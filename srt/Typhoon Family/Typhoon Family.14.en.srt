TYPHOON FAMILY

2
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,068
Yes, sir.

3
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:47,986
NINE YEARS AGO

4
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:51,030
I'm sorry to bother you again,
but I'd like to ask for another favor.

5
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:54,534
As you know,
come tomorrow, I'll go bankrupt.

6
00:00:55,493 --> 00:00:57,662
I'll give you some shares.

7
00:00:58,371 --> 00:01:00,623
No, it's not worthless!
How is that worthless?

8
00:01:01,124 --> 00:01:02,584
Don't you trust me? I'm Pyo--

9
00:01:03,668 --> 00:01:04,586
Hello?

10
00:01:18,516 --> 00:01:24,898
KOREA TELECOM

11
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:26,941
TYPHOON TRADING

12
00:01:43,207 --> 00:01:44,459
"Promissory note."

13
00:01:45,543 --> 00:01:49,589
In… return for borrowing

14
00:01:49,672 --> 00:01:51,132
PROMISSORY NOTE

15
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:53,593
forty million won…

16
00:01:57,805 --> 00:02:01,100
CREDITOR: KANG JIN-YOUNG
DEBTOR: PYO BAK-HO

17
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:09,442
Mr. Kang…

18
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,413
"Promissory note"?

19
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:26,000
I can't recall if such a thing existed.

20
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:29,254
The money from nine years ago
should now be…

21
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:32,173
What with the interest… No.

22
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,550
Throw in all the overdue interest,

23
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:37,220
and this office

24
00:02:39,222 --> 00:02:40,848
and the building should be mine.

25
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:50,024
Watch your darn mouth, you little brat.

26
00:02:51,234 --> 00:02:55,279
Don't you worry.
I couldn't care less about your building.

27
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:57,281
Then what?

28
00:02:57,365 --> 00:02:59,951
I want the three million pairs
of gloves in your storage.

29
00:03:01,244 --> 00:03:02,078
What?

30
00:03:03,746 --> 00:03:05,123
I'm losing out big time, aren't I?

31
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:07,750
What's the matter?

32
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,046
Do you think I don't have it?

33
00:03:17,635 --> 00:03:18,970
That may be the case.

34
00:03:25,977 --> 00:03:27,645
Let me share the order of events.

35
00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:33,609
Once Typhoon Trading delivers the gloves
and the payment has been received,

36
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:35,695
our transaction will be complete.

37
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:39,657
That promissory note or whatever
will be given to you.

38
00:03:41,993 --> 00:03:44,871
Why should I make this deal with you?

39
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:46,247
It's obvious.

40
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:51,544
You have much more to lose.

41
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:14,192
But I can't

42
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:18,446
just give you the stuff
solely based on your words.

43
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:22,909
Let's do this.

44
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:27,705
LETTER OF GUARANTEE

45
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,165
The terms are the same.

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,752
But on the day the payment is made,

47
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,255
you will hand over
the promissory note to me.

48
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:39,425
What if you fail to do so?

49
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:43,846
What can you offer?

50
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:49,060
You have no money, so not that.

51
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:51,396
What can you offer?

52
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:55,233
Typhoon Trading.

53
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,943
I don't know.

54
00:04:58,194 --> 00:04:59,320
My company?

55
00:05:01,364 --> 00:05:03,741
That's not something
I can offer as I please.

56
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:08,871
Let's think realistically.

57
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:11,666
I offer myself.

58
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:14,752
To be exact, my position.

59
00:05:16,504 --> 00:05:20,091
You'll give up everything
and leave the business alone?

60
00:05:22,051 --> 00:05:24,720
The position of CEO
at Typhoon Trading, you say?

61
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:28,474
Is it a balanced deal now?

62
00:05:31,644 --> 00:05:33,354
You better have it

63
00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:38,276
if you want to save that petty position
your father left behind.

64
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:40,236
3. IF THE PROMISSORY NOTE IS NOT RETURNED,

65
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,740
KANG TAE-POONG SHALL RESIGN
FROM TYPHOON TRADING

66
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:55,668
1. PYO MERCHANT MARINE TO TRANSFER
3 MILLION GLOVES

67
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:57,753
2. TYPHOON TRADING TO RETURN
THE PROMISSORY NOTE

68
00:05:57,837 --> 00:05:59,463
You can't come crying to me later.

69
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:00,381
JUNE 5TH, 1998

70
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:13,436
HOWEVER, OTHER EMPLOYEES
OF TYPHOON TRADING

71
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,274
SHALL NOT BE IMPACTED IN ANY WAY
THROUGH THE CONTENTS OF THIS CONTRACT

72
00:06:26,616 --> 00:06:29,827
KANG TAE-POONG

73
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:33,873
PYO BAK-HO

74
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:44,926
Oh, it almost slipped my mind.

75
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:50,848
Don't you want to know
why I need those gloves?

76
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:55,311
Because someone set

77
00:06:56,604 --> 00:06:57,521
our warehouse on fire.

78
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:02,193
But I never beg.

79
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:05,655
I make others beg.

80
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:23,839
I'm getting a call.

81
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,842
Hello?

82
00:07:27,552 --> 00:07:29,011
Hey, Ms. Oh. What's up?

83
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:33,891
Hello?

84
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:40,064
What?

85
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:45,861
We got the gloves, so we can deliver them
straight to the designated warehouse.

86
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:48,864
Mr. Bae just went out
to look for a truck himself.

87
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:53,411
Yes, you can do that.

88
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:55,621
Okay, bye.

89
00:08:11,262 --> 00:08:14,307
MOMO'S PUB

90
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:19,645
I don't know about everyone else,

91
00:08:20,938 --> 00:08:23,649
but I thought I should apologize to you.

92
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:32,074
Pick up the pace,
and we can all wrap up quickly.

93
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:34,660
Speed it up even more,
and we'll be out in no time.

94
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:36,621
Hey, watch your step.

95
00:08:38,914 --> 00:08:40,374
Don't you dare touch them!

96
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,251
You bastards.

97
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:44,670
So, did you come
looking for a fight, Tae-poong?

98
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:47,131
Bring it on. Come at me, you punk.

99
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:54,764
Jerk.

100
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:55,681
Ms. Oh.

101
00:08:58,184 --> 00:08:59,268
Are you out of your mind?

102
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:01,020
You did it, didn't you?

103
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:04,190
-What?
-I know everything.

104
00:09:04,273 --> 00:09:06,025
You set the place on fire.

105
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:09,153
I don't know what you mean.

106
00:09:13,783 --> 00:09:15,201
So shut your mouth and wait.

107
00:09:17,286 --> 00:09:18,120
Let's go.

108
00:09:26,128 --> 00:09:28,422
Give me that!

109
00:09:31,926 --> 00:09:33,427
PURCHASE AGREEMENT

110
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:35,012
"Seller, Pyo Bak-ho"?

111
00:09:47,942 --> 00:09:49,235
Darn it!

112
00:09:53,948 --> 00:09:54,782
Ms. Oh.

113
00:10:07,795 --> 00:10:09,046
Can we…

114
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:12,800
Can we stay like this for a moment?

115
00:10:14,969 --> 00:10:16,053
I really want

116
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:21,684
to say something to comfort you,
but I don't know what to say.

117
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:31,402
Ms. Cha came by.

118
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:36,198
Did she tell you everything?

119
00:10:37,742 --> 00:10:40,119
I was going to take my time
and tell you later.

120
00:10:41,537 --> 00:10:42,747
What about your hand?

121
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,082
He has thick skin,
so it must've hurt a lot.

122
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,128
So here's what happened.

123
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:52,631
-First, I said I had the promissory note.
-Take your time.

124
00:10:52,715 --> 00:10:54,675
You can take your time to tell me.

125
00:10:57,428 --> 00:10:59,805
My hand isn't the problem right now.

126
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:01,390
It's how you're feeling.

127
00:11:03,058 --> 00:11:04,435
Are you all right?

128
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:07,730
I'm…

129
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:10,065
Well…

130
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:13,694
I'm okay, I guess.

131
00:11:13,778 --> 00:11:16,697
I just feel bad for my father.

132
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:19,825
It would've broken his heart

133
00:11:21,243 --> 00:11:22,620
if he had seen all this.

134
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,665
He would've said you've done well.

135
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:54,109
EPISODE 14
BORN IN THE WIND

136
00:11:58,113 --> 00:11:59,281
TYPHOON TRADING

137
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:00,324
Yes.

138
00:12:01,158 --> 00:12:03,410
Yes, thank you.

139
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,121
-So?
-Yeah.

140
00:12:06,956 --> 00:12:09,083
The insurance company handled everything.

141
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:12,711
So is the case closed as arson?

142
00:12:14,296 --> 00:12:17,007
Well, it was an arson case.

143
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:19,927
But there's insufficient evidence,
so it'll remain unresolved.

144
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,679
I'm just glad the insurance can cover it.

145
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:24,348
We just got over another hurdle.

146
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:26,684
Will it take about a month
for the payment?

147
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:30,521
Yes, I've issued the invoice,
so the payment will be made in a month.

148
00:12:30,604 --> 00:12:33,440
Good. We finally caught a breather
thanks to Mr. Kang.

149
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,318
All right. Good work, everyone.

150
00:12:36,902 --> 00:12:39,280
After all, it's summer vacation season.

151
00:12:39,905 --> 00:12:42,283
Why don't we use this chance
to get some fresh air?

152
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:45,786
-I'm sure you're all feeling down.
-Well, we'll get over this.

153
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:49,123
Who would feel great after this?

154
00:12:49,832 --> 00:12:51,709
What's wrong with Seon-taek, really?

155
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:55,004
She isn't someone who'd do that,
so she must've lost her senses.

156
00:12:56,672 --> 00:12:58,257
I was greatly disappointed too.

157
00:13:06,348 --> 00:13:07,391
Ms. Cha?

158
00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:15,274
Have you lost your mind?
How dare you show up here?

159
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:17,651
I'll leave these and go.

160
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:19,862
I was designated to this area.

161
00:13:19,945 --> 00:13:21,739
Then you should change it.

162
00:13:21,822 --> 00:13:23,490
Swap your area with someone else.

163
00:13:23,574 --> 00:13:26,035
I'm all done here and leaving. Okay?

164
00:13:28,704 --> 00:13:29,538
Cha Seon-taek!

165
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:39,632
You are less than human
and worse than the beasts.

166
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:42,343
How dare you brazenly show up here?

167
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:44,637
Then what can I do?

168
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,389
You can stop ordering
after this month's subscription.

169
00:13:48,223 --> 00:13:49,433
I guess you haven't heard.

170
00:13:55,064 --> 00:13:55,898
1989
ACCOUNT BOOK

171
00:13:55,981 --> 00:13:58,567
I already lodged a complaint
with your juice company

172
00:13:58,651 --> 00:14:01,236
for the damage you caused
to our official documents.

173
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,323
Your company had a solid reputation,
so why would they keep you?

174
00:14:04,406 --> 00:14:06,533
-Myung-gwan.
-And Mr. Kang.

175
00:14:06,617 --> 00:14:11,705
I also sued her for trespassing and theft,
so that's all you need to know.

176
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:12,831
Mr. Koo.

177
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,167
How can you be so cruel?

178
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:17,836
What did I do so wrong?

179
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,340
Think of all the years
we've known each other!

180
00:14:21,423 --> 00:14:22,383
The years?

181
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:23,801
What did that mean to you?

182
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:29,556
When you sold away 26 years
for a petty amount of money,

183
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,059
did this mean anything to you?!

184
00:14:32,142 --> 00:14:33,727
Think of how desperate I was.

185
00:14:34,728 --> 00:14:38,315
I can't believe not a single person here
asked me why I did it.

186
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,318
If you were going through something
that made you do this,

187
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:43,320
you should've told us about it!

188
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:44,363
If I were

189
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:48,867
to tell you all about my business,
it'd be like speaking ill of my family!

190
00:14:48,951 --> 00:14:50,619
But are we strangers?

191
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:51,912
Are we?

192
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:55,040
We said we'd be your family!

193
00:14:55,624 --> 00:14:58,836
We already know
you have no one else to rely on.

194
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:02,047
All of us here are all living
in such misery anyway!

195
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:04,466
So why did you feel ashamed
and want to hide this,

196
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,802
only to end up in this state?

197
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:11,181
Why should the miserable stick together?
We have to take something from the rich!

198
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:16,687
You're hopeless. Get out of here!

199
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:19,690
Don't ever show your face here again!

200
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:21,775
I'm going to starve to death anyway.

201
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:23,318
We don't have to meet again!

202
00:15:23,402 --> 00:15:25,362
Can you please stop?

203
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:29,241
-This is too frightening and upsetting.
-Ms. Cha, that's enough for today.

204
00:15:30,034 --> 00:15:31,410
You should leave for now.

205
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:34,997
Why…

206
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:38,876
won't you apologize?

207
00:15:42,713 --> 00:15:43,922
Say you're sorry.

208
00:15:46,258 --> 00:15:47,801
Say you were wrong.

209
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:51,138
And I don't mean to me,
but to your colleagues and my father.

210
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:53,932
You need to apologize to them.

211
00:15:54,892 --> 00:15:55,976
My dear.

212
00:15:57,352 --> 00:15:58,979
Will an apology change anything?

213
00:15:59,063 --> 00:16:03,025
-Please just beg for forgiveness.
-So what if I beg?

214
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:06,487
Are you going to forgive me?

215
00:16:07,696 --> 00:16:09,114
If I apologize,

216
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:13,327
can the late Mr. Kang hear anything I say?

217
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,495
Yes.

218
00:16:16,121 --> 00:16:16,955
He'll hear you.

219
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:20,667
He may be dead, but he's not gone.

220
00:16:22,211 --> 00:16:23,378
No, right?

221
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:25,964
All of us here remember him.

222
00:16:27,424 --> 00:16:29,843
I'll hear it. We'll hear it.

223
00:16:29,927 --> 00:16:31,720
My father will hear it too.

224
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:36,809
And you'll hear it too.

225
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:43,732
I can't understand
or forgive you for this.

226
00:16:47,027 --> 00:16:48,278
But still,

227
00:16:49,113 --> 00:16:52,741
you should understand…

228
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:57,204
and forgive yourself for this.

229
00:16:59,164 --> 00:17:01,750
Living with guilt toward my father?

230
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:06,463
I'm already carrying enough
of that myself.

231
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:32,781
If that is the case,

232
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:36,326
if he's listening,
that's all the more reason I can't say it.

233
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:47,963
I can't do it.

234
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:05,647
A whale breathes through the blowhole
on top of its head.

235
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:20,037
-Mi-seon, isn't that nice?
-It is.

236
00:18:21,163 --> 00:18:24,708
But you never did anything like that.
Why are you using cosmetic products?

237
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:27,294
It's as if you're dating someone.

238
00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:32,299
I am dating someone.

239
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:35,636
Wait, what? Who is it?

240
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,179
Is it Tae-poong?

241
00:18:38,222 --> 00:18:39,932
Oh, my goodness.

242
00:18:40,015 --> 00:18:42,726
What do you see in him?
Wait, does he like you?

243
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:46,605
My gosh. This is insane.
He's an unusual one too.

244
00:18:46,688 --> 00:18:49,149
You didn't lend him money
or something like that, did you?

245
00:18:51,526 --> 00:18:53,070
Don't be cheeky.

246
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:04,456
-By any chance, have you two kissed?
-Stop saying that in front of a kid.

247
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,210
It's time to sleep, Beom. It's late.

248
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:10,462
-Mi-seon.
-Yes?

249
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:12,839
Is the sea that big?

250
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:16,218
Yes, the sea
is much bigger than Han River.

251
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:19,805
-It's blue and vast.
-I don't think so.

252
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:22,057
It's not so big.

253
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,603
So how do blue whales live there,
and how does it have treasures?

254
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:28,063
You fool.

255
00:19:28,897 --> 00:19:31,024
It's because you're watching it
on a tiny TV.

256
00:19:31,108 --> 00:19:32,901
It's really huge in real life.

257
00:19:33,485 --> 00:19:36,029
I'm not a fool, you old hag.

258
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:37,197
What did you say?

259
00:19:37,781 --> 00:19:40,325
I'm the only one
who hasn't seen the sea. Gosh.

260
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:42,619
Get over here.

261
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:46,081
Get over here! Did you call me a hag?

262
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:49,543
I'm going to tickle you!

263
00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:51,712
Tickles, doesn't it?

264
00:19:51,795 --> 00:19:54,256
Doesn't it? That's what you get
for calling me a hag!

265
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:55,299
Get back here!

266
00:19:57,009 --> 00:20:00,345
Did you want to see the sea
that badly, my dear Beom?

267
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:05,267
FOR LEASE
ULCHI WORLD REAL ESTATE OFFICE

268
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:57,861
I just paged Mi-seon,
so she'll be here soon.

269
00:21:09,122 --> 00:21:13,877
Promissory note.
Where would the promissory note be?

270
00:21:38,193 --> 00:21:39,486
Oh, my.

271
00:21:42,322 --> 00:21:45,242
Gosh, why is it so dusty?

272
00:21:48,453 --> 00:21:49,371
Hold on.

273
00:21:59,423 --> 00:22:00,298
Mi-seon?

274
00:22:01,007 --> 00:22:04,845
It's just that
I can't see anything right now.

275
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:05,804
Jeez.

CHEONGGYE POLICE STATION

277
00:22:14,521 --> 00:22:18,024
Excuse me, I received a call to come here.

278
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:19,776
-Are you his guardian?
-Yes.

279
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,779
He was reported
for trespassing and vandalism.

280
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:23,780
Okay.

281
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,284
Mr. Kang?

282
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:32,122
Gosh.

283
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:38,920
You need to dust yourself off a little.

284
00:22:39,004 --> 00:22:41,548
You're going to break Ms. Jung's heart.

285
00:22:41,631 --> 00:22:43,425
Gosh, I'm so hungry.

286
00:22:43,508 --> 00:22:45,594
-I'm hungry.
-Are you?

287
00:22:45,677 --> 00:22:46,553
Yes.

288
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:53,143
Jeez.

289
00:22:57,814 --> 00:22:59,232
What?

290
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:01,318
Well, you know.

291
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,696
-We were on the same page.
-We were.

292
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:07,115
-You can have this later.
-Okay. Thanks.

293
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:10,577
Here. You love this. Have some.

294
00:23:26,134 --> 00:23:27,385
Mr. Kang.

295
00:23:29,554 --> 00:23:30,847
"Mr. Kang"?

296
00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:32,390
Man, "Mr. Kang"?

297
00:23:33,225 --> 00:23:34,392
You're on a break.

298
00:23:34,976 --> 00:23:36,603
I really don't want to be called that.

299
00:23:36,686 --> 00:23:39,522
-I'm your boyfriend.
-Okay.

300
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:42,150
Mr. Kang Tae-poong.

301
00:23:45,528 --> 00:23:47,989
Exactly. We're on a break.
What are we doing here?

302
00:23:48,573 --> 00:23:49,908
I have to find it quickly.

303
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:53,662
I was feeling rushed
and I'm running out of time.

304
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:56,748
-If I don't, the business will--
-One second.

305
00:23:57,582 --> 00:23:59,376
Clear your mind for one second.

306
00:24:00,502 --> 00:24:03,463
Have you been sleeping
or eating since that day?

307
00:24:05,757 --> 00:24:08,718
What you need
is a moment to relax your mind.

308
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:13,223
You're right.

309
00:24:20,021 --> 00:24:21,022
-It's good.
-Is it?

310
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,319
I prepared something for you.

311
00:24:31,324 --> 00:24:32,325
Here.

312
00:24:36,788 --> 00:24:37,789
Open it.

314
00:24:44,713 --> 00:24:46,006
It's a real cell phone.

315
00:24:46,506 --> 00:24:47,465
Is this for me?

316
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:48,925
This is mine!

317
00:24:51,094 --> 00:24:54,139
What was that?
Were you just showing it off?

318
00:24:54,222 --> 00:24:55,348
Look.

319
00:24:55,432 --> 00:24:56,558
Number one on my speed dial.

320
00:24:58,435 --> 00:25:00,687
"Oh Mi-seon" with a heart.

321
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:09,779
-What?
-Why won't it connect?

322
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:11,865
Why isn't this working?

323
00:25:11,948 --> 00:25:13,366
What do you mean?

324
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,535
Jeez, I barely have any reception!

325
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,537
Why won't it work?

326
00:25:18,955 --> 00:25:20,248
-Come on.
-What is it?

327
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,252
-I've found a signal.
-What's that sound?

328
00:25:32,135 --> 00:25:33,053
Look.

329
00:25:35,764 --> 00:25:36,848
This is yours.

330
00:25:40,268 --> 00:25:42,228
We should've bought this ages ago.

331
00:25:42,937 --> 00:25:46,191
We're the only two salespeople
who don't have cell phones.

332
00:25:47,108 --> 00:25:48,651
Is this really for me?

333
00:25:53,531 --> 00:25:55,533
You didn't have to get one for me.

334
00:25:57,118 --> 00:25:58,203
Thank you.

335
00:25:59,037 --> 00:26:01,915
-Do you like it?
-This is so light.

336
00:26:01,998 --> 00:26:05,585
I think it's as heavy as a block of tofu.

337
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:08,421
-What kind of an analogy is that?
-No?

338
00:26:13,343 --> 00:26:14,344
So, what now?

339
00:26:16,096 --> 00:26:18,348
Will I be number one on your speed dial?

340
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,102
-Yes.
-What will you save my name as?

341
00:26:24,062 --> 00:26:25,980
Your name, Kang Tae-poong.

342
00:26:26,064 --> 00:26:28,566
You'd be on top. It's the first letter
of the Korean alphabet.

343
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,692
You can be so dry.

344
00:26:30,652 --> 00:26:33,113
Just Kang Tae-poong? How about…

345
00:26:34,864 --> 00:26:37,450
You can go with Honey-poong

346
00:26:38,576 --> 00:26:41,204
or Baby-poong, something like that.

347
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:46,960
-Honey-poong?
-Yes.

348
00:26:48,628 --> 00:26:50,672
Honey-poong? Okay.

349
00:26:50,755 --> 00:26:53,091
But that'll put you last on the list.
Is that okay?

350
00:26:53,174 --> 00:26:54,426
No, I want to be number one.

351
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:57,137
I mean that you'd be at the bottom
in the actual contacts.

352
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,013
Then just use the first alphabet.

353
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:00,515
-The first?
-Or Baby-poong.

354
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:15,155
I knew it. We have such good chemistry.

355
00:27:43,433 --> 00:27:46,269
Is the sea a sky for whales?

356
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:57,864
I'm sorry for making you worried today.

357
00:27:59,449 --> 00:28:00,492
"Anyway."

358
00:28:01,117 --> 00:28:05,121
"What is on your

359
00:28:06,498 --> 00:28:07,332
mind?"

360
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:10,210
"Are you thinking about me…"

361
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:17,467
Where's the question mark?
The question mark.

362
00:28:18,218 --> 00:28:19,594
The question mark.

363
00:28:20,512 --> 00:28:21,596
My gosh!

364
00:28:29,979 --> 00:28:31,105
One more time.

365
00:28:32,273 --> 00:28:36,069
"What are you up to?"

366
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,947
You're finally home after days,

367
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,533
so why are you texting
instead of sleeping?

368
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:44,118
Mom.

369
00:28:44,786 --> 00:28:47,747
Do you want me to check your biorhythm?
I can check it here.

370
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:53,586
-Is it accurate?
-Of course.

371
00:28:54,754 --> 00:28:59,425
Your date of birth.

372
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:08,142
Why don't we take a day trip
to the sea with Beom?

373
00:29:09,018 --> 00:29:11,104
And then, let's go look
for the promissory note.

374
00:29:22,699 --> 00:29:23,783
Sounds great!

375
00:29:24,617 --> 00:29:27,161
My condition is great? How so?

376
00:29:28,872 --> 00:29:32,500
Everything about you is great.
Everything, including your skin.

377
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:35,211
I've always had good skin.

378
00:29:36,963 --> 00:29:38,131
That's untrustworthy.

379
00:29:40,008 --> 00:29:40,842
"I would…

380
00:29:43,595 --> 00:29:44,637
love to."

381
00:29:54,397 --> 00:29:59,152
ALL VEHICLES MUST CHECK IN
AT THE SECURITY OFFICE

382
00:30:27,972 --> 00:30:29,515
Did you get this from that woman?

383
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:32,936
Yes, I received it
from Ms. Cha Seon-taek herself today.

384
00:30:37,774 --> 00:30:39,901
I thought she got fired
from the juice company.

385
00:30:39,984 --> 00:30:42,695
-She must've had someone to borrow from.
-She sold her house.

386
00:30:44,614 --> 00:30:45,448
Of course.

387
00:30:46,032 --> 00:30:48,826
She shouldn't have slept in peace
before she paid my money back.

388
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,745
What's your plan now?

389
00:30:51,704 --> 00:30:53,206
Tae-poong, that kid,

390
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:55,583
knows about the promissory note,
but he doesn't have it.

391
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:59,420
He had no idea money wasn't the problem,
but our shares were at stake.

392
00:31:00,296 --> 00:31:04,634
"Pyo Bak-ho will
transfer 20% of his shares…"

393
00:31:05,885 --> 00:31:06,719
No.

394
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:10,473
"Transfer 30% of his shares…"

395
00:31:14,102 --> 00:31:15,353
What about the flight?

396
00:31:16,062 --> 00:31:18,606
I'll send him away as soon as possible.

397
00:31:19,107 --> 00:31:21,985
Have him stay abroad
and study for about three years.

398
00:31:22,068 --> 00:31:25,071
By then, Kang Tae-poong
would've been gone without a trace.

399
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:34,038
CEO OFFICE

400
00:31:41,838 --> 00:31:42,880
Dad!

401
00:31:54,225 --> 00:31:57,103
-Send my driver home. You may leave too.
-Yes, sir.

402
00:32:01,107 --> 00:32:03,526
What were you two talking about?

403
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:08,239
PURCHASE AGREEMENT

404
00:32:09,157 --> 00:32:11,242
Dad. No.

405
00:32:12,076 --> 00:32:13,286
Mr. Pyo.

406
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:15,955
I went through such a ridiculous incident.

407
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:20,334
And my family was behind it.

408
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,012
-Why did you set the place on fire?
-That's not the problem!

409
00:32:33,056 --> 00:32:35,141
Why did you sell my gloves to that idiot?

410
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:40,146
Yes, I set the place on fire.
I knew it was dangerous,

411
00:32:40,229 --> 00:32:43,066
but I put up with the risk
and did that. Do you know why?

412
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:48,237
Because I wanted you…

413
00:32:50,907 --> 00:32:52,658
to be proud of me just once.

414
00:32:52,742 --> 00:32:54,702
And you chose to set the place on fire?

415
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:56,662
You idiot!

416
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:01,959
Have you considered
the kind of consequences you'd face?

417
00:33:02,043 --> 00:33:05,129
That's the very proof of your idiocy!

418
00:33:07,298 --> 00:33:10,093
I'm dumb, and you're so smart

419
00:33:11,052 --> 00:33:13,262
that you had to borrow money
from Typhoon Trading?

420
00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:16,599
What's wrong?
Did you think I didn't know a thing?

421
00:33:18,184 --> 00:33:20,645
Tae-poong always gets the best of you…

422
00:33:23,147 --> 00:33:25,775
because you let him
get a hold of your weakness!

423
00:33:28,653 --> 00:33:32,949
You wicked punk. Do you know
how I kept this business going?

424
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:37,245
I should've had a son like Tae-poong,
not an idiot like you!

425
00:33:39,747 --> 00:33:40,665
Dad…

426
00:33:44,752 --> 00:33:47,088
-You can't say that to me.
-Why not?

427
00:33:47,672 --> 00:33:51,217
My business wouldn't be in this state
if a smart kid like him were my son!

428
00:33:52,343 --> 00:33:54,178
You can't do a thing without me!

429
00:33:54,804 --> 00:33:58,057
But Tae-poong is out there
spreading his wings without his dad!

430
00:33:58,766 --> 00:34:02,395
All you ever do is pull tricks
and look for excuses!

431
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:06,149
You're a loser.

432
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:09,360
Get out.

433
00:34:10,153 --> 00:34:11,863
Go and get ready to go to America.

434
00:34:13,197 --> 00:34:15,116
I don't want to see you here. Get out!

435
00:34:31,215 --> 00:34:32,592
Why do you call me a loser?

436
00:34:33,384 --> 00:34:35,303
PYO BAK-HO

437
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,138
Dad.

438
00:34:38,723 --> 00:34:40,308
I'm not a loser.

439
00:34:43,895 --> 00:34:45,438
I'm not a loser!

440
00:34:55,781 --> 00:34:57,909
Tae-poong is the thief.

441
00:34:58,868 --> 00:35:01,245
He keeps stealing everything that's mine.

442
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,291
The girls,

443
00:35:06,751 --> 00:35:08,794
the fabric, the shoes, the gloves,

444
00:35:11,172 --> 00:35:12,006
and…

445
00:35:15,676 --> 00:35:18,095
even you, Dad.

446
00:35:19,513 --> 00:35:21,057
He even took you from me.

447
00:36:40,303 --> 00:36:41,345
Gosh.

448
00:36:45,933 --> 00:36:46,934
Dad.

449
00:36:47,018 --> 00:36:51,022
I once heard somewhere
that people don't die that easily.

450
00:36:51,105 --> 00:36:52,064
So,

451
00:36:53,107 --> 00:36:55,735
wait here just a little, okay?

452
00:37:01,991 --> 00:37:04,994
I'll get my victory
against that punk, Tae-poong,

453
00:37:06,454 --> 00:37:08,205
and come back to get you.

454
00:37:14,754 --> 00:37:15,963
So…

455
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:20,259
hang in there for a while.

456
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:41,113
Light you up at the end of the night

457
00:37:43,157 --> 00:37:46,702
As you flowed in your loneliness

458
00:37:48,662 --> 00:37:51,874
You did not enjoy any of your days

459
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:57,630
And crossed winter with a blank face

460
00:38:12,103 --> 00:38:13,813
Wang Nam-mo.

461
00:38:13,896 --> 00:38:15,022
Make me something to eat.

462
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:22,363
Why haven't you eaten yet?

463
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:26,700
Mind your own business.

464
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:32,331
Then, why are you strumming alone
instead of meeting gumiho?

465
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:35,960
Mom.

466
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:38,671
Have you ever heard me sing?

467
00:38:38,754 --> 00:38:40,089
Of course, I have.

468
00:38:40,172 --> 00:38:42,341
When you were in third grade,

469
00:38:42,425 --> 00:38:45,553
you were chosen to sing
the national anthem on the field day.

470
00:38:45,636 --> 00:38:47,388
But not since then.

471
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:49,557
What do you say?
Should I sing something now?

472
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,684
No, don't bother me while I eat.

473
00:38:53,185 --> 00:38:55,729
Just listen to it. It's not so bad.

474
00:38:55,813 --> 00:38:57,523
-Forget it.
-Okay.

475
00:39:08,409 --> 00:39:11,078
Her smile

476
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,958
Is like a full-bloomed magnolia

477
00:39:18,252 --> 00:39:20,004
You have a pretty nice voice.

478
00:39:20,087 --> 00:39:21,839
And you're good with the guitar.

479
00:39:23,966 --> 00:39:28,095
Whenever I looked at her

480
00:39:28,888 --> 00:39:31,348
It was always like a warm spring day

481
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:36,604
On the day she first cried

482
00:39:38,689 --> 00:39:41,317
I was shocked out of my mind

483
00:39:43,652 --> 00:39:47,281
Her beautiful face

484
00:39:48,157 --> 00:39:50,284
Was covered with tears

485
00:39:52,828 --> 00:39:56,624
She always smiled no matter the pain

486
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:59,502
But on the day she first shed tears

487
00:39:59,585 --> 00:40:02,296
KIM EUL-NYEO
DEPUTY BRANCH MANAGER

488
00:40:02,379 --> 00:40:05,925
It felt like the world came crashing down

489
00:40:06,008 --> 00:40:06,842
There, there.

490
00:40:06,926 --> 00:40:09,929
I felt so stifled on the inside

491
00:40:11,597 --> 00:40:13,891
But I can't see it anymore

492
00:40:16,352 --> 00:40:19,021
The way she smiled

493
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:25,152
On the day she first cried

494
00:40:25,236 --> 00:40:28,239
She left my life

495
00:40:30,491 --> 00:40:34,286
On the day she first cried

496
00:40:35,162 --> 00:40:38,123
She left my life

497
00:40:48,217 --> 00:40:49,927
Why on earth…

498
00:40:54,515 --> 00:40:57,059
do kids grow up this fast?

499
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:03,357
It feels like
I didn't even get to see you much.

500
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,863
What have I lived for all these years?

501
00:41:19,582 --> 00:41:20,416
Mom.

502
00:41:24,295 --> 00:41:25,379
Ms. Eul-nyeo.

503
00:41:29,592 --> 00:41:30,467
I love you.

504
00:41:36,223 --> 00:41:38,559
You're driving me crazy.

505
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:44,690
Come on out, Mi-ho!

506
00:41:52,072 --> 00:41:53,073
Oh, my.

507
00:41:54,658 --> 00:41:57,870
Why did you get two watermelons?
Those must've been heavy!

508
00:41:57,953 --> 00:41:59,913
They were so light
I thought they were tangerines.

509
00:41:59,997 --> 00:42:01,332
Show me your hands.

510
00:42:01,415 --> 00:42:03,876
With all this stuff,
your hands must've been sore.

511
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:05,252
Hey, Nam-mo.

512
00:42:06,253 --> 00:42:07,755
This is for you and Grandma.

513
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:10,257
Gosh, you didn't have to get us one.

514
00:42:12,259 --> 00:42:14,762
Little Ms. Oh, you should be
fully dressed before you walk out.

515
00:42:14,845 --> 00:42:16,221
I'm fully dressed.

516
00:42:16,305 --> 00:42:18,098
Oh, my. You're unbelievable.

517
00:42:18,182 --> 00:42:21,977
You can't go around looking like this,
exposing all of your body!

518
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:23,687
My goodness. I can't believe it.

519
00:42:23,771 --> 00:42:25,814
I don't want to wear this, Ms. Jung!

520
00:42:25,898 --> 00:42:27,399
-You have to!
-This is fashion!

521
00:42:27,483 --> 00:42:28,942
You can't go out like this.

522
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:30,986
People will be
terrified of you in this state.

523
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,614
-No, she's just my style.
-Silence.

524
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,866
You look much better.

525
00:42:51,131 --> 00:42:54,301
Good grief, Ms. Jung.
Here comes the peacock.

526
00:42:54,802 --> 00:42:57,346
He's just born that good-looking.

527
00:42:59,515 --> 00:43:00,933
Looking racy and nice. Good.

528
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:02,976
Where's Mi-seon?

529
00:43:07,606 --> 00:43:09,608
Let's go! I'm ready.

530
00:43:10,901 --> 00:43:13,070
Why do you have so much stuff?

531
00:43:13,153 --> 00:43:17,324
I boiled some eggs and corn and packed
side dishes, lettuce, and chili peppers.

532
00:43:17,408 --> 00:43:19,118
These will cost money outside.

533
00:43:22,204 --> 00:43:24,164
Please stop acting so miserably stingy.

534
00:43:24,248 --> 00:43:26,208
Why? I love how smart she is.

535
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:29,211
-Well, please keep an eye on my grandma.
-You love it?

536
00:43:29,294 --> 00:43:31,130
She's been sleeping a lot lately.

537
00:43:31,213 --> 00:43:32,172
Cut it out.

538
00:43:32,256 --> 00:43:35,092
The elderly tend to lose energy
in the dead of summer.

539
00:43:36,135 --> 00:43:37,553
Have a relaxing time there.

540
00:43:38,303 --> 00:43:39,888
Thank you. We'll make it quick.

541
00:43:39,972 --> 00:43:41,557
Nice job with the brows.

542
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,434
-So what?
-"So what?"

543
00:43:43,517 --> 00:43:44,893
-Back at you.
-No, you.

544
00:43:44,977 --> 00:43:46,895
-You're so annoying!
-Hey, Beom!

545
00:43:46,979 --> 00:43:48,731
We'll leave if you don't come out!

546
00:43:52,484 --> 00:43:54,027
-Oh, my.
-Wow.

547
00:43:54,778 --> 00:43:57,489
-Look at you.
-I'm nothing compared to that guy.

548
00:43:57,573 --> 00:43:58,532
He's the real deal.

549
00:43:58,615 --> 00:44:00,451
The sea is calling out to me!

550
00:44:34,443 --> 00:44:36,403
SAMPO, THE BEACH OF LOVE AND ROMANCE

551
00:44:38,155 --> 00:44:40,574
Tubes for rent!

552
00:44:45,537 --> 00:44:46,455
Oh, wow.

553
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:53,128
-Mi-seon, how far does the sea stretch?
-Everything you see out there is the sea.

554
00:44:56,131 --> 00:44:57,716
Are you scared? Come here.

555
00:44:58,342 --> 00:44:59,259
Come to me.

556
00:45:05,182 --> 00:45:07,976
Let's go and look at the sea!

557
00:45:10,479 --> 00:45:11,480
Here we go.

558
00:45:12,648 --> 00:45:15,651
Beom, the sea is vast and deep.

559
00:45:15,734 --> 00:45:17,694
The sea stretches all the way to there.

560
00:45:17,778 --> 00:45:20,822
-Then we'll die if we go that far.
-Is that so?

561
00:45:21,657 --> 00:45:23,659
What do you think is under the sea?

562
00:45:24,785 --> 00:45:26,578
-Hey.
-That's cold.

563
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:29,373
It feels cool.

564
00:45:30,415 --> 00:45:35,879
There are waves,
sand, and fish in the sea.

565
00:45:35,963 --> 00:45:38,215
And whales and treasures.

566
00:45:38,298 --> 00:45:39,299
That's right.

567
00:45:44,012 --> 00:45:46,557
Even when you face
something big and scary,

568
00:45:47,266 --> 00:45:48,934
try to think of what's inside.

569
00:45:49,601 --> 00:45:51,728
No matter how vast the sea is,

570
00:45:52,354 --> 00:45:56,483
in the end,
it all began with this cool water.

571
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:05,242
-Hey!
-What?

572
00:46:05,325 --> 00:46:08,996
Hey, Beom, with this, you won't die
even if you go all the way out there.

573
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:10,289
-Put it on.
-Put it on!

574
00:46:11,164 --> 00:46:13,625
Hey, the sun's going down.
Let's have fun already!

575
00:46:13,709 --> 00:46:15,085
-Be careful! Don't fall!
-Let's go!

576
00:46:15,168 --> 00:46:17,462
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

577
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:19,923
-Oh, my!
-It's so cold!

578
00:46:21,174 --> 00:46:22,342
Come on in!

579
00:46:23,302 --> 00:46:24,636
Come and join us!

580
00:46:30,058 --> 00:46:33,395
Did you just splash me?
Get back here! Back here!

581
00:46:33,478 --> 00:46:34,813
Come join us!

582
00:46:38,692 --> 00:46:39,693
There.

583
00:46:40,902 --> 00:46:41,862
So muscular.

584
00:46:42,571 --> 00:46:44,531
Catch me if you can!

585
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,784
Catch me if you can!

586
00:46:52,748 --> 00:46:56,376
I said catch me, not toss me in the water!

587
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,879
-I'm sorry.
-What am I going to do?

588
00:47:03,008 --> 00:47:03,967
I'm leaving!

589
00:47:06,178 --> 00:47:08,180
Wang Nam-mo!

590
00:47:08,263 --> 00:47:11,350
Wang Nam-mo, you! I'm going to kill you!

591
00:47:16,855 --> 00:47:18,023
Stay here, Beom.

592
00:47:24,529 --> 00:47:25,489
Mr. Kang Tae-poong.

593
00:47:28,075 --> 00:47:29,826
You were thinking about work again.

594
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:32,788
I was thinking about my girlfriend.

595
00:47:38,418 --> 00:47:39,836
This won't do. Come here.

596
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,004
-Why?
-Come.

597
00:47:43,632 --> 00:47:47,010
-Do we leave him there?
-Yes, just for a moment.

598
00:47:59,481 --> 00:48:01,316
Mr. Kang, look over here.

599
00:48:02,192 --> 00:48:04,736
There are clams everywhere! Look.

600
00:48:07,739 --> 00:48:11,076
Do you see these seaweeds in here?

601
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:13,161
The clams are the ones eating it.

602
00:48:13,245 --> 00:48:14,871
It's this clam. Littleneck clam.

603
00:48:15,622 --> 00:48:17,249
This is what you're looking for.

604
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:20,377
Littleneck clams.

605
00:48:23,046 --> 00:48:24,047
Wait.

606
00:48:26,425 --> 00:48:27,634
What? What is it?

607
00:48:27,718 --> 00:48:28,969
Is this sea mustard?

608
00:48:30,595 --> 00:48:32,597
Is this sea mustard?

609
00:48:33,473 --> 00:48:34,766
I found some sea mustard.

610
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,644
Why was it there?

611
00:48:39,563 --> 00:48:40,564
Look at this.

612
00:48:43,066 --> 00:48:44,276
It's sea mustard, right?

613
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:46,862
Yes, it is, and there's a bunch of them.

614
00:48:46,945 --> 00:48:48,905
So look for littleneck clams
instead of that.

615
00:48:48,989 --> 00:48:50,532
So sea mustard isn't actually a plant.

616
00:48:50,615 --> 00:48:52,951
If you think about it,
it shouldn't be called seaweed.

617
00:48:53,034 --> 00:48:54,161
It's marine algae.

618
00:48:55,245 --> 00:48:57,831
Marine algae.
Stop looking for marine algae.

619
00:48:57,914 --> 00:48:59,374
You can look for these now.

620
00:49:02,335 --> 00:49:06,339
The seaweed soup we had together
last birthday was so delicious.

621
00:49:07,883 --> 00:49:09,968
My goodness! Let's go eat.

622
00:49:10,051 --> 00:49:11,136
Let's go.

623
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:13,388
Let's just go home.

624
00:49:14,055 --> 00:49:16,683
We can go home for food.
I have plenty of it.

625
00:49:20,145 --> 00:49:21,772
I'm actually out of side dishes.

626
00:49:21,855 --> 00:49:26,193
Happy birthday to our new employee,

627
00:49:26,276 --> 00:49:28,361
-Kang Tae-poong!
-Cheers.

628
00:49:28,445 --> 00:49:29,529
Cheers.

629
00:49:29,613 --> 00:49:31,072
-Thank you.
-Sure.

630
00:49:31,156 --> 00:49:32,157
Thank you.

631
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,493
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

632
00:49:34,576 --> 00:49:37,329
-Thank you.
-You should eat.

633
00:49:38,914 --> 00:49:40,123
It's delicious.

634
00:49:41,249 --> 00:49:42,417
It's good.

635
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,674
We can't collect these after sunset.

636
00:49:49,758 --> 00:49:51,510
So hurry up and find some.

637
00:49:51,593 --> 00:49:53,512
Find some more. Yes, that's it.

638
00:49:53,595 --> 00:49:55,430
You're taking the marine algae home?

639
00:50:00,602 --> 00:50:01,728
More sea mustard.

640
00:50:06,733 --> 00:50:08,693
This feels like manual labor.

641
00:50:09,528 --> 00:50:10,862
Anyway.

642
00:50:12,447 --> 00:50:15,951
How did Littleneck 1 and Littleneck 2
end up getting caught by us?

643
00:50:16,034 --> 00:50:19,204
-Stop naming them. We'll be eating them.
-What?

644
00:50:20,997 --> 00:50:22,249
I gathered those as food.

645
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:31,383
-There's a huge clam.
-Where?

646
00:50:32,425 --> 00:50:33,802
Where is it?

647
00:50:33,885 --> 00:50:35,554
Oops, I tripped!

648
00:50:35,637 --> 00:50:36,721
Gosh.

649
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:39,015
Hey, be careful.

650
00:50:42,602 --> 00:50:44,604
Hey, my littleneck clams.

651
00:50:46,064 --> 00:50:47,399
Why did you do that?

652
00:50:47,482 --> 00:50:52,112
Well, after spending
a few hours with them, they grew on me.

653
00:50:52,195 --> 00:50:53,530
They grew on you that quickly?

654
00:50:53,613 --> 00:50:55,740
How can I eat those cute things?

655
00:50:55,824 --> 00:50:59,035
-My gosh.
-Oh, dear.

656
00:51:02,163 --> 00:51:04,666
But you had nothing else on your mind
while doing this, right?

657
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,128
That's so true.

658
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:13,216
I had nothing else on my mind.

659
00:51:15,468 --> 00:51:18,221
Neither the promissory note
nor Pyo Merchant Marine.

660
00:51:20,807 --> 00:51:22,851
That's good enough then. That will do.

661
00:51:27,606 --> 00:51:29,774
Oh, right! Try to guess what I brought.

662
00:51:29,858 --> 00:51:31,151
Did you bring something?

663
00:51:31,234 --> 00:51:32,819
-Look.
-What is that?

664
00:51:33,695 --> 00:51:37,407
It's a top shell. It hangs onto sounds,
so you can hear waves in it.

665
00:51:39,618 --> 00:51:40,493
Let me hear it.

666
00:51:41,995 --> 00:51:44,414
-You can, right? Can you?
-You're right. I can.

667
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,334
-My gosh. Yes.
-You hear it, right?

668
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:48,460
I can.

669
00:51:52,923 --> 00:51:53,882
I love you.

670
00:52:00,889 --> 00:52:02,807
Can you hear my feelings?

671
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,478
I can hear it loud and clear.

672
00:52:11,232 --> 00:52:12,609
You got something on your face.

673
00:52:13,109 --> 00:52:14,861
I think your hand is dirtier.

674
00:52:15,528 --> 00:52:17,530
-No.
-Are you putting it on my face?

675
00:52:17,614 --> 00:52:20,533
No way. Look.

676
00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:23,703
You're getting more on me.

677
00:52:24,371 --> 00:52:25,288
No way.

678
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:58,321
Then Ji-yeong,
who ranked second in her class,

679
00:52:58,405 --> 00:53:01,449
pushed Min-ji,
the top student, off the rooftop.

680
00:53:01,533 --> 00:53:02,617
Why?

681
00:53:03,618 --> 00:53:05,870
And Min-ji fell headfirst.

682
00:53:07,706 --> 00:53:09,374
After that incident,

683
00:53:09,457 --> 00:53:12,836
Ji-yeong was at her evening study session.

684
00:53:12,919 --> 00:53:15,338
Soon, she realized
she was there all alone.

685
00:53:16,631 --> 00:53:19,009
-Then she began to hear something.
-Okay.

686
00:53:20,635 --> 00:53:23,346
Thump, thump, thump.

687
00:53:24,889 --> 00:53:26,057
"She's not here."

688
00:53:27,517 --> 00:53:30,854
Thump, thump, thump.

689
00:53:31,646 --> 00:53:33,148
"She's not here either."

690
00:53:33,857 --> 00:53:37,485
Thump, thump, thump.

691
00:53:39,696 --> 00:53:40,697
Thump.

692
00:53:42,115 --> 00:53:44,034
"She's here!"

693
00:53:44,117 --> 00:53:45,118
She's here!

694
00:53:45,201 --> 00:53:46,870
-Stop it!
-Don't do that!

695
00:53:47,704 --> 00:53:49,873
-She's here!
-Stop it!

696
00:53:49,956 --> 00:53:52,542
-That was so shocking!
-Mi-seon's good at this.

697
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:55,170
-Hey, forget it.
-Why are you so shocked?

698
00:53:56,087 --> 00:53:57,839
Why was she there?

699
00:53:57,922 --> 00:53:59,799
I feel bad for that girl, though.

700
00:53:59,883 --> 00:54:02,302
-Ranking second is still good.
-Right?

701
00:54:02,385 --> 00:54:05,555
Hey, Beom. Forget that.
Have a bite, go inside and go to sleep.

702
00:54:06,765 --> 00:54:09,059
I'm not sleepy.
Stop telling me to go to sleep.

703
00:54:09,142 --> 00:54:11,728
Beom, do you want your brother-in-law
to sing you a lullaby?

704
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:14,064
I decline, Mr. Wang Nam-mo.

705
00:54:19,694 --> 00:54:21,571
Are you leaving? Good night.

706
00:54:24,365 --> 00:54:25,867
That was so shocking.

707
00:54:27,494 --> 00:54:28,495
My gosh.

708
00:54:28,578 --> 00:54:30,080
Ji-yeong sounds so evil. How awful.

709
00:54:30,163 --> 00:54:32,040
-How can she push her?
-Hello.

710
00:54:32,123 --> 00:54:34,167
Hello? Can I speak to Mi-ho?

711
00:54:36,377 --> 00:54:37,796
Who would call at this hour?

712
00:54:39,464 --> 00:54:40,632
No one.

713
00:54:41,633 --> 00:54:43,760
-Who was it?
-Someone had the wrong number.

714
00:54:43,843 --> 00:54:45,720
It was the wrong number. A stranger.

715
00:54:46,554 --> 00:54:48,181
-I mean it.
-You're acting odd.

716
00:54:48,264 --> 00:54:49,933
-I'm serious.
-Is she cheating on you?

717
00:54:50,016 --> 00:54:50,892
I said no.

718
00:54:53,353 --> 00:54:55,814
-But she's acting suspicious.
-It's no one.

719
00:54:56,397 --> 00:54:57,398
She can't cheat.

720
00:54:58,858 --> 00:55:00,276
What do you mean, I can't?

721
00:55:01,236 --> 00:55:03,488
What's with you, Mi-seon?

722
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:06,116
Hey, why is your ex-boyfriend
looking for you?

723
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:07,117
You mean Tae-min?

724
00:55:07,826 --> 00:55:09,619
-Why didn't you put me on?
-Hey!

725
00:55:10,578 --> 00:55:13,123
Why do you stay in touch
with your ex-boyfriend?

726
00:55:13,206 --> 00:55:15,834
Because I had to say something to him.

727
00:55:16,501 --> 00:55:18,503
Anyway, if he calls again, put me on.

728
00:55:18,586 --> 00:55:19,504
Hey!

729
00:55:20,088 --> 00:55:22,298
You're not up to anything, are you?

730
00:55:22,382 --> 00:55:24,759
I'm not. What's with you?

731
00:55:29,139 --> 00:55:30,348
She seems so suspicious.

732
00:55:43,194 --> 00:55:46,322
-Are you sure you can sleep here?
-I'll be fine.

733
00:55:46,406 --> 00:55:48,116
I like sleeping in the car.

734
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:50,535
The tent is too small,
so let Nam-mo and Beom stay.

735
00:55:50,618 --> 00:55:52,453
And you can relax with Mi-ho.

736
00:55:54,873 --> 00:55:56,499
It seems uncomfortable.

737
00:55:56,583 --> 00:55:58,626
It feels so nice and comfy.

738
00:55:59,711 --> 00:56:00,712
Go to sleep.

739
00:56:04,632 --> 00:56:06,759
It doesn't seem all right.

740
00:56:06,843 --> 00:56:07,969
Gosh.

741
00:56:08,052 --> 00:56:09,053
It's so relaxing.

742
00:56:22,817 --> 00:56:24,736
You're really going to go to sleep?

743
00:56:26,946 --> 00:56:30,325
I'm tired.
And we have to get up early tomorrow.

744
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:32,952
Can we talk?

745
00:56:33,745 --> 00:56:35,663
Later. Let's talk later.

746
00:56:36,581 --> 00:56:38,917
Later. You always say later.

747
00:56:41,044 --> 00:56:43,963
You said you'll take up another job
after this summer break.

748
00:56:44,047 --> 00:56:47,175
Even now, I only see you
in the dead of night. How is this dating?

749
00:56:47,759 --> 00:56:49,260
It's just a late-night stroll.

750
00:56:50,386 --> 00:56:53,097
Why? I like seeing you like this
even if it's for a brief moment.

751
00:56:53,723 --> 00:56:55,099
Do you not feel that way?

752
00:56:56,059 --> 00:56:56,893
No, I don't.

753
00:56:58,394 --> 00:57:00,438
Darn it. Forget it. Whatever.

754
00:57:25,922 --> 00:57:30,051
It could be somewhere here.

755
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:49,946
The ceiling…

756
00:58:10,341 --> 00:58:11,175
What's this?

757
00:58:13,011 --> 00:58:13,928
Let's see.

758
00:58:16,055 --> 00:58:17,181
It looks old.

759
00:58:18,141 --> 00:58:19,183
Could it be…

760
00:58:20,935 --> 00:58:22,145
Why is this here?

761
00:58:22,228 --> 00:58:25,273
1986 STUDENT RECORD

762
00:58:27,859 --> 00:58:31,487
ETHICS B, KOREAN D, MATH F, SCIENCE F,
PHYSICAL EDUCATION A, ENGLISH D

763
00:58:31,571 --> 00:58:35,533
HE MAY HAVE AWFUL GRADES,
BUT HE HAS AN EXEMPLARY PERSONALITY

764
00:58:36,826 --> 00:58:38,036
It's been so long.

765
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:45,918
I APOLOGIZE FOR MY SON'S POOR PERFORMANCE
PLEASE CONTINUE TO GUIDE HIM WELL

766
00:58:46,919 --> 00:58:48,379
That's so dad.

767
00:58:54,093 --> 00:58:56,262
"I apologize
for my son's poor performance."

768
00:59:05,229 --> 00:59:07,315
My gosh.

769
00:59:11,778 --> 00:59:14,238
You must've been surprised
when my sister hung up.

770
00:59:14,322 --> 00:59:15,406
Sorry.

771
00:59:15,907 --> 00:59:18,534
Anyway, have you considered
what I said last time?

772
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:24,666
Don't be like this, Tae-min.
You said you'd love to.

773
00:59:24,749 --> 00:59:26,709
You're just awful.

774
00:59:29,671 --> 00:59:30,755
Don't be so awful.

775
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,884
I'd like to do that one of these days.

776
00:59:43,601 --> 00:59:45,311
It's not like that.

777
00:59:45,812 --> 00:59:46,896
Hey!

778
00:59:49,357 --> 00:59:50,650
Good luck with him.

779
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,697
Hey, Nam-mo!

780
00:59:57,657 --> 00:59:58,825
Darn it.

781
01:00:06,624 --> 01:00:07,709
What's going on?

782
01:00:08,626 --> 01:00:10,878
What are you looking for?
The promissory note?

783
01:00:10,962 --> 01:00:14,757
Well, I heard
this car was his favorite thing.

784
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,302
I thought it might be here somewhere.

785
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,643
What happens if you don't find it?
The deadline is coming up.

786
01:00:32,191 --> 01:00:33,067
In that case…

787
01:00:38,781 --> 01:00:40,158
I have to give up

788
01:00:42,076 --> 01:00:43,286
my position as the CEO.

789
01:00:43,369 --> 01:00:44,996
-What did you say? Ouch!
-Wait.

790
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:47,749
-Are you okay? What happened?
-Wait. Darn it.

791
01:00:47,832 --> 01:00:50,752
Are you okay? Is the car okay?

792
01:00:50,835 --> 01:00:51,961
Are you okay, Mi-seon?

793
01:00:54,589 --> 01:00:56,799
Give up what? Your position as the CEO?

794
01:00:56,883 --> 01:00:58,843
What are you talking about?

795
01:00:58,926 --> 01:01:02,764
Well, I couldn't sit around
and let the business go bankrupt.

796
01:01:04,265 --> 01:01:06,768
And from the company's perspective,

797
01:01:06,851 --> 01:01:09,353
me leaving is the easiest way
to handle things.

798
01:01:09,437 --> 01:01:11,731
How is that easy?

799
01:01:12,231 --> 01:01:13,232
Jeez!

800
01:01:14,358 --> 01:01:15,443
That must hurt.

801
01:01:16,152 --> 01:01:17,570
So what are you…

802
01:01:17,653 --> 01:01:20,239
After all that,
you're talking about moving offices?

803
01:01:25,203 --> 01:01:26,370
It was a promise.

804
01:01:27,997 --> 01:01:29,791
-Six!
-Hey.

805
01:01:30,917 --> 01:01:32,710
-Okay.
-What now?

806
01:01:33,753 --> 01:01:34,879
-All of a sudden?
-Okay.

807
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,340
He's so mean.

808
01:01:38,299 --> 01:01:39,175
Zero.

809
01:01:40,551 --> 01:01:41,427
Three.

810
01:01:46,849 --> 01:01:47,975
I am back.

811
01:01:51,312 --> 01:01:52,980
You're back, Mr. Bae!

812
01:01:53,064 --> 01:01:55,858
Everything went well thanks to you!

813
01:01:55,942 --> 01:01:57,485
So while we're on the subject,

814
01:01:58,277 --> 01:02:01,739
why don't I get promoted
to manager when this deal ends?

815
01:02:01,823 --> 01:02:02,657
Manager Bae.

816
01:02:04,867 --> 01:02:06,828
Was he a part of the company?

817
01:02:06,911 --> 01:02:09,705
-Is he on the payroll?
-Not really.

818
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,543
-Good work.
-Good work.

819
01:02:14,794 --> 01:02:15,920
So?

820
01:02:16,003 --> 01:02:18,422
What do you want to do once we get paid?

821
01:02:20,466 --> 01:02:23,135
How about some barbecue
at Jangsu Barbecue Restaurant?

822
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:24,971
Let's eat some ribeye.

823
01:02:25,054 --> 01:02:29,016
True love can be expressed
when cash is exchanged, you know.

824
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:32,228
I'll leave you at that. You know, right?

825
01:02:34,105 --> 01:02:36,858
I want us to return to our old office.

826
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,943
I miss my old desk.

827
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,613
I miss that place.

828
01:02:49,412 --> 01:02:52,415
I made my promise on that day.

829
01:02:52,999 --> 01:02:56,085
That we'd go back to our old office
the first thing when we made money.

830
01:03:03,551 --> 01:03:05,261
What if we don't find it?

831
01:03:05,344 --> 01:03:07,471
Do you have a plan for that?

832
01:03:08,973 --> 01:03:10,933
I'll face it when the moment comes.

833
01:03:11,934 --> 01:03:13,436
Good grief.

834
01:03:14,353 --> 01:03:15,479
Stop that.

835
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,315
Don't do it.

836
01:03:20,735 --> 01:03:23,696
What's that? Is that a piece of paper?

837
01:03:23,779 --> 01:03:25,114
-Is that it?
-No, not this one.

838
01:03:25,197 --> 01:03:26,699
Why not? Let me see it.

839
01:03:26,782 --> 01:03:28,159
-It's nothing.
-That might be it.

840
01:03:39,712 --> 01:03:41,172
Should we look for it tomorrow?

841
01:03:49,722 --> 01:03:50,556
Gosh.

842
01:03:54,143 --> 01:03:56,020
-Mi-seon.
-Yes?

843
01:03:56,103 --> 01:03:58,814
Mi-ho is laying down,
but she keeps swearing.

844
01:03:58,898 --> 01:04:01,359
-What? She did?
-Go and scold her.

845
01:04:01,442 --> 01:04:04,278
All right. Go to sleep.
Will you sleep here?

846
01:04:04,862 --> 01:04:05,863
Why would she swear?

847
01:04:15,998 --> 01:04:19,794
TYPHOON TRADING

848
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,131
Please put it there for now.

849
01:04:24,215 --> 01:04:25,049
Okay.

850
01:04:39,772 --> 01:04:40,773
Why won't he pick up?

851
01:04:43,818 --> 01:04:44,944
Mr. Kang.

852
01:04:45,027 --> 01:04:48,155
You're going to visit Mr. Pyo?
He's not picking up.

853
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:50,992
He's not, but today is the day
we agreed on, so I have to show up.

854
01:04:52,368 --> 01:04:53,452
I'll go with you.

855
01:04:55,287 --> 01:04:56,330
Listen.

856
01:04:58,290 --> 01:04:59,750
I'll take this too.

857
01:04:59,834 --> 01:05:00,793
What's that?

858
01:05:02,503 --> 01:05:03,587
A cashier's check.

859
01:05:03,671 --> 01:05:05,756
The price for the gloves
you took from him.

860
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:09,927
No, we got those gloves
in return for the money he owed us.

861
01:05:10,011 --> 01:05:12,930
I know. The amount he borrowed in 1989
along with the interest

862
01:05:13,014 --> 01:05:14,974
is much more than the gloves we took.

863
01:05:16,517 --> 01:05:19,854
But it's also true
that you didn't find the promissory note.

864
01:05:22,189 --> 01:05:23,566
There's a letter of guarantee.

865
01:05:25,234 --> 01:05:29,071
And that letter is the acknowledgement
that there is a promissory note out there.

866
01:05:30,364 --> 01:05:34,452
So I'll meet him today
and make an offer to just call it even.

867
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:37,329
Okay, let's hurry.

868
01:05:45,004 --> 01:05:49,258
I'm not here to fight today.
I have an appointment.

869
01:05:49,341 --> 01:05:51,469
Mr. Pyo is busy.

870
01:05:52,053 --> 01:05:55,222
-Call him before you come!
-He won't pick up! What can I do?

871
01:05:55,806 --> 01:05:57,391
I have to meet him today!

872
01:05:58,559 --> 01:05:59,852
But is he inside?

873
01:06:01,562 --> 01:06:03,814
What now? Are you doubting me?

874
01:06:03,898 --> 01:06:05,316
Doubting, my foot.

875
01:06:05,399 --> 01:06:07,526
-Move aside!
-Hey, wait!

876
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:09,945
-Hey!
-Security!

877
01:06:14,867 --> 01:06:16,410
Why do you keep avoiding me?

878
01:06:18,913 --> 01:06:19,955
What?

879
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:22,124
Where's Mr. Pyo?

880
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:30,341
What's he talking about?
Introducing himself?

881
01:06:32,927 --> 01:06:34,303
Where's the CEO?

882
01:06:34,386 --> 01:06:35,346
CEO PYO BAK-HO

883
01:06:38,808 --> 01:06:41,393
Hey. Where's your dad?

884
01:06:41,477 --> 01:06:43,896
You little punk.

885
01:06:43,979 --> 01:06:46,273
Why do you keep asking for him?

886
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:50,569
-Say it to me if you need to talk.
-I have nothing to say to you.

887
01:06:50,653 --> 01:06:51,904
Where's the CEO?

888
01:06:52,738 --> 01:06:53,948
I'm the CEO.

889
01:06:54,532 --> 01:06:55,991
Cut this crap and tell me.

890
01:06:59,161 --> 01:07:01,122
Goodness, I'm sorry.

891
01:07:01,205 --> 01:07:02,414
Why, you…

892
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:05,376
How dare you barge in here? Get out.

893
01:07:05,459 --> 01:07:07,461
Stop lurking around and get out!

894
01:07:07,545 --> 01:07:08,420
Okay, I'll go.

895
01:07:09,004 --> 01:07:10,172
The CEO isn't even around.

896
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:16,011
This looks adequate.

897
01:07:16,846 --> 01:07:20,141
-What's the time, Ms. Oh?
-It's 11:15 a.m.

898
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,727
What the heck are you doing?

899
01:07:30,651 --> 01:07:31,902
All of you saw me here.

900
01:07:32,611 --> 01:07:34,947
I came here on the scheduled date.

901
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:38,909
Let's go.

902
01:07:38,993 --> 01:07:41,453
KANG TAE-POONG
11:15 A.M., JUNE 29TH, 1998

903
01:07:41,537 --> 01:07:43,080
That's a permanent marker.

904
01:07:47,126 --> 01:07:50,087
Did you notice the desk?
He really seemed absent.

905
01:07:50,171 --> 01:07:51,213
I noticed.

906
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:55,134
What do you think happened to him?

907
01:07:56,677 --> 01:07:57,970
We'll see in time.

908
01:08:00,806 --> 01:08:02,850
Let's go. It's a good day,
and everyone's waiting.

909
01:08:02,933 --> 01:08:03,851
Okay.

910
01:08:40,137 --> 01:08:42,681
This place brings back so many emotions.

911
01:08:44,808 --> 01:08:46,101
Be quiet and get me water.

912
01:08:46,185 --> 01:08:48,646
Sure, it's placed inside the pantry.

913
01:08:48,729 --> 01:08:51,065
Do we have to make such a huge fuss?

914
01:08:51,607 --> 01:08:54,276
-Where are the scissors?
-They're on my desk.

915
01:08:57,196 --> 01:09:01,075
You're making this worse.
Can you play just one song?

916
01:09:02,576 --> 01:09:05,746
Is this broken?

917
01:09:05,829 --> 01:09:08,332
Mr. Kang, I get it,
but you're wearing white pants

918
01:09:08,415 --> 01:09:11,669
with your shirt buttoned down there.
Isn't that too revealing?

919
01:09:11,752 --> 01:09:15,422
I know a thing or two about fashion.

920
01:09:24,848 --> 01:09:27,017
Watch out, Myung-gwan.

921
01:09:27,101 --> 01:09:28,894
We've returned in glory!

922
01:09:29,728 --> 01:09:30,562
No!

923
01:09:33,107 --> 01:09:34,191
Are you okay?

924
01:09:35,192 --> 01:09:37,152
-Come on!
-What's this?

925
01:09:38,612 --> 01:09:39,822
What is this?

926
01:09:39,905 --> 01:09:43,742
You should've set this out
after the plant came in!

927
01:09:43,826 --> 01:09:44,660
Come on!

928
01:09:44,743 --> 01:09:48,914
Let us cut the tape
to celebrate Typhoon Trading's return.

929
01:09:48,998 --> 01:09:50,749
I will call out Typhoon Trading.

930
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:54,628
Then, everyone, please shout out,
"We can do it!"

931
01:09:57,423 --> 01:09:58,632
Typhoon Trading!

932
01:09:58,716 --> 01:09:59,967
We can do it!

933
01:10:05,431 --> 01:10:06,390
You didn't set a timer?

934
01:10:06,473 --> 01:10:07,558
I didn't set a timer.

935
01:10:07,641 --> 01:10:08,517
Me neither.

936
01:10:09,101 --> 01:10:11,312
What did we just do? Are you guys dumb?

937
01:10:11,395 --> 01:10:14,648
Mr. Bae, you should've set up the timer.

938
01:10:14,732 --> 01:10:18,360
Hey, why are you getting on my case?
That's not my vibe today.

939
01:10:18,986 --> 01:10:20,821
Hey, that's not my vibe today either.

940
01:10:20,904 --> 01:10:22,948
Then should I do it? Or Myung-gwan?

941
01:10:23,032 --> 01:10:25,200
His hands keep trembling.

942
01:10:25,284 --> 01:10:27,119
Let's just take turns.

943
01:10:27,202 --> 01:10:28,996
-Let's put these back together.
-Let's do it.

944
01:10:29,079 --> 01:10:30,289
Should I bring the stapler?

945
01:10:30,372 --> 01:10:32,041
It's too ragged.

946
01:10:32,124 --> 01:10:34,168
-Right. A stapler.
-I'll bring it anyway.

947
01:10:34,251 --> 01:10:36,920
-What are we doing?
-We can just stick them back together.

948
01:10:37,504 --> 01:10:39,631
Is that right? Okay. All set.

949
01:10:39,715 --> 01:10:41,216
-We're set.
-Okay.

950
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,718
Did you stick them together?

951
01:10:43,552 --> 01:10:45,095
Hey, you'll staple your hand!

952
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:46,680
-I won't. Be careful.
-No!

953
01:10:47,306 --> 01:10:48,932
Come on!

954
01:10:49,016 --> 01:10:50,267
Typhoon Trading!

955
01:10:50,351 --> 01:10:51,810
We can do it!

956
01:10:52,895 --> 01:10:54,980
One, two, three.

957
01:11:08,535 --> 01:11:09,453
Anyway.

958
01:11:10,913 --> 01:11:13,207
Where did Pyo Bak-ho go?

959
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:16,126
Forget about him on a good day like this.

960
01:11:16,877 --> 01:11:18,837
He's not around. What can he do?

961
01:11:18,921 --> 01:11:20,964
Why won't you use the CEO's office?

962
01:11:22,591 --> 01:11:27,262
I want to leave the place as is.
I also like it out here.

963
01:11:29,264 --> 01:11:32,518
This rice cake is nice and chewy,

964
01:11:32,601 --> 01:11:33,894
just like our future.

965
01:11:35,062 --> 01:11:37,523
-I can't seem to swallow it.
-It's choking me.

966
01:11:38,899 --> 01:11:41,110
Anyway, where's Mr. Bae?

967
01:11:41,193 --> 01:11:43,195
He went out to pick up a call.

968
01:11:43,278 --> 01:11:46,740
What? He's been on the phone
for half a day now.

969
01:11:48,075 --> 01:11:49,368
-He's back.
-Mr. Bae.

970
01:11:50,702 --> 01:11:52,371
Have some rice cake, Mr. Bae.

971
01:11:52,454 --> 01:11:53,705
Have some.

972
01:11:54,706 --> 01:11:55,833
Mr. Bae.

973
01:12:00,546 --> 01:12:03,215
-Is something going on?
-Hey, what's wrong?

974
01:12:06,385 --> 01:12:07,511
Mr. Bae.

975
01:12:10,722 --> 01:12:11,890
What's wrong?

976
01:12:14,768 --> 01:12:16,311
Mr. Bae, what's going on?

977
01:12:19,231 --> 01:12:20,566
It's my dad.

978
01:12:25,904 --> 01:12:27,281
He's going to kill himself.

979
01:12:34,663 --> 01:12:36,790
What am I going to do?

980
01:13:10,491 --> 01:13:17,456
BORN IN THE WIND

981
01:13:49,571 --> 01:13:52,491
TYPHOON FAMILY

982
01:13:52,574 --> 01:13:54,535
Dad… Dad!

983
01:13:55,035 --> 01:13:57,621
And yet, they proceeded
to declare bankruptcy right away.

984
01:13:57,704 --> 01:13:58,789
That does seem fishy,

985
01:13:58,872 --> 01:14:01,750
but what I find odd
is that I ran into Hyun-jun there.

986
01:14:01,833 --> 01:14:03,210
It's voice-activated.

987
01:14:03,293 --> 01:14:06,505
It follows the source of the sound.
My father had it patented.

988
01:14:06,588 --> 01:14:09,466
You two are walking
unusually close together.

989
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:10,425
Be careful, okay?

990
01:14:10,509 --> 01:14:11,802
You could end up catching feelings.

991
01:14:13,929 --> 01:14:15,222
Get the hell out!

992
01:14:15,305 --> 01:14:17,057
If you got lost without a fuss,

993
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:20,394
everyone outside
could at least keep their jobs.

994
01:14:20,477 --> 01:14:22,771
Wait for me, Dad.

995
01:14:22,854 --> 01:14:24,314
I won't ever give up.

996
01:14:25,607 --> 01:14:30,612
