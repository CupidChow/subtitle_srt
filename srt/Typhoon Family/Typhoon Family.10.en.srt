TYPHOON FAMILY

2
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,737
What on earth?

3
00:01:29,027 --> 00:01:30,737
Mr. Arthit.

4
00:01:34,073 --> 00:01:36,951
He's the customs officer
who took the $50 bribe.

5
00:01:41,456 --> 00:01:43,875
"At 6:00 p.m. on April 27th,

6
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:46,961
a Korean man gave me $10,000
after work on my way home."

7
00:01:47,045 --> 00:01:48,838
That's that line.

8
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:56,471
Yes, he did it.

9
00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:06,064
Your Honor.

10
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:10,777
This film includes the entire instance
of grabbing money and handing it to him.

11
00:02:12,737 --> 00:02:15,740
I wish to turn this film in as evidence.

12
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:29,796
And if necessary, I'd like to have
the photo studio owner as our witness.

13
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:51,067
-It's game over.
-Yes, it's game over.

14
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,669
RECEIPT OF THE CRIMINAL COURT

15
00:03:09,752 --> 00:03:11,170
FINE PAID IN FULL
DEFENDANT RELEASED

16
00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:18,803
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

17
00:03:18,886 --> 00:03:20,304
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

18
00:03:23,016 --> 00:03:25,226
-Are you sure it's done?
-Yes, it's done.

19
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:28,813
-We did it!
-We did it!

20
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,814
We did it!

21
00:03:31,816 --> 00:03:33,818
-Great work.
-Yes, great work.

22
00:03:33,901 --> 00:03:35,570
We did it.

23
00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:38,656
Oh, right. Here.

24
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,159
The old man at the photo studio
gave this back.

25
00:03:41,242 --> 00:03:42,577
Your watch.

26
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:44,120
I'll take that.

27
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:51,085
We have to hurry.

28
00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:58,634
COURT FOR CONCILIATION

29
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:01,971
-Mr. Kang. Ms. Oh.
-Hey.

30
00:04:02,055 --> 00:04:03,598
-Mr. Go!
-Mr. Go!

31
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:08,895
-You've gone through so much trouble!
-You almost ended up in prison!

32
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:11,314
Who's the police chief? Get him here!

33
00:04:11,397 --> 00:04:14,650
I'll show him the terror
of the Korean Marine Corps!

34
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:17,111
-Hold yourself back.
-I'll hold myself back.

35
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:18,529
Gosh, I'm free.

36
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:20,782
-You are.
-I'm free!

37
00:04:20,865 --> 00:04:24,577
-I've been freed!
-You've been freed!

38
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,496
I got freed!

39
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:28,289
-I'm free now!
-Wait.

40
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:29,916
Wait, what time is it?

41
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:31,417
-Why?
-It's already past 3:00 p.m.!

42
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:33,419
-The time! We have to go!
-We have to hurry.

43
00:04:33,503 --> 00:04:34,629
What do you mean?

44
00:04:34,712 --> 00:04:37,882
Our helmets will be disposed of
if this case isn't closed by 4:00.

45
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:40,676
Why are you here?
Why were you celebrating?

46
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,305
We ran around everywhere
trying our best to save you!

47
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:48,643
-Over there. That's the car.
-Hey!

48
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:50,019
-Over here!
-Here!

49
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:54,524
-Get in.
-To the port!

50
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:56,067
-No, you can't go!
-Why not?

51
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,069
-Why not?
-We're in huge trouble!

52
00:04:58,152 --> 00:04:59,153
What now?

53
00:04:59,237 --> 00:05:01,864
They're doing some construction work
on the highway,

54
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:04,534
so the entire road is closed off!

55
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:09,122
This car can't go on the highway.
We can't go.

56
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:11,666
If we can't take this car,
we'll take another way, then.

57
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:13,960
Goodness gracious.

58
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:17,505
It'll take at least an hour
to get to the port.

59
00:05:17,588 --> 00:05:20,550
And there's no guarantee
that other roads will be open.

60
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:22,927
-What do we do?
-What now?

61
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,721
-Let's find bicycles.
-How are you going to go on bicycles?

62
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:27,390
What else can we do, then?

63
00:05:27,473 --> 00:05:29,600
I get scared. I'm not going!

64
00:05:30,393 --> 00:05:32,228
Where are you going, Mr. Go?

65
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,647
-Where is he going?
-Where are you going?

66
00:05:43,322 --> 00:05:44,407
What's going on?

67
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,576
What are you doing, Mr. Go?

68
00:05:47,785 --> 00:05:50,913
When in doubt, always take a motorcycle.

69
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:52,081
-Let's go, Ms. Oh.
-Okay.

70
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:54,208
I'll get behind you,
and Ms. Oh can hop on last.

71
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:55,626
You can come separately.

72
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,961
Why?

73
00:05:57,044 --> 00:05:59,380
This motorcycle can't fit three.
We aren't kids, you know.

74
00:05:59,463 --> 00:06:01,174
The sales team will go on our own.

75
00:06:03,342 --> 00:06:05,678
-Bye.
-Hold tight!

76
00:06:06,262 --> 00:06:07,513
Be careful!

77
00:06:13,394 --> 00:06:17,356
MIN BURI CRIMINAL COURT
MIN BURI CIVIL COURT

78
00:06:18,065 --> 00:06:19,108
What about me?

79
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:33,915
Thank you, Ms. Oh!

80
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,375
What? I can't hear you!

81
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:39,462
Hold tight!

82
00:06:39,545 --> 00:06:41,505
I can't hear you, Mr. Go!

83
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:44,467
-And you smell awful!
-What?

84
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,594
You smell awful!

85
00:06:46,677 --> 00:06:48,304
Don't worry!

86
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:51,224
We need to hurry, but be careful!

87
00:07:01,776 --> 00:07:03,402
Let me come through!

88
00:07:12,078 --> 00:07:13,454
Excuse me!

89
00:07:23,798 --> 00:07:25,550
Coming through!

90
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:26,759
I'm sorry!

91
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:40,856
-Drive faster, Mr. Go!
-This motorcycle is too slow!

92
00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:44,527
-Do you know the direction?
-Trust me!

93
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:47,405
-Just trust in me!
-Eyes on the road!

94
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:33,576
Be careful, Mr. Go.

95
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:36,704
Don't worry!

96
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:45,212
You're going too fast!

97
00:08:46,422 --> 00:08:48,382
Don't worry about it!

98
00:08:55,348 --> 00:08:58,225
-What's going on? What is it?
-Wait a second.

99
00:08:58,309 --> 00:08:59,727
-What's with this?
-What?

100
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,855
-This can't happen. What's going on?
-Is it broken? Why?

101
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:04,190
Why? What's the matter?

102
00:09:04,273 --> 00:09:06,400
-It won't move.
-Did it break down?

103
00:09:06,484 --> 00:09:08,277
-What's with this?
-What are we going to do?

104
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:10,780
-Why would it break down now?
-We should do something.

105
00:09:10,863 --> 00:09:12,657
We'll do something. But…

106
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,909
-This is driving me insane.
-Wait, what do we do?

107
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:16,410
What now? Wait.

108
00:09:16,994 --> 00:09:18,454
-Let's see.
-Darn it.

109
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:22,041
-Has the engine given up?
-Can you even tell by looking?

110
00:09:22,124 --> 00:09:25,002
What would I know even if I looked?
I don't know anything.

111
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:27,421
But we have to do something…

112
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:32,385
Hey, what's… What's with this?

113
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:35,346
-Mr. Go, I'll get there faster if I run.
-What?

114
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:36,847
Where are you going?

115
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:39,266
Ms. Oh!

116
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:09,880
Hey.

117
00:10:10,798 --> 00:10:11,924
Hop in.

118
00:10:12,842 --> 00:10:14,593
It's you, Mr. Kang.

119
00:10:23,477 --> 00:10:25,855
Mi-seon has gone far.
I don't see her anymore.

120
00:10:25,938 --> 00:10:28,107
-Did she run?
-Yes.

121
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:30,359
Why would she do that?

122
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:05,394
PRIVATE CAR LANE

123
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:11,108
Okay, just trust me.

124
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:17,448
Ms. Oh!

125
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:54,777
Oh, no…

126
00:12:05,454 --> 00:12:07,414
Wait! Wait a moment!

127
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,709
Hold on! Wait, no. Wait.

128
00:12:10,793 --> 00:12:12,503
-Get out.
-I'm begging you. Please.

129
00:12:12,586 --> 00:12:14,255
-Wait! Stop!
-Get out.

130
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:16,215
-They're almost here.
-Get out. It's dangerous.

131
00:12:16,298 --> 00:12:17,508
-Hurry up!
-It's dangerous.

132
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:19,385
-Let's get going.
-Get out. It's dangerous.

133
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:20,761
-One moment.
-Hurry up, quick!

134
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:22,012
Wait just a little.

135
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:24,682
-They're almost here.
-It's dangerous.

136
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:27,017
-Please…
-What's she saying? One minute!

137
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:29,687
-No, wait.
-Hey!

138
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,896
Jeez.

139
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,106
-Get down.
-Get out.

140
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:33,649
-Get down.
-Get out. It's dangerous.

141
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:35,442
-No, stop!
-Get out.

142
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:37,444
-Ten minutes! Stop, please.
-Get out.

143
00:12:37,528 --> 00:12:39,572
-Ten minutes. Ten minutes.
-Get her out of here.

144
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:41,365
-You can't. Wait…
-Get out.

145
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:44,827
-No, wait! They're almost here!
-Get out.

146
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:53,043
Wait!

147
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:56,505
You can't! No!

148
00:12:57,172 --> 00:12:58,424
I won't let you.

149
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:01,135
No, wait!

150
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:11,645
Please…

151
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:27,286
Ms. Oh!

152
00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:33,584
No…

153
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:35,794
-Hold tight, Mr. Go!
-What?

154
00:13:42,176 --> 00:13:43,636
-Move!
-Move aside!

155
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:45,387
-Move aside!
-Move aside!

156
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:47,723
Move aside, all of you!

157
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,601
-Ms. Oh! Move aside!
-Move aside!

158
00:13:50,684 --> 00:13:52,144
-Ms. Oh!
-Move it!

159
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:56,190
No…

160
00:14:09,203 --> 00:14:10,454
Move aside!

161
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,379
-Mi-seon!
-Move aside!

162
00:14:35,604 --> 00:14:36,689
Are you okay, Mr. Go?

163
00:14:37,314 --> 00:14:38,607
I'm fine.

164
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:40,609
No, I'm not fine!

165
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:45,155
Stop it!

166
00:14:53,664 --> 00:14:55,165
Get out.

167
00:14:55,249 --> 00:14:57,751
Mr. Kang, are you all right?

168
00:14:57,835 --> 00:14:58,919
I'm fine.

169
00:14:59,003 --> 00:15:00,379
-Here.
-Yes.

170
00:15:00,462 --> 00:15:01,755
Take it.

171
00:15:03,465 --> 00:15:05,134
What? Get out of the way!

172
00:15:05,217 --> 00:15:06,593
I have it. Hold on.

173
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:08,721
Here.

174
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,519
FINE PAID IN FULL PER VERDICT
DEFENDANT DISCHARGED

175
00:15:16,145 --> 00:15:17,521
Oh, I see.

176
00:15:27,197 --> 00:15:30,284
What's going on? The tuktuk! Hold it.

177
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:34,121
-That was so shocking.
-It worked.

178
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:35,831
-Hey, your forehead.
-What about it?

179
00:15:35,914 --> 00:15:36,874
You're bleeding.

180
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:38,083
-I'm bleeding?
-Oh, no.

181
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:39,168
I'm fine.

182
00:15:41,545 --> 00:15:44,173
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-No, it's okay.

183
00:15:44,256 --> 00:15:45,883
Are you really okay?

184
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:49,720
-Are you okay, Mr. Go?
-I'm not, but I guess I'm fine.

185
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:20,584
Thank you.

186
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,801
They look like they've seen better days,
but they should be fine, right?

187
00:16:28,884 --> 00:16:30,427
After all, these are helmets.

188
00:16:35,349 --> 00:16:36,558
They look fine.

189
00:16:39,603 --> 00:16:40,646
The insides are destroyed.

190
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,131
They'll run it through customs again.

191
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:11,135
What's wrong? What is it?

192
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:20,978
What happened to these?

193
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:23,981
Are they all in this condition?

194
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:28,485
Wait. Hold on.

195
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:29,862
I'm sure some are…

196
00:17:31,113 --> 00:17:33,782
Do we have to throw out all of these?

197
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:36,577
What about this one?

198
00:17:37,286 --> 00:17:38,787
Are they all like this?

199
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:41,582
Wait a second. What do we do now?

200
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:44,251
What do we do?
Do we have to throw them out or what?

201
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:45,711
What do we do?

202
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:51,550
No, we…

203
00:17:53,468 --> 00:17:54,469
Wait.

204
00:17:55,262 --> 00:17:57,764
-Ms. Oh.
-No, wait.

205
00:17:59,224 --> 00:18:02,144
-It's okay. We can start again.
-No, give me a second.

206
00:18:14,323 --> 00:18:15,908
Wait, Mr. Kang.

207
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:20,370
In the end, we failed.

208
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:25,792
We couldn't find a client,
make sales, or save the inventory.

209
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,254
Don't worry. It's okay.

210
00:18:30,797 --> 00:18:31,757
Ms. Oh.

211
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:35,510
Ms. Oh, it's okay.

212
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:38,138
We did our best.

213
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:42,768
I never realized it before,
but you're very good at your job.

214
00:18:44,228 --> 00:18:45,896
You've done so well, Ms. Oh.

215
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:49,024
Senior Staff Oh Mi-seon,

216
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,902
you were the best trader.

217
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,198
You've done well. It's all right.

218
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:00,535
-You did a good job.
-What do we do?

219
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:04,456
You did well. We can do it over.

220
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:08,585
I'm so frustrated. What do we do?

221
00:19:12,172 --> 00:19:13,131
I'm so frustrated.

222
00:19:20,931 --> 00:19:22,849
I smell, don't I?

223
00:19:24,268 --> 00:19:25,394
You don't.

224
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,354
What do we do?

225
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:46,331
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

226
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:54,172
But still, I'm so relieved.

227
00:19:54,256 --> 00:19:57,676
In the end, we didn't lose everything.

228
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,554
We still managed to save 140 helmets.

229
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:04,182
It came through customs,
so we won't face more problems, right?

230
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:06,852
We'll do our best
to sell everything we have.

231
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,605
YEOPJIP RAMYEON

232
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,484
Should we export ramyeon?

233
00:20:14,568 --> 00:20:17,487
Isn't it too spicy for foreigners?

234
00:20:17,571 --> 00:20:20,490
The spiciness makes it unique.
I think it'll be a hit.

235
00:20:21,074 --> 00:20:24,119
We were going to throw away
that T-shirt, remember?

236
00:20:25,704 --> 00:20:27,914
Why would you throw away
this perfectly good T-shirt?

237
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:34,171
This is proof
of my youthful days when I was 27.

238
00:20:34,254 --> 00:20:37,424
It takes me back
to the sentiment from those days,

239
00:20:37,507 --> 00:20:39,718
when I listened
to Deulgukhwa and Infinite Track.

240
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:41,470
Were you in high school?

241
00:20:41,553 --> 00:20:44,848
I was in eighth grade,
and I loved Lee Sang-eun's "Dam-Da-Di."

242
00:20:44,931 --> 00:20:48,643
Our age gap is way too big
for us to sit together.

243
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:51,730
Back in the day,

244
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:55,650
when I was in tenth grade,
Nam-mo and I skipped military drill,

245
00:20:55,734 --> 00:20:58,028
went to watch
Kim Soo-nyung's archery game,

246
00:20:58,111 --> 00:21:01,531
got caught by the drill instructor,
and got beaten up ten times.

247
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:03,450
That's why I have a huge butt.

248
00:21:04,951 --> 00:21:06,870
The student military drill?

249
00:21:06,953 --> 00:21:09,664
You must've practiced
with wooden guns, right?

250
00:21:09,748 --> 00:21:11,750
We did it with real guns.

251
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:15,087
When did you start elementary school?
You're old.

252
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,421
I mean, real guns?

253
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:19,591
It was a turbulent time.

254
00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:22,761
Everything and everyone was suspicious.

255
00:21:24,554 --> 00:21:25,389
However…

256
00:21:26,556 --> 00:21:27,724
You know,

257
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,856
just because I'm older,
it doesn't mean I'm wiser.

258
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:39,903
Who would've known I'd make
such huge trouble in this foreign land?

259
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:45,158
And I acted like I was full of myself
when I talked to Ms. Oh.

260
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:49,496
Those $50 were just 70,000 won.

261
00:21:50,497 --> 00:21:54,459
I thought it was petty money,
but it led me to lose a huge amount.

262
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:59,589
The fine seemed pretty heavy.
I'll do something to pay that back.

263
00:21:59,673 --> 00:22:01,925
Don't mention it.

264
00:22:02,008 --> 00:22:04,344
Everything happened
while you were working,

265
00:22:05,387 --> 00:22:06,555
so we'll write it off.

266
00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:11,184
But we have to pay for this business trip
and pay off Kangseong Helmet's balance.

267
00:22:11,268 --> 00:22:13,937
I already came up with a plan in my head.

268
00:22:18,024 --> 00:22:20,569
I feel too ashamed.

269
00:22:22,195 --> 00:22:23,029
I'm sorry.

270
00:22:23,655 --> 00:22:24,531
Goodness.

271
00:22:27,993 --> 00:22:28,910
Mr. Go.

272
00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:33,790
I was the one who turned off the lights
whenever you were in the restroom.

273
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:34,708
I'm sorry.

274
00:22:36,668 --> 00:22:37,961
-So, it was you.
-Yes.

275
00:22:38,461 --> 00:22:42,632
I think this is really great.
I finally feel like we're a team.

276
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:49,264
All right, from now on,
let us stand hand in hand.

277
00:22:49,347 --> 00:22:54,477
-We'll get past walls and stay as a team.
-Okay.

278
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,062
-All right.
-Let's go!

279
00:22:56,146 --> 00:22:58,899
You're starting to sound like a real CEO.

280
00:22:59,774 --> 00:23:01,067
Of course, I am.

281
00:23:04,237 --> 00:23:06,740
Wait, you two
couldn't eat cilantro before.

282
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:09,201
Hand in hand we stand.

283
00:23:31,806 --> 00:23:33,600
Come on. I'm really fine.

284
00:23:34,643 --> 00:23:36,978
That wound can leave a scar.

285
00:23:43,818 --> 00:23:45,946
-It stings.
-Hang on a second.

286
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:46,988
Oh, no.

287
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,668
Okay. All done.

288
00:24:01,211 --> 00:24:02,629
Does it still sting?

289
00:24:03,755 --> 00:24:07,842
It kind of stings,
but it kind of doesn't. I'm not sure.

290
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:11,096
Someone told me not
to get up close and personal.

291
00:24:19,604 --> 00:24:22,023
Please excuse me, then. Get a good rest.

292
00:24:22,816 --> 00:24:23,817
Ms. Oh.

293
00:24:28,613 --> 00:24:29,906
I have something to tell you.

294
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,035
-Thank you.
-What?

295
00:24:34,703 --> 00:24:37,038
I thought about it
and realized I never said this.

296
00:24:38,832 --> 00:24:40,208
When I was in trouble

297
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:45,338
or when I felt I was all alone,

298
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:47,799
you were always there with me.

299
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:56,766
Thank you, Ms. Oh Mi-seon.

300
00:25:26,629 --> 00:25:29,841
I was just doing my job,

301
00:25:30,675 --> 00:25:31,968
whenever I had to do it.

302
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,599
Because you have to write
the business trip log?

303
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:40,393
Because records last longer than memories.

304
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,147
We'll need to take
disciplinary action too.

305
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:10,382
No.

306
00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:14,844
I prefer memories over records.

307
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:57,137
EPISODE 10
YOU AND I

308
00:27:05,812 --> 00:27:07,981
I'll miss this so much once we go back.

309
00:27:08,648 --> 00:27:09,941
-Eat up.
-Okay.

310
00:27:10,024 --> 00:27:11,860
Does anyone sell this in Korea?

311
00:27:11,943 --> 00:27:14,988
-I doubt it.
-No way. That's just ridiculous.

312
00:27:19,534 --> 00:27:21,161
What's this red thing?

313
00:27:21,244 --> 00:27:23,663
Put it in the front and back.

314
00:27:24,914 --> 00:27:27,709
-Go Ma-jin!
-Hey.

315
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:29,752
-He's here.
-Yes.

316
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:36,926
-Hey, Ma-jin.
-Hey.

317
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,052
Hello.

318
00:27:38,136 --> 00:27:40,430
-Get the boat closer.
-Pull it.

319
00:27:40,513 --> 00:27:41,806
-Closer.
-Right here.

320
00:27:43,183 --> 00:27:44,642
-Hey, Ma-jin.
-Hey.

321
00:27:44,726 --> 00:27:45,894
Goodness.

322
00:27:45,977 --> 00:27:48,104
-Hey, Ma-jin!
-Hey!

323
00:27:48,188 --> 00:27:50,273
-Hello.
-It must've been a rough journey.

324
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:51,816
Goodness, it must've been hard.

325
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,652
Mr. Kang and Ms. Oh,
it's a shame to see you go.

326
00:27:54,736 --> 00:27:55,945
Let us meet again, okay?

327
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:57,280
-Yes.
-My goodness.

328
00:27:57,363 --> 00:27:58,364
Hey, Ha-neul.

329
00:27:58,448 --> 00:28:00,700
What are you waiting for?
Come and say goodbye.

330
00:28:04,829 --> 00:28:05,955
Don't go.

331
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:07,874
-Here.
-Okay.

332
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:10,710
Thank you so much.

333
00:28:10,793 --> 00:28:12,295
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

334
00:28:12,378 --> 00:28:13,963
-Bye.
-Bye.

335
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:16,674
It's such a shame to see you go.
Now, come along.

336
00:28:16,758 --> 00:28:18,510
Are you sure you can do this alone?

337
00:28:19,385 --> 00:28:22,472
Mr. Kang, going around on foot
is the best way to do sales.

338
00:28:22,555 --> 00:28:25,391
I'll see the numbers working
once I put my feet to work.

339
00:28:25,475 --> 00:28:28,269
Of course, it'd be great
if I could sell all 140 at once.

340
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:30,897
But I don't care if I can't do that.

341
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:34,484
If I sell ten helmets
to 14 different places,

342
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:40,240
there will be at least one or two places
where I sell big and hit the jackpot.

343
00:28:40,949 --> 00:28:41,866
It will happen.

344
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,368
And I'm not here alone.

345
00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:49,749
Now, we're ahead of the game
with my experience and connections.

346
00:28:51,334 --> 00:28:53,253
-See you in Seoul.
-Okay.

347
00:28:53,336 --> 00:28:54,212
-Wait.
-What?

348
00:28:54,295 --> 00:28:56,339
Let's do a cheer for our business.

349
00:28:56,422 --> 00:28:58,550
-Why are we doing this?
-On the count of three.

350
00:28:58,633 --> 00:29:01,344
-Typhoon Trading, let's go!
-Let's go.

351
00:29:01,427 --> 00:29:02,887
We weren't in sync.

352
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:04,889
-Let's do this.
-Yes, let's do it!

353
00:29:04,973 --> 00:29:05,807
Let's do this!

354
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,976
-All right. Go now.
-You can do it!

355
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:09,394
-Come and visit, okay?
-Okay.

356
00:29:09,477 --> 00:29:10,687
My goodness.

357
00:29:11,729 --> 00:29:12,814
Mr. Kang.

358
00:29:13,606 --> 00:29:16,067
Keep an eye on my dear Ms. Oh, will you?

359
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,403
Since when was she your dear Ms. Oh?

360
00:29:19,028 --> 00:29:19,946
Be careful.

361
00:29:20,738 --> 00:29:23,950
It's such a shame to see you go…

362
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:29,664
Ms. Oh, I'll make money
and bring some dried mangoes home.

363
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,041
-And big peanuts!
-Okay!

364
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:33,418
Mangoes are for me.

365
00:29:34,043 --> 00:29:35,670
Make sure you visit!

366
00:29:35,753 --> 00:29:38,047
-Bye!
-Bye! Be careful!

367
00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:40,300
Drive safely!

368
00:29:47,223 --> 00:29:48,224
Bye!

369
00:29:54,814 --> 00:29:56,399
Why isn't she here yet?

370
00:30:01,195 --> 00:30:02,989
It's about time she came back.

371
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:07,827
Mi-seon!

372
00:30:09,913 --> 00:30:11,497
Hey, Beom.

373
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,374
You're back!

374
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:16,252
-We're back.
-It must've been exhausting.

375
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:19,172
-Was it a tough journey?
-No.

376
00:30:19,881 --> 00:30:23,134
-We had a good journey.
-You look so thin.

377
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:25,511
-Have you been well?
-Hey.

378
00:30:25,595 --> 00:30:28,264
-I'm home, Grandma.
-You're back, Mi-seon!

379
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:29,682
-Mi-seon!
-Hey.

380
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:32,602
-I got you a present.
-You did? Show me.

381
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,357
Did you miss me or not?

382
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,524
Did you or did you not?

383
00:30:39,484 --> 00:30:41,486
Let's see them.

384
00:30:42,612 --> 00:30:43,738
That's a lot.

385
00:30:43,821 --> 00:30:45,323
You got so many things.

386
00:30:45,406 --> 00:30:47,116
Why did you get so much stuff?
That's mine.

387
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,034
-No, mine.
-No.

388
00:30:48,117 --> 00:30:53,873
Does the US Army Base have
a lot of great things like these?

389
00:30:53,957 --> 00:30:56,459
This could look tacky
if the wrong person holds this.

390
00:30:56,542 --> 00:30:58,711
It looks good only on someone like me.

391
00:30:58,795 --> 00:31:01,130
Tae-poong has such good taste.

392
00:31:01,214 --> 00:31:03,758
-It's pretty.
-Hey, you.

393
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:06,010
Was this the best you could do?

394
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:09,889
What is this? It's blue!

395
00:31:09,973 --> 00:31:13,351
It makes me look like a ghost!
Didn't you see anything in pink or red?

396
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,646
Darn it. You're the worst.
Why did you get me this?

397
00:31:16,729 --> 00:31:18,523
-Thank you.
-It's tasty.

398
00:31:18,606 --> 00:31:20,233
Is there anything else?

399
00:31:20,316 --> 00:31:21,818
She's a ghost.

400
00:31:21,901 --> 00:31:24,070
-Stop it, ma'am.
-She's a ghost.

401
00:31:24,153 --> 00:31:26,698
-Mi-seon, what is this?
-What?

402
00:31:26,781 --> 00:31:29,867
You can wear it to work.
It looked comfortable.

403
00:31:30,451 --> 00:31:31,953
Darn it. Keep it for yourself.

404
00:31:32,036 --> 00:31:33,663
-This sucks.
-It's cute.

405
00:31:33,746 --> 00:31:36,082
It's pretty. I'm jealous of you, Mi-ho.

406
00:31:36,165 --> 00:31:37,125
-Here.
-You can keep it.

407
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:38,042
Grandma?

408
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,503
-Goodness, no.
-Eat this.

409
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:43,381
-Don't give it to me.
-The banana's delicious.

410
00:31:50,888 --> 00:31:52,765
Why isn't he home yet?

411
00:32:09,615 --> 00:32:11,284
It's so cramped.

412
00:32:11,367 --> 00:32:13,661
Beom, you said you'd sleep with Grandma.

413
00:32:13,745 --> 00:32:15,538
It's been so long
since we've seen Mi-seon.

414
00:32:20,209 --> 00:32:24,422
-I'm thirsty, Mi-ho.
-Be quiet and swallow your spit.

415
00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:27,133
Go to sleep.

416
00:32:51,991 --> 00:32:56,245
ACCOUNT BALANCE: 126,550 WON

417
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:44,502
CEO KANG JIN-YOUNG

418
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,422
REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

419
00:34:29,505 --> 00:34:32,758
CONTRACT AMOUNT: 70 MILLION WON
REMAINING BALANCE: 24 MILLION WON

420
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:42,476
CEO'S OFFICE

421
00:35:18,221 --> 00:35:19,555
I'll be back.

422
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:23,100
I promise.

423
00:35:55,591 --> 00:35:56,592
Watch out.

424
00:35:58,844 --> 00:36:00,846
-Stop pushing.
-Please don't push.

425
00:36:08,854 --> 00:36:10,898
EUROPE ALSO SUFFERS
FROM UNEMPLOYMENT CRISIS

426
00:36:10,982 --> 00:36:12,942
Stop looking at me and read the paper.

427
00:36:17,822 --> 00:36:18,739
Are you okay?

428
00:36:20,157 --> 00:36:22,702
Sure, I'm fine.

429
00:36:26,205 --> 00:36:27,331
-Watch it.
-Come on.

430
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,546
I'm sorry.

431
00:36:34,755 --> 00:36:36,841
-I'm sorry.
-Stop getting in.

432
00:36:36,924 --> 00:36:39,385
-I'm so sorry.
-Jeez.

433
00:36:45,474 --> 00:36:47,018
Except that we're standing too close.

434
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:12,084
Thank you.

435
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:15,171
-It's hot. Be careful.
-It's surely hot.

436
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:17,465
-Thank you.
-Sure.

437
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:22,636
Eat up.

438
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,805
-It's so hot.
-Is it?

439
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:30,853
What is it?

440
00:37:35,483 --> 00:37:36,984
-Your lips.
-Right.

441
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:38,402
-Your lips.
-Is something on it?

442
00:37:39,195 --> 00:37:40,404
Thank you.

443
00:37:45,951 --> 00:37:46,952
It's so hot.

444
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:53,626
-Oh, my.
-My gosh.

445
00:37:55,002 --> 00:37:56,128
Why did you…

446
00:37:58,297 --> 00:38:01,217
Why did you pull out the straw?

447
00:38:02,718 --> 00:38:04,011
You can wipe it now.

448
00:38:05,304 --> 00:38:07,014
-Is it in my nose?
-No, you're fine.

449
00:38:09,266 --> 00:38:11,102
-Be careful.
-Okay.

450
00:38:18,192 --> 00:38:19,026
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

451
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,653
-Thank you.
-Bye.

452
00:38:23,364 --> 00:38:24,365
Wait, Ms. Oh.

453
00:38:25,324 --> 00:38:26,450
We aren't going there.

454
00:38:28,077 --> 00:38:30,579
-We aren't going to work?
-Well, we are.

455
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:34,166
-But we aren't going in that direction.
-What?

456
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,294
-Our office is this way.
-No, we're over here.

457
00:38:38,087 --> 00:38:39,130
What?

458
00:38:41,549 --> 00:38:43,134
What have you done now?

459
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:56,355
Stand right there.

460
00:39:00,568 --> 00:39:02,987
Oh, my gosh, Mr. Kang.

461
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,948
What is this?

462
00:39:06,031 --> 00:39:08,033
-The thing is--
-What?

463
00:39:08,701 --> 00:39:09,827
Hey, over here.

464
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,621
You just sent me a random address.
What is this?

465
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:15,541
-Hello, Mr. Bae.
-Hey.

466
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:19,545
Allow me to present Typhoon Trading.

467
00:39:26,594 --> 00:39:28,762
I'm not really into fried chicken.

468
00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:30,931
Why did you call him?

469
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:33,517
I was raised with good food,
so palm oil doesn't work with me.

470
00:39:34,393 --> 00:39:36,937
Wipe that margarine off your face first.

471
00:39:39,565 --> 00:39:41,317
Anyway, let's go inside.

472
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,359
-Okay.
-All right.

473
00:39:42,443 --> 00:39:44,487
TYPHOON TRADING

474
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:09,970
This is Typhoon Trading version 2.0.

475
00:40:10,054 --> 00:40:12,932
Mr. Kang, when did you make this decision?

476
00:40:16,143 --> 00:40:17,394
It started in Thailand.

477
00:40:19,355 --> 00:40:23,067
Things were too hectic back then,
so I didn't get a chance to tell you.

478
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:27,655
And our team wasn't in good spirits.

479
00:40:29,615 --> 00:40:30,616
Also,

480
00:40:32,284 --> 00:40:36,705
I needed some money
to handle my responsibilities as the CEO.

481
00:40:41,126 --> 00:40:44,588
But because I made you move here
without discussing this beforehand,

482
00:40:45,422 --> 00:40:46,549
I am very sorry…

483
00:40:50,052 --> 00:40:50,970
about that matter.

484
00:40:51,762 --> 00:40:53,222
-No.
-It's okay.

485
00:40:54,473 --> 00:40:56,600
Is there something on the floor?

486
00:40:56,684 --> 00:40:57,810
-The floor?
-What's that?

487
00:40:57,893 --> 00:41:02,565
If you think about it, we couldn't afford
an office like that in our situation.

488
00:41:02,648 --> 00:41:04,525
Please stop, Mr. Kang.

489
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:08,028
It's not like we'll stick around here
for a long time, right?

490
00:41:08,112 --> 00:41:11,824
Of course not.
We'll go back to our office.

491
00:41:11,907 --> 00:41:14,159
-Yes, of course.
-Yes.

492
00:41:14,702 --> 00:41:16,996
Was this previously a pub?

493
00:41:17,705 --> 00:41:21,709
It was a pub my friend ran,
but he's taking some time off.

494
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:24,837
So, we're using this for the time being.

495
00:41:25,796 --> 00:41:26,964
It has running water, right?

496
00:41:27,047 --> 00:41:29,758
Of course, it does.
It has electricity too.

497
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,928
The Internet modem works as well.

498
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,514
Are you all right?

499
00:41:39,351 --> 00:41:40,894
It's working fine.

500
00:41:42,396 --> 00:41:43,606
Did they move out in a hurry?

501
00:41:44,607 --> 00:41:47,693
Look at this place.
We could start frying chicken now.

502
00:41:49,486 --> 00:41:54,617
MOMO'S PUB

503
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,703
-Let's do this!
-Go!

504
00:41:57,786 --> 00:41:59,038
All right!

505
00:42:07,671 --> 00:42:09,840
-Careful with your back.
-Let's go!

506
00:42:10,674 --> 00:42:12,343
-Be careful.
-Careful.

507
00:42:12,426 --> 00:42:13,761
-All right!
-Be careful.

508
00:42:13,844 --> 00:42:15,387
Is it that heavy?

509
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:17,181
Now, let's move this.

510
00:42:17,264 --> 00:42:18,390
MONTHLY SCHEDULE AND PLANNER

511
00:42:24,605 --> 00:42:25,814
Is this okay?

512
00:42:27,107 --> 00:42:29,026
-Put it this way.
-Turn it around.

513
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:30,861
No, go the other way.

514
00:42:30,944 --> 00:42:32,613
-The other way?
-Wait, no. I'm sorry.

515
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:41,830
We're almost done.

516
00:42:42,665 --> 00:42:43,540
All done.

517
00:42:43,624 --> 00:42:46,502
THE CONTACT

518
00:42:46,585 --> 00:42:47,544
CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST

519
00:43:05,729 --> 00:43:07,356
Has anybody been watering this?

520
00:43:08,232 --> 00:43:13,946
That was Mr. Koo's duty,
but no one else did it once he left.

521
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:17,408
-Does that beer machine work?
-It does.

522
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:20,994
Does it work?

523
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,208
-What?
-This is awesome.

524
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:27,501
What are you doing?

525
00:43:28,544 --> 00:43:32,089
-What do you think you're doing?
-I wanted to test it and see if it worked.

526
00:43:32,172 --> 00:43:35,676
Why would you test that?
Of course, it'll work once it's plugged.

527
00:43:36,468 --> 00:43:38,554
-Jeez.
-Okay. I'll be careful from now on.

528
00:43:38,637 --> 00:43:41,181
Please do. We have to save on everything.

529
00:43:41,265 --> 00:43:45,978
I mean, we can grab a glass of beer
from time to time while we work now.

530
00:43:48,605 --> 00:43:49,982
MOMO'S PUB

531
00:43:50,858 --> 00:43:51,900
These two…

532
00:43:56,071 --> 00:43:58,198
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hey, you're here.

533
00:43:58,282 --> 00:44:00,701
-These two are for you, right?
-That's right.

534
00:44:01,326 --> 00:44:02,703
-Thank you.
-Sure.

535
00:44:16,717 --> 00:44:19,094
-How much is this, ma'am?
-Yes?

536
00:44:20,804 --> 00:44:23,348
Why? Do you want one for yourself?

537
00:44:23,432 --> 00:44:24,391
What?

538
00:44:25,476 --> 00:44:27,060
You have such a cute smile.

539
00:44:29,229 --> 00:44:30,230
Take it.

540
00:44:30,314 --> 00:44:31,690
-You're giving it for free?
-Sure.

541
00:44:31,774 --> 00:44:32,941
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

542
00:44:33,025 --> 00:44:34,193
Thank you.

543
00:44:34,276 --> 00:44:36,069
-Thank you.
-Here. Take this.

544
00:44:39,782 --> 00:44:41,825
-Goodbye, then.
-Bye.

545
00:44:44,578 --> 00:44:49,166
I thought it would look shabby,
but it turned out to be a decent office.

546
00:44:49,249 --> 00:44:51,585
It looks rather cozy.

547
00:44:51,668 --> 00:44:54,880
What about the kitchen?
Should we use it as a meeting room?

548
00:44:54,963 --> 00:44:57,799
My friend wanted to use it,
so he asked us to leave it alone.

549
00:45:04,223 --> 00:45:06,266
We have a freeloader now?

550
00:45:07,684 --> 00:45:11,146
Did you call me a freeloader?
The lease is in my name.

551
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:13,065
What is this, Tae-poong?

552
00:45:13,148 --> 00:45:15,067
You said you'd only use half.

553
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,861
We're paying 50-50, but you want me
to be locked up in the kitchen?

554
00:45:17,945 --> 00:45:19,571
-We're paying 50-50?
-I guess so.

555
00:45:19,655 --> 00:45:21,657
Hey, push this over.

556
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:25,494
Then you can come out.
We have extra seats, no doubt!

557
00:45:25,577 --> 00:45:27,621
Stop talking nonsense
and draw the halfway line.

558
00:45:27,704 --> 00:45:28,997
-Push it!
-Hold on.

559
00:45:29,081 --> 00:45:30,666
Let's do this, then.

560
00:45:30,749 --> 00:45:32,543
Give him a hug!

561
00:45:32,626 --> 00:45:34,753
-What are you doing?
-Okay. Welcome!

562
00:45:34,836 --> 00:45:36,964
Welcome to Typhoon Family.

563
00:45:37,047 --> 00:45:38,048
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

564
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:39,550
-Welcome!
-I'm glad you're here.

565
00:45:40,676 --> 00:45:42,219
-How endearing.
-Welcome.

566
00:45:42,844 --> 00:45:44,096
I'll turn on the light!

567
00:45:45,764 --> 00:45:47,599
TYPHOON TRADING
MOMO'S PUB

568
00:45:49,184 --> 00:45:51,019
It's hard to make out both.

569
00:45:51,103 --> 00:45:53,272
"Momo's Typhoon Trading."

570
00:45:54,189 --> 00:45:56,191
-Turn it off.
-Turn it off?

571
00:45:58,694 --> 00:46:00,779
This way, you can see both.

572
00:46:07,286 --> 00:46:08,370
This way.

573
00:46:15,252 --> 00:46:16,920
See? I told you.

574
00:46:17,004 --> 00:46:18,130
They're done for good.

575
00:46:49,077 --> 00:46:51,622
"Notice of Office Relocation."

576
00:46:52,497 --> 00:46:53,957
I'm telling you they're done.

577
00:46:54,791 --> 00:46:57,169
We aren't done.
This is just the beginning.

578
00:46:58,545 --> 00:47:01,256
The beginning of your suffering.

579
00:47:07,262 --> 00:47:09,181
Aren't you hot? Have something cold.

580
00:47:12,309 --> 00:47:13,560
My back hurts.

581
00:47:22,903 --> 00:47:25,155
-Hey, cheers.
-Cheers.

582
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:31,995
-Oh, man.
-How's your mother?

583
00:47:33,121 --> 00:47:34,414
What happened?

584
00:47:35,999 --> 00:47:38,043
It was human marketing.

585
00:47:38,126 --> 00:47:39,503
In other words, a pyramid scheme.

586
00:47:41,129 --> 00:47:45,676
My dear Ms. Kim Eul-nyeo reached
the Sapphire tier with our mortgage money.

587
00:47:47,594 --> 00:47:52,849
Everyone who reached the jewel tier
was crying together in that office.

588
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:56,937
They were Ruby, Sapphire,
and Diamond tiers.

589
00:47:58,438 --> 00:47:59,856
Doesn't it sound like a fairy tale?

590
00:48:01,525 --> 00:48:04,027
It must've been upsetting, Nam-mo.

591
00:48:04,111 --> 00:48:06,279
It's not something
for me to be upset about.

592
00:48:07,614 --> 00:48:09,074
It's my mom who's struggling.

593
00:48:11,243 --> 00:48:12,244
My mom

594
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:14,621
held my hand and cried.

595
00:48:17,624 --> 00:48:18,792
She said she was sorry.

596
00:48:22,295 --> 00:48:24,881
But, Tae-poong,
I'm not going down like this.

597
00:48:26,883 --> 00:48:28,176
I'm the head of my household.

598
00:48:29,052 --> 00:48:31,096
-I'll live a diligent life.
-Of course.

599
00:48:31,805 --> 00:48:33,724
Although I'm not sure
what your mom's thinking.

600
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:37,477
Also, I'm seeing someone.

601
00:48:37,561 --> 00:48:40,230
Of course. Although I'm not sure
how that woman feels…

602
00:48:41,606 --> 00:48:43,316
What? Who is she?

603
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,027
There's this woman,
the prettiest woman you know.

604
00:48:47,404 --> 00:48:52,325
She reminds me of an adorable deer
that drinks from a spring in a mountain

605
00:48:52,409 --> 00:48:56,538
or a girl who lives in the Alps,
just 4,000 m above sea level.

606
00:48:56,621 --> 00:48:58,081
Anyway, she's that pretty.

607
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:01,668
Why, you! Is it Ms. Oh?

608
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:03,879
She's more like a tigress from Jirisan!

609
00:49:03,962 --> 00:49:06,798
Then who is this girl
who resembles the deer in the Alps?

610
00:49:06,882 --> 00:49:10,010
Hey, go back to your job!
What do you know about love?

611
00:49:10,093 --> 00:49:12,137
I can never tell what women are thinking.

612
00:49:12,804 --> 00:49:15,182
You're just a fool
who only knows how to export.

613
00:49:18,435 --> 00:49:19,644
I mean…

614
00:49:21,772 --> 00:49:23,482
Don't you start dating after a kiss?

615
00:49:23,565 --> 00:49:25,567
Are you out of your mind?
You need to marry her!

616
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:27,235
-Right?
-Who did you kiss?

617
00:49:27,861 --> 00:49:30,322
-What?
-Why didn't you tell me? Who was it?

618
00:49:30,405 --> 00:49:31,823
Is she pretty?

619
00:49:34,618 --> 00:49:37,496
-Yes.
-Who is it? Tell me.

620
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:43,835
It can't be. Not the tigress from Jirisan.

621
00:49:45,587 --> 00:49:46,546
Is it her?

622
00:49:47,297 --> 00:49:48,131
Yes.

623
00:49:49,257 --> 00:49:51,134
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

624
00:49:51,218 --> 00:49:52,969
Man, this is crazy!

625
00:49:54,012 --> 00:49:55,138
This is impossible.

626
00:50:03,063 --> 00:50:03,897
Ms. Oh.

627
00:50:08,276 --> 00:50:10,278
Right. Thank you.

628
00:50:17,577 --> 00:50:19,204
-Mi-seon.
-Yes?

629
00:50:21,915 --> 00:50:22,916
Here, have some tea.

630
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:25,210
Thank you.

631
00:50:27,754 --> 00:50:30,507
What's going on?
Why do you two look so close?

632
00:50:31,091 --> 00:50:32,968
Actually, we are--

633
00:50:33,051 --> 00:50:34,970
I came down with a cold.

634
00:50:36,847 --> 00:50:38,682
Don't cough at me.
I don't want to catch it.

635
00:50:39,683 --> 00:50:40,851
I'm sorry.

636
00:50:42,602 --> 00:50:44,437
You're coughing? Then…

637
00:50:53,321 --> 00:50:55,490
I didn't know she caught a cold.

638
00:50:56,783 --> 00:50:58,368
Wait a second, Ms. Oh.

639
00:50:58,994 --> 00:51:00,912
Let me get this from now on.

640
00:51:00,996 --> 00:51:01,955
Huh? Why?

641
00:51:02,038 --> 00:51:04,124
Ms. Oh? That doesn't sound right.

642
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:07,878
-What should I call you?
-What do you mean?

643
00:51:09,212 --> 00:51:10,171
I mean,

644
00:51:11,673 --> 00:51:13,216
we're now dating, so…

645
00:51:15,218 --> 00:51:16,303
Mr. Kang.

646
00:51:17,053 --> 00:51:19,681
When did we say we'd start dating?

647
00:51:21,141 --> 00:51:23,977
Last night, we kissed…

648
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,855
The kiss?

649
00:51:26,938 --> 00:51:28,023
It's not that…

650
00:51:28,106 --> 00:51:33,820
People don't start dating
just because it happened once.

651
00:51:33,904 --> 00:51:36,448
We don't do that in this day and age.

652
00:51:36,531 --> 00:51:38,283
Then why did you kiss me?

653
00:51:39,743 --> 00:51:42,454
-Were you toying with me?
-No, it's not that.

654
00:51:42,537 --> 00:51:43,747
Are you coming?

655
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:46,458
-Should I do all the work?
-I'm coming.

656
00:51:47,584 --> 00:51:49,836
-We'll talk later.
-Wait a second.

657
00:51:52,672 --> 00:51:55,884
What about staying by my side?

658
00:52:02,182 --> 00:52:05,352
What do you mean?
We're together at work and at home.

659
00:52:07,979 --> 00:52:09,689
We should talk again later.

660
00:52:09,773 --> 00:52:11,358
We're running late.

661
00:52:14,361 --> 00:52:16,029
He didn't even ask me out,

662
00:52:16,112 --> 00:52:19,741
so why does he suddenly think
that we're dating?

663
00:52:24,871 --> 00:52:27,582
Yes, I get it. I know the answer.

664
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:29,376
She doesn't like you.

665
00:52:30,043 --> 00:52:32,420
-Then why did she kiss me?
-Why do you chew gum?

666
00:52:32,504 --> 00:52:36,132
-Because I get bored.
-That's exactly it. You know the answer.

667
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,843
Hey, you're way too slow.

668
00:52:38,927 --> 00:52:41,304
No, it wasn't like that.

669
00:52:41,388 --> 00:52:42,681
Jeez. You and your pride.

670
00:52:43,348 --> 00:52:45,684
Goodness gracious. Hold on.

671
00:52:45,767 --> 00:52:46,810
What time is it?

672
00:52:47,435 --> 00:52:48,853
Wait, did you buy a cell phone?

673
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:51,481
Don't you have one?

674
00:52:51,564 --> 00:52:54,859
You should get one.
How can you run a business without it?

675
00:52:54,943 --> 00:52:56,611
Right. I have to go to your place today.

676
00:52:56,695 --> 00:52:58,530
-My place? Why?
-Right? Why am I going?

677
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:00,782
Oh, it's to hang out with you.

678
00:53:00,865 --> 00:53:02,534
-With me?
-Yes, I'll go there first.

679
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:04,202
Bye.

680
00:53:08,456 --> 00:53:09,416
With me?

I prefer memories over records.

687
00:55:34,227 --> 00:55:36,062
Let's hang out, Tae-poong!

688
00:55:38,481 --> 00:55:39,399
Hello.

689
00:55:39,482 --> 00:55:41,568
Who's that?

690
00:55:43,027 --> 00:55:44,696
Tae-poong said he'd be late.

691
00:55:44,779 --> 00:55:46,114
Really?

692
00:55:46,865 --> 00:55:48,283
That's weird.

693
00:55:50,577 --> 00:55:53,204
I even brought some clothes for him.

694
00:55:53,997 --> 00:55:57,792
I said I didn't want to buy them.
Why do you keep bothering me?

695
00:55:58,793 --> 00:56:00,670
I got some for you too.

696
00:56:01,462 --> 00:56:06,092
-Have you had dinner?
-No, I actually haven't eaten dinner.

697
00:56:07,177 --> 00:56:09,429
-What is that?
-I'll show you later.

698
00:56:09,512 --> 00:56:10,722
Goodness.

699
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:14,893
Wang Nam-mo.

700
00:56:19,189 --> 00:56:21,608
Goodness, Mr. Wang.

701
00:56:21,691 --> 00:56:28,531
You're even good at doing chores.
You're rather decent for a man.

702
00:56:30,408 --> 00:56:32,368
I'll cook you a delicious meal, ma'am.

703
00:56:38,082 --> 00:56:41,169
-You look great, Grandma.
-Yes, it looks great on you.

704
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,173
You look so cute. How adorable.

705
00:56:45,256 --> 00:56:47,091
-This is nice.
-How cute.

706
00:56:47,175 --> 00:56:49,594
I don't think these are right for me.

707
00:56:49,677 --> 00:56:51,888
Hey, Beom. Don't you
know anything about hip-hop?

708
00:56:51,971 --> 00:56:54,098
I don't. How is this called hip-hop?

709
00:56:54,182 --> 00:56:56,517
You should thank him
for the thought. Sit down.

710
00:56:56,601 --> 00:56:59,354
Okay. Fine. Thank you.

711
00:56:59,437 --> 00:57:03,608
I don't see anything
that Tae-poong can wear.

712
00:57:06,152 --> 00:57:07,403
Goodness.

713
00:57:07,487 --> 00:57:10,782
-Are these mine?
-Yes, they're yours.

714
00:57:10,865 --> 00:57:13,284
Thank you so much.
I can't wait to wear them.

715
00:57:13,368 --> 00:57:15,119
I thought you were with Mr. Kang.

716
00:57:15,662 --> 00:57:17,038
What? We left together.

717
00:57:18,164 --> 00:57:20,625
Mi-seon. I got you some too.

718
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:23,753
This floral pattern
is the most popular in Dongdaemun now.

719
00:57:23,836 --> 00:57:25,588
Give me those.

720
00:57:25,672 --> 00:57:27,757
-Those are mine.
-Yes, give them to her.

721
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,925
Yes, these are yours.

722
00:57:29,008 --> 00:57:31,302
-These look warm.
-These are tights.

723
00:57:31,386 --> 00:57:32,762
-Yes, they're tights.
-Yes.

724
00:57:32,845 --> 00:57:35,557
-You got socks and pants.
-These are for Mi-seon.

725
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,142
Here you go. Thank you for the food.

726
00:57:38,226 --> 00:57:39,769
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

727
00:57:39,852 --> 00:57:41,229
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

728
00:57:42,063 --> 00:57:43,565
Grandma, go ahead.

729
00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:49,529
-Have some rice.
-Watch it.

730
00:57:49,612 --> 00:57:52,282
Beom, is that how you were raised?

731
00:57:53,074 --> 00:57:54,867
-Come on.
-Eat some more.

732
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:58,830
-Make sure to chew carefully.
-Goodness.

733
00:57:58,913 --> 00:58:00,665
-Have this, Beom.
-Goodness.

734
00:58:00,748 --> 00:58:03,042
It's nice to eat with many people.

00:58:18,474 --> 00:58:19,309
Tell me.

738
00:58:23,187 --> 00:58:24,314
Where is it?

739
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:28,484
Did she accept it?

740
00:58:28,568 --> 00:58:30,737
She said she'll think about it.

741
00:58:32,113 --> 00:58:37,118
Now that she has accepted it,
her heart is bound to follow.

CEO KANG JIN-YOUNG

745
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:27,251
It's not so bad here, is it?

746
00:59:29,379 --> 00:59:31,506
It's our first day,
so let's stay together.

747
00:59:40,264 --> 00:59:43,017
There's way too much work to do.

748
00:59:51,818 --> 00:59:57,740
Man, he was such a meticulous person.

749
01:00:00,034 --> 01:00:01,661
Every inch is covered.

750
01:00:05,998 --> 01:00:07,959
ACCOUNT BOOK, 1989

751
01:00:08,626 --> 01:00:10,628
Year 1989.

752
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:18,010
AUGUST

753
01:00:21,222 --> 01:00:23,141
August 11th.

754
01:00:25,184 --> 01:00:28,938
August 17th, 18th, 19th.

755
01:00:32,358 --> 01:00:35,027
Did he rip out the next page
because there were errors?

756
01:00:59,469 --> 01:01:00,970
Where's my IOU?

757
01:01:02,597 --> 01:01:03,931
My promissory note.

758
01:01:06,017 --> 01:01:07,894
I can't find it.

759
01:01:20,031 --> 01:01:21,657
End-of-the-day mark.

760
01:01:23,367 --> 01:01:24,744
This is crossed out.

761
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,039
"Data entry error. Next page."

762
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:33,419
So, he would never rip out a page
even if he made errors.

763
01:01:38,841 --> 01:01:40,635
Year 1989.

764
01:01:43,471 --> 01:01:44,806
Why is this page gone?

765
01:01:57,401 --> 01:02:01,948

01:02:53,165 --> 01:02:55,376
What exactly do you want to do?

769
01:02:55,459 --> 01:02:57,378
A totally safe government project.

770
01:02:57,461 --> 01:03:00,423
It would've been better
if Mr. Koo was here.

771
01:03:00,506 --> 01:03:03,217
"The king of darkness
will descend upon this world."

772
01:03:03,301 --> 01:03:04,135
Hey, Mr. Koo.

773
01:03:04,218 --> 01:03:05,094
Stop it! Stop!

774
01:03:05,177 --> 01:03:08,180
I've lost my way,
so don't look for me again.

775
01:03:08,264 --> 01:03:10,808
I don't want to be dependent
on emotional comfort.

776
01:03:10,892 --> 01:03:13,519
Let's keep our focus
on work matters. Nothing more.

777
01:03:13,603 --> 01:03:17,064
If there are multiple bidders,
it goes to a competitive bid.

778
01:03:17,148 --> 01:03:19,233
We have to win this project.

779
01:03:19,317 --> 01:03:20,151
Please help us.

780
01:03:20,902 --> 01:03:22,111
Please help Typhoon Trading.
