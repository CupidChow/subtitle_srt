TYPHOON TRADING

3
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,322
What on earth?

4
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,950
What?

5
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,037
Mr. Kang?

6
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,959
Mr. Kang?

7
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:26,836
Mr. Kang.

8
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,963
Mr. Kang!

9
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,715
- Oh, my gosh!
- My goodness!

10
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,217
You scared me!

11
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,345
- Are you okay?
- Who are you?

12
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,263
Hello.

13
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,601
Mom, I can't turn my neck! I'm paralyzed!

14
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,062
- What?
- My neck!

15
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:47,190
- Mom! Help me!
- What do we do?

16
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,734
You're lying on your side, Mr. Kang.

17
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,402
You're on your side.

18
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,780
You're not paralyzed.
He's fine. Calm down.

19
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,657
He's all right. Please calm down.

20
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,283
He's fine.

21
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,249
You scared me.

22
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,127
Why are you here?

23
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,712
Why are you here instead of at your home?

24
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,589
- Hello.
- Good morning.

25
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,758
- This is my mom.
- Hello.

26
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,844
Good morning.

27
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:19,222
What are you two doing here?

28
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,558
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

29
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,522
Are you all right?

30
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,985
I'm wearing it backwards.

31
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,659
I'm telling you, we're okay, Ms. Oh.

32
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,161
We're okay.

33
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,831
- Do you have someplace to stay?
- No.

34
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,541
I'll find one.

35
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,293
- What about money?
- I don't have any.

36
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,005
Wait, I do. Remember the fabric we sold?

37
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,841
- Mr. Kang.
- Yes?

38
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,802
If you touch that, it's embezzlement.
Don't say that.

39
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,263
Why? I'm the one who sold it.

40
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,391
Shall we go, then?

41
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:06,895
Right.

42
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,067
- Ms. Oh, right?
- Yes.

43
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,696
You're smart, just like my husband said.

44
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,660
- We won't cause any trouble. Thank you.
- Yes, of course.

45
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,162
Mom.

46
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,456
Stop acting tough and just come along.

47
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,293
- Are you done with that?
- Yes.

48
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,711
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

49
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,134
Come along.

50
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,564
Throw it gently, okay? Good.

51
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,066
We're almost there.

52
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,114
She said that several times.

53
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,616
- We're almost there.
- Okay.

54
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,701
- It's right up ahead.
- Are you okay?

55
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,955
- We're nearly there.
- All right.

56
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:27,767
Is this the place?

57
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,936
Maybe not.

58
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,275
Right this way.

59
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,409
Watch your step. Please come in.

60
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,831
I can't believe there are
still houses like this around.

61
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,207
That scared me.

62
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,793
This is my little brother.
Say hello, Beom.

63
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,504
Hello, I'm Oh Beom
from Changjeon Elementary School.

64
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,716
I'm student number 47
in the first grade, Class 11.

65
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,386
- I see.
- Who is it?

66
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,388
This is my younger sister.

67
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,099
- Just go.
- What's going on?

68
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,686
- Is he your secret lover?
- How vulgar…

69
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:17,233
- No, absolutely not.
- No, we're not like that.

70
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,029
Do you know how to spin a top?

71
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,282
- Can you make it jump? Attack?
- Attack what?

72
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,825
Don't eat that booger.

73
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,246
Is someone here?

74
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,798
Are you Gap-sik's father?

75
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,051
My dear!

76
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,636
My goodness.

77
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,765
My goodness.

78
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,267
He's not Gap-sik's father.

79
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,980
Who's Gap-sik's father, anyway?

80
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,940
Oh Gap-sik is our dad.

81
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,904
You're finally home.
Is the war finally over?

82
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:07,033
- The war?
- Do you know how long I've waited for you?

83
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,203
- Gap-sik has grown so much.
- Grandma.

84
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:15,041
Don't be ridiculous, Grandma.
They don't look anything alike.

85
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,461
You should go back inside, Grandma.
I'll make you scorched rice.

86
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,379
- Scorched rice.
- Sounds good.

87
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,382
I'll make you some. Get some rest.

88
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,134
<i>- Animal Quiz Show</i> is on.
- Go on in.

89
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,097
We have an empty room
over there by the door.

90
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,599
You said you were
going to let me have that room!

91
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,477
You said you didn't want to pay for coal!

92
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,812
Please come inside.

93
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,897
- The entrance is a bit--
- I'm late again!

94
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,566
After all that complaining
about coal prices…

95
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,569
Then tell them to pay for the coal!

96
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,031
Is this a good idea?

97
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,922
I'm confused.

98
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,469
I thought they didn't close down,
but no one's here.

99
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,441
I mean…

100
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,611
Aside from the hat, I don't look so bad.

101
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,841
Did you only pack clothes?
The closet is about to collapse.

102
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:50,970
- You said to pack the pricey stuff.
- They don't even fit inside.

103
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,139
You take after me in things like this too.

104
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,809
They even have a TV here.

105
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,230
I can't believe
they still have TVs like this.

106
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,940
Why isn't it working?

107
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,317
- Let me try.
- What do I do?

108
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,485
Watch out.

109
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,779
- Be careful with your hand.
<i>- …at 29.5%.</i>

110
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,198
It's working.

111
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,076
<i>Pusan Port, the shining beacon</i>
<i>of Korea's export industry.</i>

112
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,872
<i>Even in the piercing wind, sweat rolls</i>
<i>down the faces of export workers.</i>

113
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,791
At least the blankets here are clean.

114
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:25,630
They say sleeping on the floor like this

115
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,302
is better for your back than using a bed.

116
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,512
You're right.

117
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:37,058
- It's been years since I've done this.
- Seriously.

118
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,895
- It's nice.
- It's really nice.

119
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,440
- I feel so much better now.
- Me too.

120
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:48,027
But it looks like
they don't have any parents.

121
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,283
- Grandma?
- Yes?

122
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,078
Why did you call that guy your husband?

123
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,164
They said my husband was

124
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:05,753
taken during the war and died in battle.

125
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:11,175
I was 22 years old at the time.

126
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:17,640
He was 23 years old,
and my Gap-sik was four years old.

127
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,143
All three of us were really young.

128
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:27,441
My sweet grandson.
You must be happy to meet your dad.

129
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,363
- So, that guy is my dad.
- Yes.

130
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,949
Then who's the lady?

131
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:41,038
I haven't heard a word from your mom.

132
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,709
That's why I've been
taking care of this family until now.

133
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,252
That means

134
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,338
I have both a mom and a dad now.

135
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,031
The wind feels cold.

136
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,593
MOMO'S PUB

137
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,470
Are you serious right now?

138
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,181
Why do I have to wear it?
I can just hold it.

139
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,226
You need to wear it so it can stand out.

140
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,479
This is what we're paying you for.

141
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,481
You can get lost if you don't want to.

142
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,775
But you'll have to compensate us.

143
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,569
Fine.

144
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,157
Could've saved me the trouble.

145
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,577
MOMO'S PUB

146
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,830
You win! Congratulations.

147
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,207
- Here's your prize.
- I won fifth place?

148
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,960
Tissues? That's it?

149
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,923
Hold on a minute. Let me try again.

150
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,509
Sorry, but you only get one chance.

151
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,761
You can if you order
another bottle of soju.

152
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,015
One more bottle of soju! You happy now?

153
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,852
How come he gets to touch?

154
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,438
- Let me try too.
- You can't touch this.

155
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,649
- You use this to enter the event.
- Come on.

156
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,984
- Come on.
- This is…

157
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,486
- Let me spin it!
- Oh, my goodness. Stop it!

158
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:20,489
Stop right there!

159
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,168
Please sit. Take a seat.

160
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,295
Are you okay?

161
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,213
Yes.

162
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,299
Can I take that roulette for a minute?

163
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,593
Sure.

164
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,888
Thank you.

165
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,891
Okay, let's continue with the event!

166
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,809
Spin it! Go ahead!

167
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,687
- Spin it.
- Come on, spin it.

168
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,939
Spin it!

169
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,358
That's third place!

170
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,070
You won third place. Here's your prize.

171
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:04,575
We have something really amazing left.

172
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,660
I found it. Here.

173
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,996
One, two, three.

174
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,292
You bastards.
How dare you touch a woman like that?

175
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,337
Come here, you.

176
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:21,050
If you get caught doing this again,
you're dead meat.

177
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,635
- Got it?
- Yes.

178
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,677
I ought to…

179
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,639
Hey.

180
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,433
Grab this bastard.

181
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,647
Do something!

182
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,742
You bastard!

183
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,410
You little…

184
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,164
Tae kwon do!

185
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,423
Is she crying?

186
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,596
That stings.

187
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,766
- Please be gentle.
- You crybaby.

188
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,568
Why did you get involved
when you can't even fight?

189
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,153
How could I just ignore that?

190
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:27,533
Perverts who grope women
need to be taught a lesson.

191
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,286
Guys like that are everywhere.

192
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,581
I'm not like that.
I can't stand that kind of stuff.

193
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,254
I won't even get paid today
because of you.

194
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,966
I'm sorry about that.
I'll pay you back sometime.

195
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,429
I grilled this pollack. It's good, right?

196
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,306
Woman No. 1.

197
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,933
What?

198
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,227
I'm Man No. 2, Wang Nam-mo.

199
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,437
Call me "Wang," as in king.

200
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,900
- From <i>Studio I Love You--</i>
- How have you been?

201
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,485
I didn't know you worked here.

202
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,862
I fry the chicken.

203
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,780
What a small world.

204
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,659
BANK TRANSFER FORM

205
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:22,463
RECIPIENT: SHOE PARK
SENDER: TYPHOON TRADING

206
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,886
Hello.

207
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,055
Here you go.

208
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,810
- Did you transfer the money to Shoe Park?
- Yes.

209
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,395
What's that?

210
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,606
This is…

211
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,859
Here, I printed
some safety-related documents.

212
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,985
SAFETY EQUIPMENT DEMAND

213
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,404
- I've already received these.
- What?

214
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,324
That's just basic for a trader.

215
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,747
If I'd known, we would've
just gone to the market instead.

216
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,874
- The market?
- Yes.

217
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,128
There's a specialty shoe store
in Dongdaemun,

218
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,173
so I thought I'd take a look
for market research.

219
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,633
That's a good idea.

220
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,511
I looked into it,

221
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,597
and safety shoes aren't just worn
on construction sites.

222
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,475
They're used in manufacturing,
chemical plants,

223
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,687
and places like disaster sites too.

224
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,357
That's great. We should go
check it out sometime.

225
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,360
- It's slippery, so be careful.
- Right back at you.

226
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,451
- What happened?
- What?

227
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,747
- Let's go back to--
- Yes, before rush hour begins.

228
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,003
I had no idea you already printed these.

229
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,221
Oh, my.

230
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,393
Hey, Beom. Why aren't you in school?

231
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:04,106
- I woke up late.
- What do you mean you woke up late?

232
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,776
Hurry up and get ready
so you can go to school.

233
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,903
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

234
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:14,783
Dear.

235
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,577
Me?

236
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,080
- Where's my son?
- He's not your son.

237
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,793
I'm hungry. Go cook something.

238
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,836
Me?

239
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,717
Excuse me, miss.

240
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,178
Your brother and grandmother
need something.

241
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,306
Just leave them. They'll figure it out.

242
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,392
What do you mean?

243
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,685
How will they do it?

244
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,200
Whatever.

245
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,410
I'm not part of their family.

246
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,834
Come here, doggy.

247
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,088
How do you want your coffee?

248
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,132
- Cream and sugar?
- I'll do it.

249
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,718
- No, I'll do it.
- No.

250
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,762
No, step back.

251
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,306
How do you want it?

252
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,434
Two spoons of sugar and cream, please.

253
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,236
Wait, what are you doing?

254
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,114
What are you doing?
The order is coffee, sugar, and cream.

255
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:39,118
- It's coffee, cream, and sugar.
- No, we've always done it this way.

256
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,536
Look.

257
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,454
Coffee.

258
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,000
Sugar.

259
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,337
Add cream like this.

260
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,047
That's my hand, by the way.

261
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,554
I was just showing you
how we usually make it.

262
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,389
Like that?

263
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,768
- The water's boiling!
- I'll get it!

264
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,441
You'll burn yourself.

265
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,027
That thing is really hot.

266
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,697
It's boiling.

267
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,991
- You can't touch it with your bare hands.
- Right.

268
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:22,161
- Go sit down. I'll bring it.
- Okay, thanks.

269
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:43,265
How about we visit construction companies
and project sites around Seoul?

270
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,976
- I'm sorting the clients.
- Sounds good.

271
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,228
We'll be on the road a lot.

272
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:53,400
You know how important
business etiquette is for traders, right?

273
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,818
I did a bit of studying.

274
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,780
I came prepared too, of course.

275
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,616
Here's how to present a business card.

276
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,075
Watch carefully.

277
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,497
The visitor offers it first.

278
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:12,294
They hand it with both hands,
so the name is visible.

279
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,297
Hello, I'm Kang Tae-poong
from Typhoon Trading.

280
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:17,841
Nice job. Well done.

281
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,595
But apparently handshakes
are the opposite.

282
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,681
It's polite for the higher-ranking person
to offer first.

283
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,601
- Okay, let's try it.
- Okay.

284
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,064
Hello, I'm Oh Mi-seon
from Typhoon Trading.

285
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,149
The weather's nice today.

286
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,693
Who…

287
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,779
Who talks about the weather?

288
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:42,324
Talking about the weather
is an icebreaker.

289
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,534
That would make things even more awkward.

290
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,663
Isn't it better to ask something
like if they have eaten?

291
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,374
- They could ask if the ride was okay.
- Okay, then.

292
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,627
Try acting like the high-ranking person
and ask about my meal.

293
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,046
Hey, there.

294
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,966
I'm Kang Tae-poong from Typhoon Trading.

295
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,509
Have you eaten?

296
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,971
Wasn't the road slippery at all?

297
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,722
Which company are you from again?

298
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,308
- Where is it?
- It's Typhoon Trading.

299
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:13,939
EPISODE 5
HEAVEN, WHERE WE ARE

300
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,294
That almost started a fire.

301
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,306
I'll also

302
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,517
take two spoons of sugar and cream.

303
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,448
She must've been exhausted.

304
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,757
You're here.

305
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,051
You should've gone home.

306
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:28,013
- I think Ms. Oh is really tired.
- What?

307
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,269
- What the heck?!
- Oh, my gosh.

308
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:37,064
You made the main character wait.

309
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,774
Mr. Bae?

310
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,109
You know…

311
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,656
I wanted to live
an unremarkable life, Tae-soo.

312
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,908
It's Tae-poong.

313
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,244
What's that sound?

314
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,664
Did you turn on the computer, Mr. Bae?

315
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,167
As expected of Romi… I mean, Ms. Oh.

316
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,752
You follow my every move.

317
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,587
She's a senior staff now.

318
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,927
- Why are you here?
- My feet just led me here.

319
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,845
CUSTOMS BROKER EXAM

320
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:09,846
Customs Broker?

321
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,767
- You want to study here?
- No, I'll study at a prep school.

322
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,312
- This place is for rest and recharging.
- Why?

323
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,815
Mr. Kang said we were family.

324
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,198
You came to use the computer, right?

325
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,371
You're asking
too many questions today, Ms. Oh.

326
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,164
That's all for today.

327
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,084
- You'd better pay for electricity.
- But we're family.

328
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,256
No, we're not.
And bring your own toilet paper.

329
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,759
This is abuse!

330
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,470
Mr. Kang, please say something.
This isn't right.

331
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,721
What is this?

332
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,682
Why do you have this menu?

333
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,433
When did you sneak a look?

334
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,144
No, I…

335
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,437
I know you're interested in me.

336
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,732
- But you can't go through someone's bag--
- We worked hard to collect this.

337
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,819
- You can't just take it for yourself.
- Give it back.

338
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,279
What else did you take?

339
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,906
- Let me see your bag.
- Hey!

340
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,700
- Did you take--
- Mr. Kang!

341
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,201
- Come on, Ms. Oh.
- Seriously?

342
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,829
- Make your own coffee too.
- Coffee?

343
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,999
- Fine, I won't drink it.
- We don't have enough for you.

344
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,140
- Are you leaving already?
- I'm sorry.

345
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:38,185
Everything's ready.
You should eat before you go.

346
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:41,062
Sorry, I need to catch the train.
You go ahead.

347
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,147
Tae-poong,

348
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,400
good luck at work today.

349
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,068
Don't rush around, okay?

350
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,278
I won't.

351
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:52,532
It's my first day
bringing in the goods I signed for.

352
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,869
I already showed it to over ten places,
and some of them showed interest.

353
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:01,374
I did such a great job raising my son.

354
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,542
My son.

355
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,630
After I receive all the items today,
we'll have a delicious dinner.

356
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,507
We were supposed
to go to Nam-mo's chicken place.

357
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,384
I almost forgot.

358
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,346
Then…

359
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,391
Let's go eat steak
once I sell all the safety shoes.

360
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,518
That sounds wonderful.

361
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,356
And, Mom…

362
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,693
I promise I'll get it back.

363
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,156
I'll get our home back no matter what.

364
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,713
What's this?

365
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,635
- It's fried eggs.
- It looks yummy.

366
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,013
- Can I have it?
- No.

367
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,851
It's gone cold. I'll make you a new one.

368
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,396
Come on.

369
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:10,902
You can head inside over there,
and feel free to look around.

370
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,781
Please look this over and sign it.

371
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:20,036
DATE OF RECEIPT,
ITEM AND QUANTITY

372
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,332
- The products are coming from Pusan?
- Yes.

373
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,086
That's going to take a long time.

374
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,504
REPRESENTATIVE: OH MI-SEON

375
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,006
I'm going to wait here.

376
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,550
- Thank you.
- No problem.

377
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,235
- Is this the place?
- Yes.

378
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,074
Isn't it great?

379
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,330
This way.

380
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,089
What is it?
Why are you just standing there?

381
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,474
Wait. They were here before.

382
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,732
Look. This place is completely empty!

383
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,572
There's no electricity, either.

384
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,748
All the items were here.

385
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,169
I knew it smelled fishy.
We've been scammed.

386
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,129
- I told you so!
- It was here.

387
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,131
- When did they switch it?
- Hold on.

388
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:56,966
Wait a minute.

389
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,136
Kang Tae-poong!

390
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,517
Mr. Park!

391
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,686
Open the door, Mr. Park!

392
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,289
Kang Tae-poong!

393
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,750
You'll hurt yourself!

394
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:32,544
Gosh.

395
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,179
Mr. Park!

396
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,864
- There's no way he's here. He ran away.
- He has to be here.

397
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,324
He's not here!

398
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:12,375
Mr. Park!

399
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,711
I'm sorry…

400
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,547
I'm so sorry.

401
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,591
- What…
- I'm so sorry.

402
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,053
I'm sorry.

403
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,015
Please forgive me.

404
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,434
I'm sorry.

405
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,061
If you give me just a little more time,

406
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,107
I swear I'll fix everything.

407
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,778
- Please forgive me.
- Hey, Mr. Park.

408
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,865
Did you borrow money from thugs?

409
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,035
- Oh, my.
- I can already tell.

410
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,623
They're going to ruin
another small-time company.

411
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:58,671
You put Tae-poong's items up
as collateral and sold them all off.

412
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,090
And now you've even lost that too.

413
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:07,847
Yes, you could say that.

414
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,560
Were you scamming me then?

415
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,103
I wasn't scamming you…

416
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,316
I was just unlucky.

417
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,488
Do you have any idea
what that money meant?

418
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,699
I'm so sorry.

419
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,576
Why me?

420
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,246
Tell me.

421
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,540
Why are you doing this to me?!

422
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,542
Why? Seriously!

423
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:40,171
I honestly took your money
to pay off an urgent interest bill,

424
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,592
but I was going to make it up to you
once things improved.

425
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,636
And?

426
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:49,889
Since when did life go according to plan?

427
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,476
In the meantime, the interest…

428
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,272
How did it pile on so fast?

429
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,481
Forget it.

430
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,359
Forget about your debts and all that.

431
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,155
What about my money?

432
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,117
Where's my money?

433
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,994
You took my down payment.

434
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,913
That money
is the only reason I'm still alive.

435
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,130
Damn it.

436
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:27,510
Is there seriously
nothing left at all? Really?

437
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,178
Damn it!

438
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,472
There's absolutely nothing left?

439
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,934
Do you have a plan?

440
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,188
All the factories, shops, and banks

441
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:40,732
took everything.

442
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,943
There's no stock left at all.

443
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,695
I think

444
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,823
this will only end if I die.

445
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,577
How dare you talk about dying?!

446
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,872
Do you know who has
to pay your debt if you die?

447
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,959
You can

448
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,754
hit me too if you want.

449
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,342
This bastard has completely lost his mind.

450
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,595
Okay, fine. Come here.

451
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,555
Come here, you bastard!

452
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,478
Gosh.

453
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,648
This is so frustrating.

454
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,526
Hey! Tae-poong!

455
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,115
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to report him to the police.

456
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:35,244
That's not going to fix anything.
He doesn't even have electricity.

457
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:39,248
My goodness.
Hold on. Let me make a few calls.

458
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,460
Why did you take that?

459
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,004
Just so I'd have something.

460
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,591
This isn't worth much.

461
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,343
PATENT CERTIFICATE

462
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,804
You even got the patents.
What are we going to do now?

463
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,975
You should call Mi-seon.

464
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,559
Never mind, I'll do it.

465
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,401
- Are you okay?
- Yes, of course.

466
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,361
I'm fine.

467
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,783
You're doing your best as the boss.

468
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:38,057
BUSINESS ENGLISH CONVERSATION HANDBOOK

469
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,893
TELL THEM THE QUALITY WILL BE DIFFERENT

470
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:12,091
CONGRATULATIONS AND BEST WISHES

471
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,219
Here's your beer, ma'am.

472
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,179
Oh, my gosh!

473
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,016
- What happened to your face?
- I got drunk and fell.

474
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,478
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

475
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,146
Be careful with that.

476
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,357
- One spicy sea snail salad, please.
- Coming right up.

477
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,778
You didn't have to bring anything.

478
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:32,904
Thank you.

479
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,574
You're amazing, Ms. Kim.

480
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:41,788
How did you manage
to start a business right away?

481
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:46,167
Not at all. I was scared,
so I opened up right next to the bank.

482
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,044
They're my previous clients.

483
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,338
- But still…
- Hello, Ms. Kim.

484
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,299
Welcome, you can sit over there.

485
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:56,969
- A bottle of soju, please.
- Coming right up.

486
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,767
- Here you go.
- Can we get more of this?

487
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,644
- You can get it yourself.
- Please.

488
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,062
My goodness.

489
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:10,274
- Can I see the menu, please?
- Where's the menu, Nam-mo?

490
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,568
- It's over there.
- Okay.

491
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,838
Tae-poong.

492
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,716
What are you doing here?
You should've called.

493
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,844
I waited for you.

494
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,971
I'm sorry. The timing wasn't ideal.

495
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,890
You must've waited long.

496
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,271
- What's this? Fried chicken?
- Yes, it's for Beom.

497
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:52,066
- We can't be the only ones who eat it.
- Good idea.

498
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,361
This looks delicious.

499
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,282
What's wrong?

500
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,994
- Did something happen?
- No.

501
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,914
Nothing happened. I'm just kind of tired.

502
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,167
Okay.

503
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,170
I'd be tired too, if I were you.

504
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:19,844
Your mother didn't even realize
the house was being taken away,

505
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,514
and she's living off her son at her age.

506
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,766
Don't say that, Mom.

507
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,144
But, son,

508
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,063
don't try too hard.

509
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,445
As long as I have you,
the whole world feels like home to me.

510
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,448
And…

511
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,996
I may be a good-for-nothing mom,
but you still have me.

512
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,541
I won't ever let you go hungry.

513
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,962
What I regret most in my life is…

514
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,636
that I never once told…

515
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,432
your father he could

516
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,810
- lean on me.
- Come on.

517
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,188
Mom.

518
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,691
It's okay.

519
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,904
I'm fine. I promise.

520
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,534
- Tae-poong.
- Yes?

521
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,747
You can lean on me.

522
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,878
You can lean on me
when things become too tough.

523
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:38,589
Okay?

524
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,061
- Mom.
- Yes?

525
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,274
I'm having such a hard time.

526
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,860
It's been so hard.

527
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,198
My goods are gone.

528
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,076
They're gone,

529
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,162
and all my money's gone too.

530
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:18,546
I don't even know

I was so scared because of that.

00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,400
It's okay.

534
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,069
It's okay, sweetie.

535
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,252

00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,723
Hello.

540
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,439
- How have you been?
- How did you know I was here?

541
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,649
You told me you worked here that day.

542
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,945
I've never seen
a woman drink so much beer.

543
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,074
- What do you want?
- I'm here to repay you.

544
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:31,369
- Forget it. Go back to your fried chicken.
- Just a minute.

545
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,163
Today's my day off,
so I don't have to fry any chicken.

546
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,291
It's cold today, isn't it?

547

Here you go.

548
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,760
It's cold. Take this.

549
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:50,930
I don't want it.

00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,896

- It's really cold.

552
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,689
Isn't it warm?

553
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,734
Stop following me.

554
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,864
Sorry, he's not here yet.

555
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,201
One moment. He just got home.

556
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,787
Welcome back.

557
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,205
Good night.

558
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,290
You got a call from Pusan.

559
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,333
- Pusan?
- Yes.

560
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,256
- Hello, Ms. Jung?
- Yes, it's me.

561
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,174
I found out who took the goods.

562
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,384
You did?

563
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:32,179
- Where is it?
- He's this loan shark I know.

564
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:36,642
It's best not to do business
with him if you can help it.

565
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:40,062
<i>Anyway, I explained your situation</i>

566
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,981
and told him 500 pairs belonged to you.

567
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,692
He'll return them
if you bring another five million won.

568
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,652
So, who exactly

569
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:48,946
has them?

570
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,617
How can they take someone else's stuff
and then ask for money?

571
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,827
Those goods are mine.

572
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,998
<i>Listen, half of it</i>
<i>is already useless and done with.</i>

573
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,333

<i>you don't have to.</i>

00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,251
No, I--

575
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:06,505
Hello? This is Mi-seon, Ms. Jung.

576
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,508
- How much did you say he wants?
<i>- Five million won.</i>

577
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,178
Five million won…

578
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:16,265
We'll call back once we get the money.

579
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,225
Okay.

580
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,437
Thank you. Good night.

581
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:26,650
Don't worry about it, Ms. Oh.
We have no money.

582
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,027
I'll handle it.

583
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,279
What will you do?

584
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,449
I'll go get the goods in person.

585
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,785
You know what loan sharks are, right?

586
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,916

Something like the father of success?

656
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,028
Failure is money.

657
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:49,032
Someone needs to lose 100 won

But…

680
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,924
This money really doesn't belong to me.

681
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:13,301
I was thinking of returning it.

682
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:17,723
Still, this doesn't feel right.
I'll figure it out.

683

If I can't, we can try something else.

684
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,893
Absolutely not.

685
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,396
Go and get our goods back.

686
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:26,982
Get them and we can sell them
for a bit more.

687
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,361
We can do this.

688
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,356

00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:25,874
Like I said last time,
that bastard isn't easy to deal with.

692
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,209
He's ruthless.

693
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:33,590
So just don't say a word,
give him the money and get the goods.

694
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:35,550
That's it.

695
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:38,678
Got it?

696
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,017
Got it.

697
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,979
I feel bad about what you went through,
so I'll help you up to this point.

698
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,315
Understood?

699

Give it to him.

709
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,729
We'll give it to you,
but only after we get ours.

710
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,272
The goods?

711
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:14,816
Follow me.

712
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,630
Move it. Hurry it up.

713
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:37,923
Yes, sir!

714
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,258
We'll finish early if you guys hurry up.

715
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,429
- You left out 500 of them, right?
- Yes, sir.

716
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,599
- Leave out 500.
- So 500?

717
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,560
If we leave out 500, it'll be 1,500.

718
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,064
Let's just round it off to 30 million won.

719
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,363
Look, it's Typhoon Trading!

720
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,950
- Did you catch on?
- Wait a minute.

721
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,119
Hold on. Manager Ha!

722
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,288
What do you mean?

723
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,832
Why are you leaving some of the goods?

724
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:19,381
Tae-poong.

725
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:21,883
This is good, but too spicy.

726
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:24,552
Manager Ha, I can't eat it anymore.

727
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,388
Let's keep moving.

728
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,264
Hey.

729
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,726
Are you a gangster now?

730
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:37,524
Isn't it better to be poor
than a gangster?

731
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:38,984
Have you lost your mind?

732
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,863
Hey. Do you seriously think we're equals
just because I came here?

733
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:47,826
You got any money? Or connections?

734
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,121
Please stop!

735
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:53,164
- Bring it on!
- No, don't.

736
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,124
Bring it.

737
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,750
Let's keep moving, guys.

738
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,127
Let's get a move on.

739
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,087
- That bum…
- Who are you calling a bum?

740
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,131
Let's calm down, everyone.

741
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:03,508
- You jerk.
- Just leave it.

742
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:05,635
- You're nothing but a gangster.
- Bastard.

743
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,972
- Stop.
- Watch your tongue!

744
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,725
What the heck is this?

745
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,856
Get this moving, now!

746
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,928
Mister.

747
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,265
Are you okay?

748
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,992
You can't take a nap here.

749
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,622
It's freezing in here, mister.

750
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:39,312
- Is this fun to you?
- Yes. It's a lot of fun.

751
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,609
Relax, you bastard.

752
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,404
I'll kill you if you get in my way.

What's taking him so long?

755
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,289
Take this.

756
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,546
I can't give this money to these people.

757
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,590
It's worth more than that.

758
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,759
- What are you doing?
- Tae-poong.

759
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:54,888
- You can't do this.
- You should go, Ms. Jung.

760
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:01,603
Put your feet down.

761
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,730
I said, put your feet down!

762
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:08,985
Let's go.

763
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:12,864
Listen to me.

764
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:14,699
What good is looking at the ledger?

765
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,701
You can't even sell an item.

766
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:24,375
- How much does that guy owe you?
- Why do you want to know?

767
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:26,669
It's 50 million won.

768
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:31,633
- It's 70 million won now with interest.
- Make it 100 million.

769
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:38,014
I'll sell 7,000 safety shoes
and give you 100 million won.

770
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,226
Thirty million won for a dump sale?

771
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,439
If you're clueless,
even a diamond is just a rock.

772
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:49,609
Is that so?

773
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,820
It's a great offer,

774
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,490
but there's already a buyer.

775
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,700
Who? Me?

776
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,621
What happens if he can't do it?

777
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:03,748
Then I'll take the interest.

778
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,713
Mr. Park's life is a given, of course.

can you put your eyes on the line?

782
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,316
Don't do this. Don't do this, Tae-poong.

783
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:37,031
This is unbelievable.
I'll back off if you're that desperate.

On one condition.

785
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:42,120
You have to let me gouge out
one of that bastard's eyes.

786
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,127
What's wrong?

787
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:51,879
You scared?

788
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,259
You have to swear

789
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,971
to leave us alone
once you get 100 million won.

790
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:03,725
What's wrong?

791
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,436
You scared?

792
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:11,024

That's none of your business.
