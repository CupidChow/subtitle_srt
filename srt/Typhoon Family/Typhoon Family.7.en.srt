FV IMAGIN

3
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,799
Push it to the edge!

4
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,426
Be careful.

5
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:56,055
Hi, is the captain here?

6
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,476
Captain! Sir!

7
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,062
What do you want?

8
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:03,688
Hello.

9
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,483
My name is Kang Tae-poong
of Typhoon Trading.

10
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:11,279
We wanted to ask you for a favor, sir.

11
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:15,366
Do you load different items on your ship,
such as shoes?

12
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,203
We have 5,000 safety shoes
that have to go.

13
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:22,123
Can you ship them to Mexico?

14
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,545
Did he just say yes?

15
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,506
-I think so.
-Right?

16
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:30,924
Boys.

17
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,176
-What did he say?
-What?

18
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,096
-Did you bring the proof of receipt?
-I don't have it.

19
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,350
-What? Why?
-Oh, my gosh.

20
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:45,230
You punks!
Can't you see I'm busy right now?

21
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,565
What are you waiting for? Throw more salt!

22
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:51,361
You guys are just unbelievable!

23
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:52,862
Watch out.

24
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,697
-Oh, my gosh.
-What did I do wrong?

25
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,825
Give that to me. Jeez.

26
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,244
Okay, we'll come back another time.

27
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,121
Don't ever come back, you punks!

28
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,290
-Get lost!
-We have to get the shoes on that ship.

29
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,961
You'll have to change your name
if you want to do that.

30
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,551
You bastard!

31
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,971
-Hey, punk.
-Where's our money?

32
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:21,099
Please give me two more days.
I swear I'll pay you back.

33
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,934
Please, I beg you.

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,480
-You bastard!
-Please show mercy!

35
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,316
Please spare me!

36
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,694
Please have mercy…

37
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,325
DEBT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM

38
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,052
Hey, Hyun-jun.

39
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,929
Do you know that thing I asked for?

40
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,015
-Your new position?
-Yes.

41
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,561
-Good job.
-Have a good day.

42
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,067
My job offer got canceled, and…

43
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,904
What good are friends for anyway?

44
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:20,074
-I'll put in a word with HR. Go see them.
-Really?

45
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,368
Are you sure I can really do that?

46
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,162
Seriously, thank you.

47
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,705
Mr. Pyo.

48
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,042
This is the CEO of Uriel.

49
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,211
He had a loan of five million
plus interest, which makes it 20 million.

50
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,129
Give it to him.

51
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,675
Can we please take our goods back?

52
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,011
We really need to get them delivered.

53
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,651
What are you…

54
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,444
I didn't get paid.

55
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,325
-Hey!
-Grab him!

56
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,994
What are you doing? Stop!

57
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,207
Do you know what you're doing?

58
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,005
Stop it!

59
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,178
-Get him out of here.
-You bastard!

60
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,390
-How many?
-Eleven stacks.

61
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,854
-A deep-sea fishing boat?
-Yes.

62
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,772
No.

63
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,316
-Why not?
-Isn't it obvious?

64
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:39,028
Who uses a fishing boat to load cargo?

65
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:43,116
Where were you all night?
What gave you such a crazy idea?

66
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,036
How much is this Danish money worth?

67
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,705
The krone was 253 won.

68
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,208
Is there no way to load it?

69
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,211
Forget all this nonsense
and stick with me, Ms. Oh.

70
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,921
I'll pay you three times more.

71
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,214
Absolutely not.

72
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,549
No.

73
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,553
There's nothing in the contract
about how we should make the delivery.

74
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:07,181
-They just need to verify the goods.
-That's right.

75
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,475
What's wrong with both of you?

76
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,936
That's smuggling!

77
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,488
-What's the name of the ship?
-The name was…

78
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,407
It was…

79
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,326
It was called FV Imagin.

80
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:27,994
-FV Imagin.
-What?

81
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:28,995
FV Imagin.

82
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,831
Oh, my gosh.

83
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,916
My head hurts.

84
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,633
Hello? It's me.

85
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,303
I'm going to send two of my staff--

86
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,346
You want me to come too?

87
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,933
Sure.

88
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:04,322
PUSAN SIMYEONG SHIPPING

89
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,618
It's a herbal tea drink.

90
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,787
Do you have Dr Pepper?

91
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,290
Maybe not in Pusan.

92
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,292
They don't have any.

93
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,795
I'll make my own drink, the American way.

94
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:26,594
We're prepared to offer
compensation for your services.

95
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,888
What? "Compensation"?

96
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:34,018
How dare a woman speak up?

97
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:39,107
I'm about to lose my mind
because my engineer just ran off!

98
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:43,027
You think I'm going to budge
for chump change?

99
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,239
This is why I don't deal with boat guys.

100
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,198
"Boat guys"?

101
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,993
How dare you spout
that ignorant, sexist nonsense?

102
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,411
You're a disgrace!

103
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,664
Kang Tae-poong.

104
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,332
-Yes?
-Kaiser was not like this.

105
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,417
He was a great man.

106
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,840
Kaiser? Who's that? What a funny name.

107
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,092
Don't you know your father's name?

108
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,718
He was Kaiser Kang.

109
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,390
This kid is Kaiser's son?

110
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,016
He looks just like him.

111
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,352
Stand up, kid.

112
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,521
I said, stand up.

113
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,023
Attention!

114
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:22,900
At ease.

115
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,902
Attention! At ease.

116
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,028
Attention!

117
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,865
At ease, attention, at ease, attention!

118
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,034
At ease.

119
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,663
He's no good.

120
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,666
Is it true?

121
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,877
Why are you making me do this?

122
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,800
Your father and I shared meals,
boarded the same ship,

123
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,260
and even caught some tuna together--

124
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,387
Sure, you went to the sauna.

125
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,763
We get it.

126
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,891
So, what can you do for him?

127
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,394
But even if my ship goes
all the way to Mexico,

128
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,272
what are you going to do there?

129
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,150
You guys don't realize it,

130
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,360
but even with a local broker,

131
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,906
something is bound to go wrong
if they send the goods from there.

132
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,075
-Are you aware of that?
-What if I went on the ship?

133
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,163
What about Bo-ram?

134
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,123
She'll be okay.

135
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:24,795
It would be helpful to you
if I were to board that ship.

136
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,673
Do you have a marine engineer license?

137
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,884
I graduated
from Yeongdo Maritime University.

138
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,638
I've never worked on fishing boats,
only two tours on oil tankers,

139
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,390
but I got off because I didn't want
to do nine months.

140
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,644
Looks like I'll be on it for two years.

141
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,647
Aside from that, there's one more problem.

142
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,441
How are we going
to get 5,000 safety shoes…

143
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,278
onto a ship?

144
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:55,868
I will…

145
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:04,627
figure out a way to make that happen.

146
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,550
Auntie.

147
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,469
-Do you still have sea eel?
-At this hour?

148
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,266
Isn't two years too long?

149
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,646
This is all my fault.
It's the least I could do.

150
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,731
What about your daughter?

151
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,609
I'll send her to her mom's.

152
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,989
She's young,
but I'm sure she'll understand.

153
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,459
Mr. Park.

154
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,797
Just stick it out for the long haul.

155
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,259
You'll end up
with many more opportunities in life.

156
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,052
That's exactly my plan.

157
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:59,265
That way, I'll be able
to repay all this kindness.

158
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,517
My point exactly.

159
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,274
But what exactly is Kang Tae-poong

160
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,818
planning to do?

161
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,196
Can he actually load those safety shoes?

162
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,198
There are so many of them.

163
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,035
That's what I'm worried about too.

164
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,500
CRAB AND OTHER SEAFOOD

165
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,184
We have crabs and other seafood!

166
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,769
He's here!

167
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,522
Let's get to work.

168
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,323
Be careful.

169
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,994
It's heavy. Careful.

170
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,455
Here, be careful.

171
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,387
You're coming to our ship.

172
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,392
That's all of it.

173
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,477
Take a look.

174
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,359
CRAB AND OTHER SEAFOOD

175
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,653
Come on, get up here!

176
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,489
-I'm coming up, Captain!
-Hurry up.

177
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,748
You should keep living life your own way.

178
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,375
Sorry?

179
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:38,007
Even if you've got no money nor dignity,
all you need is someone by your side.

180
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,345
No matter how much the world changes,

181
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,849
in the end, it's still people
who will live in that world.

182
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,601
We're all the same after all.

183
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,020
-You can bring that here.
-Okay.

184
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,563
Thank you.

185
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,735
Here, you dummy.

186
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,281
Thank you.

187
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,699
Are the shoes okay?

188
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:07,453
"Shoes that are strong even in sub-zero
temperatures, Shoe Park's Safety Shoes."

189
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,538
-Is that so?
-Yes, look.

190
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,874
The sun's rising! Let's get a move on!

191
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,711
-My own way?
-Your own way.

192
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,880
My own way!

193
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,065
Are you really sure about this?

194
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:42,655
There are people who bet their own life
for a complete stranger.

195
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,244
-But what about Bo-ram?
-I've taken care of it.

196
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,664
Shoe Park is like my child too.

197
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,124
I should take responsibility.

198
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,585
Don't worry about me.

199
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,926
Mr. Kang.

200
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,515
I am truly sorry
for everything up till now,

201
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,560
and I am truly grateful.

202
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,480
When we meet again in two years,

203
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,984
I promise to be someone
you can look up to.

204
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,068
Come on.

205
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,737
Stop being so sappy.

206
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,950
-But you were really cool today.
-You think so?

207
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:33,664
I never did that. You were the one
who emphasized that we had five patents.

208
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:35,791
Shoe Park's…

209
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,668
-Safety Shoes.
-Safety Shoes.

210
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,628
That was cool.

211
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,341
What's that sound?

212
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,467
A siren?

213
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,305
It's the cops. We need to hide.

214
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,098
-Over there.
-Wait…

215
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,105
Attention, FV Imagin.

216
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,899
Please hold your departure.

217
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,985
You are forbidden from setting sail.

218
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,071
Get off the ship, Tae-poong!

219
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,781
-Me?
-Get off!

220
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,658
I have to get out of here.

221
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,702
Please stop what you're doing.

222
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,746
Please hold your departure.

223
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,540
You are forbidden from setting sail.

224
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:22,838
Go through there.

225
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,224
What's going on?

226
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,439
-Where is he?
-What do we do?

227
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,903
Hello, sir. Is something wrong?

228
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:49,782
We got a report that suspicious items
may have been loaded onto your ship.

229
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,701
All this over a report?

230
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,328
We have to depart right now.

231
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:58,290
Please show me the crew members' IDs
and the departure declaration form.

232
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,084
Gather round, everyone!

233
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:04,213
Get your IDs and passports out!

234
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,259
-Come on, hurry up.
-Seriously?

235
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,475
Cover me.

236
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:19,895
Come on!

237
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,317
Let's see.

238
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,821
-Please take your hat off.
-Jeez.

239
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,198
Someone reported you for smuggling drugs.

240
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:35,077
That's ridiculous!
It's hardly worth the risk.

241
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,870
Park Yun-cheol.

242
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,001
But, Officer,

243
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,629
who's going to take responsibility
if we can't sail because of this?

244
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,383
Goodness, should I call
our company or what?

245
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,053
We're just checking.

246
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,347
What are you waiting for? Move!

247
00:16:59,018 --> 00:16:59,852
That's me.

248
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,521
You're good.

249
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,136
Thank you for your hard work.

250
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,306
Mr. Kang.

251
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,849
What's going on?

252
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:43,270
They can't go that way.
What if they stop us from departing?

253
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,689
I'll figure something out, so stop them.

254
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,733
-Stop them?
-Go.

255
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,361
Thanks for all your hard work!

256
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,656
Would you like a cup of coffee
before you go?

257
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,533
I'll make a nice cup for everyone.

258
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,787
The captain said you guys
are working so hard

259
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,497
and insisted you stay for coffee.

260
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,129
-I'll make--
-There's nothing there.

261
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,089
-I'll check over there.
-Hurry up.

262
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,341
Stop!

263
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,009
What are you doing?

264
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,430
Hey!

265
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,058
Hey!

266
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,435
It's been a while since I've done this!

267
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,063
I'm getting high!

268
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:09,982
Stop right there!

269
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,361
What is that?

270
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,905
-What?
-Over there!

271
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,615
What?

272
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,369
What is that?

273
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,247
Look over there.

274
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,584
Is that Mr. Kang?

275
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,793
Hey!

276
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,463
I wanted a deep-sea fishing boat,

277
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,885
but a tanker is fine too!

278
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,850
I'm going all out tonight!

279
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,145
-I'm getting high!
-That little…

280
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,899
Calling Seagull Three!

281
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,525
Drug suspect sighted!

282
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,194
Requesting backup!

283
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:04,953
What's he doing?

284
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,040
I'm so high!

285
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,420
Is he doing drugs?

286
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:16,131
No, he's eating it.

287
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,425
No wonder he had a weird look in his eyes.

288
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,177
He's an absolute lunatic.

289
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,562
Is that flour?

290
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,522
What the…

291
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,025
Did he starve or something?

292
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,318
Why is he eating that?

293
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,654
That's how people do drugs.

294
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,863
FLOUR

295
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,284
This is amazing!

296
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,036
It's amazing!

297
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,414
Oh, my gosh.

298
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,422
Calling Seagull Three!

299
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,675
The incident has been resolved.
Cancel backup.

300
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,053
Captain.

301
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:06,014
I'm sorry for keeping you.

302
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,393
We have plenty of time,
so we'll get ready to set sail now.

303
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,478
Come on, crew!

304
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,107
-Let's go back to the sea!
-Yes, sir.

305
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,866
I'm so high!

306
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:42,676
Shoe Park's Safety Shoes.

307
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,508
Gosh.

308
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,728
-Who are you?
-Hello.

309
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,397
-I must've scared you. I--
-Come here.

310
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,774
-Okay, I--
-Come here.

311
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,484
-Come here.
-Wait.

312
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,818
Please listen to me.

313
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,737
-Captain!
-Wait, please.

314
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:45,572
-Hold on.
-Captain.

315
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:46,948
-Just a minute.
-What is it?

316
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,159
Hello, Captain. I'm Kang Tae-poong.

317
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,328
I must've scared you.

318
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,371
I got on here by accident.

319
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,582
You're a suspicious guy.

320
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,042
I'm not.

321
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:01,046
This white powder isn't drugs. It's flour.

322
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,839
I'm not a suspicious guy.

323
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,174
Shut your mouth!

324
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,344
-Please let me get off--
-I told you to shut up.

325
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,304
Nice!

326
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,597
Let's see.

327
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,100
I'll teach you a lesson.

328
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,334
Who the heck are those guys?

329
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,514
There you are.

330
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,189
What do you want?

331
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,568
I'm Ryu Hui-gyu.

332
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,071
Hey, mister.

333
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,531
That one's mine,

334
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:11,616
so let him go.

335
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,254
Did you load all the shoes?

336
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,338
Jeez.

337
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,846
Did you come because you were worried?

338
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,056
With that kid?

339
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,143
That bastard is such a pain.

340
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,233
Give me a hand.

341
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,655
Tae-poong.

342
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,034
I came for your eyes.

343
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,002
I asked if you loaded them.

344
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,923
-How did you find me?
-I know everything that happens in Pusan.

345
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,384
Then why are you asking?

346
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,848
-You bastard.
-Hold on.

347
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,183
I want to do it.

348
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,693
Don't you want to go back?

349
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,321
Do you hate me too?

350
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,822
I hate you, you bastard.

351
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,491
Beg for your life.

352
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,035
Is that what you want?

353
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,249
"Please spare me."

354
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,793
Please kill me

355
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,629
if you don't want your money.

356
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,965
The sea is still cold.

357
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,218
Can you even last one minute?

358
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,600
Do it.

359
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,353
But if you can't kill me now,

360
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,274
you'll never be able to kill me.

361
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,459
Is that so?

362
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,046
I won't get the money if I kill you now.

363
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,930
Hold on. That's it?

364
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:40,849
Hey!

365
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,643
Do you think I came here just for that?!

366
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,314
If I give you that money,
will you kill him?

367
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,733
How much?

368
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,569
How much will it take?

369
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,032
Are you that rich?

370
00:26:58,867 --> 00:26:59,743
Then…

371
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,830
How much will your father pay for this?

372
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,085
What are you saying, you thug?

373
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,503
Have you lost your mind?

374
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,757
My dad won't pay you.

375
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,427
If you send him my ear,

376
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,056
he'll kill all of you.

377
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:29,856
See you.

378
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,320
Get out of my way, please.

379
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,201
That's salt water!

380
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,787
Jeez, salt water!

381
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,164
It's fake anyway, so who cares?

382
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,834
Come on, you should get the authentic one.

383
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,088
Damn it.

384
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,258
Bring this to the dry cleaner's,
Manager Ha!

385
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,766
Where is he? I don't see him.
I'm so worried.

386
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,726
Where did he go?

387
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:12,232
What if he fell off that boat earlier?

388
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,274
What?

389
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,985
This is weird.

390
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,489
Hey!

391
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,867
-What are you doing? Are you crazy?
-I should go look for him!

392
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,245
No, you're going to die out there!

393
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,329
I'm a good swimmer.

394
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,455
-No!
-He can't swim.

395
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,124
What if he drowns?

396
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,959
-Let's just wait!
-I can't!

397
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,169
Who else is going to save him?

398
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,089
Hey!

399
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,591
Over here!

400
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,093
I'm here!

401
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:41,678
Over here!

402
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,972
I'm right here!

403
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:55,191
Hey!

404
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,194
-I made it back in one piece!
-Mr. Kang!

405
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,490
Why do you make me worried sick?

406
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,244
-I was so scared.
-Well…

407
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,419
Get a room, you two.

408
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,175
Ms. Oh.

409
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,094
I'm sorry.

410
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,638
You always manage to surprise me.

411
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:26,890
I was just so worried.

412
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,808
-I'm sorry.
-You're more reckless.

413
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,188
Are you okay?

414
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,942
-Are you returning to Seoul?
-I should go check on Bo-ram.

415
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,571
Don't worry, I'll take care of her.

416
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:46,910
Didn't you tell me to mind my own business
because the world is cold?

417
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:50,830
Even if the world is cold,
you should still be kind.

418
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,082
I'm off.

419
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,877
You'd better call me
when you have raw fish next time.

420
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,878
We will.

421
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,922
-Take care.
-Thank you.

422
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,548
-Thank you.
-Thank you for everything.

423
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,767
-Put your shoes on.
-Yes.

424
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,560
-You're not hurt, are you?
-No.

425
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,938
-Here are your shoes.
-I'll put them on.

426
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,164
The goods should arrive safely, right?

427
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,375
They just have to cross the border.

428
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,212
What happened to your hand?

429
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,089
Did you get hurt?

430
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,758
It's from when I was trying
to get the tube earlier.

431
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,679
-Why would you--
-I'm fine.

432
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,556
It's not that bad.

433
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,731
Ms. Oh.

434
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,030
I think I like you.

435
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,782
Pardon?

436
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,286
You look dirty and scruffy now.

437
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,914
But you're beautiful.

438
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:25,341
You're not so clean yourself right now.

439
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,094
Now that I think about it,

440
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,346
you always look the same,

441
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,933
but you're becoming lovelier.

442
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,605
You're cute when you're mad,

443
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,398
and when you smile…

444
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,068
you're beautiful.

445
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,032
What are you talking about?

446
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,076
-This is so sudden.
-That's it.

447
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,872
I like you, Ms. Oh.

448
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,418
That's why you're pretty.

449
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,715
What are you saying right now?

450
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:10,470
You should go take a nap.
I think you're sleep-deprived.

451
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,312
Maybe you're right.

452
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,731
Go take a nap.

453
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,077
This is so heavy.

454
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:12,115
What made those days more painful was

455
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,159
that the most basic things

456
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,245
were stripped away.

457
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,626
There was no way

458
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,879
to know who was to blame for it all.

459
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,674
No.

460
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,720
No one could even think
about such things back then.

461
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,346
Why isn't the car coming?

462
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,306
-It's freezing.
-Excuse me.

463
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:38,975
Passing through.

464
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,310
-Watch it.
-Sorry about that.

465
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:44,981
Is that it?

466
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,276
There it is.

467
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,868
This is the last car for today. Get in!

468
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,998
Hey, you!

469
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,296
Don't push!

470
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:58,513
1,000 PAST EXAM QUESTIONS

471
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,016
We had to get through
impossibly difficult days…

472
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,852
-Honey!
-We're almost there.

473
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,230
We're nearly there.

474
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,152
INFANT VISITATION HOURS

475
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:24,539
…and find a way to keep our families safe.

476
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:32,922
The only thing we needed
was some kind of sign,

477
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,174
however small,

478
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,593
that tomorrow would come,

479
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,138
and that we weren't alone.

480
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,643
You can use this here.

481
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,438
Oh, dear.

482
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,150
-You're done already?
-Yes.

483
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:56,487
Look at you. You now seem like
a true seamstress.

484
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,324
What are you working on?

485
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,910
I'm fixing my youngest son's gym uniform.

486
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,288
Your son would love that.

487
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:14,422
EPISODE 7
THE MEANING OF LIFE

488
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,425
-I win.
-No, I win!

489
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:22,054
Hi! Jjuggu!

490
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,350
-Jjuggu!
-It's Jjuggu!

491
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,936
-Jjuggu!
-Be careful with your hands.

492
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,275
There we go.

493
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,152
Look up.

494
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,287
You're supposed to say hello
when you see someone.

495
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:51,083
This tiny house is way too crowded.
Isn't that right?

496
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:59,175
How come no matter how much I wash myself,
I don't smell as good as Ji-hun?

497
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,885
What?

498
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,639
Don't be ridiculous.

499
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,641
You're squeaky clean.

500
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,935
-Who else washes you--
-Move.

501
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,106
Come closer.

502
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,400
There we go. Good job.

503
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,153
Let's see.

504
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,950
Okay, give me your face.

505
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:24,909
Good boy.

506
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,328
Here you go.

507
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,997
Clean behind the ears.

508
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,791
Tip your head back. There we go.

509
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:35,670
You have to clean thoroughly
if you don't want to smell.

510
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,714
Good job. Look down.

511
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,220
You're doing so good. Great job.

512
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,347
Attaboy.

513
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,522
There we go. All clean.

514
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,815
You look like a prince.

515
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:59,735
Look at our little prince.

516
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,370
Hey!

517
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,913
What the heck are you doing?

518
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,627
You could've just wired it.

519
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,255
We're here to get
our debt acknowledgement form back.

520
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,381
Is that so?

521
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,175
I should give it back.

522
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,450
So you have something
you're scared of now.

523
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,203
Right?

524
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,005
Let's go.

525
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,428
Crazy punk.

526
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,465
What did you say?

527
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,179
Manager Ha!

528
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,264
What on earth were you doing?!

529
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,976
We're just trying
to handle things ourselves.

530
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,069
Do you know how much damage you caused?

531
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,656
Thanks to you, our ship will leave
with an empty container.

532
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,617
Now we have to pay damages
to the buyer in secret,

533
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,411
not to mention late fees as well!

534
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,080
-Do you know how much that is?
-Dad.

535
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,795
That thug said if Tae-poong
doesn't bring the money,

536
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:27,591
he'll kill him
and give me Tae-poong's goods.

537
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,093
Isn't that efficient?

538
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:33,097
But Kang Tae-poong made money
while you lost our company's money!

539
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,434
Why do you only care about the result?
Think about the progress.

540
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,019
I really tried my best.

541
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:43,232
You're always going on and on
about that darn Typhoon Trading!

542
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,359
You're always raving about them.

543
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,819
Do you even…

544
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,197
Do you have what it takes
to take Kang Tae-poong down?

545
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,949
Do you?

546
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,953
You punk!

547
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,080
You're not in the same league as him!

548
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:02,418
I set up that trading company you wanted,
so stop trying to copy Kang Tae-poong.

549
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:06,130
Call your aunt and ask her to send over
some useful goods from the States.

550
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,923
Your mom's family has good taste.

551
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,509
Get out.

552
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,012
-You!
-Yes, sir!

553
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,638
-Take him outside.
-Yes, sir.

554
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,599
Let's go.

555
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,059
Come on, let's go.

556
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,439
Jeez.

557
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,737
Have a good day, sir.

558
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,498
-Hi.
-How was the expo, Mr. Kang?

559
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:44,460
There were a lot of good items,
but they don't really match our vibe.

560
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,046
Take a look at this.

561
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,592
Electronics and chemical products.

562
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,013
EXPORT EXPO INFORMATION

563
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,390
The bigger trading companies
handle those, don't they?

564
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,059
I suppose so.

565
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,148
I shouldn't have repaid
the full amount to that loan shark.

566
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:11,028
Never get involved
with people like that again.

567
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,489
Even after our losses, we have a lot left.

568
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,574
Mr. Bae.

569
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,910
Are you studying, Mr. Bae?

570
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,453
EXAM QUESTIONS
EXORCISM CHRONICLES

571
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,707
Can you please respect my privacy?

572
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:26,919
Gosh.

573
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,339
Are you crying?

574
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,133
My gosh, he's really crying.

575
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,678
Life is so hard.

576
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:37,429
What?

577
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:40,641
Here's some tissue.

578
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,893
We have a lot of good-looking folks today.

579
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,019
KING DIAMONDS IS THE WAY TO GO!

580
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,104
SPECIAL LECTURE BY KIM GEUM-OK

581
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,814
Things are really tough these days, right?

582
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,233
-Yes!
-I'm sure it's very difficult.

583
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,901
It's so tough.

584
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,529
But you know, I'm not struggling at all.

585
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:59,118
I can't help but laugh
because I'm so excited and happy.

586
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:00,953
Why, you ask?

587
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:04,665
Is it because 30 million won is deposited
into my bank account every month?

588
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,792
KING DIAMONDS INCOME

589
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,627
KING LIFE SUCCESS LEADERSHIP ACADEMY

590
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,129
That's incredible.

591
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,550
Thirty million won…

592
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,637
No, this isn't what makes me happy.

593
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:25,352
I'm truly happy
because all of you can become like me.

594
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,273
We can do it!

595
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,403
Are we all alone in this?

596
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,780
-Is that how Koreans are?
-No.

597
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,532
No, we're not.

598
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,951
We need to stick together
and overcome this.

599
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,162
What is that called? Networking?

600
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,123
It's called marketing.

601
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,791
What did I say IMF stands for?

602
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,128
Exactly.

603
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:57,801
All of you can become Rubies,
Sapphires, and a Diamond like me.

604
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,012
Let's earn 30 million won a month,

605
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,556
send those disobedient kids
overseas for school,

606
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,101
and gloat about it
to our annoying neighbor!

607
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,653
Our country is in danger
because of the IMF!

608
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,489
We need your help, everyone!

609
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,909
Please participate
in the Gold Collection Effort.

610
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,204
Our country is in danger
because of the IMF!

611
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,248
Please participate
in the Gold Collection Effort.

612
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,459
We must revive our country.

613
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,172
The country is in danger.

614
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:40,302
Lucky them, having gold to contribute.

615
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,012
We must revive our country.

616
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:46,058
-Please fall in line.
-Please donate

617
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,102
any gold you're not using.

618
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,646
Let's gather our small efforts…

619
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,439
Who am I to help, given my situation?

620
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,775
We must revive our country.

621
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:02,074
Let's gather our small efforts
and revive our country.

622
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:08,914
Please donate any gold you're not using.

623
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,293
Our country is in danger.

624
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:20,467
Let's gather our small efforts
and revive our country.

625
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:25,013
You'll be proud of me, right, honey?

626
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,058
Please donate any gold you're not using.

627
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:30,936
Let's gather our small efforts…

628
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:35,482
A cold, chilling wave worse
than the winter air has crashed over us,

629
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:39,820
but our people's passion for the nation
is burning brightly this new year.

630
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,658
What were your thoughts
as you brought your treasured gold?

631
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:46,869
I don't know.

632
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:50,497
As a proud citizen,
what would you like to say?

633
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,082
I'm a mess right now.

634
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,962
"The country's a mess right now."
What kind of a mess is it?

635
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:58,881
Stop it.

636
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:02,926
Stop! I can't let the other ladies
see me like this!

637
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,346
-What's wrong with her?
-Let's go over there.

638
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,556
Stop it.

639
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:11,768
Are you sad to let go of your gold turtle
and your gold medal of honor?

640
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:17,149
The people are struggling just to survive.
What good will these do in my closet?

641
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:19,318
We have to save the country first.

642
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,571
As you can see,

643
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:27,075
true heroes exist all around the world,
no matter the era or their age.

644
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,398
-There you are.
-Hey.

645
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,455
We should've gone for some good food.

646
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,583
I don't like crowded places.

647
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,839
Is your mother doing well?

648
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:24,591
Probably.

649
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:28,971
I don't really know either.

650
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,558
Right now, it's every man for himself.

651
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:40,107
Hey, my family went under too.

652
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,527
Jeez.

653
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,862
I know, dude.

654
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,076
Even without friends,
rumors still spread like wildfire.

655
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:56,206
Sorry I couldn't go to the funeral.

656
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:01,670
And I swear I'll kill
that bastard Pyo Hyun-jun someday.

657
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,339
You're crazy.

658
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,137
Yun-seong.

659
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:14,224
There are just too many
terrible people out there.

660
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:19,104
It's too exhausting
trying to hate all of them.

661
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:24,860
So, let's just think about
the people we want by our side.

662
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,362
Okay?

663
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,411
Hold on.

664
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,790
-What did you bring this time?
-Just hold on.

665
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,834
I said you don't have to.

666
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,086
Here.

667
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:44,630
What's this?

668
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,758
It's what I've been making these days.

669
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,763
I work at a helmet factory.

670
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,973
It's popular in Europe and the US.

671
00:48:55,682 --> 00:49:01,188
So my boss made a fortune
and became rich even during this crisis.

672
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,566
-Lucky him.
-Right?

673
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:07,569
Hey.

674
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,323
Whatever you do, just stay safe.

675
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,452
Once you get that look
in your eyes, it's all over.

676
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,831
Once I save up,

677
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,168
I'll get some used machinery
and start making screws.

678
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,422
I told you.

679
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,841
I'm going to pay you back.

680
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:33,845
-I said you don't have to pay me back.
-Of course not. It's chump change.

681
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,267
-I should go.
-Wait.

682
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:40,852
I'm going first.

683
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,773
This is the first product I sold.

684
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,776
-Stay safe.
-What is it?

685
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,986
Got it? Throw this away for me.

686
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,738
-Hey!
-See you.

687
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:56,993
See you next time.

688
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,421
He hasn't changed at all.

689
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,619
This is nice.

690
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,759
Jeez…

691
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,017
I got my paycheck.

692
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,103
I wanted to pay you back first.

693
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,481
Thanks.

694
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:21,912
MOMO'S PUB

695
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,302
What are you doing?

696
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,055
I want to sell this.

697
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,683
-A helmet?
-Yes.

698
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:27,477
It's apparently
the number one helmet in the US.

699
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,397
But I don't know where to begin.

700
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,609
I really want
to sell them properly this time,

701
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,070
but I can't use a fishing ship again.

702
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,875
-Oh, my.
-Hey.

703
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,460
You're finally all here.

704
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:55,213
Ms. Cha, what brings you here?

705
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:57,299
My gosh.

706
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,051
Here.

707
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,052
CHOROK FARM GREEN JUICE

708
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:06,683
Of course you don't know.
You never learned this.

709
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:10,812
You should've had your shoes
inspected by Go Ma-jin first.

710
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,815
My shoes? Why?

711
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,942
Put your foot up.

712
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:22,198
Look here, at the toe.

713
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:26,369
Is it polished until it shines?
It's your mindset when meeting a client.

714
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,538
Now, the heel.

715
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:32,667
How worn down is it?
Does it show you've been running around?

716
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,878
That's so old-fashioned.

717
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:36,504
What's he doing here?

718
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,799
How many have you had?

719
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:43,887
-You're only drinking the ginseng too.
-I've been feeling weak lately.

720
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,096
Jeez.

721
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,474
Drink it then.

722
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,393
-Thank you.
-Three.

00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,898
CHOROK FARM ORDER FORM
QUANTITY: 3

724
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,066
There we go.

725
00:53:57,025 --> 00:54:00,528
Well, Mr. Go has been in sales
for a long time.

726
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:04,824
Mr. Go may sound rough,
but he was great at his job.

727
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:05,742
QUANTITY: 2

728
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,000
QUANTITY: 4

729
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,336
-We only need two.
-Guys.

730
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,589
Nothing in life is free.

731
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,716
Not age nor experience,

732
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,260
and certainly not green juice.

733
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:28,765
You're right.

734
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,393
Work isn't something you can do alone.

735
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,477
-Hey.
-Yes?

736
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:35,355
You should keep living life your own way.

737
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,606
Sorry?

738
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:44,239
Even if you've got no money nor dignity,
all you need is someone by your side.

739
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,451
You need people by your side.

740
00:54:58,753 --> 00:54:59,838
Excuse me.

741
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,387
Pardon me.

742
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:15,645
SHOE REPAIR SPECIALIST

743
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,405
Go and eat first, Dad.

744
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:27,574
Dad?

745
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,457
You need to eat better.

746
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:38,710
Let's go and eat a proper meal.

747
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,546
Dad?

748
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,051
You're so stingy.

749
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,887
Seriously, so stingy.

750
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,849
You don't even have time
to see your grandkid.

751
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:56,978
My wife didn't

752
00:55:58,354 --> 00:55:59,981
want you skipping any meals.

753
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:03,651
I'm off.

754
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:06,738
Stop eating that.

755
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,200
I'm off.

756
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:20,960
What are you doing?

757
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,379
Stop it.

758
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,509
Why are you giving this to me?

759
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:30,470
Don't make your wife work.
She just had a baby.

760
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,109
Thank…

761
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:32,115
What brings you here all of a sudden?

762
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:36,411
What are you trying to get me to do now?

763
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:37,912
We're now

764
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,290
going to export goods.

765
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:44,085
Export? I see. That's good these days.

766
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,254
But you need the right item.

767
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,465
Do you have someone in sales
at the company?

768
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:49,883
Well…

769
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:53,011
Ms. Oh is in charge.
She's now a senior staff member.

770
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:55,263
I see, Ms. Oh…

771
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,894
Okay, good luck.

772
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:02,937
You should join us.

773
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,737
With what?

774
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,113
We have the right item.

775
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,408
But I don't know how to start.

776
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:20,163
So, please teach me how to do my job.

777
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,795
No, I need to make money.
My second child was just born.

778
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:30,006
I need to make money too.
This is the only way how.

779
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:32,383
Your company is nothing but a name now.

780
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,093
It's still nice

781
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:36,721
having a company.

782
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,144
Here.

783
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,231
And I have you too.

784
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:50,735
What's this? What are you doing?

785
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:54,155
You have to bring that helmet
to the office tomorrow, got it?

786
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,950
We're in big trouble if you don't, okay?

787
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,576
Promise you will!

788
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:06,668
RÉSUMÉ

01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:34,881
Correct!

JERRY MACGYVER: YOU GOT IT RIGHT

796
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,810
Okay, three in a row!

797
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,024
It's been eight hours.

798
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:55,652
It's hot.

799
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:04,327
SHAWSHANK EXEMPTION: I SHALL GET GOING NOW

800
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,666
If there's an expiration date
on this chat room,

801
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,459
I want it to be 10,000 years.

802
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,363
Good morning.

It's only been two years
since helmets became mandatory.

808
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,762
The law is going to be
much stricter this year.

809
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:29,555
When will the items arrive?

810
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,015
Who cares?

811
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:33,392
Mr. Kang and I will be going anyway,
so it doesn't matter.

812
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,019
I work in sales too.

813
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:36,771
What can you do?

814
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:38,648
Where do you make these connections?

815
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:41,275
The youngsters these days call it a club.

816
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,694
-The Nihakham Group heir will be there.
-Oh, hi.

817
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,071

818
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,113
Who are you?
