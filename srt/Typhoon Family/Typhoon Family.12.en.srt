00:00:42,772 --> 00:00:45,066
TYPHOON FAMILY

2
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,484
Break!

3
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:52,073
That was absolutely amazing!

4
00:00:52,156 --> 00:00:54,659
Please give them
another big round of applause!

5
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:04,836
That was amazing!

6
00:01:08,548 --> 00:01:12,468
I once asked Nam-mo
what was most precious to him.

7
00:01:13,678 --> 00:01:16,514
Soldiers, even as we speak right now,

8
00:01:16,598 --> 00:01:20,393
there is someone
who spends her nights up thinking of you.

9
00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:23,104
It's none other than your mothers.

10
00:01:24,772 --> 00:01:28,860
Back then, he chuckled,
asking why I asked him that question.

11
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:33,031
The forever refuge of our hearts.

12
00:01:33,114 --> 00:01:35,033
Let us call on her.

13
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:37,827
-Mother!
-Mother!

14
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:39,329
Here she is.

15
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:46,002
Thank you for coming today, ma'am.
Nice to meet you.

16
00:01:46,586 --> 00:01:49,422
-Why, hello.
-Yes, hello.

17
00:01:49,505 --> 00:01:52,216
You must've brought
lots of delicious food.

18
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:57,847
No, I didn't go through much trouble.
I just bought everything my son likes.

19
00:01:58,473 --> 00:02:00,099
-Is that so?
-Yes.

20
00:02:00,183 --> 00:02:02,602
Ma'am, can you brag
about how great your son is?

21
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:10,276
My son has very long limbs,
and he's good-looking.

22
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,697
He also has a melancholic look
in his eyes, which isn't a bad addition.

23
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:16,115
He's good-looking.

24
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:21,371
She can't seem to stop laughing
at the thought of meeting her son soon.

25
00:02:21,454 --> 00:02:22,664
-Right?
-Yes.

26
00:02:22,747 --> 00:02:27,794
If any of you think
this lady is your mother,

27
00:02:27,877 --> 00:02:29,212
come up on the stage.

28
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:30,672
Private Wang Nam-mo, sir!

29
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:32,548
Corporal Bae Song-jung!

30
00:02:37,345 --> 00:02:40,223
I am sure she is my mother!

31
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:42,100
Do you have a reason for that?

32
00:02:42,183 --> 00:02:44,978
Look at my long limbs
and melancholic eyes.

33
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:49,607
She has to be my mother!

34
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:51,317
What about you?

35
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:54,320
I already know
the lady back there is not my mother!

36
00:02:54,404 --> 00:02:55,947
Then why are you here?

37
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,949
I wanted to say something
to my girlfriend.

38
00:02:58,032 --> 00:03:01,536
Young-in, you're free
to go on dates for now.

39
00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:04,205
But let us reunite after 19 months!

40
00:03:05,123 --> 00:03:06,541
-Say it!
-Goodness.

41
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,543
Now, why are you here?

42
00:03:08,626 --> 00:03:10,586
My mother cannot cook!

43
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,798
I always made her breakfast
even before I was enlisted!

44
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:16,843
If she chose to buy takeout food
even on a day like this,

45
00:03:16,926 --> 00:03:19,887
I am perfectly sure that she is my mother!

46
00:03:21,305 --> 00:03:27,437
So, whose mother is she?
Let us all call her out here together.

47
00:03:28,146 --> 00:03:31,315
-Mother!
-Mother!

48
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:33,985
Here she is.

49
00:03:34,068 --> 00:03:36,487
Please give her a big hand.

50
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:38,156
Do you see your son up here?

51
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,491
Have you met your son?

52
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:43,494
-Nam-mo.
-Her son's here!

53
00:03:44,162 --> 00:03:46,873
Goodness, ma'am.

54
00:03:46,956 --> 00:03:48,583
-Oh, dear.
-Oh, my.

55
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,461
His legs must've given out
because he was too nervous.

56
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:53,004
Are you all right?

57
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:55,423
Did you gain weight? Why are you so heavy?

58
00:03:55,506 --> 00:03:57,759
-Good grief, you punk.
-Ma'am, please.

59
00:03:57,842 --> 00:03:59,177
Oh, my. What do I do now?

60
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,387
-You're with your son now.
-I'm sorry.

61
00:04:01,971 --> 00:04:04,682
Salute! I am Private Wang Nam-mo, ma'am!

62
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,976
Mother, please receive my bow!

63
00:04:08,603 --> 00:04:11,647
Her son is giving her a deep bow.

64
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,442
Look at how brave he is.

65
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:16,944
He's a proud soldier of the ROK.

66
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:18,863
He's such a gallant soldier.

67
00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:21,407
Ma'am, why don't you give him
the biggest hug?

68
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,746
Nam-mo.

69
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:29,457
Nam-mo…

70
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:34,837
But he didn't have to tell me
what was most precious to him.

71
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,384
And now, it's time to return home!

72
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:42,428
-Mom!
-Back then, it was such an easy question.

73
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:43,930
Thank you!

74
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:49,227
But now…

75
00:04:52,355 --> 00:04:53,564
Although it's one-sided.

76
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,404
It's my first unrequited love.

77
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:15,420
-Unrequited love?
-Yes, unrequited love.

78
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,507
My unrequited love for you starts today.

79
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,676
What should I do?
Do you think I'll do a good job?

80
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:26,764
Do whatever you want.
You don't have to ask me.

81
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:31,269
Wait for me, my dear unrequited love,
Ms. Oh Mi-seon.

82
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:38,901
-What makes you so confident?
-Because it's an unrequited love.

83
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:41,988
Be careful. Behind you.

84
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:53,124
If someone asked me
what is most precious to me now,

85
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:57,879
how should I answer that question?

86
00:05:58,421 --> 00:06:03,634
EPISODE 12:
MY REASON FOR LIVING

87
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:26,490
It's kind of off.

88
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,346
No, this won't work. It's too high.

89
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:00,024
Wang Nam-mo!

90
00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:03,194
Hey, Mom. When did you get here?

91
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:05,112
That darned guitar. I'd better…

92
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:11,369
Tae-poong's company went under,

93
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,830
but he's still the CEO.

94
00:07:20,044 --> 00:07:21,629
Good grief!

95
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:24,131
-Clean up everything.
-Have you eaten?

96
00:07:24,215 --> 00:07:26,551
-Do you want ramyeon?
-No, I don't want to eat.

97
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:29,053
My goodness. This place is messy.

98
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:30,721
What on earth is this?

99
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,441
THE CUSTOMER'S HAPPINESS IS OUR PRIDE

100
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:44,360
I'm leaving first. Goodbye.

101
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:45,486
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

102
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,071
-Bye.
-Look at that girl.

103
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:49,073
She's going to get a stomachache.

104
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,831
Nam-mo.

105
00:07:58,082 --> 00:07:59,667
Are you still writing music?

106
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:01,752
It's just a hobby.

107
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:06,507
Who's this girl?

108
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:08,926
What do you think?
She's your son's girlfriend.

109
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,761
-Your…
-Isn't she pretty?

110
00:08:10,845 --> 00:08:14,265
Don't fall for girls
just for their looks, please.

111
00:08:14,348 --> 00:08:17,059
Think about what really matters, you punk.

112
00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:19,520
You both look equally pretty.

113
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,026
Good grief. You fool!
I can't deal with this anymore.

114
00:08:25,109 --> 00:08:26,777
-Get rid of these.
-What's wrong, Mom?

115
00:08:26,861 --> 00:08:28,696
-Throw these away.
-What do you mean?

116
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,114
-I'll rip this out!
-No!

117
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,410
Are you all right?

118
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:37,913
Why did you suddenly come
and make a scene?

119
00:08:37,997 --> 00:08:40,791
-Are you hurt?
-Cut it out. I'm fine.

120
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:53,471
It's okay to date just anyone for now.

121
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:56,390
But you should be serious
when it comes to marriage, got it?

122
00:08:56,474 --> 00:08:57,683
Mom.

123
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:01,771
-What do you mean, "just anyone"?
-That girl…

124
00:09:03,272 --> 00:09:05,441
What do her parents do?

125
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:10,029
Which school did she graduate from?
Where does she live?

126
00:09:10,112 --> 00:09:11,989
She's just anyone if you don't know that!

127
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:14,950
Mom, I also don't have a dad
if you say it like that.

128
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:18,996
I barely got into a university,
and our family is penniless too!

129
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,581
Isn't that so?

130
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:22,667
You fool!

131
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,629
How dare you…

132
00:09:26,712 --> 00:09:29,507
How dare you talk like that to me?

133
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:34,804
Just go, Mom.

134
00:09:35,763 --> 00:09:37,598
Go home. I'm sleeping here tonight.

135
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:51,696
Do whatever you want.

136
00:09:56,992 --> 00:09:57,993
And you…

137
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,790
You better act wisely around that sly girl
named Oh Mi-ho or whatever.

138
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:13,676
How does she know her name?

139
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:38,576
Ma'am, it's still hot.

140
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:41,787
So blow on it first.

141
00:10:41,871 --> 00:10:44,582
Goodness, you're too kind.

142
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,210
-I appreciate it.
-Don't mention it.

143
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:49,420
It looks good.

144
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:53,424
Hey, Beom.

145
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:57,178
Wake up already.
Do you know what time it is?

146
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:58,637
Goodness, you're a mess.

147
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,182
Open your eyes, Beom.

148
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:04,351
Stay alert and watch out for cars.

149
00:11:04,435 --> 00:11:06,812
-Okay.
-Have a great day!

150
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:08,481
Tae-poong! Time to go to work!

151
00:11:08,564 --> 00:11:11,150
-I'm leaving!
-Okay, goodbye!

152
00:11:14,904 --> 00:11:18,157
Grandma, eat slowly.

153
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,993
Okay? You have to chew well
and eat slowly.

154
00:11:21,076 --> 00:11:22,244
Okay.

155
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:29,418
What's with him this early?

156
00:11:30,044 --> 00:11:32,379
-I'm leaving, Grandma.
-Bye.

157
00:11:39,678 --> 00:11:40,596
I'm going to work.

158
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,526
Little Ms. Oh.

159
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:55,069
Are you busy this week?

160
00:11:55,152 --> 00:11:56,612
Well, take a look at this.

161
00:11:59,031 --> 00:12:00,032
What?

162
00:12:00,115 --> 00:12:01,283
What's this?

163
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:07,665
It's a notice from the Green Mothers' Club

164
00:12:07,748 --> 00:12:11,377
for moms to stand in front of the school
with a flag for traffic control.

165
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,254
I could always fill in,

166
00:12:13,337 --> 00:12:16,173
but I thought it'd be better
if his pretty sister showed up.

167
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:22,930
Why did he fold it like this?

168
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:25,599
He's that thoughtful.

169
00:12:29,061 --> 00:12:30,145
Okay.

170
00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:32,231
I'm leaving.

171
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:35,484
Have a great day.

172
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:37,570
-Can we have six sandwiches to go?
-Sure.

173
00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:40,197
-We'll eat two here.
-Okay.

174
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:41,615
It's better when it's hot.

175
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:44,618
All done.

176
00:12:44,702 --> 00:12:45,953
Here.

177
00:12:46,036 --> 00:12:48,122
-Thank you.
-You got it on your hand.

178
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,499
Thank you.

179
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,626
I'm fine.

180
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:54,670
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

181
00:12:57,798 --> 00:12:59,258
-It's hot.
-Is it?

182
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:03,345
One second. We'll take a milk.

183
00:13:05,598 --> 00:13:07,141
-Go ahead.
-No, I'm fine.

184
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:15,649
You must enjoy my sandwich a lot.

185
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:18,152
Isn't she adorable when she eats?

186
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:20,070
I like her.

187
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:30,205
Thank you.

188
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:37,087
It was good, wasn't it?

189
00:13:37,171 --> 00:13:38,505
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes?

190
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:41,300
We're at work now.
You need to stop doing that.

191
00:13:41,383 --> 00:13:42,635
Stop doing what?

192
00:13:42,718 --> 00:13:44,094
That.

193
00:13:46,513 --> 00:13:47,765
Your unrequited love.

194
00:13:52,895 --> 00:13:54,563
Separating work from my feelings.

195
00:13:56,065 --> 00:13:57,066
What a shame.

196
00:13:58,317 --> 00:13:59,693
-Okay?
-Yes, ma'am!

197
00:14:01,695 --> 00:14:03,072
-Thank you.
-Sure.

198
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:06,325
Wait.

199
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:09,703
Why are we the only ones eating?
What about you two?

200
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:12,790
-We already had one on our way here.
-Is that so?

201
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,377
Why didn't you have it with us?

202
00:14:17,044 --> 00:14:18,879
-Because of my love.
-What?

203
00:14:20,464 --> 00:14:22,299
-My love for a hot sandwich.
-Yes.

204
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:24,343
-I see.
-Enjoy.

205
00:14:24,927 --> 00:14:26,095
Thank you.

206
00:14:26,178 --> 00:14:27,388
I also have love…

207
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:30,849
for sandwiches loaded with sugar.

208
00:14:32,476 --> 00:14:33,978
I'm disappointed, Ms. Oh.

209
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:37,272
You missed my preference today.

210
00:14:38,607 --> 00:14:39,650
Sure.

211
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:45,489
Things seem slow here.

212
00:14:47,241 --> 00:14:51,495
You're all having some sandwich.
Is it good?

213
00:14:54,289 --> 00:14:58,502
The surgical gloves aren't manufactured
in three different places.

214
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:01,296
There's only one place in America.

215
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,883
That's monopoly.

216
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:06,927
So, who will benefit from this?

217
00:15:10,472 --> 00:15:13,350
Those punks had bottles
of expensive liquor,

218
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:15,811
then gave us no discount.

219
00:15:15,894 --> 00:15:17,980
They have a good reason not to, actually.

220
00:15:18,063 --> 00:15:22,443
Blaze Eagles are monopolizing
the powdered gloves industry right now.

221
00:15:22,526 --> 00:15:23,527
Monopolizing?

222
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,365
All right.
They're the only ones we can turn to.

223
00:15:31,035 --> 00:15:35,831
Typhoon Trading has probably realized
they're bust, right?

224
00:15:35,914 --> 00:15:38,876
They probably know they're bust.

225
00:15:41,754 --> 00:15:44,298
-Hey, get over here.
-Yes?

226
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:57,686
PURCHASE SPECIFICATION

227
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,979
We received an estimate,

228
00:15:59,063 --> 00:16:01,732
and their price is fixed,
regardless of quantity or conditions.

229
00:16:01,815 --> 00:16:04,026
They hold a monopoly
and face no competition,

230
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:06,153
so there's no reason to negotiate.

231
00:16:06,236 --> 00:16:08,155
This is a serious problem.

232
00:16:08,238 --> 00:16:10,574
If the cost price is the same,

233
00:16:11,158 --> 00:16:13,368
it's clearly an advantage
to Pyo Merchant Marine.

234
00:16:14,912 --> 00:16:16,914
Why? Because they have a vessel?

235
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:19,583
Not just that. They have a warehouse too.

236
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,461
Those two already cost a fortune.

237
00:16:22,544 --> 00:16:25,964
They may have a ship,
but it comes with an operation cost.

238
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:29,802
Why don't you run the numbers
with our profit margin at three percent?

239
00:16:35,265 --> 00:16:36,934
We'll only make 9.18 million won.

240
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:38,393
Goodness, that's too low.

241
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:40,938
Are there any other costs we can cut?

242
00:16:41,021 --> 00:16:44,525
We can cut on the warehouse cost
if we schedule everything perfectly.

243
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:46,401
The risk is too high for that plan.

244
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:49,029
Even the sea routes gets jammed sometimes.

245
00:16:49,113 --> 00:16:51,907
-Where's the factory? In America?
-Malaysia.

246
00:16:57,246 --> 00:16:58,497
Can we talk for a moment?

247
00:17:07,464 --> 00:17:10,551
-Why? What do you want?
-We have something to discuss.

248
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:11,927
Don't mind us and carry on.

249
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:16,598
This is my area.
You should knock before you enter.

250
00:17:17,724 --> 00:17:18,809
Are you two really friends?

251
00:17:19,393 --> 00:17:20,477
We'll leave soon.

252
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:25,190
Do you have to do this, Mr. Kang?

253
00:17:25,274 --> 00:17:28,277
-Pardon? But--
-I know.

254
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,737
We all worked very hard on this,

255
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:33,323
and we don't have
an alternative right now.

256
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:37,202
However, this is already a finished game.

257
00:17:38,036 --> 00:17:42,583
It was your first time bidding,
and bidding is all about money.

258
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,586
The starting line
is basically different for us and them.

259
00:17:46,837 --> 00:17:49,339
We're already seven to eight percent
behind Pyo Merchant Marine

260
00:17:49,423 --> 00:17:51,383
in logistical costs.

261
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:53,552
Forget about the three percent.

262
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:57,055
This kind of gap is difficult to make up
even if we sell it without profit.

263
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:01,768
Are you saying we should give up?

264
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,397
That's your decision to make as the CEO.

265
00:18:06,857 --> 00:18:08,901
Let's say we got lucky

266
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:12,571
and somehow landed the deal
without any profit margin.

267
00:18:12,654 --> 00:18:16,158
Then what? We have to sign the contract
and pay the security deposit.

268
00:18:16,241 --> 00:18:18,327
What will you use to pay that amount?

269
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:20,913
You know where that money is from.

270
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:25,209
I do. It's what we got
after moving out of our previous office.

271
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:29,755
Think wisely with both your heart and head
to make a sound decision.

272
00:18:30,505 --> 00:18:31,673
It must be a burden.

273
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:37,012
But I guess that's the weight
you must carry as the CEO.

274
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:40,849
The weight of five people
who depend on you to make our living.

275
00:18:50,984 --> 00:18:53,570
Hey, Tae-poong. I'm against that.

276
00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:56,990
You won't give up until the end, will you?

277
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:00,327
That's the attitude that suits you.

278
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,506
SHIPMENT, DEPARTURE, ARRIVAL,
DELIVERY, STORAGE, BID PRICE

279
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:14,466
Is there really no way around this?

280
00:19:15,842 --> 00:19:18,262
We're at different starting lines.

281
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:20,764
The starting lines.

282
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:25,978
-Hey.
-The starting…

283
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:27,354
You're still here?

284
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:29,356
Yes, I had to think about something.

285
00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:32,234
Thinking is a wonderful thing.

286
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:38,031
Have I run out already?
I thought I had enough.

287
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:42,202
I always had this at wholesale price,

288
00:19:42,286 --> 00:19:44,579
so it feels too expensive
to buy it out there.

289
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,627
-Is there a huge difference?
-Quite a bit, actually.

290
00:19:53,297 --> 00:19:56,842
What about chicken?
Does that come at a wholesale price?

291
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:59,636
Yes, there's a business
that delivers only raw chicken.

292
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,221
That's where we get it.

293
00:20:01,305 --> 00:20:04,850
You know, we still used
high-quality chickens here.

294
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:06,226
By any chance…

295
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,480
By any chance, do you know a way to get it
even cheaper than the wholesale price?

296
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:13,233
Would I sit around like a bum if I knew?

297
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:17,738
How would you do that?
Go to the farm and slaughter chickens?

298
00:20:20,157 --> 00:20:21,158
The farm?

299
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,076
TYPHOON TRADING
PYO MERCHANT MARINE

300
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,123
If we have different starting lines,
why don't we pull up one more step?

301
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:30,542
Here's what I mean.

302
00:20:32,294 --> 00:20:34,087
Instead of the headquarters in America,

303
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:36,131
let's go straight
to the factory in Malaysia.

304
00:20:36,214 --> 00:20:39,009
FACTORY - COST

305
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:43,680
Then, we'll get it at a cheaper price.

306
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:46,808
Would Blaze Eagles let this slide?

307
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:50,270
It's all right.
That's not the only client they work with.

308
00:20:52,356 --> 00:20:54,608
That's a relief. We might have a chance.

309
00:20:56,568 --> 00:20:58,820
Should I find out
the factory's phone number?

310
00:20:58,904 --> 00:21:01,740
No, it'd be better
to go in person instead of calling.

311
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:06,119
The bidding is in two days,
and you should be there, Mr. Kang.

312
00:21:06,203 --> 00:21:09,998
Of course, someone else
will have to go to Malaysia.

313
00:21:29,684 --> 00:21:30,685
Please?

314
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:33,688
You want to swap shifts with me?
Are you going somewhere?

315
00:21:33,772 --> 00:21:37,150
-I have to go to my brother's school.
-That little boy?

316
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,945
I already have plans.

317
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:42,572
-Please? Just this once.
-Jeez.

318
00:21:43,532 --> 00:21:44,699
All right.

319
00:21:45,325 --> 00:21:46,660
It's my turn next, okay?

320
00:21:47,327 --> 00:21:50,372
Really? Thank you so much.
I'll treat you twice next time.

321
00:21:50,455 --> 00:21:51,456
Go, now.

322
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,917
Thank you. I'm leaving!

323
00:22:00,674 --> 00:22:03,343
Does she not have family?

324
00:22:03,427 --> 00:22:05,762
She lives with her grandma,
but she has dementia.

325
00:22:06,638 --> 00:22:07,556
Dementia?

326
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:09,307
Once her older sister gets married,

327
00:22:09,391 --> 00:22:11,893
her grandma and younger brother
will be her responsibility.

328
00:22:13,478 --> 00:22:15,188
That poor girl.

329
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,860
-Have a great day.
-All right. Thanks, bye.

330
00:22:47,137 --> 00:22:48,138
Goodness.

331
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,102
Oh, my. Does this even cover anything?

332
00:22:55,395 --> 00:22:56,771
It looks more like a mask.

333
00:22:59,524 --> 00:23:00,567
Jeez.

334
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:23,298
-Nam-mo.
-Yes?

335
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:24,591
What do you think?

336
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,676
Let's see.

337
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,179
This doesn't look like your style, Mi-ho.

338
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:32,307
How do I put this? It's for older…

339
00:23:33,016 --> 00:23:36,186
-No, it's a mature style.
-Really?

340
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:39,481
Will I look like his mom?

341
00:23:42,817 --> 00:23:44,736
Excuse me. Coming through.

342
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:48,281
Nam…

343
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:55,622
My back hurts.

344
00:23:55,705 --> 00:23:56,748
-Nam-mo.
-Yes?

345
00:23:56,831 --> 00:23:59,793
-Is that all she has to wear?
-Mi-ho.

346
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:01,253
I love it when you do that.

347
00:24:01,336 --> 00:24:03,713
-But I'm gross and sweaty now.
-No, not at all.

348
00:24:03,797 --> 00:24:05,131
She's wiping sweat with her hand?

349
00:24:05,215 --> 00:24:07,425
-You're so wet!
-Doesn't she have a handkerchief?

350
00:24:08,385 --> 00:24:10,470
Great, I'm all recharged now. One moment.

351
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,391
My gosh.

352
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:20,063
Now, where am I headed next?

353
00:24:20,689 --> 00:24:22,899
The next stop? Let me help you.

354
00:24:23,525 --> 00:24:26,486
All right.

355
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:33,576
Wow! Made in America.

356
00:24:38,581 --> 00:24:40,709
Awesome.

357
00:24:43,628 --> 00:24:45,547
I even love the popping sound.

358
00:24:50,593 --> 00:24:54,097
-American juice surely is good.
-It is good. Yes.

359
00:24:55,056 --> 00:25:00,395
Mr. Pyo still believes all these
are on their way to the PPS.

360
00:25:00,478 --> 00:25:03,606
We need to make space for the gloves.

361
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,400
-Just pull them out.
-Yes, sir.

362
00:25:06,443 --> 00:25:08,737
And we can always sell these somewhere.

363
00:25:09,863 --> 00:25:12,365
My friend is the son
of Center Department Store's CEO.

364
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:14,284
-Reach out to them.
-Yes, sir.

365
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:17,120
Okay, we're all done here.

366
00:25:20,665 --> 00:25:22,417
Did you run the numbers on our bid?

367
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,086
Yes, I ran the numbers
with our bidding price

368
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,089
at a profit margin of 12%.

369
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:29,632
-At 12%?
-Yes, sir.

370
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:33,928
Jeez.

371
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:35,388
That sounds too high.

372
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:38,725
-Did you want to make money with this?
-No, sir.

373
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:44,147
Mr. Pyo, we already have the upper hand
because of the logistics costs,

374
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,316
and we need this profit
to run the business--

375
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,194
Stop racking your brains
and drop the price.

376
00:25:52,989 --> 00:25:54,741
Let's play it safe.

377
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:05,168
It is good.

378
00:26:05,251 --> 00:26:07,712
-Mr. Ha!
-Yes, sir! I just gave it a taste.

379
00:26:09,172 --> 00:26:11,383
MALAYSIA

380
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:42,247
I'll get it.

381
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,873
Hello, you've reached Typhoon Trading.

382
00:26:43,957 --> 00:26:45,667
-It's me.
-It's Mr. Bae!

383
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,294
Hey, put him on speaker.

384
00:26:48,378 --> 00:26:50,463
Hello? Can you hear me?

385
00:26:50,547 --> 00:26:53,425
Yes, we can. Did you arrive?

386
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:54,509
What?

387
00:26:55,385 --> 00:26:57,929
No, I haven't eaten anything yet.

388
00:26:58,012 --> 00:27:01,015
Did you hurt your ears?
Did you get into an accident?

389
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:02,892
That's not what's important.

390
00:27:02,976 --> 00:27:04,436
I came, and there's huge trouble.

391
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:06,271
The factories have changed.

392
00:27:06,354 --> 00:27:09,524
What? The factories have changed?

393
00:27:09,607 --> 00:27:12,277
Yes, the head office
called off the contract,

394
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,571
so this factory now makes pillows.

395
00:27:14,654 --> 00:27:15,864
It's three for 10,000 won.

396
00:27:15,947 --> 00:27:19,576
-Pillows? Like for sleeping?
-What about the gloves?

397
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:21,494
They don't make the gloves here.

398
00:27:21,578 --> 00:27:23,246
It's now made on another island,

399
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:27,333
but this country
has well over 800 islands.

400
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:28,877
But tomorrow's the bidding.

401
00:27:29,586 --> 00:27:30,753
It's on another island?

402
00:27:30,837 --> 00:27:35,049
When was the contract canceled
at that factory?

403
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:38,470
I heard it was quite recent,
but I don't have a way of finding out…

404
00:27:38,553 --> 00:27:39,846
-Hello?
-Hello?

405
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,098
Can you hear me? Hello?

406
00:27:42,932 --> 00:27:44,017
-Hello?
-Mr. Bae!

407
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,143
-Mr. Bae!
-Mr. Bae!

408
00:27:46,352 --> 00:27:47,604
-Mr. Bae!
-It was cut off.

409
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:49,898
-It got cut off.
-You can't get him back now.

410
00:27:51,649 --> 00:27:54,068
It took so many tries to get through!

CHANGJEON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

412
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,544
-Oh, wow.
-Look.

413
00:28:11,628 --> 00:28:15,298
-Whose mom is that? She's really pretty.
-What are you talking about?

414
00:28:18,676 --> 00:28:21,095
PLEASE STOP AT THE LINE

415
00:28:22,722 --> 00:28:23,598
She's my sister.

416
00:28:24,265 --> 00:28:26,309
She's my sister
who's much better than any mom.

"PLAINS OF HOPE" BIDDING DAY

421
00:29:09,894 --> 00:29:11,437
Has Mr. Bae reached out?

422
00:29:12,188 --> 00:29:15,108
He called, but the call
keeps getting disconnected.

423
00:29:15,191 --> 00:29:18,111
There was something I asked him to do,
but it's not easy to reach him.

424
00:29:18,194 --> 00:29:20,029
What can we do now?

425
00:29:20,113 --> 00:29:22,949
We have to go.
Otherwise, we'll lose the bid bond.

426
00:29:23,032 --> 00:29:28,538
Yes, we'll go and bid at a very high price
or do our best and lose heroically.

427
00:29:29,998 --> 00:29:31,749
Let's go there for now and wait.

428
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:34,878
I know he'll do
whatever it takes to reach out to us.

429
00:29:49,893 --> 00:29:50,852

WE WILL SUPPORT
NEW SMES' ENTRY INTO THE MARKET

432
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,410
Keep it up.

433
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:10,163
Drop the shoulders.

434
00:30:10,246 --> 00:30:11,581
-Looking great.
-Good.

435
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:16,586
You're good. You're loosening up.

436
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:18,796
Excellent. Great posture.

437
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,673
-You're all good.
-You're good.

438
00:30:20,757 --> 00:30:22,091
Try not to move your wrist.

439
00:30:22,175 --> 00:30:25,553
Don't let anyone guess
what you're writing. Make it discreet.

440
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:26,763
-Okay.
-Good.

441
00:30:28,097 --> 00:30:30,725
-Where there's a will, there's a way.
-What now?

442
00:30:30,808 --> 00:30:32,268
Where there's a will, there's a way.

443
00:30:32,352 --> 00:30:34,103
-Okay. All right.
-Okay.

444
00:30:34,687 --> 00:30:37,440
We cannot have any problems from A to Z.

445
00:30:37,523 --> 00:30:39,984
-All right?
-Impressive. You have grown.

446
00:30:40,068 --> 00:30:40,902
Mr. Kang.

447
00:30:40,985 --> 00:30:42,070
-Yes!
-Yes!

448
00:30:42,153 --> 00:30:45,365
Mr. Kang, take a look at this.
If you get confused, choose one from here.

449
00:30:45,448 --> 00:30:48,242
I ran the numbers
from 5% profit margin to 15%.

450
00:30:48,826 --> 00:30:51,162
Hey, Ms. Oh, this is even more confusing.

451
00:30:51,245 --> 00:30:53,581
Mr. Kang, let me share my secret with you.

452
00:30:56,292 --> 00:31:00,463
KANG TAE-POONG

453
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:03,132
One, two, three, four. One, two…

454
00:31:06,594 --> 00:31:07,637
Thirteen.

455
00:31:15,103 --> 00:31:17,313
Okay, this is it.

456
00:31:17,397 --> 00:31:18,356
Go with this number.

457
00:31:19,232 --> 00:31:21,317
-You want me to take the fifth option, 9%?
-Yes.

458
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:23,903
-Bid that number.
-Are you serious?

459
00:31:24,487 --> 00:31:25,405
Mr. Koo.

460
00:31:25,488 --> 00:31:27,991
If you keep this up,
you'll end up in hell.

461
00:31:28,074 --> 00:31:29,283
That paper has been blessed.

462
00:31:31,744 --> 00:31:36,124
What a bunch of bums.
You all are such a joke.

463
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:40,962
Are you trying to be
the terrifying underdogs?

464
00:31:43,006 --> 00:31:44,674
You look way too serious.

465
00:31:44,757 --> 00:31:46,634
Hey, Freckles.

466
00:31:47,802 --> 00:31:49,012
You're the female lead.

467
00:31:50,972 --> 00:31:54,017
-Don't look that way.
-What's going on here?

468
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,893
This isn't a flea market.

469
00:31:55,977 --> 00:31:58,438
Is the entire staff
of Typhoon Trading here?

470
00:31:58,521 --> 00:31:59,522
Good grief!

471
00:31:59,605 --> 00:32:01,941
I want to see only two here,
just like them.

472
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:03,401
The rest can wait outside.

473
00:32:03,484 --> 00:32:04,861
He hasn't called, right?

474
00:32:05,486 --> 00:32:06,779
Buy some time.

475
00:32:07,488 --> 00:32:08,406
Stall for time.

476
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:10,825
Excuse me. I have a question.

477
00:32:10,908 --> 00:32:14,328
Do you have a policy of keeping only two?
I haven't seen it. Why two?

478
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:15,872
Could you tell me the reason?

479
00:32:15,955 --> 00:32:17,415
-I don't see it.
-It's not in here.

480
00:32:17,498 --> 00:32:18,583
Why should only two remain?

481
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:19,792
-There's no rule.
-Right?

482
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:21,127
Get out of here. Now!

483
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,629
You have to tell me why.
I can't leave without a reason.

484
00:32:23,713 --> 00:32:25,923
My goodness. She's so stubborn.
This is killing me.

485
00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:27,759
She just told you to leave!

486
00:32:27,842 --> 00:32:29,135
We need more time.

487
00:32:30,595 --> 00:32:33,014
-Where is that rule? Two people?
-I don't see it.

488
00:32:33,097 --> 00:32:34,932
-I don't see it.
-I have to pray now.

489
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,393
What? You have to pray!

490
00:32:37,477 --> 00:32:39,979
I'm sorry to ask,
but I must be here alone.

491
00:32:40,063 --> 00:32:41,898
-May I have some privacy?
-Hey, look.

492
00:32:41,981 --> 00:32:43,483
-He has to pray to live.
-He does.

493
00:32:43,566 --> 00:32:45,485
Hey, you can't do this!

494
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,528
-This guy?
-Get them out of here.

495
00:32:47,612 --> 00:32:48,488
He's a Buddhist.

496
00:32:48,571 --> 00:32:50,281
-One second.
-He has to pray right now.

497
00:32:50,364 --> 00:32:51,240
He has to pray now.

498
00:32:51,324 --> 00:32:52,158
Mister!

499
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:55,244
Get him out of here!

500
00:32:56,412 --> 00:32:58,289
-When we're upset
-When we're upset

501
00:32:58,372 --> 00:32:59,207
What's he doing?

502
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,541
-He's not done.
-No.

503
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:03,544
-You can't do this here!
-Stop bothering him!

504
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:05,046
You have to get up.

505
00:33:05,129 --> 00:33:06,130
Get out.

506
00:33:06,214 --> 00:33:09,008
-We have to start bidding.
-Bless you!

507
00:33:09,092 --> 00:33:10,718
Follow your heart.

508
00:33:10,802 --> 00:33:12,929
-You have to leave now!
-Why do we have to go?

509
00:33:13,596 --> 00:33:15,848
-What is wrong with you?
-My gosh!

510
00:33:18,351 --> 00:33:19,602
We'll begin now!

511
00:33:29,904 --> 00:33:31,239
We will begin the bidding.

512
00:33:33,074 --> 00:33:34,742
The bidding ends at 11:15 a.m.

513
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:43,918
BIDDER: PYO MERCHANT MARINE
AMOUNT: 433,444,043 WON

514
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:48,047
Yes, sir.

515
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:53,427
Hey, what are you doing?

516
00:33:54,262 --> 00:33:55,346
Are you scared?

517
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,058
Let me give you a hint.

518
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:01,269
Try begging and say, "Please."

519
00:34:01,352 --> 00:34:02,478
Please.

520
00:34:06,482 --> 00:34:09,610
Hey, you need to start thinking
with some common sense.

521
00:34:09,694 --> 00:34:13,489
You don't do business
by pulling petty tricks.

522
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:16,117
You do it with money.

523
00:34:17,201 --> 00:34:20,872
But you have no money,
no warehouse, and no ship,

524
00:34:20,955 --> 00:34:24,000
which makes you a loser
from the beginning.

525
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:28,212
-Let's go, Mr. Pyo.
-Okay.

526
00:34:29,046 --> 00:34:30,047
All right.

527
00:34:31,257 --> 00:34:33,092
You've lost.

528
00:34:40,183 --> 00:34:41,267
Here.

529
00:34:48,065 --> 00:34:49,233
And here.

530
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,653
Lastly, here.

531
00:34:54,947 --> 00:34:56,324
Why is this so complicated?

532
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:41,452
Mr. Kang.

533
00:35:41,953 --> 00:35:43,996
You need to start writing now. Do it.

534
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,290
We still have some time.

535
00:35:46,374 --> 00:35:48,292
Just a little more.

536
00:35:48,376 --> 00:35:51,671
-I'm sure he'll reach out.
-Okay.

537
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:54,066
Officer.

538
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,198
-A telegram came.
-A telegram?

539
00:37:01,282 --> 00:37:02,575
-For me?
-No.

540
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:05,119
-Mr. Kang Tae-poong?
-Yes!

541
00:37:06,912 --> 00:37:10,833
How important was that telegram
that it had to be sent here?

542
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:12,418
-A family event?
-Please leave.

543
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:13,919
Wait.

544
00:37:14,003 --> 00:37:16,839
This is unfair.
There are only three minutes left.

545
00:37:16,922 --> 00:37:18,090
Wait, it's…

546
00:37:19,091 --> 00:37:20,426
It's very urgent.

547
00:37:21,802 --> 00:37:24,180
-It's my father--
-He died, you punk.

548
00:37:24,722 --> 00:37:26,515
His deeply beloved wife, my mother.

549
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:30,102
Goodness gracious. How important is this?

550
00:37:30,186 --> 00:37:32,438
I'm getting curious. Read it.

551
00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:34,482
Cut the crap. Open it now.

552
00:37:34,565 --> 00:37:36,901
-Open it now!
-Right? I'll do that.

553
00:37:36,984 --> 00:37:39,195
I wanted to open it. I'll do it.

554
00:37:39,945 --> 00:37:42,239
TO KANG TAE-POONG,
SEOUL PUBLIC PROCUREMENT OFFICE

555
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,745
"Five, one, one, one, stop.
Four, zero, stop. Okay, stop."

556
00:37:47,828 --> 00:37:48,871
What is this?

557
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:58,172
-Is this…
-It sounds like a code.

558
00:37:58,255 --> 00:37:59,757
-Right?
-Is he a spy?

559
00:38:01,342 --> 00:38:02,301
I know.

560
00:38:02,385 --> 00:38:05,054
"Work five days a week,
every hour and minute for 40 years, okay?"

561
00:38:07,973 --> 00:38:09,642
I don't think that's it.

562
00:38:12,311 --> 00:38:14,980
It's about time you wrapped up everything.

563
00:38:15,064 --> 00:38:18,609
We have a while…
Oh, no! We have a minute left.

564
00:38:18,692 --> 00:38:20,194
You have a minute to make your bid.

565
00:38:20,277 --> 00:38:22,029
Please hurry.

566
00:38:32,206 --> 00:38:33,624
BIDDING APPLICATION

567
00:38:38,796 --> 00:38:41,465
-I'm on my way.
-It must be sealed!

568
00:38:41,549 --> 00:38:43,551
-Right.
-You have to seal it tightly first.

569
00:38:43,634 --> 00:38:44,468
Sealing.

570
00:38:45,136 --> 00:38:46,595
-Stay calm.
-Tightly.

571
00:38:47,179 --> 00:38:48,222
Sealing tightly.

572
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:50,433
-Stay calm.
-Sealing.

573
00:38:52,017 --> 00:38:53,769
-And I need your seal.
-Yes, of course.

574
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:56,188
-The seal. The inkpad.
-The inkpad.

575
00:39:03,195 --> 00:39:05,406
Why the heck is she so strong?

576
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,285
Two.

577
00:39:10,536 --> 00:39:12,455
-All right.
-Three.

578
00:39:20,004 --> 00:39:21,547
We did it!

579
00:39:29,221 --> 00:39:30,389
-Good work.
-Sure.

580
00:39:31,182 --> 00:39:32,224
Great job.

581
00:40:01,545 --> 00:40:03,005
The old geezers are here.

582
00:40:05,966 --> 00:40:08,177
We'll sit here.

583
00:40:12,806 --> 00:40:14,767
Now, the bidding has ended.

584
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,936
Let me announce the winning vendor.

585
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:23,901
The vendor that made the winning bid
for three million surgical gloves is…

586
00:40:52,304 --> 00:40:54,390
The winner is

587
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,433
Typhoon Trading.

588
00:40:59,812 --> 00:41:02,022
-All right!
-Yes!

589
00:41:03,148 --> 00:41:04,567
-My gosh!
-Yes!

590
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,570
-We did it!
-Yes!

591
00:41:08,946 --> 00:41:09,947
Cut the crap!

592
00:41:10,573 --> 00:41:13,576
-That doesn't make any sense!
-See it for yourself then.

593
00:41:13,659 --> 00:41:17,288
-We won
-We won

594
00:41:17,371 --> 00:41:19,331
-See it for yourself.
-We got it!

595
00:41:19,415 --> 00:41:22,126
-Hey, get that from him later.
-Yes, ma'am.

596
00:41:22,209 --> 00:41:26,130
PYO MERCHANT MARINE: 433,444,043 WON
TYPHOON TRADING: 428,580,315 WON

597
00:41:26,213 --> 00:41:27,590
This can't be.

598
00:41:30,342 --> 00:41:32,428
Let me take that if you're done.

599
00:41:35,097 --> 00:41:36,932
They couldn't have bid that price.

600
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:40,019
This is bad.

601
00:41:45,274 --> 00:41:48,277
We won, so let's get out of here.
Let's go back to the office. Hold hands.

602
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,071
Let's leave quickly
before they raise an objection.

603
00:41:51,155 --> 00:41:52,823
Let's go. I'll order tangsuyuk.

604
00:41:52,906 --> 00:41:53,991
-Really?
-Yes.

605
00:41:54,074 --> 00:41:56,327
Great work.

606
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:59,246
It's all thanks to Mr. Bae.

607
00:42:00,164 --> 00:42:04,918
-So when was the contract canceled?
-They said it's been about ten days.

608
00:42:05,002 --> 00:42:06,128
-Ten days?
-Ten days?

609
00:42:06,211 --> 00:42:09,089
That means they couldn't have removed
the gloves in stock.

610
00:42:09,173 --> 00:42:11,258
Mr. Bae, do they have them in stock?

611
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:13,135
What? The stock?

612
00:42:13,218 --> 00:42:15,095
They don't just have a little in stock.

613
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:17,806
There are over 5,000 boxes,
5,111 to be exact.

614
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:21,143
-Then let's take everything.
-Let's do that.

615
00:42:21,226 --> 00:42:24,855
The problem is the price.
I don't know how much to offer.

616
00:42:24,938 --> 00:42:28,150
-Well, you can go with--
-We have to lowball them.

617
00:42:28,233 --> 00:42:29,526
Go for like 60%, maybe 70%.

618
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:31,236
-We shouldn't do that.
-How about 59%?

619
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,656
No, I think we should
take our time to negotiate.

620
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:34,615
Hello?

621
00:42:35,157 --> 00:42:36,033
-Hello?
-Hello?

622
00:42:36,116 --> 00:42:37,451
-Mr. Kang?
-Hello?

623
00:42:37,534 --> 00:42:39,119
-Mr. Bae.
-Hello?

624
00:42:39,203 --> 00:42:41,372
-Hello?
-Mr. Bae?

625
00:42:41,997 --> 00:42:44,375
-Bae Song-jung?
-Where did he go? Hello?

626
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:46,377
Jeez.

627
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,705
That's going to get me in trouble.

628
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:46,353
TELEGRAM

629
00:43:46,437 --> 00:43:50,232
"Five, one, one, one, stop.
Four, zero, stop. Okay, stop."

630
00:43:50,315 --> 00:43:51,150
What is this?

631
00:43:51,233 --> 00:43:53,026
They don't just have a little in stock.

632
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:55,404
There are over 5,000 boxes,
5,111 to be exact.

633
00:44:01,785 --> 00:44:03,328
We got it!

634
00:44:18,635 --> 00:44:20,888
STANDARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT
CONTRACTOR: TYPHOON TRADING

635
00:44:23,724 --> 00:44:25,100
Are you that happy?

636
00:44:26,143 --> 00:44:27,728
We can make a living now.

637
00:44:28,645 --> 00:44:31,815
People might think
you've been starving all along.

638
00:44:37,154 --> 00:44:38,906
Don't smile like that.

639
00:44:39,782 --> 00:44:40,616
You're too pretty.

640
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,661
No, it's after hours,
so you can be pretty.

641
00:44:47,331 --> 00:44:48,332
You know…

642
00:44:50,959 --> 00:44:53,045
It's hard to separate work from feelings.

643
00:44:53,962 --> 00:44:55,005
Jeez.

644
00:44:57,216 --> 00:44:59,635
So, is Mr. Bae coming back tomorrow?

645
00:45:01,303 --> 00:45:02,304
Yes.

646
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:07,893
Where did you get the idea
that the factory would have stocks left?

647
00:45:08,852 --> 00:45:12,022
From three aspects of sales,
clients, revenue, and…

648
00:45:12,105 --> 00:45:13,482
-Inventory.
-Precisely.

649
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:15,734
You know that well.

650
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:20,989
But you know, lowballing them was a bit…

651
00:45:22,074 --> 00:45:24,368
-Was that awful?
-No, it was way too cool!

652
00:45:25,285 --> 00:45:26,537
I knew it.

653
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:29,456
That's why
you're Typhoon Trading's trader.

654
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:31,917
Thank you.

655
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,460
-Sure.
-Thank you.

656
00:45:46,932 --> 00:45:49,601
What's the most precious to you, Ms. Oh?

657
00:45:52,479 --> 00:45:54,606
I don't know. I've never thought about it.

658
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,193
Well…

659
00:45:59,778 --> 00:46:03,949
Rice and briquettes
are both very precious.

660
00:46:05,909 --> 00:46:07,077
But you know,

661
00:46:09,746 --> 00:46:10,831
to me, it's tomorrow.

662
00:46:12,457 --> 00:46:13,500
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

663
00:46:14,418 --> 00:46:18,589
In the past, I could endure today
only by thinking that there's tomorrow.

664
00:46:20,215 --> 00:46:21,675
But it's a bit different now.

665
00:46:24,344 --> 00:46:26,013
When tomorrow comes,

666
00:46:27,806 --> 00:46:30,517
I will have learned some more
and reflected a bit more,

667
00:46:32,269 --> 00:46:35,272
so I could become
slightly better than I am today.

668
00:46:39,443 --> 00:46:42,070
What about you?
What's the most precious to you?

669
00:46:44,531 --> 00:46:45,532
Me?

670
00:46:50,078 --> 00:46:51,079
To me…

671
00:47:05,385 --> 00:47:06,928
The most precious thing is…

672
00:47:13,727 --> 00:47:15,228
I can't tell you yet.

673
00:47:15,312 --> 00:47:16,730
I'll tell you later.

674
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:39,961
Darn it.

675
00:47:40,045 --> 00:47:41,713
This again. Jeez.

676
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:44,508
It's such a mess.

677
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:53,767
Thank you.

678
00:47:57,187 --> 00:47:59,147
My dear Nam-mo must be looking for you.

679
00:48:00,357 --> 00:48:01,358
Yes.

680
00:48:05,904 --> 00:48:09,074
-Sorry?
-I am Nam-mo's mother.

681
00:48:10,784 --> 00:48:13,161
And you better throw that away.

682
00:48:15,497 --> 00:48:18,917
I was going to throw it away.

683
00:48:20,168 --> 00:48:24,798
Hey, can we chat for a moment?

684
00:48:28,802 --> 00:48:32,222
Well, may I buy you food somewhere?

685
00:48:35,392 --> 00:48:38,562
When you address your elder,
use proper words like "treat" and "meal."

686
00:48:38,645 --> 00:48:39,771
Okay.

687
00:48:41,189 --> 00:48:45,694
And it's not going to be a long chat,
so let me make it quick right here.

688
00:48:47,487 --> 00:48:49,364
I don't want you to date Nam-mo.

689
00:48:53,076 --> 00:48:55,662
-Sorry?
-It must feel too sudden, right?

690
00:48:56,955 --> 00:49:00,959
But I thought I should make
something like this loud and clear.

691
00:49:02,836 --> 00:49:06,840
Nam-mo is a kid who always does as I say,

692
00:49:06,923 --> 00:49:09,384
so I'll convince him the best I can.

693
00:49:09,468 --> 00:49:10,719
So,

694
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:17,017
stop seeing each other
before it gets more serious, okay?

695
00:49:17,684 --> 00:49:18,727
Let's do that.

696
00:49:21,563 --> 00:49:22,564
Why?

697
00:49:24,191 --> 00:49:25,192
What do you mean?

698
00:49:25,275 --> 00:49:27,194
Why do you hate me?

699
00:49:27,277 --> 00:49:30,030
No, it's not that I hate you.

700
00:49:30,113 --> 00:49:33,909
It's different from hating you.
It's not hatred, but…

701
00:49:35,285 --> 00:49:36,411
Gosh.

702
00:49:38,914 --> 00:49:40,165
You are…

703
00:49:46,421 --> 00:49:49,883
You're extremely poor, aren't you?

704
00:49:52,803 --> 00:49:54,721
And your parents aren't with you.

705
00:49:54,805 --> 00:49:59,142
Your grandmother has dementia,
and your brother is still very young.

706
00:50:00,769 --> 00:50:02,437
I have an older sister too.

707
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,982
Right. I see.

708
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,444
But you know, once she gets married,

709
00:50:10,904 --> 00:50:12,405
she's as good as a stranger.

710
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:18,203
When that happens, your remaining family
will become my son's responsibility.

711
00:50:18,286 --> 00:50:21,164
He doesn't have the ability
to handle that kind of life.

712
00:50:21,915 --> 00:50:24,459
When that happens,
I'll end up with the burden,

713
00:50:24,543 --> 00:50:26,002
but I can't handle that either.

714
00:50:27,879 --> 00:50:29,047
You know it, don't you?

715
00:50:30,423 --> 00:50:31,591
Poverty…

716
00:50:33,134 --> 00:50:35,637
is like a joint guarantee
without a contract.

717
00:50:36,805 --> 00:50:39,057
That's why I'm scared of it.

718
00:50:42,018 --> 00:50:44,354
I don't plan to give him my burden.

719
00:50:45,981 --> 00:50:47,107
That…

720
00:50:50,485 --> 00:50:51,945
is easier said than done.

721
00:50:59,202 --> 00:51:00,328
Miss.

722
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,709
When I was younger than Nam-mo's age now,

723
00:51:08,295 --> 00:51:09,629
I became a widow.

724
00:51:13,008 --> 00:51:15,135
People around me pitied me

725
00:51:15,218 --> 00:51:18,555
and treated me nicely
when they were with me.

726
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:22,183
But they were saying behind my back
I had bad luck.

727
00:51:23,101 --> 00:51:24,352
It felt so unfair.

728
00:51:27,689 --> 00:51:28,982
But what can I do?

729
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,401
That's how the world works.

730
00:51:33,695 --> 00:51:34,779
Ms. Oh Mi-ho.

731
00:51:35,614 --> 00:51:39,075
Since you and I are the unfortunate ones,

732
00:51:40,702 --> 00:51:41,870
let's avoid each other.

733
00:51:42,746 --> 00:51:43,788
Please.

734
00:51:44,497 --> 00:51:45,498
Okay?

735
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:47,626
Mom.

736
00:51:50,712 --> 00:51:53,340
How did you… Why are you here?

737
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:58,303
Hey, why are you crying?

738
00:52:00,305 --> 00:52:03,808
-What did you say to her?
-I didn't say anything.

739
00:52:03,892 --> 00:52:05,018
What did you just say?

740
00:52:06,353 --> 00:52:07,896
I told her to stop seeing you.

741
00:52:09,773 --> 00:52:11,524
You too, get a grip!

742
00:52:12,776 --> 00:52:15,362
Your friend is a CEO
who wears a tie to work.

743
00:52:15,445 --> 00:52:18,156
Will you continue to haul
those bags of clothes every night?

744
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:19,866
Is that Mi-ho's fault? Is it?

745
00:52:20,575 --> 00:52:22,786
Why are you blaming someone else
for my incompetence?

746
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:26,373
Why are you blaming her
for our wrong life choices?

747
00:52:27,707 --> 00:52:29,376
-What?
-It's true!

748
00:52:29,459 --> 00:52:33,380
I had an impossible dream,
and you believed that total fraud's words.

749
00:52:34,047 --> 00:52:38,593
Mom, we ended up like this
not because of the world or other people.

750
00:52:38,677 --> 00:52:42,305
It's because we lived like fools!
Aren't I right?

751
00:52:43,682 --> 00:52:44,683
You…

752
00:52:46,101 --> 00:52:48,228
And you.
Are you going to break up with me?

753
00:52:49,771 --> 00:52:51,189
No, let me make this clear first.

754
00:52:51,272 --> 00:52:55,402
I don't care what my mom said.
I'm not leaving you, okay?

755
00:52:55,485 --> 00:52:58,029
-Enough is enough, Wang Nam-mo!
-What's enough?

756
00:52:58,113 --> 00:53:01,366
I don't plan to break up with Mi-ho,
so apologize to her right now!

757
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:03,535
You've lost your mind!

758
00:53:05,203 --> 00:53:06,454
I am…

759
00:53:16,423 --> 00:53:17,298
not sure anymore.

760
00:53:19,009 --> 00:53:20,010
Mi-ho.

761
00:53:21,386 --> 00:53:22,929
You're dating me, not my mom.

762
00:53:25,515 --> 00:53:26,516
Let's go.

763
00:53:31,855 --> 00:53:32,814
Wang Nam-mo!

764
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,235
If you take one more step,

765
00:53:39,112 --> 00:53:40,739
I will never see you again.

766
00:53:42,532 --> 00:53:43,533
Mom.

767
00:53:44,117 --> 00:53:46,411
I'm paying rent for the store
thanks to Tae-poong,

768
00:53:46,494 --> 00:53:49,039
and Tae-poong
is living off Mi-ho's family.

769
00:53:49,122 --> 00:53:51,124
Mi-ho is the best off among us!

770
00:53:51,207 --> 00:53:53,585
If anyone wants to break us up,
it should be her family!

771
00:54:11,186 --> 00:54:12,687
Let go of me.

772
00:54:13,521 --> 00:54:14,939
Let go.

773
00:54:16,357 --> 00:54:17,734
What do you want?

774
00:54:18,985 --> 00:54:20,528
Why are you mad?

775
00:54:22,822 --> 00:54:23,948
You need to go.

776
00:54:24,783 --> 00:54:27,285
I haven't decided
if I'll break up with you or not.

777
00:54:28,411 --> 00:54:31,915
So, I don't want to see you. Get lost!

778
00:54:31,998 --> 00:54:33,124
Hey, Mi-ho.

779
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:35,168
Why do you act tough when you're with me?

780
00:54:36,086 --> 00:54:38,713
You should've said everything
you wanted earlier, just like now.

781
00:54:39,506 --> 00:54:41,341
Why did you look like
you did something wrong?

782
00:54:41,925 --> 00:54:45,303
Don't just stand there like a fool
when someone messes with you!

783
00:54:45,386 --> 00:54:47,514
She's your mother!

784
00:54:50,517 --> 00:54:53,603
Yes, I am extremely poor.

785
00:54:55,271 --> 00:54:57,273
But I've never begged anyone for help.

786
00:54:58,358 --> 00:55:01,069
I've never coveted what wasn't mine.
My grandma…

787
00:55:02,987 --> 00:55:04,114
My grandma

788
00:55:06,116 --> 00:55:07,450
raised me like that.

789
00:55:09,077 --> 00:55:11,830
So, why would my sister be a stranger?
Why is my family a burden?

790
00:55:11,913 --> 00:55:14,290
What's so great about your family?

791
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,627
I speak better English than you,

792
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:20,255
and I worked at the department store
longer than your mom.

793
00:55:20,338 --> 00:55:22,715
So, how dare she talk and look down on me?

794
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,137
-What a weird woman.
-My mom said those things because--

795
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:33,268
I feel like a fool for not saying a word
just because she's your mom,

796
00:55:34,811 --> 00:55:36,896
so you need to get lost, please.

797
00:55:45,196 --> 00:55:46,197
One more thing.

798
00:55:47,198 --> 00:55:48,533
My life isn't unfortunate.

799
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,787
I may not have parents,
but I have three in my family.

800
00:55:54,497 --> 00:55:56,166
I may not have parents,

801
00:55:57,167 --> 00:56:01,588
but I have my grandma,
Beom, and my sister,

802
00:56:02,964 --> 00:56:04,716
whom I love very much.

803
00:56:09,762 --> 00:56:11,306
I'm sorry, Mi-ho.

804
00:56:14,475 --> 00:56:16,603
I'm so sorry
you had to hear that from her.

805
00:56:22,984 --> 00:56:26,321
BELLUA DEPARTMENT STORE

806
00:57:21,668 --> 00:57:23,670
Jeez! Enough!

807
00:57:25,463 --> 00:57:26,714
You idiot.

808
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:30,677
I thought you had stopped causing trouble,
but you ended up with this mess?

809
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,887
I'm also as pissed off as you are.

810
00:57:33,638 --> 00:57:36,349
-I'm much more irritated than you are!
-Irritated?

811
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,645
Your irritation doesn't matter.
Do you know how much the juice was?

812
00:57:41,229 --> 00:57:42,730
It was $150,000!

813
00:57:42,814 --> 00:57:45,191
How are you going to make up
over 200 million won of loss?

814
00:57:45,275 --> 00:57:46,234
Dad.

815
00:57:47,527 --> 00:57:49,821
-I have a plan too.
-What plan?

816
00:57:51,739 --> 00:57:53,616
You couldn't possibly have a plan!

817
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,452
If the department store returns it,
that'll be the end!

818
00:57:58,413 --> 00:58:00,748
You're…

819
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:12,885
I told Mr. Ha to remove your office.

820
00:58:13,803 --> 00:58:16,139
-Get ready to go to America.
-America?

821
00:58:19,309 --> 00:58:22,353
-And return the juice?
-Go there and study.

822
00:58:23,688 --> 00:58:24,856
You're nothing right now.

823
00:58:24,939 --> 00:58:27,275
You have such a long way to go.

824
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:29,193
-You can't do anything!
-Dad!

825
00:58:29,277 --> 00:58:31,112
It's not over yet.

826
00:58:31,696 --> 00:58:34,991
I may have taken a few jabs,
but one uppercut will end that punk.

827
00:58:35,074 --> 00:58:36,367
Business isn't like boxing.

828
00:58:36,451 --> 00:58:39,287
It doesn't matter
if you get beaten up and fall down.

829
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:43,333
-Whoever lasts longer in the ring wins!
-I don't care who lasts longer!

830
00:58:46,419 --> 00:58:48,004
I'll land a big blow on him

831
00:58:49,505 --> 00:58:51,299
and buy out the entire game.

832
00:59:05,563 --> 00:59:06,439
What is it?

833
00:59:06,981 --> 00:59:09,942
Why did you suddenly want to see me?
There's no business between us.

834
00:59:10,026 --> 00:59:11,027
Hey, lady.

835
00:59:13,613 --> 00:59:14,989
Darn it.

836
00:59:17,075 --> 00:59:21,245
Who do you think would feel
more humiliated if we were seen together?

837
00:59:21,329 --> 00:59:22,830
That's not what I mean.

838
00:59:23,665 --> 00:59:27,335
This situation is ridiculous.
Why should I meet you?

839
00:59:28,336 --> 00:59:29,337
You're a spy, right?

840
00:59:32,965 --> 00:59:34,717
What are you talking about?

841
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:39,639
I can't believe
you stabbed Tae-poong in the back.

842
00:59:40,223 --> 00:59:41,557
Stabbed him in the back?

843
00:59:41,641 --> 00:59:44,185
-I haven't done anything like that yet.
-"Yet"?

844
00:59:46,437 --> 00:59:48,147
That means you're planning to.

845
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,612
I saw something at my dad's desk.

846
00:59:55,571 --> 00:59:58,533
It had your home address,
the names of your family,

847
00:59:58,616 --> 01:00:00,618
and everything else written up there.

848
01:00:00,702 --> 01:00:04,706
I wonder what he's going to do.
It's a shame.

849
01:00:08,334 --> 01:00:10,461
I don't care
what that piece of paper says.

850
01:00:10,545 --> 01:00:12,130
What do you want from me?

851
01:00:13,297 --> 01:00:15,967
I'm sick and tired
of that promissory note!

852
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:18,511
Promissory note?

853
01:00:26,185 --> 01:00:27,437
I see.

854
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:31,691
So, that was it?

855
01:00:36,237 --> 01:00:37,363
Oh, no.

856
01:00:45,037 --> 01:00:50,209
SAMGOK WAREHOUSE

857
01:00:50,293 --> 01:00:51,419
Excuse me.

858
01:00:52,211 --> 01:00:54,547
The gloves came earlier than expected.

859
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:56,883
I could've done the due diligence alone.

860
01:00:56,966 --> 01:00:59,552
It'd be better if we do it together
and have it done faster.

861
01:01:00,595 --> 01:01:01,763
I also get to see you.

862
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:05,516
There's the truck.

863
01:01:07,643 --> 01:01:08,853
-Hello.
-Hello.

864
01:01:10,313 --> 01:01:12,982
-This is the last one.
-Thank you.

865
01:01:14,233 --> 01:01:15,693
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

866
01:01:15,777 --> 01:01:17,195
-Let's go eat.
-Thank you.

867
01:01:17,779 --> 01:01:20,072
Thanks for your hard work.
Enjoy your lunch!

868
01:01:25,536 --> 01:01:26,537
Gosh.

869
01:01:26,621 --> 01:01:28,206
-Everything is here now.
-Yes.

870
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:31,876
It'll take a while
to check all the quantities.

871
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,086
Then you must be hungry.

872
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:37,799
-I'll get us something to eat.
-I didn't see anything nearby.

873
01:01:37,882 --> 01:01:40,134
No, there are a lot of food joints
just down the corner.

874
01:01:40,218 --> 01:01:41,803
I'll get some in a flash.

875
01:01:41,886 --> 01:01:43,513
-Okay, see you.
-Okay.

876
01:02:07,245 --> 01:02:10,248
SURGICAL GLOVES INVENTORY

877
01:02:17,797 --> 01:02:20,383
-My goodness.
-What happened?

878
01:02:20,466 --> 01:02:22,009
Are you badly hurt?

879
01:02:23,135 --> 01:02:24,136
I'm fine.

880
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:25,555
Really?

881
01:02:25,638 --> 01:02:27,515
Something's making me uneasy.

882
01:02:27,598 --> 01:02:30,434
But he said he wasn't traveling far today.

883
01:02:31,185 --> 01:02:35,481
It's true.
The students were all drafted as soldiers.

884
01:02:35,565 --> 01:02:39,819
I was worried sick
as I waited for my husband.

885
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:43,155
I can't imagine
what it's like to wait for your son.

886
01:02:44,198 --> 01:02:48,244
My children are still young,
so I don't know what that's like.

887
01:02:49,745 --> 01:02:50,997
You're right.

888
01:02:52,832 --> 01:02:55,960
I don't feel at ease staying home
while pushing my son out to work.

889
01:02:56,919 --> 01:02:57,920
Oh, dear.

890
01:03:04,176 --> 01:03:05,094
All right.

891
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:08,931
Come here.

892
01:03:10,433 --> 01:03:11,976
Let me see that.

893
01:03:12,852 --> 01:03:15,104
Let me put this on like this.

894
01:03:17,189 --> 01:03:18,900
Oh, dear.

895
01:03:19,817 --> 01:03:20,985
All good.

896
01:03:22,278 --> 01:03:23,321
You're done.

897
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:31,037
It must be hard to live in poverty

898
01:03:31,787 --> 01:03:35,791
after living many years
of such a good life, isn't it?

899
01:03:38,044 --> 01:03:42,423
But you never show it
to anybody under this roof.

900
01:03:42,506 --> 01:03:45,384
I can tell that you're very kind.

901
01:03:46,302 --> 01:03:49,597
Everything's going to work out, okay?

902
01:03:52,266 --> 01:03:53,517
Ma'am…

903
01:03:56,228 --> 01:03:57,396
All done.

904
01:04:07,782 --> 01:04:08,950
What is that smell?

905
01:04:21,379 --> 01:04:22,380
What?

906
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,395
No, wait.

907
01:04:37,478 --> 01:04:38,896
Oh, my gosh!

908
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,857
No, this can't happen!

909
01:04:41,941 --> 01:04:43,526
What do I do? But how?

910
01:04:43,609 --> 01:04:44,860
How did a fire break out?

911
01:04:44,944 --> 01:04:46,112
Wait. Let's see.

912
01:04:48,072 --> 01:04:49,740
No, please.

913
01:04:50,491 --> 01:04:52,243
Please stop.

914
01:04:52,326 --> 01:04:53,661
No, this can't happen.

915
01:04:53,744 --> 01:04:55,204
No, please.

916
01:04:55,287 --> 01:04:56,580
No.

917
01:04:58,582 --> 01:05:00,001
No!

918
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:15,182
NATIONWIDE

919
01:05:15,266 --> 01:05:17,143
BIRTH OF THE G2 DIGITAL PCS!

920
01:05:17,226 --> 01:05:19,353
Would Ms. Oh like that?

921
01:05:44,628 --> 01:05:45,963
What do I do?

922
01:05:46,047 --> 01:05:47,465
It's hot!

923
01:05:48,007 --> 01:05:49,216
What do I do?

924
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,687
Please help!

925
01:06:03,439 --> 01:06:06,150
This can't be happening.

926
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:10,696
No…

927
01:06:13,074 --> 01:06:14,158
What do I do?

928
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:37,723
Jeez!

929
01:06:38,474 --> 01:06:39,642
Ms. Oh!

930
01:06:40,267 --> 01:06:41,227
Ms. Oh!

931
01:06:42,144 --> 01:06:43,479
Darn it.

932
01:06:43,562 --> 01:06:45,064
Oh Mi-seon!

933
01:06:45,147 --> 01:06:47,066
Hold on. Hang in there.

934
01:07:06,085 --> 01:07:07,169
Please…

935
01:07:09,421 --> 01:07:10,506
Ms. Oh!

936
01:07:16,637 --> 01:07:17,972
Ms. Oh!

937
01:07:25,104 --> 01:07:27,565
Back then, Nam-mo also asked…

938
01:07:28,274 --> 01:07:29,650
Ms. Oh!

939
01:07:29,733 --> 01:07:31,652
…what was most precious to me.

940
01:07:32,194 --> 01:07:33,445
Oh Mi-seon!

941
01:07:39,535 --> 01:07:42,746
If someone asked me the same question,

942
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,625
about what was most precious to me…

943
01:07:47,334 --> 01:07:48,210
Mi-seon.

944
01:07:52,882 --> 01:07:54,049
…I would say

945
01:07:54,717 --> 01:07:55,759
it's you.

946
01:08:00,973 --> 01:08:02,057
Hang in there.

947
01:08:02,641 --> 01:08:03,726
Hold on.

948
01:08:09,857 --> 01:08:11,066
Oh Mi-seon!

949
01:08:21,118 --> 01:08:28,042
MY REASON FOR LIVING

950
01:09:00,241 --> 01:09:03,077
TYPHOON FAMILY

951
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:06,247
And yet, the warehouse burst into flames.

952
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:07,331
Are we sure it wasn't arson?

953
01:09:07,414 --> 01:09:11,460
From now on, I will never leave you alone.

954
01:09:11,543 --> 01:09:14,588
You've had an accident
with only a week left until the deadline?

955
01:09:14,672 --> 01:09:15,589
Tell me you're joking!

956
01:09:15,673 --> 01:09:17,758
Did you go through the documents here?

957
01:09:18,592 --> 01:09:20,344
I swear I had these arranged neatly.

958
01:09:20,427 --> 01:09:21,637
I've got it.

959
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:24,556
I found out why Blaze Eagles
has a supply shortage.

960
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:25,808
Hyun-jun!

961
01:09:26,642 --> 01:09:27,601
Even if I die,

962
01:09:28,143 --> 01:09:29,561
Typhoon Trading won't go down.

963
