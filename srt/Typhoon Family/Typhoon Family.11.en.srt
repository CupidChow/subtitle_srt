TYPHOON FAMILY

00:00:51,823 --> 00:00:53,324
Where's my IOU?

3
00:00:55,243 --> 00:00:56,786
My promissory note.

4
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:00,665
I can't find it.

00:01:07,213 --> 00:01:10,842
AUGUST 1989

6
00:01:13,094 --> 00:01:15,889
It's just as I told Mr. Ha, sir.

7
00:01:20,685 --> 00:01:22,103
Just look, Mr. Pyo.

8
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,481
There was a page
with records of loans right here,

9
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:28,568
so I tore it and destroyed it.

10
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:31,738
I went through everything daily

11
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:34,741
since we were at the Ulchiro office,
but I couldn't find it.

12
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:38,745
That small scrap of paper can't have gone
anywhere on its own, can it?

13
00:01:38,828 --> 00:01:41,915
I've searched everywhere,
but I still couldn't find it!

14
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:50,506
Are you sure Tae-poong doesn't have it?

15
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:53,927
Please think about it, Mr. Pyo.

16
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,470
We… I mean, no.

17
00:01:55,553 --> 00:01:58,932
Typhoon Trading had to resort
to relocating to this old place.

18
00:01:59,557 --> 00:02:01,351
Let's say Tae-poong has that note.

19
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:03,853
Do you think that hotheaded kid
would stay quiet?

20
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:05,897
He'd have caused a scene
at your office already.

21
00:02:08,358 --> 00:02:13,363
As for the money you gave me,
I'll make sure to return it to you.

22
00:02:14,822 --> 00:02:17,533
I wasn't in my right mind
when I accepted it.

23
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:24,332
-Here.
-Goodness.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,669
I can't accept this.

26
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:30,046
Please don't put me on the spot like this.

27
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:34,509
I heard your husband's business
is struggling.

28
00:02:37,553 --> 00:02:42,475
I'm saying that I don't know anything
about that promissory note you're after.

29
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:44,477
We won't make the same offer again.

30
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:50,817
-All right, then--
-Wait!

31
00:02:53,444 --> 00:02:55,738
Could I have some time to think about it?

32
00:02:57,281 --> 00:03:00,201
My financial situation is…
Well, it's in terrible shape.

33
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:05,373
I swear I'll return every penny.

34
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:07,000
I've done enough, haven't I?

35
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,169
It's about time you gave up, all right?!

36
00:03:13,423 --> 00:03:14,424
What's the matter?

37
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,678
I hear your husband's business went under.

38
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,931
Does it feel like it's all over now?
You thought wrong.

39
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:24,267
You have your kid.

40
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:27,311
That kid should get
to finish school, right?

41
00:03:27,395 --> 00:03:29,981
-What are you--
-Stop squealing and find my note.

42
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:32,275
-Then we're all good.
-What do you…

43
00:03:35,194 --> 00:03:36,612
What are you saying?

44
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:38,823
Why are you even mentioning my child?

45
00:03:38,906 --> 00:03:40,575
Why are you dragging my kid into this?

46
00:03:42,994 --> 00:03:45,913
Why would you mention my baby?!

47
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:48,916
Find it.

48
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:51,002
That's all I need.

49
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,004
You're so sweet, Mi-ja.

50
00:04:41,677 --> 00:04:42,845
My goodness.

51
00:04:53,648 --> 00:04:58,820
Mi-ja, could you teach Beom
how to clean up his things?

Oh, dear.

55
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:39,610
-What are you doing?
-Hi.

56
00:05:40,486 --> 00:05:42,738
I'm reviewing the ledgers
from the old office.

57
00:05:44,782 --> 00:05:45,783
Look at this, Mom.

58
00:05:50,204 --> 00:05:51,372
My gosh.

59
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:55,334
This must have been taken on the day
he signed the Ulchiro office's lease.

60
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:58,713
-They're Ms. Cha and Mr. Koo, right?
-Yes.

61
00:06:00,464 --> 00:06:01,465
Tae-poong.

62
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:04,177
How are you holding up?

63
00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:07,263
I'm amazed you decided
to move out of the office.

64
00:06:07,346 --> 00:06:08,431
I'm fine.

65
00:06:09,223 --> 00:06:11,475
I just feel bad for my dad
and the employees.

66
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:14,604
But I badly needed that deposit
to try something new.

67
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:21,068
You know what?

68
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:24,280
It's nice to have people around.

69
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:28,701
It felt like it was over for the company
in the empty Ulchiro office,

70
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:31,871
but now that I can hear
people breathing and conversing,

71
00:06:33,331 --> 00:06:34,498
I finally feel at ease.

72
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:39,295
That's why people flock together
and form a village.

73
00:06:41,255 --> 00:06:46,260
People watch the television,
read the newspapers,

74
00:06:46,344 --> 00:06:49,180
and go to cinemas
just to see how other people are doing.

75
00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:52,975
-Mom.
-Yes?

76
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:56,312
What do you think
troubled my dad that badly?

77
00:06:59,565 --> 00:07:00,608
Well…

78
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:04,070
Everyone running a business
suffered greatly.

79
00:07:04,153 --> 00:07:05,404
That's my point.

80
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:10,493
My dad wasn't the type

81
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:15,581
to crack under the pressure of work
or losing a client, was he?

-You're quick as always.

00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:39,206
Goodness. Who ordered tangsuyuk?

91
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,084
Seafood jjajangmyeon too?

92
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:46,172
-Who on earth placed this order?
-Me. I know how much you love shrimp.

93
00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:52,219
-How much is it?
-It's 24,500 won.

94
00:08:52,303 --> 00:08:53,346
Wait.

95
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:57,308
-Here we go.
-What the… What is wrong with you?

96
00:08:57,391 --> 00:09:00,186
Why would you pour the sauce
all over the tangsuyuk?

97
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:02,647
-To enjoy it juicy and moist.
-It'll be soggy!

98
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,482
How could you be so reckless?

99
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:07,151
This is unacceptable, man.

100
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:11,364
-Surely, it can't be such a big deal--
-Just look at what you've done!

101
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:14,617
-You could've asked first.
-Shame on you.

Don't just stand there. Get in already.

105
00:09:35,388 --> 00:09:36,263
Jeez.

106
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:39,392
Goodness.

Have some pickled radish.
I know you love them.

108
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:55,449
I can see through your tricks.

109
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:57,660
Take any more tangsuyuk,
and I'll hurt you.

110
00:09:58,869 --> 00:10:00,329
Gosh.

111
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,708
Lead an honest life, okay?

112
00:10:13,008 --> 00:10:14,552
Ms. Oh.

113
00:10:14,635 --> 00:10:16,470
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

114
00:10:17,638 --> 00:10:19,724
-What do you mean?
-You keep watching me.

115
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:21,642
You even gave me a tangsuyuk piece.

116
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,270
Because it was the piece you dropped.

117
00:10:24,353 --> 00:10:26,021
Please stop liking me so much.

118
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:30,234
Oh, come on. It's not like that.

119
00:10:31,902 --> 00:10:33,279
Tell him he's got it wrong.

120
00:10:33,863 --> 00:10:34,864
Don't date, Ms. Oh.

121
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:37,199
Focus on your career
until I find one for you.

122
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:39,577
Then, you'll marry a nice man.

123
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,912
No, don't get married.
Enjoy your single life.

124
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:43,414
I'll do as you say.

125
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:45,708
That took a weight off my chest.

126
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:46,834
Why won't you tell them?

127
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:52,673
We're good colleagues, nothing more.

128
00:10:53,257 --> 00:10:55,092
Please don't declare your love for me.

129
00:10:55,676 --> 00:11:00,097
Don't order tangsuyuk
until we finish collecting the coupons.

130
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:02,099
We've almost reached our goal.

131
00:11:21,452 --> 00:11:22,286
Thank you.

132
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:24,914
I know he's not the one you like.

133
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,041

Give up that ridiculous green juice gig
and come to work.

136
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:49,605
Look at him. Even Mr. Bae
comes in daily to work with us.

137
00:11:49,688 --> 00:11:52,233
I'll have you know
that logistics requires a specialist.

138
00:11:52,316 --> 00:11:54,485
It requires all sorts of expert knowledge.

139
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:56,987
Those with that expertise
are the top assets.

140
00:11:57,071 --> 00:12:00,533
Come on, now. The company
can save a ton with one less employee.

141
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,123
What's this?

142
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,545
I've been reviewing the old ledgers.

143
00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:15,422
But why? That's random.

144
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:20,469
Isn't this…

145
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:22,304
Man, it's from almost a decade ago.

147
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:27,518
If you realize you put down
the wrong amount in the ledger,

148
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:30,062
how do you generally proceed?

149
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:35,401
Supposing it was either a simple error
or that the order got canceled.

150
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:39,071
The golden rule was to strike it out
and get the late Mr. Kang's seal.

151
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:42,658
Or we reported the discrepancies
by the end of the month

152
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:45,411
and added an extra page
listing the corrections later.

153
00:12:46,495 --> 00:12:49,290
Why? Did you find anything useful?

154
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,751
Hello?

155
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:54,920
Mr. Kang?

156
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:00,175
I couldn't find it.

157
00:13:14,648 --> 00:13:20,112
I mean a deal that is stable,
dependable, and also lucrative.

158
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:22,615
I've had no luck yet.

159
00:13:22,698 --> 00:13:24,825
So that's what you're after?

160
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:28,662
Such deals don't exist. Even if they did,
they'd never come our way.

161
00:13:28,746 --> 00:13:30,122
If you think about it…

162
00:13:30,205 --> 00:13:33,709
Government projects are still
the most reliable despite all this,

163
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:35,336
but it's not easy to sign them on.

164
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:38,589
-The government agencies?
-The public sector deals? Forget it.

165
00:13:38,672 --> 00:13:41,717
We could never handle that now.
Only the large corporations do it.

166
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,801
Gosh, look at the time.

167
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:44,970
Oh, dear. I've got to go.

168
00:13:45,054 --> 00:13:46,305
-Hey.
-"Public sector deals"?

169
00:13:46,388 --> 00:13:49,224
Ms. Oh, remember that appointment
to visit our partner company?

170
00:13:49,308 --> 00:13:50,517
Oh, right.

171
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:51,977
-Let's head out together.
-Okay.

173
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:54,063
Oh, dear.

174
00:14:00,903 --> 00:14:02,488
It's called public procurement.

175
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:04,406
"Public procurement"?

176
00:14:18,462 --> 00:14:19,672
Public procurement?

177
00:14:20,923 --> 00:14:23,592
So, this is
the Public Procurement Service?

178
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:24,885
SAVE RESOURCES CAMPAIGN

179
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:27,012
I see tons of notices.

180
00:14:27,096 --> 00:14:28,931
BID FOR DOMESTIC COMMODITIES

181
00:14:29,014 --> 00:14:32,059
BID FOR FOREIGN COMMODITIES
BRIEFING ON "PLAINS OF HOPE"

182
00:14:32,142 --> 00:14:33,769
This is tricky.

183
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:39,900
To my knowledge,
the PPS doesn't handle export.

184
00:14:39,984 --> 00:14:41,860
There has to be something for us too.

185
00:14:41,944 --> 00:14:44,697
I don't get why you brought me here.

186
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,449
You've always taken
Ms. Oh with you so far.

187
00:14:48,617 --> 00:14:49,994
I asked you to come

188
00:14:50,744 --> 00:14:54,123
because I haven't had time
to get to know you and stuff.

189
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:00,462
You know,

190
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:03,799
about Ms. Oh…

191
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,261
I know you two have
a special thing going on.

192
00:15:10,222 --> 00:15:12,808
How can I miss it
when you're always together?

193
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:16,478
Oh, no. I wouldn't say

194
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:18,480
we've reached that level.

195
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:20,024
You're best friends, right?

196
00:15:20,941 --> 00:15:22,818
So, about Ms. Oh.

197
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,405
Was she heartbroken by my demeanor?

198
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:28,115
-What the--
-Excuse me?

199
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,579
Oh, no. She wasn't heartbroken at all.

200
00:15:33,662 --> 00:15:36,457
I believe men and women can be friends.

201
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,918
Please do all you can to console Ms. Oh.

202
00:15:40,002 --> 00:15:41,211
Friends…

203
00:15:41,837 --> 00:15:43,714
That's not how things are between us.

204
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:47,843
I hope you're not delusional
or think that everyone loves you.

205
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:49,845
-Sorry?
-You can hear me, can't you?

206
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:51,472
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

207
00:15:51,555 --> 00:15:55,225
Could you direct me to the team
handling export-related projects?

208
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:57,519
I'm not sure if we have such projects.

209
00:15:57,603 --> 00:16:02,066
Perhaps the Foreign Commodities Division?
Their office is over there.

210
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:03,859
-Okay, thank you.
-No problem.

211
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:05,903
Hello, I'm with KOICA.

212
00:16:09,865 --> 00:16:11,408
"Bienvenue en Corée."

213
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:13,994
Welcome to Korea.

214
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:15,621
KOICA?

215
00:16:16,705 --> 00:16:20,292
I studied French for my elective
foreign language course in high school.

216
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:26,048
My friends told me I have the look
of a European, especially a French man.

217
00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:29,426
I was initially reluctant
to take up French,

218
00:16:29,968 --> 00:16:34,014
but as time passed, I got the sense
that the language suited me rather well.

219
00:16:34,098 --> 00:16:35,099
So…

220
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:39,895
Mr. Kang?

221
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:48,153
Man, look at all these people.

222
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:57,287
-Welcome.
-Sorry?

223
00:16:57,371 --> 00:16:58,747
Please go in. We'll begin soon.

224
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:00,999
-I can wait here--
-You know how she is.

225
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:05,963
All right, everyone.
We'll begin the presentation shortly.

226
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:07,756
Please take a seat.

227
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,800
Please be seated.

228
00:17:15,097 --> 00:17:16,640
Hello.

229
00:17:17,808 --> 00:17:18,851
Jeez.

230
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,022
PUBLIC PROCUREMENT SERVICE

231
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:30,320
I apologize for the delay.
It's been a hectic day.

232
00:17:30,988 --> 00:17:32,322
What was I thinking?

233
00:17:32,406 --> 00:17:34,950
Mr. Jung. Could you go get my shoes?

234
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:36,952
I'm afraid we have to start, ma'am.

235
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:44,960
BRIEFING ON "PLAINS OF HOPE"

236
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,546
THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT
FOR HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS IN AFRICA

237
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:49,423
HOSTED BY: FOREIGN PROCUREMENT DIVISION 2

238
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:54,595
My heartfelt gratitude to everyone
for attending this event in person.

239
00:17:54,678 --> 00:17:59,558
To make the most of your valued time,
I'll get straight to the point.

240
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:04,229
Hello and welcome. Thanks for coming.

241
00:18:04,313 --> 00:18:07,733
Since time is precious,
we will keep this brief.

242
00:18:08,275 --> 00:18:11,987
First, please welcome
the representatives from KOICA.

243
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:15,866
To my left, the organization
for international cooperation.

244
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:25,709
We also have the African delegation
who came all the way to Korea.

245
00:18:26,418 --> 00:18:29,004
And to my right,
the delegation from Africa.

246
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:30,047
Welcome.

247
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:38,639
As you know, KOICA has decided
to fund the construction of schools

248
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:44,061
and hospitals with surgical facilities
to post-conflict regions in Africa.

249
00:18:44,144 --> 00:18:47,105
Our agency will be procuring
the resources required for the project.

250
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:49,942
As you know, we have decided
to provide financial aid

251
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:51,818
for the construction
of schools and hospitals

252
00:18:51,902 --> 00:18:53,570
in regions affected by the war.

253
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:56,823
We will purchase anything necessary
to support this effort.

254
00:18:57,449 --> 00:19:00,077
Please check the document on your desk.

255
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,038
You can find
the list of items to be procured,

256
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:07,376
the project timeline,
contact information, and key guidelines.

257
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:12,547
"Gauze pad, X-ray film, ambu bag,
thermometer, surgical glove, oxygen tank…"

258
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:13,715
EQUIPMENT AND PURPOSE

259
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,468
As for the items procured
for this project,

260
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:20,639
our agency will collect them all
and ship them together to Africa.

261
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:24,226
Since that's the case,
please make sure to meet the deadline.

262
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:26,478
The agency is handling shipping?

263
00:19:26,561 --> 00:19:30,232
Do you have any questions?

264
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:31,441
Do you have any questions?

265
00:19:33,068 --> 00:19:34,069
Excuse me.

266
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:39,825
Can I sign up for everything on the list?

267
00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:42,577
Which company is he with, Mr. Jung?

268
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:44,997
He seems familiar,
but I can't say for sure.

269
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:49,251
To my knowledge,

270
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:53,588
we already have a vendor
for all the items on the list.

271
00:19:54,506 --> 00:19:57,217
Mr. Jung. Are they any items
that haven't been decided?

272
00:19:57,301 --> 00:19:58,635
Yes, there are.

273
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:02,389
Please make sure that you don't bid
on items assigned to another company.

274
00:20:02,472 --> 00:20:04,266
Let's not get greedy, okay?

275
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:06,059
We're all here for a great cause.

276
00:20:06,143 --> 00:20:07,978
-Let's keep it civil.
-Of course.

277
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:10,397
To be frank,
you all work at respectable firms.

278
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,357
Once this project concludes smoothly,

279
00:20:12,441 --> 00:20:15,610
our African counterpart
will extend their invitations.

280
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:18,238
Can you remind me
what the top tourist spots are?

281
00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:20,657
What is famous in your region?

282
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:23,452
Sahara Desert, safari…

283
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:25,662
Serengeti, lions.

284
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:28,999
They have the Sahara Desert, the safari,
the Serengeti, and the lions.

285
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:31,585
Lions?

286
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,019
"Global Exploration: The World of Nature."

287
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:54,149
No, you should keep it on a little longer.

288
00:20:54,816 --> 00:20:58,487
You need to wear it for 15 minutes or more
to enhance your concentration.

289
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,698
It wasn't an easy decision
for me to buy it.

290
00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:07,704
Beom, getting only 30 points
in the dictation test is a serious issue.

291
00:21:08,955 --> 00:21:10,082
Keep it on, okay?

292
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,253
There's my good boy.

293
00:21:18,423 --> 00:21:24,471
The nimblest and quickest predator
here in the African savanna

294
00:21:25,722 --> 00:21:29,393
has its eye on only one thing.

295
00:21:30,102 --> 00:21:31,895
There's no way I would let this go.

296
00:21:31,978 --> 00:21:33,939
Did you see zebras and giraffes too?

297
00:21:34,022 --> 00:21:37,859
Were you the lion chasing after them?
What exactly is your goal here?

298
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:40,320
A government project,
the most secure project.

299
00:21:40,404 --> 00:21:42,406
Here you go. Please check this out.

300
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:45,200
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT
OF HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS IN AFRICA

301
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:50,080
So, KOICA is launching
an aid project in Africa,

302
00:21:50,163 --> 00:21:51,748
building schools and hospitals.

303
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:52,874
That's right.

304
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,168
They'll ship all
necessary items to Africa.

305
00:21:55,752 --> 00:21:57,170
Just think about it.

306
00:21:57,963 --> 00:21:59,423
This ship won't disappear,

307
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:03,051
the goods will never get seized,
and our client will never go under.

308
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:07,472
This is the perfect opportunity for us.

309
00:22:07,556 --> 00:22:09,516
Of course, it's perfect.

310
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,146
But larger corporations generally have
monopoly on such fantastic deals.

311
00:22:14,229 --> 00:22:15,355
"Monopoly"?

312
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:18,650
-Haven't you heard of it?
-Monopoly.

313
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:22,863
Anyhow, didn't you say

314
00:22:22,946 --> 00:22:25,574
that they already have a vendor
for all of the items?

315
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,617
And yet…

316
00:22:29,703 --> 00:22:30,954
one item is left hanging.

317
00:22:32,747 --> 00:22:33,999
Surgical gloves.

318
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,669
-How come?
-There's no domestic supplier.

319
00:22:39,254 --> 00:22:43,008
See? All the meaty, juicy parts
have been divvied up among them.

320
00:22:43,091 --> 00:22:46,011
We would never get to have a bite.
Do you want to know why?

321
00:22:46,094 --> 00:22:49,222
Because we lack the funds.
Have you got some?

322
00:22:49,973 --> 00:22:52,726
What about personnel and experience?

323
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:54,019
FUNDS, PERSONNEL, EXPERIENCE

324
00:22:54,102 --> 00:22:55,478
This requires quite a big sum.

325
00:22:55,562 --> 00:22:59,065
Even if we got items on credit,
we still need a bid bond and a deposit.

326
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:02,861
Also, there's a mountain
of paperwork to submit. It's too much.

327
00:23:02,944 --> 00:23:06,656
To my knowledge, we've never done
a deal in the public sector.

328
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,535
You might as well think the big companies
called dibs on such big projects.

329
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:12,287
They meet all three criteria.

330
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:15,457
Don't say that.
We have experience, at the very least.

331
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:19,377
If you're going to voice your opinion,
just come work here.

332
00:23:19,461 --> 00:23:22,214
You're not a guest star.
Do you think we're 015B?

333
00:23:22,297 --> 00:23:24,507
Ms. Cha, the green juice is expired.

334
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:26,801
Think of it as being aged and drink up.

335
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:28,887
Hear me out.

336
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,350
The late Mr. Kang and Mr. Koo
used to work for Samjeon Trading.

337
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:37,187
So, we did work on public sector projects
in the early days.

338
00:23:37,729 --> 00:23:39,064
-My father did that?
-Sure.

339
00:23:42,108 --> 00:23:44,945
Things would be better
if Mr. Koo were here, right?

340
00:23:46,988 --> 00:23:52,035
But I must say, you guys have no respect.

341
00:23:52,118 --> 00:23:57,123
How can you talk back
to your boss this much?

342
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,376
As the saying goes,

343
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:02,170
you can only come up with excuses
when you're trying to weasel out.

344
00:24:02,254 --> 00:24:04,839
But where there's a will, there's a way.

345
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:07,717
I'm off.

346
00:24:08,635 --> 00:24:09,928
See you.

347
00:24:10,011 --> 00:24:11,346
-See you.
-See you.

348
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:14,891
Come work with us already.
You can find a way for us.

349
00:24:15,684 --> 00:24:18,061
KOO MYUNG-GWAN

350
00:24:18,144 --> 00:24:19,271
I might be able

351
00:24:21,022 --> 00:24:22,357
to find a way.

352
00:24:36,871 --> 00:24:39,374
-Hello.
-Hello, we're with Typhoon Trading.

353
00:24:39,457 --> 00:24:40,750
Please take this.

354
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:45,338
We just wanted to ask--

355
00:24:56,224 --> 00:24:57,851
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

356
00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:17,912
Freight Elevator 3 will be going down
with the VIPs heading to the B3 lounge.

357
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:21,541
Does that make us very important cargo?

358
00:25:21,624 --> 00:25:25,545
It must be tiring to repeat that all day.
You might as well rest back here.

359
00:25:25,628 --> 00:25:26,463
Gosh.

360
00:25:26,546 --> 00:25:29,215
I hold the doors open for the jerks
who are strangers.

361
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:32,385
It's nothing to hold the doors open
for the brats I work with.

362
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:35,096
We'd love you more
if only you were polite.

363
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,390
I already get enough attention
for my beauty.

364
00:25:37,474 --> 00:25:39,642
I'd be in big trouble
if I get any prettier.

365
00:25:40,185 --> 00:25:43,146
Pretty girl, you've got a run
in your tights again.

366
00:25:44,522 --> 00:25:48,693
-Get a new pair, will you?
-I have a run on this side too.

367
00:25:49,944 --> 00:25:51,404
A pair, huh?

368
00:25:51,488 --> 00:25:53,740
It's a sure way to lose your luck.

369
00:25:53,823 --> 00:25:57,077
Only those born with good luck
can afford to care about it.

370
00:25:58,203 --> 00:26:01,164
Cover up your belly button
when you're out of the uniform.

371
00:26:01,247 --> 00:26:02,832
That's none of your business.

372
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:04,209
You're unbelievable.

373
00:26:06,378 --> 00:26:09,881
We've arrived at your lounge, dear VIPs.
Please exit here.

374
00:26:09,964 --> 00:26:12,175
Thanks for the VIP treatment, pretty girl.

375
00:26:12,258 --> 00:26:15,970
-She sure doesn't lack confidence.
-Doesn't it feel good, though?

376
00:26:24,687 --> 00:26:25,688
Ma'am.

377
00:26:26,523 --> 00:26:27,774
Excuse me.

378
00:26:27,857 --> 00:26:29,943
-May I rearrange your hair?
-Excuse me?

379
00:26:31,027 --> 00:26:33,405
I saw a bobby pin
stick out of your headscarf.

380
00:26:33,488 --> 00:26:34,739
Just a second.

381
00:26:34,823 --> 00:26:36,032
Let me take this…

382
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:38,701
Here we go.

383
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:42,539
The team's manager throws a fit
over minor details like this.

384
00:26:42,622 --> 00:26:45,375
Nobody likes being nagged
when they're doing their best.

385
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,211
I'll be off, then.

386
00:26:48,294 --> 00:26:49,462
Wait, miss.

387
00:26:50,797 --> 00:26:51,798
Thank you.

388
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,591
No problem.

389
00:27:11,901 --> 00:27:15,155
"Buhyeong Station, Exit 1."
And this is the Exit 1.

390
00:27:16,364 --> 00:27:19,492
Do you think she meant
that we could meet him here?

391
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:22,287
She gave us the note for a reason.
Let's wait it out.

392
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,329
Right?

393
00:27:23,413 --> 00:27:25,915
It's the new millennium.
Believe in the Prophet.

394
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:27,459
-New millennium, new sky.
-Exactly.

395
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:28,460
THE DIVINE SKY

396
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:30,503
Hello.

397
00:27:32,088 --> 00:27:34,382
Millennium, the Prophet of the new age

398
00:27:34,466 --> 00:27:36,217
I see a fortune in your face…

399
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:37,343
-Oh, my.
-Mr. Koo.

400
00:27:39,053 --> 00:27:40,346
Tae-poong.

401
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,389
Mi-seon.

402
00:27:42,557 --> 00:27:45,852
-What brings you here?
-Of course, we've come to see you.

403
00:27:45,935 --> 00:27:48,605
We need your advice
on the Public Procurement Service.

404
00:27:48,688 --> 00:27:51,357
Could you spare us a minute?
It won't take long.

405
00:27:51,441 --> 00:27:54,152
I'm afraid I'm rather busy at the moment.

406
00:27:54,235 --> 00:27:57,071
-I'll see you later.
-Wait, Mr. Koo.

407
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:02,410
NEW MILLENNIUM
SPECIAL PRAYER SERVICE

408
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:06,372
Rumor has it
that you're the CEO now, Tae-poong.

409
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:07,916
That's true.

410
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:12,086
-Congratulations, Mr. Kang.
-Goodness.

411
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,297
A NEW MILLENIUM
FOR THE DIVINE SKY

412
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:17,550
Hello.

413
00:28:17,634 --> 00:28:19,302
-Hello.
-Hello.

414
00:28:19,385 --> 00:28:22,764
Are you friends of Deacon Koo here?

415
00:28:22,847 --> 00:28:24,349
That's right, sir.

416
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,851
We met by chance.

417
00:28:26,935 --> 00:28:29,270
-Off you go, then.
-Mr. Kang, correct?

418
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,064
Yes?

419
00:28:31,147 --> 00:28:32,857
I can see fortune in your face.

420
00:28:33,483 --> 00:28:34,484
Pardon?

421
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:36,361
-Does he mean there's money?
-No.

422
00:28:36,444 --> 00:28:37,946
He thinks you look lucky.

423
00:28:38,613 --> 00:28:40,490
Oh, you meant good fortune.

424
00:28:40,573 --> 00:28:45,537
My eyes can see everything,
and I mean everything.

425
00:28:46,162 --> 00:28:47,413
He is the Prophet.

426
00:28:47,497 --> 00:28:50,458
-Thank you, Mr. Prophet.
-That's not his name.

427
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:52,919
I've fallen victim
to crooks twice recently.

428
00:28:53,002 --> 00:28:57,006
-So I--
-Are you sure you're not a lucky man?

429
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:00,093
I'm sure. I've been conned twice.
I lost my home and office--

430
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:01,553
Millennium

431
00:29:01,636 --> 00:29:04,514
-The Prophet of the new age
-The Prophet of the new age

432
00:29:04,597 --> 00:29:07,725
-When the dejected feel like crying
-When the dejected feel like crying

433
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:09,561
-He soothes their souls
-He soothes their souls

434
00:29:09,644 --> 00:29:10,979
Wait, Mr. Koo.

435
00:29:11,062 --> 00:29:13,982
-The Prophet lives inside us
-The Prophet lives inside us

436
00:29:14,065 --> 00:29:15,525
-Step back
-Step back

437
00:29:15,608 --> 00:29:17,527
-Welcome him into your heart
-Welcome him into your heart

438
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,653
NEW SKY

439
00:29:18,736 --> 00:29:20,613
What's a millennium and a binary system?

440
00:29:20,697 --> 00:29:22,198
Oh, dear Prophet

441
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:24,576
All rise to greet the Prophet

442
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:27,245
Believe in the Prophet.

443
00:29:27,328 --> 00:29:29,205
All hail the Prophet!

444
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:30,456
Heed him well!

445
00:29:31,165 --> 00:29:33,209
-Exalted on high
-Exalted on high

446
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:35,044
NEW MILLENIUM
SPECIAL PRAYER SERVICE

447
00:29:35,128 --> 00:29:39,966
-Is our Prophet
-Is our Prophet

448
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:42,719
-Millennium!
-Millennium

449
00:29:42,802 --> 00:29:45,305
-The Prophet of the new age
-The Prophet of the new age

450
00:29:45,388 --> 00:29:47,056
Prophet!

451
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,058
-Nurse a hope
-Nurse a hope

452
00:29:49,142 --> 00:29:50,852
-That our Prophet
-That our Prophet

453
00:29:50,935 --> 00:29:53,771
-Will save us from hardships
-Will save us from hardships

454
00:29:53,855 --> 00:29:54,772
Deliver my message!

455
00:29:54,856 --> 00:29:58,776
-The Prophet of hope
-The Prophet of hope

456
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,944
Step back!

457
00:30:00,028 --> 00:30:02,614
-Step back, welcome him into your heart
-Step back, welcome him into your heart

458
00:30:02,697 --> 00:30:04,240
-The new millennium
-The new millennium

459
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:05,283
Who am I?

460
00:30:05,366 --> 00:30:07,994
-Our Prophet
-Our Prophet

461
00:30:08,077 --> 00:30:09,954
Who am I again?

462
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:13,499
-Dear Prophet
-Dear Prophet

463
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:16,878
-Our dear Prophet
-Our dear Prophet

464
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,713
Tae-poong.

465
00:30:18,796 --> 00:30:21,007
Is this plagiarized? The tune is familiar.

466
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,258
It does sound familiar.

467
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:23,509
How did you get here?

468
00:30:23,593 --> 00:30:25,511
They welcomed us in when we showed these.

469
00:30:25,595 --> 00:30:26,596
I can't believe you two.

470
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:40,944
-My gosh.
-No, wait.

471
00:30:41,027 --> 00:30:42,320
-Look.
-That startled me.

472
00:30:44,864 --> 00:30:49,786
Once upon a time,
a prophet appeared and declared,

473
00:30:50,787 --> 00:30:52,413
"In the year 1999,

474
00:30:52,497 --> 00:30:55,625
the lord of darkness
will descend onto your world."

475
00:30:59,545 --> 00:31:04,175
"The lord of darkness
shall devour everything in the world."

476
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:08,554
"But do not fear."

477
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:13,810
"I have dispatched a being
with my authority and discerning eyes."

478
00:31:15,728 --> 00:31:16,646
Thank you!

479
00:31:18,564 --> 00:31:19,399
Everyone.

480
00:31:19,983 --> 00:31:21,859
Who or what is the lord of darkness?

481
00:31:21,943 --> 00:31:26,864
Who or what is this lord of darkness
that you fear so much?

482
00:31:27,448 --> 00:31:29,075
War!

483
00:31:29,158 --> 00:31:31,494
-Satan.
-The Gulf War.

484
00:31:31,577 --> 00:31:34,372
-The IMF!
-Poverty!

485
00:31:35,581 --> 00:31:38,209
No, you're all wrong!

486
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:43,131
The lord of darkness
is none other than Y2K.

487
00:31:43,214 --> 00:31:44,257
It's Y2K.

488
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,758
A NEW MILLENIUM
FOR THE DIVINE SKY

489
00:31:47,385 --> 00:31:53,099
Computers run on a binary system,
which consists of ones and zeros.

490
00:31:53,182 --> 00:31:58,021
0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0.

491
00:31:58,104 --> 00:32:01,691
In other words, computers can't grasp
the concept of the new millennium.

492
00:32:01,774 --> 00:32:04,485
When the clock hits 12:00 a.m.
on January 1st, 2000,

493
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:07,196
all computers will start malfunctioning!

494
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,825
All the missiles and nuclear weapons
rely on their computer system!

495
00:32:10,908 --> 00:32:13,036
So the world…

496
00:32:14,328 --> 00:32:15,663
It will go boom!

497
00:32:16,497 --> 00:32:18,583
Please save us!

498
00:32:20,251 --> 00:32:21,085
And yet,

499
00:32:21,836 --> 00:32:24,630
the true path to the heavens
will soon appear before us.

500
00:32:24,714 --> 00:32:26,090
OPENING THE PATH TO THE SKY

501
00:32:26,174 --> 00:32:30,803
Just ten million won can make the systems
understand number two!

502
00:32:34,432 --> 00:32:36,893
Oh, dear Prophet!

503
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:41,272
This is a sweet deal.

504
00:32:41,355 --> 00:32:46,277
Surely, you don't want to keep it and
survive alone while your family perishes!

505
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,820
-Of course not!
-You're right!

506
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:49,447
Let us pray.

507
00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:01,501
-About that deal with the PPS--
-They're praying.

508
00:33:01,584 --> 00:33:02,960
I'm sorry, everyone.

509
00:33:05,963 --> 00:33:08,841
They're securing goods
to construct schools and hospitals,

510
00:33:08,925 --> 00:33:11,094
and most items on the list
have been claimed

511
00:33:11,177 --> 00:33:14,347
except for surgical gloves.

512
00:33:15,223 --> 00:33:18,893
All we need is to strike a deal
at a good price and hand the goods over.

513
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:22,814
But we're having difficulty
navigating the waters on our own.

514
00:33:22,897 --> 00:33:25,858
You're the only one
who's ever worked with the PPS.

515
00:33:25,942 --> 00:33:26,984
Exactly.

516
00:33:31,781 --> 00:33:34,700
I really want to secure this… No.
We must secure that deal.

517
00:33:36,202 --> 00:33:38,287
Please stop, Tae-poong.

518
00:33:39,163 --> 00:33:40,790
How's this, Mr. Koo?

519
00:33:40,873 --> 00:33:44,252
We'll show you the documents.
You can make your decision after that.

520
00:33:44,335 --> 00:33:47,171
Then you'll see
it's a golden opportunity you can't miss.

521
00:33:47,255 --> 00:33:48,756
-Join us already!
-Why, you…

522
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,675
Stop it, okay?!

523
00:33:51,425 --> 00:33:55,179
Typhoon Trading doesn't even have
enough money to strike that deal!

524
00:33:55,263 --> 00:33:58,641
We have spawns of Satan
harassing one of our own!

525
00:33:58,724 --> 00:34:00,852
Drag them out!

526
00:34:07,483 --> 00:34:08,943
Hang on.

527
00:34:09,026 --> 00:34:10,820
This is just… Mr. Koo!

528
00:34:10,903 --> 00:34:12,029
Let me go!

529
00:34:12,113 --> 00:34:16,409
Folks, how lame is "Y2K"?

530
00:34:16,492 --> 00:34:19,078
Just turn the computers off
and unplug them, okay?

531
00:34:19,162 --> 00:34:20,413
Mr. Koo!

532
00:34:20,496 --> 00:34:21,664
Wait, Mr. Koo!

533
00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:28,129
Do you think he'll come back?

534
00:34:29,755 --> 00:34:30,965
We've got to have faith.

535
00:34:32,175 --> 00:34:35,887
With or without him,
I'm going to secure that deal.

536
00:34:38,764 --> 00:34:41,225
Why do you want the PPS deal so badly?

537
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:51,068
I just have a hunch
that this may be the final shot for me.

538
00:34:52,403 --> 00:34:55,948
Since I don't have more funds,
or anywhere to make a retreat,

539
00:34:57,533 --> 00:34:58,910
I need a dependable client.

540
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:03,915
Let's go inside.

541
00:35:13,049 --> 00:35:15,468
I told you we could get
something more delicious.

542
00:35:15,551 --> 00:35:16,928
I happen to love dumplings.

543
00:35:17,428 --> 00:35:18,679
-You do?
-Sure.

544
00:35:23,976 --> 00:35:25,061
Thanks.

545
00:35:33,361 --> 00:35:34,403
Is it good?

546
00:35:40,993 --> 00:35:43,120
What's wrong? Are you okay?
Sip some water.

547
00:35:43,204 --> 00:35:46,249
-Should I go get some medicine?
-No, I'm good.

548
00:35:46,332 --> 00:35:47,541
Some water will do.

549
00:35:50,127 --> 00:35:51,629
-Are you sure?
-I'm quite sure.

550
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:57,385
-Was there something in the dumpling?
-Oh, no.

551
00:35:59,845 --> 00:36:01,097
I'm fine.

552
00:36:05,476 --> 00:36:06,477
Let me try it.

553
00:36:07,186 --> 00:36:08,187
Mr. Kang.

554
00:36:13,484 --> 00:36:18,656
I'm usually the one looking out for others
and not the other way around.

555
00:36:22,034 --> 00:36:24,453
I'm the opposite.
People tend to look out for me.

556
00:36:34,422 --> 00:36:35,423
So…

557
00:36:39,343 --> 00:36:42,805
it feels new to me
to have someone look out for me.

558
00:36:43,556 --> 00:36:46,809
I honestly feel grateful too.

559
00:36:49,937 --> 00:36:51,731
But I must say…

560
00:36:56,986 --> 00:36:59,697
I don't want to be dependent
on such emotional comfort.

561
00:37:02,908 --> 00:37:03,909
What I'm saying is…

562
00:37:07,663 --> 00:37:08,789
How about we…

563
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:14,545
just look out for each other at work only?

564
00:37:15,963 --> 00:37:17,673
Let's separate feelings from work.

565
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:26,182
-Separate feelings from work?
-That's it.

566
00:37:31,395 --> 00:37:34,190
I want to pursue my career
more than anything, Mr. Kang.

567
00:37:36,692 --> 00:37:38,069
I feel this is necessary.

568
00:37:55,878 --> 00:37:58,130
-Dig in. The dumplings might get cold.
-Okay.

569
00:38:02,635 --> 00:38:03,803
Take them slowly.

570
00:38:10,017 --> 00:38:13,771
-So, did you come here to get some tights?
-No, I've come to see you.

571
00:38:15,022 --> 00:38:17,024
I could've come to you after I was done.

572
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:18,776
I came because I could manage it.

573
00:38:19,443 --> 00:38:21,237
-Hello.
-Hey, you're here.

574
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,197
I have an order
from Color Story in Gwangju.

575
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,366
-The order is for 233,000 won.
-I have them here.

576
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,369
You can check.

577
00:38:29,912 --> 00:38:31,455
Here's 240,000 won, sir.

578
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:33,499
-The change is 7,000 won.
-Okay.

579
00:38:36,669 --> 00:38:38,671
-Here's your 7,000 won.
-Thank you.

580
00:38:40,548 --> 00:38:42,299
-Did you check everything?
-Sure.

581
00:38:44,009 --> 00:38:45,010
Thank you.

582
00:38:45,094 --> 00:38:46,512
-Thank you.
-Have a good one.

583
00:38:48,222 --> 00:38:50,683
I gave it some thought afterwards.

584
00:38:51,642 --> 00:38:55,062
Wouldn't it be unfair
to lose good luck over torn tights?

585
00:38:55,146 --> 00:38:56,856
My sister works so hard every day.

586
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,068
Then again, older ladies
turn out to be right most of the time.

587
00:39:01,902 --> 00:39:04,822
Mi-ho, I'll buy you 100 pairs of tights.

588
00:39:06,532 --> 00:39:07,533
Really?

589
00:39:07,616 --> 00:39:09,869
-Let's make it 1,000 pairs.
-Lucky me.

590
00:39:17,251 --> 00:39:18,794
Open wide, Mi-ho.

591
00:39:21,338 --> 00:39:22,923
Gosh, this is so nice and cold.

592
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:28,596
By the way, this place is bustling
with people, clothes, and money.

593
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:29,680
Right?

594
00:39:29,763 --> 00:39:33,184
All the money in the country
seems to flow into this area.

595
00:39:33,267 --> 00:39:34,602
TEXTILE ACCESSORIES MARKET

596
00:39:34,685 --> 00:39:35,853
It's nice here.

597
00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:38,939
I love clothes and money.

598
00:39:41,984 --> 00:39:44,153
What would you do
if you had a lot of money?

599
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,821
Me?

600
00:39:48,824 --> 00:39:49,825
I know what I'd do.

601
00:39:50,868 --> 00:39:52,828
I want to fund Mi-seon's college tuition.

602
00:39:54,872 --> 00:39:59,752
I've always been an airhead,
and she was the model student.

603
00:40:01,253 --> 00:40:03,255
But Mi-seon had the bad luck
of being born first,

604
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:05,007
so I went to college, not her.

605
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:09,803
I hate it.

606
00:40:09,887 --> 00:40:11,472
It feels like I owe her.

607
00:40:12,932 --> 00:40:17,478
I'll make a lot of money,
so she can go to college.

608
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:25,986
What about you? What's your dream?

609
00:40:26,612 --> 00:40:27,446
Me?

610
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,992
My dream is making it as a singer.

611
00:40:33,827 --> 00:40:34,828
Are you serious?

612
00:40:36,288 --> 00:40:37,289
Sing a song for me.

613
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:41,168
Come on. I can barely remember
what happened on Studio I Love You.

614
00:40:42,836 --> 00:40:45,422
Here's my song
Now it's over

615
00:40:49,593 --> 00:40:51,053
But that's in the past.

616
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,972
It's not what I want now.

617
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,641
Instead,

618
00:40:57,101 --> 00:40:58,477
I have a new dream.

619
00:40:59,853 --> 00:41:00,813
What's that?

620
00:41:02,147 --> 00:41:02,982
You.

621
00:41:08,612 --> 00:41:09,613
You are

622
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,158
my dream, Mi-ho.

623
00:41:32,845 --> 00:41:35,973
SEOUL REGIONAL OFFICE
OF THE PUBLIC PROCUREMENT SERVICE

624
00:41:39,184 --> 00:41:42,855
Sample containers, plaster cast kits…

625
00:41:42,938 --> 00:41:44,481
Hochang, screens.

626
00:41:44,565 --> 00:41:45,774
LIST OF VENDORS

627
00:41:45,858 --> 00:41:48,027
What's this? Who are they?

628
00:41:48,694 --> 00:41:49,987
"Typhoon Trading"?

629
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,656
Why do we have a small fish here?

630
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,074
Who gave them a call?

631
00:41:54,158 --> 00:41:55,868
-Hey, Mr. Jung.
-Yes, ma'am?

632
00:41:58,954 --> 00:42:03,083
-Did you bring in Typhoon Trading?
-No.

633
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:05,377
Fax them that they're not eligible.

634
00:42:05,461 --> 00:42:06,837
Understood, ma'am.

635
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,261
TYPHOON TRADING, POWDERED SURGICAL GLOVES

636
00:42:15,095 --> 00:42:18,515
SEOUL OFFICE
OF THE PUBLIC PROCUREMENT SERVICE

637
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,985
It's an official notice from the PPS.

638
00:42:33,697 --> 00:42:36,575
"Bidding ineligibility notice."

639
00:42:36,659 --> 00:42:39,411
"We inform that your company
is ineligible to bid on this project."

640
00:42:39,495 --> 00:42:40,496
"End of note"?

641
00:42:42,331 --> 00:42:44,333
They can't just kick us out.

642
00:42:47,336 --> 00:42:49,713
Didn't I warn you?
I knew it would come to this.

643
00:42:49,797 --> 00:42:51,382
Be rational.

644
00:42:51,465 --> 00:42:56,303
It would be odd if they let any company
bid on a project on a national scale.

645
00:42:57,179 --> 00:43:00,349
Our company only has four staff members.

646
00:43:00,432 --> 00:43:02,059
How much do we have left?

647
00:43:02,142 --> 00:43:04,853
We have 43,500,000 won, rounded down.

648
00:43:04,937 --> 00:43:07,523
It's so specific. Now, I feel suffocated.

649
00:43:08,107 --> 00:43:09,525
We must get this deal.

650
00:43:14,738 --> 00:43:16,156
-Yes?
-What now?

651
00:43:19,284 --> 00:43:20,703
-Hey!
-What's going on?

652
00:43:20,786 --> 00:43:23,122
-My gosh!
-Jeez, I can't believe this!

653
00:43:23,205 --> 00:43:24,540
-Come in already.
-Mr. Koo!

654
00:43:24,623 --> 00:43:25,791
-Don't dawdle.
-Mr. Koo!

655
00:43:25,874 --> 00:43:28,627
How have you been?
I bet you lounged around.

656
00:43:28,711 --> 00:43:31,922
Couldn't you have come in
and helped us move stuff?

657
00:43:32,005 --> 00:43:34,591
I did hear about the relocation.

658
00:43:35,384 --> 00:43:37,344
But the office itself doesn't matter.

659
00:43:37,428 --> 00:43:41,682
As long as we're all together,
that's Typhoon Trading.

660
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:43,809
He seems pretty fine.

661
00:43:43,892 --> 00:43:45,144
No, the office matters.

662
00:43:45,227 --> 00:43:46,770
-It affects my mood.
-Mr. Bae.

663
00:43:48,355 --> 00:43:51,191
I see you've brought us
some presents again.

664
00:43:51,275 --> 00:43:52,484
Darn it.

665
00:43:52,568 --> 00:43:55,446
-Accept salvation.
-What's this?

666
00:43:55,529 --> 00:43:58,741
What does Y2K mean? Who made this?

667
00:43:59,324 --> 00:44:02,745
-What is it?
-Have you joined a church?

668
00:44:02,828 --> 00:44:04,413
Here's your salvation, Mi-seon.

669
00:44:04,496 --> 00:44:06,874
This isn't the time
to turn to religion, Myung-gwan.

670
00:44:06,957 --> 00:44:09,835
Look at what we're dealing with.

671
00:44:12,755 --> 00:44:14,965
BIDDING INELIGIBILITY NOTICE

672
00:44:17,634 --> 00:44:18,761
File an appeal.

673
00:44:21,388 --> 00:44:22,222
Pardon?

674
00:44:23,182 --> 00:44:24,224
Tae-poong.

675
00:44:25,476 --> 00:44:28,562
Civil servants operate
according to their own code.

676
00:44:29,188 --> 00:44:33,484
What civil servants love and hate the most
is none other than due process.

677
00:44:34,443 --> 00:44:38,572
It's about anti-competitive practices,
unfair trade, coercion of confidentiality…

678
00:44:41,074 --> 00:44:42,034
and discrimination.

679
00:44:48,707 --> 00:44:49,541
What?

680
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:52,211
They filed an appeal? On what grounds?

681
00:44:52,294 --> 00:44:57,549
Apparently, they're claiming
the conditions of eligibility are unclear.

682
00:44:57,633 --> 00:44:59,343
They'll also lodge a complaint

683
00:44:59,426 --> 00:45:02,429
on "anti-competitive practices,
unfair trade, discrimination,

684
00:45:02,513 --> 00:45:05,516
coercion of confidentiality,"
and any other grounds they can think of.

685
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,060
They've got to be joking.

686
00:45:08,143 --> 00:45:10,312
What discrimination?
We just don't want any mishap.

687
00:45:10,395 --> 00:45:13,982
-You can't be more right.
-Jeez, what a pain…

688
00:45:14,608 --> 00:45:16,235
-Mr. Jung.
-Yes?

689
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:18,570
What was it again? The surgical gloves?

690
00:45:18,654 --> 00:45:20,989
Has any other company
submitted a bid for them?

691
00:45:21,073 --> 00:45:22,241
No, ma'am.

692
00:45:24,201 --> 00:45:25,285
Tell them to come in.

693
00:45:29,623 --> 00:45:32,167
It turned out all our orchids
had been overwatered.

694
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,963
Overwatered?

695
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:38,340
Yes.

696
00:45:39,925 --> 00:45:42,844
The orchids kept growing,
but there was no room in the pots

697
00:45:42,928 --> 00:45:44,763
while the soil was soaking up water.

698
00:45:44,846 --> 00:45:46,807
Huge chunks of their roots rotted away.

699
00:45:47,766 --> 00:45:49,351
That's why they couldn't bloom.

700
00:45:51,645 --> 00:45:52,646
I see.

701
00:45:54,231 --> 00:45:55,857
They seemed fine on the outside,

702
00:45:58,151 --> 00:45:59,903
while the hidden parts were rotting away.

703
00:45:59,987 --> 00:46:00,988
But still,

704
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:04,741
they survived
thanks to their strong roots.

705
00:46:05,367 --> 00:46:06,285
Look.

706
00:46:06,868 --> 00:46:10,163
I cut away all the rotten roots
and moved them to a bigger pot.

707
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:11,748
They then flowered right away.

708
00:46:16,628 --> 00:46:17,629
Mr. Koo.

709
00:46:19,298 --> 00:46:22,175
It's time you came back to our office.

710
00:46:24,094 --> 00:46:25,554
We have a place for you here.

711
00:46:29,891 --> 00:46:30,726
Hello?

712
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:33,729
Oh, I see. Understood.

713
00:46:33,812 --> 00:46:35,731
Sure, thank you. Goodbye.

714
00:46:38,483 --> 00:46:41,653
-They want us to come in to submit a bid.
-That's amazing.

715
00:46:42,487 --> 00:46:45,365
-That's splendid.
-Mr. Koo's valuable advice paid off.

716
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,544
Does this CD contain instrumental songs?

717
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:03,800
Turn it off!

718
00:47:03,884 --> 00:47:07,262
When we're down and lonely
Who will come to save us?

719
00:47:07,346 --> 00:47:09,181
Our dear Prophet!

720
00:47:09,848 --> 00:47:12,643
The lord of darkness will strike
on January 1st, 2000.

721
00:47:12,726 --> 00:47:14,102
An apocalypse is coming!

722
00:47:14,186 --> 00:47:18,315
Life as we know it will no longer exist
after December 31st, 1999!

723
00:47:19,066 --> 00:47:21,985
You have to install this
to save yourselves and your families!

724
00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:24,488
Listen, Ma-jin, Seon-taek, and Tae-poong.

725
00:47:24,571 --> 00:47:26,073
-You must install this!
-Mr. Koo.

726
00:47:26,156 --> 00:47:28,158
Millennium

727
00:47:28,241 --> 00:47:31,453
The Prophet of the new age

728
00:47:31,995 --> 00:47:34,998
This is for all the dejected
who feel like crying.

729
00:47:35,082 --> 00:47:36,041
-Mr. Koo!
-Play the CD.

730
00:47:36,124 --> 00:47:38,126
-Our Prophet is--
-Mr. Koo!

731
00:47:57,646 --> 00:47:58,855
Please help us out.

732
00:48:04,111 --> 00:48:05,696
Please help Typhoon Trading.

733
00:48:44,818 --> 00:48:45,944
Mr. Koo…

734
00:49:07,924 --> 00:49:08,925
Father.

735
00:49:11,011 --> 00:49:17,601
Please shield them so they won't get hurt
by a worthless being like me.

736
00:49:19,603 --> 00:49:23,607
Allow them to forget
a miserable failure like me forever…

737
00:49:26,067 --> 00:49:27,068
and lead…

738
00:49:30,322 --> 00:49:31,323
a happy life.

739
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:35,911
Please…

740
00:49:39,372 --> 00:49:40,624
Please let them be happy.

741
00:49:48,423 --> 00:49:49,591
Ms. Cha.

742
00:49:51,885 --> 00:49:52,969
Hi there.

743
00:49:53,595 --> 00:49:54,471
Gosh.

744
00:49:54,554 --> 00:49:56,264
How come you're here all alone?

745
00:49:57,057 --> 00:49:58,934
I'm waiting to hear from someone.

746
00:49:59,017 --> 00:50:01,353
I volunteered to stay behind
and sent the others home.

747
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:05,148
-Can I get you a cup of tea?
-Sure, that sounds lovely.

748
00:50:14,449 --> 00:50:17,452
You take after your father.

749
00:50:17,994 --> 00:50:20,121
-You're sweet just like him.
-Sorry?

750
00:50:20,956 --> 00:50:22,207
My father was sweet?

751
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:25,836
You bet he was.
He was so thoughtful and generous.

752
00:50:29,506 --> 00:50:31,925
Mr. Koo used to be
the ruthless one around here.

753
00:50:32,008 --> 00:50:32,843
Here you go.

754
00:50:34,386 --> 00:50:35,345
Thanks.

755
00:50:41,643 --> 00:50:42,644
You know…

756
00:50:43,436 --> 00:50:44,521
By any chance…

757
00:50:51,027 --> 00:50:55,782
did the late Mr. Kang
tell you something in secret

758
00:50:56,533 --> 00:50:58,285
or entrust you with a special item?

759
00:50:59,077 --> 00:51:01,746
-A special item?
-Did the late Mr. Kang…

760
00:51:02,664 --> 00:51:04,457
Did he really not have
any emergency funds?

761
00:51:06,001 --> 00:51:09,504
Could he have left you with something
you don't recognize the value of?

762
00:51:10,338 --> 00:51:11,882
I was just curious.

763
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:19,139
The truth is…

764
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:22,475
There's nothing.

765
00:51:23,184 --> 00:51:25,186
The bankbook I gave you was everything.

766
00:51:25,812 --> 00:51:27,689
Of course, I should've known better.

767
00:51:28,857 --> 00:51:31,484
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
given up our old office.

768
00:51:52,339 --> 00:51:53,423
Ms. Cha.

769
00:51:54,758 --> 00:51:58,428
If your current job is too rough on you,
you can join us anytime.

770
00:52:00,472 --> 00:52:02,974
You spent 20 years
working for this company.

771
00:52:06,394 --> 00:52:07,646
Goodness, dear.

772
00:52:09,022 --> 00:52:11,232
Thanks for saying that.

773
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:17,113
Right, more than 20 years
have passed already.

774
00:52:20,533 --> 00:52:21,701
You know what?

775
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:26,748
Turns out long years of service don't mean
you deserve a second chance.

776
00:52:30,669 --> 00:52:34,005
I really liked your father.

777
00:52:36,132 --> 00:52:39,594
-Not romantically, but as a colleague.
-Oh, of course.

778
00:52:41,221 --> 00:52:42,722
I loved our company too.

779
00:52:49,896 --> 00:52:51,314
That much is true.

780
00:52:52,482 --> 00:52:55,694
Please remember that, okay?

781
00:53:01,032 --> 00:53:03,118
What time is it?

782
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:06,663
-I should get going. It's late.
-Ms. Cha.

783
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:11,918
-You forgot your bag.
-Oh, right.

784
00:53:15,714 --> 00:53:21,386
Ms. Cha, did you reorganize
the files in this office?

785
00:53:27,267 --> 00:53:30,020
What do you mean? Why would I do that?

786
00:53:31,521 --> 00:53:32,689
I took a look yesterday

787
00:53:33,523 --> 00:53:36,818
and noticed how they were arranged
by date from right to left.

788
00:53:39,404 --> 00:53:41,239
I know that's how you arrange files.

789
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:49,080
I guess someone tried your way, then.

790
00:53:50,915 --> 00:53:51,875
Looks like it.

791
00:53:54,377 --> 00:53:55,587
-Good night, then.
-Okay.

Great. Now, here.

796
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,078
No errors, right?

797
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:34,334
Would you look at that?

798
00:54:35,001 --> 00:54:36,669
Trying to expand to Africa, punk?

799
00:54:36,753 --> 00:54:38,171
Ignore him.

800
00:54:39,172 --> 00:54:40,381
Long time no see, Freckles.

801
00:54:40,465 --> 00:54:41,800
Just ignore him.

802
00:54:41,883 --> 00:54:44,928
No errors, right?
Is the total amount correct?

803
00:54:47,972 --> 00:54:48,973

-Yes?

809
00:55:11,663 --> 00:55:12,705
It will go well.

If you're scared,
we'll cancel the application,

00:55:39,732 --> 00:55:40,900
be it yours or mine.

820
00:55:40,984 --> 00:55:43,069
Are you backing out already?
Cancel yours, then.

821
00:55:43,153 --> 00:55:45,280
Know your place. I'm getting tired now.

822
00:55:45,363 --> 00:55:49,284
Let's play rock, paper, scissors
next time you feel like fooling around.

823
00:55:49,909 --> 00:55:52,912
Sucks for you, but all I can think of
is pummeling you hard.

824
00:55:52,996 --> 00:55:55,165
That way, you'd get to win
once out of ten rounds

825
00:55:55,248 --> 00:55:57,917
when I accidentally make a mistake.

826
00:56:05,258 --> 00:56:06,384
Excuse me.

827
00:56:08,887 --> 00:56:09,721
What's this?

828
00:56:10,305 --> 00:56:13,808
Pyo Merchant Marine was supposed
to procure orange juice, wasn't it?

829
00:56:13,892 --> 00:56:17,687
That's right. But we just updated
the item to rubber gloves…

830
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:19,564
I mean, surgical gloves.

831
00:56:19,647 --> 00:56:22,150
You can't make
last-minute changes like that.

832
00:56:22,233 --> 00:56:24,652
-Then we'll export orange juice--
-Mr. Ha!

833
00:56:26,571 --> 00:56:28,031
I'm going for the gloves.

834
00:56:29,449 --> 00:56:30,408
Gloves it is, then.

835
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:31,784
But the gloves are taken.

836
00:56:31,868 --> 00:56:34,454
The nit-picking Taeheung Trading
took the gloves.

837
00:56:34,537 --> 00:56:36,122
-Typhoon Trading.
-Typhoon Trading.

838
00:56:36,706 --> 00:56:39,167
-Right, Typhoon Trade.
-It's Typhoon Trading.

839
00:56:40,585 --> 00:56:42,003
This isn't your first rodeo.

00:56:42,086 --> 00:56:45,798
Don't go back on your word
and ruin our meticulously crafted plans.

-Let's carry it out as arranged.
-Of course.

00:56:48,384 --> 00:56:49,344
Listen, lady.

843
00:56:50,637 --> 00:56:51,930
Why can't I make changes?

844
00:56:52,013 --> 00:56:55,141
Excuse me? Listen very closely, mister.

845
00:56:55,225 --> 00:56:56,851
I don't appreciate your tone.

846
00:56:56,935 --> 00:56:59,479
I'm a Grade 6 civil servant
with Salary Grade 23.

847
00:56:59,562 --> 00:57:00,647
He's simply curious, ma'am.

848
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:02,815
When we have multiple bidders
on the same item,

849
00:57:02,899 --> 00:57:04,859
we must have competitive bidding.

850
00:57:04,943 --> 00:57:06,444
-Competitive bidding?
-That's right.

851
00:57:06,527 --> 00:57:07,528
What's that?

852
00:57:07,612 --> 00:57:11,199
Each company will submit their price,
and we'll choose the lowest.

853
00:57:11,866 --> 00:57:13,493
-The winner gets the deal.
-That's right.

854
00:57:13,576 --> 00:57:16,788
But with this process,
both of you will sustain heavy losses.

855
00:57:16,871 --> 00:57:18,414
That's exactly my point!

856
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:20,792
All right, then.

857
00:57:21,584 --> 00:57:24,462
Here's an idea.
Why don't you make a compromise?

858
00:57:24,546 --> 00:57:28,091
If one of you changes an item,
I'll offer favorable treatment for you.

859
00:57:28,174 --> 00:57:29,842
-Especially on our next project.
-Great.

860
00:57:29,926 --> 00:57:31,719
-I can assure you that.
-We'll do that.

861
00:57:31,803 --> 00:57:34,722
We submitted our form first.
Don't we have the priority?

862
00:57:35,932 --> 00:57:38,851
That's a load of crap.
There's no rule like that.

863
00:57:39,852 --> 00:57:42,230
-Why, you little--
-All right, fine!

864
00:57:42,313 --> 00:57:43,565
Let's have competitive bidding.

865
00:57:43,648 --> 00:57:46,442
I might as well do it the right way
if there's no way around it.

866
00:57:48,695 --> 00:57:51,614
You seem to know each other,
so mark my words.

867
00:57:51,698 --> 00:57:56,035
I have two terms.
First, submission closes on the dot.

868
00:57:56,119 --> 00:57:58,079
You're out if you miss
any required documents.

869
00:57:58,162 --> 00:58:02,250
Second, the bid will be open 100%
with the lowest bidder winning.

870
00:58:03,793 --> 00:58:06,087
You realize what this means, do you?

871
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:07,380
-Sure.
-Of course.

872
00:58:07,463 --> 00:58:09,382
-You don't.
-Not in here.

873
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,560
Your father would be enraged.

874
00:58:20,643 --> 00:58:22,895
Never mind him.
Just get me all the documents.

875
00:58:24,647 --> 00:58:28,276
And check all the companies
producing surgical gloves

876
00:58:28,359 --> 00:58:29,736
and secure all their stock for me.

877
00:58:30,486 --> 00:58:31,446
Yes, sir.

878
00:58:40,246 --> 00:58:42,415
PURCHASE SPECIFICATIONS

879
00:58:42,498 --> 00:58:44,667
Let's see.

880
00:58:44,751 --> 00:58:46,002
These are ready.

881
00:58:46,085 --> 00:58:48,838
-Do we have enough funds for the bid bond?
-Of course.

882
00:58:48,921 --> 00:58:52,342
Once we secure the deal,
we'll have to wire the deposit too.

883
00:58:52,425 --> 00:58:56,429
We should take that into account.
Have you requested a quotation?

884
00:58:56,512 --> 00:58:59,182
Yes, only three companies produce
the powdered surgical gloves

885
00:58:59,265 --> 00:59:00,892
that meet KOICA's requirements.

886
00:59:00,975 --> 00:59:03,394
-I've made the request to all three.
-Well done.

887
00:59:03,478 --> 00:59:06,939
Everything hinges on price this time,
so quotations matter the most.

888
00:59:07,023 --> 00:59:10,777
Those Pyo Merchant Marine punks
are a pain in our neck.

889
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,362
Why are they getting in our way?

890
00:59:12,445 --> 00:59:16,199
-What's that?
-The translated manual for the gloves.

891
00:59:16,282 --> 00:59:19,869
I don't understand why they would ask
the manual to be translated into French.

892
00:59:19,952 --> 00:59:23,956
All the French phrases I know
are Sophie Marceau and La Boum.

893
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,041
Those two are it.

894
00:59:25,124 --> 00:59:26,584
SPECIFICATION OF SURGICAL GLOVES

895
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:28,086
Mr. Go.

896
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:30,546
Look at this. How could they…

897
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:34,884
They wrote the translations by hand.
Who works this way? Are they crazy?

898
00:59:34,967 --> 00:59:36,594
What's the matter with these people?

899
00:59:36,678 --> 00:59:39,389
They should've typed everything
and sent us the printed copy.

900
00:59:39,472 --> 00:59:41,349
Hold on. What can we do now?

901
00:59:41,432 --> 00:59:43,935
Shouldn't we type every word ourselves?

902
00:59:44,018 --> 00:59:47,522
Of course. But to do that,
we need the right keyboard.

903
00:59:47,605 --> 00:59:50,233
-One that supports French.
-Yes, one that supports French.

904
00:59:50,316 --> 00:59:52,527
-Where can we… Would Mr. Bae know?
-Hold on.

905
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:53,945
In that case…

906
00:59:54,028 --> 00:59:55,488
Who should I call? Oh, right here.

907
01:00:25,977 --> 01:00:30,106
TYPEWRITERS, COPIERS, FACSIMILE

908
01:00:30,189 --> 01:00:32,525
I see. I got it loud and clear. Okay.

909
01:00:32,608 --> 01:00:33,568
-Okay.
-Are we good?

910
01:00:34,861 --> 01:00:38,990
-They managed to find it!
-Gosh, I can't believe they bought one.

911
01:00:39,073 --> 01:00:41,451
-I can't believe they pulled it off.
-They're incredible.

912
01:00:47,707 --> 01:00:50,084
-How are things moving along?
-Great.

913
01:00:51,544 --> 01:00:52,587
Mr. Pyo.

914
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:55,465
About the update to the goods.

915
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:58,551
-Shouldn't we inform your father--
-Forget it.

916
01:00:58,634 --> 01:01:00,511
My dad will only nag some more.

917
01:01:04,932 --> 01:01:07,059
It's all going to be fine.

918
01:01:07,643 --> 01:01:09,103
Look at me, Mr. Ha.

919
01:01:09,187 --> 01:01:10,563
Come on.

920
01:01:11,481 --> 01:01:16,778
You may find my dad hard to deal with,
but no parent wins against their child.

921
01:01:17,779 --> 01:01:19,947
-Don't you worry.
-I won't, sir.

922
01:01:21,032 --> 01:01:25,787
This is the golden opportunity
to make one of my dad's dreams come true.

923
01:01:28,706 --> 01:01:30,666
-Where's that business card?
-Oh, right.

924
01:01:37,048 --> 01:01:39,801
So, this is the surgical gloves company?

925
01:01:52,313 --> 01:01:54,524
PRECAUTIONS FOR USE

926

LIST OF DOCUMENTS TO SUBMIT

928
01:01:57,652 --> 01:01:58,528
Okay, then…

929
01:01:59,278 --> 01:02:00,863
-Are we all set?
-Here. Yes.

930
01:02:00,947 --> 01:02:02,865
-We just need the manual.
-How much longer?

931
01:02:02,949 --> 01:02:05,952
-We're almost done.
-We're nearly there.

932
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:14,001
-Are you done?
-Yes.

933
01:02:14,085 --> 01:02:15,419
-Great.
-Are we ready?

934
01:02:15,503 --> 01:02:16,796
-Ms. Oh, here…
-Print it.

935
01:02:16,879 --> 01:02:19,131
-I'll hit the print button.
-Okay, I'll be right here.

936
01:02:19,215 --> 01:02:20,216
PRINTING

937
01:02:20,299 --> 01:02:21,509
-All right!
-Okay.

938
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:25,805
-You can be quite handy, man.
-I told you I'm a top-level asset.

939
01:02:25,888 --> 01:02:26,722
Mr. Bae.

940
01:02:27,223 --> 01:02:28,933
-Thanks for your trouble.
-You're welcome.

941
01:02:29,016 --> 01:02:30,601
I'm glad we bought that keyboard.

942
01:02:30,685 --> 01:02:35,523
-Yes, that really saved us.
-We owe this success to our joint efforts.

943
01:02:36,816 --> 01:02:40,403
-I can't believe we managed to find this.
-It must've not been easy finding that.

944
01:02:40,486 --> 01:02:41,863
Mr. Kang, look!

945
01:02:41,946 --> 01:02:44,782
-Letters are broken up.
-What's the matter?

946
01:02:44,866 --> 01:02:46,033
Look at these letters.

947
01:02:48,536 --> 01:02:50,413
-What happened?
-Maybe the printer glitched.

948
01:02:50,496 --> 01:02:52,665
-I'll try again.
-Was it the wrong button?

949
01:02:52,748 --> 01:02:54,959
The machine may glitch on the first try.

950
01:02:58,629 --> 01:03:00,965
-There. Check it out.
-Did you do it?

951
01:03:08,931 --> 01:03:10,725
-What's going on here?
-Hold on.

952
01:03:10,808 --> 01:03:13,019
-How…
-What's going on with these letters?

953
01:03:13,102 --> 01:03:14,353
Is it a computer virus?

954
01:03:14,437 --> 01:03:16,314
Wait, it's the font.

955
01:03:16,397 --> 01:03:19,025
-Font?
-The software must not support this font.

956
01:03:19,108 --> 01:03:20,943
What do we do then, Mr. Kang?

957
01:03:21,027 --> 01:03:22,153
It's 2:00 a.m., isn't it?

958
01:03:22,945 --> 01:03:24,614
We've got to find a way quickly.

959
01:03:24,697 --> 01:03:26,866
-What options do we have?
-Reinstall the software?

960
01:03:26,949 --> 01:03:28,117
Hold on. What do we do?

961
01:03:34,999 --> 01:03:36,417
Have you been well?

962
01:03:47,428 --> 01:03:49,513
Quick, give me my work sleeves!

963
01:03:49,597 --> 01:03:50,890
Let's find his work sleeves.

964
01:03:52,475 --> 01:03:53,476
Where are they?

965
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:15,081
TECHNICAL SHEET

966
01:04:21,963 --> 01:04:24,090
He's copying the document faster
than I can type it.

967
01:04:31,055 --> 01:04:33,307
You're great at drawing too. It's amazing.

968
01:04:33,391 --> 01:04:35,226
I feel like I could wear that glove.

969
01:04:35,309 --> 01:04:37,019
SHAPE AND STRUCTURE: DIMENSIONS

970
01:04:37,103 --> 01:04:39,522
I can't believe
he's managing it in one go.

971
01:04:40,606 --> 01:04:42,274
No one will doubt that's a glove.

972
01:04:44,026 --> 01:04:45,361
RAW MATERIALS

973
01:04:51,701 --> 01:04:54,453
POWDER: CORN

974
01:04:55,079 --> 01:04:56,080
-It means corn.
-I see.

975
01:04:56,163 --> 01:04:57,123
So, corn.

976
01:05:01,919 --> 01:05:05,047
-That must mean "powdered corn."
-I guess powdered corn goes into gloves.

977
01:05:06,048 --> 01:05:07,341
I don't mind corn.

978
01:05:24,775 --> 01:05:26,027
I'm done.

979
01:05:28,279 --> 01:05:29,697
Thank you for your hard work.

980
01:05:30,281 --> 01:05:32,241
-You were amazing.
-Way to go, Mr. Koo.

981
01:05:32,324 --> 01:05:33,826
I can't believe my eyes.

982
01:05:33,909 --> 01:05:34,869
Incredible.

983
01:05:34,952 --> 01:05:36,871
Thank you so much. Seriously…

984
01:05:36,954 --> 01:05:39,123
-You did it, Myung-gwan.
-How cool is this?

985
01:05:39,206 --> 01:05:41,876
Thank you. You were brilliant.

986
01:05:43,169 --> 01:05:45,087
-Goodness, you sure are.
-Let's not touch them.

TECHNICAL DATA SHEET FOR SURGICAL GLOVES

988
01:05:49,008 --> 01:05:50,509
Hey, that's not yet cooked.

989
01:05:52,636 --> 01:05:55,056
When it comes to barbecue…

990
01:05:55,139 --> 01:05:56,265
It's not easy, is it?

991
01:05:56,348 --> 01:05:58,559
-Tell me about it.
-You're so clumsy.

992
01:05:58,642 --> 01:06:01,062
-Let me take that.
-I can barely see.

993
01:06:02,521 --> 01:06:04,398
-Hello.
-Welcome.

994
01:06:05,608 --> 01:06:07,985
-Over here, Ms. Cha!
-Hey, welcome.

995
01:06:08,569 --> 01:06:10,988
-Please take a seat.
-Right here, Ms. Cha.

996
01:06:11,072 --> 01:06:15,034
-Goodness.
-You didn't have to invite me as well.

997
01:06:16,494 --> 01:06:17,495
-Mr. Koo.
-Come on.

998
01:06:17,578 --> 01:06:19,789
How could we not
when Mr. Koo saved the day?

999
01:06:23,042 --> 01:06:24,835
-Let me pour you a glass.
-Okay.

1000
01:06:25,419 --> 01:06:26,587
Let me pour you one.

1001
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:30,758
Now that you're here, make a toast for us.
It's been a while.

1002
01:06:30,841 --> 01:06:33,677
You'd like that? Okay.
What should I go with?

1003
01:06:34,512 --> 01:06:35,596
How about this?

1004
01:06:36,305 --> 01:06:38,099
-Let's go with "ILA."
-Okay.

1005
01:06:38,182 --> 01:06:40,142
All together, then. One, two…

1006
01:06:40,226 --> 01:06:41,185
-I!
-I!

1007
01:06:41,268 --> 01:06:43,187
It can be terribly exhausting.

1008
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:44,396
-L!
-L!

1009
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,898
Let's still hang in there…

1010
01:06:45,981 --> 01:06:47,775
-A!
-A!

1011
01:06:47,858 --> 01:06:49,652
And thrive!

1012
01:06:51,695 --> 01:06:53,489
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1013
01:06:54,073 --> 01:06:58,327
-Great.
-All right.

1014
01:06:58,410 --> 01:07:00,454
Wait until the meat turns brown, punk.

1015
01:07:00,538 --> 01:07:03,290
Uncooked meat can make you ill.
I'm genuinely concerned.

1016
01:07:03,374 --> 01:07:04,667
Did you submit the documents?

1017
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,460
Listen. When I got there…

1018
01:07:07,128 --> 01:07:09,880
What was that shifty little punk's name?
Was it Ha?

1019
01:07:09,964 --> 01:07:12,591
That guy was walking over,
so I glared at him

1020
01:07:12,675 --> 01:07:15,261
to let him know
I was ready to take him down.

1021
01:07:15,344 --> 01:07:17,930
-I scared the hell out of him.
-He sure was charismatic.

1022
01:07:19,932 --> 01:07:22,268
Are you trying
to memorize the menu, Mr. Koo?

1023
01:07:23,894 --> 01:07:27,273
I can't decide
if I want noodles, the stew,

1024
01:07:27,356 --> 01:07:28,691
or the scorched rice soup.

1025
01:07:28,774 --> 01:07:31,652
-Shall we order more meat?
-Go ahead.

1026
01:07:31,735 --> 01:07:34,071
Ma'am, three portions of meat, please.

1027
01:07:34,155 --> 01:07:36,073
-Just two portions, please.
-Oh, come on.

1028
01:07:36,157 --> 01:07:38,284
Order some more. I want to take some home.

1029
01:07:39,076 --> 01:07:41,495
The decent thing to do
is take the leftovers.

1030
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:43,330
Don't claim stuff from the get-go.

1031
01:07:43,414 --> 01:07:45,708
Come on,
my kid is a senior in high school.

1032
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,959
Wrap these up for now.

1033
01:07:47,042 --> 01:07:48,669
-Take them home.
-Thanks.

1034
01:07:48,752 --> 01:07:49,628
It looks so good.

1035
01:07:49,712 --> 01:07:51,046
Mr. Koo.

1036
01:07:52,715 --> 01:07:53,799
No, that's okay.

1037
01:07:53,883 --> 01:07:55,551
I'd say these are all cooked.

1038
01:07:56,385 --> 01:07:59,346
It's not good for your health
to overcook the meat.

1039
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:01,015
It can increase the risk of cancer.

1040
01:08:01,932 --> 01:08:03,225
You're a know-it-all.

1041
01:08:08,314 --> 01:08:10,941
Mr. Koo, have some coffee.

1042
01:08:13,235 --> 01:08:14,195
Thank you.

1043
01:08:16,113 --> 01:08:19,158
I wanted to get some air. That's all.

1044
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:23,871
Goodness.

1045
01:08:24,955 --> 01:08:26,457
Thank you for what you've done today.

1046
01:08:27,666 --> 01:08:30,836
The idea of copying the notes by hand
didn't even occur to me.

1047
01:08:33,088 --> 01:08:34,215
It was nothing.

1048
01:08:36,467 --> 01:08:39,887
Back in the day,
we used to complete all forms by hand,

1049
01:08:40,471 --> 01:08:41,764
whatever document it was.

1050
01:08:46,435 --> 01:08:47,436
Mr. Koo.

1051
01:08:48,062 --> 01:08:52,441
What Typhoon Trading needs at the moment
is a tree rather than a flower.

1052
01:08:53,734 --> 01:08:56,278
Trees can give you shelter
from the sun in summer

1053
01:08:56,362 --> 01:08:58,489
and a warm layer of leaves in fall.

1054
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:03,869
In winter,
they can even give us some firewood.

1055
01:09:06,747 --> 01:09:12,211
I'd appreciate a sturdy tree
with layers of growth rings.

1056
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,172
I can't recall what they called it.

1057
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:18,342
I'm not the sharpest, you see.

1058
01:09:23,347 --> 01:09:25,099
Take your time and join us back in.

1059
01:09:26,642 --> 01:09:27,893
You have to come back in.

1060
01:09:36,777 --> 01:09:37,903
Growth rings, huh?

1061
01:09:41,073 --> 01:09:42,533
He must be talking about experience.

1062
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:50,165
I prefer Job's tears tea.

1063
01:09:56,255 --> 01:09:57,548
Get up now.

1064
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,717
-See you tomorrow.
-See you, Mr. Koo.

1065
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,011
-Get home safely.
-Stop wandering and come to work!

1066
01:10:02,094 --> 01:10:03,387
-Good night.
-Hey, driver!

1067
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:05,097
-Our ride is here.
-Jeez, you dummy.

1068
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:06,890
-Let me in!
-He's a handful. Hey, you.

1069
01:10:06,974 --> 01:10:08,475
-We're sharing the car!
-Hey, punk.

1070
01:10:08,559 --> 01:10:10,477
I can't get out now.

1071
01:10:10,561 --> 01:10:11,979
I'll give you the taxi fare.

1072
01:10:12,062 --> 01:10:13,522
I'll get you a taxi too, Seon-taek.

1073
01:10:13,605 --> 01:10:15,190
-No, please.
-I'll pay double!

1074
01:10:15,274 --> 01:10:17,776
We're paying double, darn it!

1075
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:19,111
-This is our ride.
-Sorry.

1076
01:10:19,194 --> 01:10:20,571
-You can take the taxi.
-Goodness.

1077
01:10:20,654 --> 01:10:22,489
-I'm not sure--
-Get in there, Seon-taek.

1078
01:10:22,573 --> 01:10:24,074
You don't have to double the rate.

1079
01:10:24,158 --> 01:10:25,784
I can't believe you.

1080
01:10:25,868 --> 01:10:27,369
-Here we go.
-Hey, wait.

1081
01:10:27,453 --> 01:10:28,996
-Take this.
-What's this? Oh, no.

1082
01:10:29,079 --> 01:10:30,205
I insist. Take it.

1083
01:10:30,289 --> 01:10:31,874
I'm not taking it back!

1084
01:10:31,957 --> 01:10:34,293
-Listen, Seon-taek.
-Yes?

1085
01:10:34,376 --> 01:10:39,423
I know you've got your husband and kid,
but prioritize yourself, okay?

1086
01:10:40,341 --> 01:10:41,425
You're unbelievable.

1087
01:10:42,092 --> 01:10:45,346
Your folks might not be around,
but you have us.

1088
01:10:48,974 --> 01:10:50,142
You can go now.

1089
01:10:50,225 --> 01:10:51,518
Off you go!

1090
01:10:51,602 --> 01:10:53,020
Thank you.

1091
01:10:53,103 --> 01:10:54,938
-Thanks again!
-Get home safely.

1092
01:10:55,022 --> 01:10:56,357
-Thank you!
-No problem.

1093
01:10:58,067 --> 01:10:59,109
Goodbye.

1094
01:10:59,193 --> 01:11:00,319
-Taxi!
-Mi-seon.

1095
01:11:00,402 --> 01:11:01,445
-Mi-seon!
-Double the rate!

1096
01:11:01,528 --> 01:11:03,155
-I'll quadruple the rate!
-Here, Mi-seon.

1097
01:11:03,238 --> 01:11:04,990
-What?
-No, I'll pay eightfold!

1098
01:11:05,074 --> 01:11:06,658
Are you getting on? Go ahead, sirs.

1099
01:11:06,742 --> 01:11:07,993
I'm taking the subway.

1100
01:11:08,077 --> 01:11:09,870
-I see. Get home safely.
-Oh, goodbye.

1101
01:11:09,953 --> 01:11:12,331
-Don't squabble, okay?
-Okay, we won't.

1102
01:11:13,123 --> 01:11:14,166
Good night.

1103
01:11:16,377 --> 01:11:20,089
It sure felt like the old days
to have everyone together.

1104
01:11:25,886 --> 01:11:28,013
Do you want to walk together for a bit?

1105
01:11:30,182 --> 01:11:31,350
Sure.

1106
01:11:47,991 --> 01:11:49,034
Thanks.

1107
01:11:51,954 --> 01:11:53,288
I've given it a thought.

1108
01:12:00,963 --> 01:12:01,797
I can't do that.

1109
01:12:03,632 --> 01:12:07,678
I can't pretend like
what happened between us never happened.

1110
01:12:09,513 --> 01:12:10,889
Do you dislike me, Mi-seon?

1111
01:12:12,975 --> 01:12:15,144
No, I don't dislike you at all.

1112
01:12:16,728 --> 01:12:19,940
I just don't feel comfortable
when the air goes mellow around us.

1113
01:12:21,525 --> 01:12:23,902
You should just take it easy--

1114
01:12:23,986 --> 01:12:25,737
You don't get to decide how I feel.

1115
01:12:26,822 --> 01:12:28,490
My feelings for you won't change.

1116
01:12:32,453 --> 01:12:34,246
Feel this. My heart is racing.

1117
01:12:34,329 --> 01:12:37,332
-It's because I like being with you.
-I get it, okay?

1118
01:12:42,671 --> 01:12:45,883
I'm going to like you,
and my feelings will only grow stronger.

1119
01:12:50,471 --> 01:12:53,015
Don't you worry. I won't let
my feelings interfere with work.

1120
01:12:53,098 --> 01:12:56,852
Yes, I'm the CEO,
and you're my senior staff.

1121
01:12:57,644 --> 01:12:58,562
Yes.

1122
01:13:02,483 --> 01:13:03,692
Jeez.

1123
01:13:06,236 --> 01:13:07,946
But know this.

1124
01:13:10,699 --> 01:13:11,825
You should know…

1125
01:13:15,913 --> 01:13:16,914
that I…

1126
01:13:23,921 --> 01:13:25,172
I love you.

1127
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:33,430
Although it's one-sided.

1128
01:13:40,354 --> 01:13:42,147
It's my first unrequited love.

1129
01:14:03,835 --> 01:14:10,509
TOMORROW COMES LOVE

1130
01:14:42,624 --> 01:14:45,544
TYPHOON FAMILY

1131
01:14:45,627 --> 01:14:48,046
Starting today, I'll act on my feelings.

1132
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:50,299
Where do I start?
You think I can pull it off?

1133
01:14:50,382 --> 01:14:51,717
Those surgical gloves

1134
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,594
are made in one place in the US.

1135
01:14:53,677 --> 01:14:54,636
That's a monopoly.

1136
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:56,555
If the starting lines aren't the same,

1137
01:14:56,638 --> 01:14:58,932
maybe we take a step ahead.

1138
01:14:59,016 --> 01:15:01,476
What's most precious to you, Ms. Oh?

1139
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,644
And you, Mr. Kang?

1140
01:15:02,728 --> 01:15:03,854
What matters most to you?

1141
01:15:03,937 --> 01:15:05,147
While you were quiet,

1142
01:15:05,647 --> 01:15:06,690
you made this mess?

1143
01:15:06,773 --> 01:15:08,317
It's not over yet.

1144
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,943
Even if I take a few jabs,

1145
01:15:10,027 --> 01:15:11,695
one uppercut from me and he's done.

1146
01:15:11,778 --> 01:15:13,155
Please! Ms. Oh!

1147
01:15:13,655 --> 01:15:14,615
Oh Mi-seon!

1148
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:20,203
