Yu Manman has used up her quota,

181
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,960
that's why she had to use my name

to buy it for her.

a lot of attention to Xiao Bu recently.

00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:03,710
Alright.

341
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,830
Let's go, Manman.

342
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,430
Alright.

343
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,560
As for the others,
start your training in groups.

344
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,350
What's a qualifier?

345
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
A qualifier

346
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,590
is an early round before the preliminary

347
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,680
to select participants after the audition.

348
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,680
Participants will have to

349
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,830
submit a dancing video

350
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,590
via the official website for evaluation.

351
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,190
Those who passed the evaluation
are entitled to join the first round.

352
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,070
I see.

353
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,800
What do you think?

354
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,160
She controls her moves so well.

355
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,560
She's the representative
of the St. Petersburg this year,

356
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,280
who's also your strongest rival.

357
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,800
People call her the Alien.

358
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,680
She has been championing
the competition three times in a row.

359
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,560
She even said

360
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,160
that she'll win her fourth championship.

361
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,110
Nothing's stopping her.

362
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,760
That's very bold.

363
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,590
She has the right to say so.

364
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,400
Do you know how they train?

365
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,350
They use editing software

366
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,430
to check her moves frame by frame.

367
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,520
Only when the students can dance

368
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,280
just the same as the tutor,

369
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,190
then they are allowed to compete.

370
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,350
No wonder all her moves
are so standardized

371
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,190
and sharp.

372
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,110
The deadline for submitting
the qualifier video

373
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,470
is almost over.

374
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,830
We're out of time.

375
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,710
So, we're going to use the same method

376
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,880
for our training.

377
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,590
Manman, there's only one champion.

378
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,280
There's no turning back.

379
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,160
Let's do it.

380
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:52,520
Here,

381
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,680
cheers for the new semester.

382
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,520
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

383
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,350
Here.

384
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,800
Let this non-ballet student

385
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,230
be your host today.

386
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,110
We'll summarize the previous semester

387
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,640
and set a goal for the next.

388
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,760
Let's

389
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,640
start from the youngest.

390
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,590
For me,

391
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,040
never have I thought

392
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,070
from a little coward,

393
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,310
a nobody who stands in the corner,

394
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,160
I have grown up so much

395
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,520
and be able to perform
with my idol on stage.

396
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,190
There's nothing else I could hope for.

397
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
My life is complete.

398
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,310
My turn then.

399
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,160
Ling Chen seldom requests to speak first.

400
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,230
I'm honored to meet all of you.

401
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,070
You're more honored
to meet Shi Xiaochun, I suppose.

402
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,470
Hong.

403
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,350
For me,

404
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,560
before I met all of you,

405
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,640
I have no one beside me

406
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,950
and I felt that I didn't need a friend.

407
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,400
After spending time with all of you,

408
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,470
I finally understand

409
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,350
how great it feels to have friends.

410
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,470
Enough.

411
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,880
It's enough for sentimentality.
My turn now.

412
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,710
Everything we do in our lives

413
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,950
depend on our luck.

414
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,590
I'm also incredibly lucky
to have met you all.

415
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,710
I hope in the coming days,

416
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,880
we can still be as close as we are,

417
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,560
eat together,

418
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,950
drink together

419
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,470
and dance together.

420
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,950
Cheers for our friendship.

421
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:26,590
Here.

422
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:27,760
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

423
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:31,640
Oh, right.

424
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,230
Have you watched the dance video

425
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:34,920
from Theater of St. Petersburg?

426
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,400
Who is it?

427
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,280
She's the three-time consecutive winner

428
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,680
of the International College
Ballet Competition.

429
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,560
She's really impressive.

430
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,160
Yes, she's great.

431
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,520
Her muscle control
is just extraordinary.

432
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,400
If Yu Manman sees the video,

433
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,230
what would she think?

434
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,710
Speaking about Manman,

435
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,830
she's preparing for the qualifier video

436
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,830
days and nights.

437
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,800
She even seldom
shows up in the dormitory.

438
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,880
Xiaochun,

439
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,310
I've always wanted to ask you a question.

440
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,230
Seeing Yu Manman preparing
for the competition every day,

441
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,160
don't you want to try too?

442
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,950
Yes, Xiaochun.

443
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,640
I...

444
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,470
For me,

445
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,070
you're just as good as Yu Manman.

446
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,070
I can't do it.

447
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,880
I'm still not up to standard yet.

448
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,280
Let's hope I get the chance in the future.

449
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,000
Manman is more suitable
for the competition.

450
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,190
She was born for the competition.

451
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,040
Show me

452
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,800
the excitement
when Coppélia earned her freedom!

453
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,470
Smile, Yu Manman. Be more cheerful.

454
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,430
What's wrong with you?

455
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,680
Are you afraid

456
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,230
that you can't win?

457
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,350
No.

458
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,590
Look at the way you dance.

459
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,470
Show me how eager
you want to win, Yu Manman!

460
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,070
Do you still want to compete?

461
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,830
Yes.

462
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,190
Prove it to me then.

463
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,280
We are coming to the final beats.

464
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,560
Five, six, seven, eight.

465
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,430
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

466
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,560
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

467
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Three, two, three, four...

468
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,520
Manman!

469
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,400
Manman!

470
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
Don't move, Manman.

471
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,520
Don't move, Manman.

472
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,590
Hello, we have an emergency.

473
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,710
This is the dance building
of the Haicheng North Area.

474
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:09,430
Yes.

475
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,400
No,

476
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,470
I still want to dance.

477
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,430
I still want...

478
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,350
Manman, wake up!

479
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,350
Manman!

480
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:19,950
Mom.

481
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,070
Eat it while it's still hot.

482
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,230
- Thank you, aunt.
- Thank you, aunt.

483
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,160
You must be tired, mom.

484
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,710
Not at all.

485
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,190
Thank you.

486
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,560
Eat more.

487
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,160
Alright.

488
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,710
Wait.

489
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,280
Hello, aunt.

490
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,230
What?

491
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,040
Alright, got it.

492
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,190
What happened?

493
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,470
Yu Manman is hurt,

494
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,230
she's in the hospital.

495
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,280
Is it serious?

496
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,590
I'm not too sure.

497
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,230
Her parents are now in the hospital.

498
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,040
They told me to pick up
her identification card

499
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,760
in her dormitory.

500
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,070
Give me your keys, Xiaochun.

501
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,040
Let me get it for you.

502
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,590
It'll save you time for registration.

503
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,710
You can head to the hospital,
I'll catch up with you later.

504
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,560
- Alright, let's go then.
- I...

505
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,350
I'll follow you as well.

506
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,520
Yes.

507
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,880
It's alright, Jiaoyang, Pan Pan.

508
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,760
When we need help,

509
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,560
