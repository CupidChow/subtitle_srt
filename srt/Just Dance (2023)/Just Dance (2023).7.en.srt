Hong Jiaoyang, Four Little Swans
is not the best for you.

24
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,170
Teacher, I'd like a chance to try it.

25
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,340
Ms. Yu, Hong Jiaoyang
has improved greatly.

26
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,850
Her stability

27
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,170
is one of the best in class.

28
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,060
She doesn't look good enough.

29
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,780
I mean the body.

30
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,610
Four Little Swans isn't very hard.

31
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,810
But it requires the performers
to be in sync and light.

32
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,810
Your figure decides

33
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,740
it's impossible for you to
perform Four Little Swans.

34
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,380
But Ms. Yu, this is my last chance.

35
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,420
I know you want to transfer.

36
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,170
For that, you need a main role.

37
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,530
I'd love to help you.

38
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,380
But as you saw,

39
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,340
you're not meant to perform
Four Little Swans.

40
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:16,730
Yes.

41
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,500

44
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,170

I'd like to discuss a matter with you.

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,010
What is it?

51
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,060
I can't play Von Rothbart.

52
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,780
What do you mean?

53
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,580
Enough with this nonsense.

54
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,650
Do you think Ms. Yu and I
have nothing better to do?

55
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,860
I'm serious.

56
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,580
I have some new ideas about this role.

57
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,090
What ideas? Do tell.

58
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,500
The thing is,

59
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,250
after my rehearsal with Manman,

60
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,090
I realize Von Rothbart and I

61
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,650
are too different.

62
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,940
Just as Ms. Yu told Hong earlier,

63
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,980
she wasn't meant to perform
Four Little Swans.

64
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,250
Von Rothbart is both female and male.

65
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,370
But look at me.

66
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,010
I'm too masculine
to play this character.

67
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:23,580
Stop.

68
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,170
You want a different role?

69
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,580
That's too sudden.

70
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,220
Where are we supposed
to find a suitable candidate

71
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,980
to perform Von Rothbart?

72
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,890
Xiao Bu, answer me.

73
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,250
Someone does come to mind.

74
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:34,940
Who is it?

75
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,450
Hong Jiaoyang, of course.

76
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,300
Hong.

77
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,980
Xiaochun.

78
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,810
Hong.

79
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,340
Hong.

80
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,450
Hang in there.

81
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,890
This isn't the friend I know.

82
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,700
You don't give up so easily.

83
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,170
I've given my best.

84
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,420
I pushed myself
to the limits with every step.

85
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,860
But I...

86
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,500
But I still couldn't do well.

87
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,610
You did pretty well, trust me.

88
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,010
All right.

89
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,500
Let's calm down
and figure something out.

90
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,610
Things will get better.

91
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,250
Hush, don't cry.

92
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,490
Aren't you the ripped Barbie?

93
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,420
Hong Jiaoyang couldn't do well

94
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,980
because she was born
with the unsuitable body.

95
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,020
She is too tall

96
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,490
and her aura is too prominent.

97
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,420
She can try forever

98
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,370
and still can't do as well as Xiaochun
and Manman in that dance.

99
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,740
But when Hong Jiaoyang
performs Latin dances,

100
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,210
since she's also training kids,

101
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,370
she dances both the men's
and women's steps.

102
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,900
Hong can outshine any guy
when she does the men's steps.

103
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,370
Sir, I have the video.
Have a look.

104
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:52,490
Sir...

105
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,770
Ms. Yu, I recorded this video of her.

106
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,650
Not bad.

107
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,650
But doing well in a Latin dance

108
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,250
doesn't mean she is good enough
to play the demon Von Rothbart.

109
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,210
Xiao Bu, focus on your own practice.

110
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,050
We don't have any plans
to make any changes to performers.

111
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,460
Hold on.

112
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,050
I agree with Ms. Yu.

113
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,020
Go back to your practice.

114
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,460
Goodbye.

115
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,460
Xiao Bu.

116
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,210
Why did you ask us to come here?

117
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,020
What is it?

118
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,650
I have a big announcement to make.

119
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,210
What announcement?

120
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,770
I want Hong Jiaoyang
to play Von Rothbart.

121
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,020
A cross-dressing role.

122
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,620
That sounds cool!

123
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,930
But isn't that your role?

124
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,810
I think

125
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,300
the role needs someone

126
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,900
more suitable to make it shine.

127
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,980
What makes Von Rothbart special?

128
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,490
The strength of a man
and the agility of a woman.

129
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,050
That's exactly
Hong's greatest strong suit.

130
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,530
Let's train hard this week.

131
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,700
Give it a shot.

132
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,650
In the next lesson,
you take my place as Von Rothbart.

133
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,700
The character wears a mask

134
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,330
during the dance anyway.

135
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,420
Give it a shot, Hong.
You can do this.

136
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,300
Don't be afraid, this will decide
whether or not you get to transfer.

137
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,980
For Hong's grand plan to transfer!

138
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,420
Go!

139
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,740
Don't get ahead of yourself.

140
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,530
To undertake this challenge,

141
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,140
one person is essential.

142
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,330
Who is it?

143
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,620
The prince.

144
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,090
Are you saying I should

145
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,020
ask him out?

146
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,770
What are the odds?

147
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,490
Where else can I be?

148
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,620
So, are you free
this Saturday afternoon?

149
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,370
I have a small favor to ask of you.

150
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,930
Are you in trouble again?

151
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,210
No.

152
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,580
Xiao Bu gave Hong
the role of Von Rothbart.

153
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,810
We need your help with the dance.

154
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,210
Hong needs to do well in the final

155
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:15,980
for her transfer.

156
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,580
This means the world to Hong.

157
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,370
Please.

158
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,980
When the job is done,

159
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,420
I'll treat you to a hearty meal.

160
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,250
How about that?

161
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:34,900
Fine.

162
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,300
Great. See you this Saturday afternoon.

163
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,370
Fawn Training Program. Don't forget.

164
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,650
I'll see you there.

165
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:42,900
Eat up.

166
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,740
Hong, you did a great job.

167
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:39,890
Trust me.

168
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,060
You were born to play this role.

169
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,620
Thank you.

170
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,530
Shi Xiaochun, stop smirking.

171
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,060
Your performance as the Black Swan

172
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,210
is average at best.

173
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,650
Sorry about that.

174
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,500
By the way, Xiaochun,

175
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,740
would you like to try again
with Ling Chen?

176
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,890
Aren't you competing to play
the Black and White Swans?

177
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,650
I...

178
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,130
How about this, Shi Xiaochun?

179
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,300
Follow your feelings.
Let's try it again.

180
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,420
Okay.

181
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,940
We've been in here the whole day.

182
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,130
Leave the two of them be.

183
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,450
Let's get some drinks.

184
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:17,770
Let's go.

185
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,260
Drinks. Yes.

186
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,380
- Come on. Let's go.
- Go.

187
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,500
We'll bring you two some drinks.

188
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,060
Hong? Xiao Bu?

189
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,890
Getting some drinks. Bye.

190
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,740
What should I do?

191
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,820
You must tease me as hard as you can.

192
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,010
Are you taking advantage of me?

193
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,890
The Black Swan
is meant to tease the prince.

194
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,940
Otherwise, how would
he get bewitched so easily?

195
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,650
Oh, that's what you mean.

196
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,210
What else did you think I meant?

197
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,010
Nothing. That's a great idea.

198
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,500
So be it. Let's begin.

199
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:15,770
Let's begin.

200
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,740
What is wrong with you?

201
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,620
You're supposed to get teased.

202
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,060
Why aren't you doing your part?

203
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,500
What kind of a Black Swan are you?

204
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,650
You're as rigid as a log.

205
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,650
What is the Black Swan supposed to do?

206
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,650
The one I liked ran away for another.

207
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,130
Am I supposed to go after him?

208
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,690
The one I like won't even come near me.

209
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,420
That is just sad.

210
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,940
Play hard-to-get, get it?

211
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,420
Nope.

212
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,650
When you truly
fall in love with someone,

213
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,690
you'll understand.

214
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:07,980
You two,

215
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,890
the mood is somewhat different.

216
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,690
- No.
- No.

217
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,420
We were practicing the whole time.

218
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,090
Don't get the wrong idea.

219
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,450
We didn't.

220
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,180
Were you lying?

221
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,330
Thanks.

222
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:27,820
Thanks.

223
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,130
By the way, Ling Chen,

224
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,420
Wild Peacock,

225
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,380
thanks for helping me out today.

226
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,890
Don't mention it. I'm glad to help.

227
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,500
Hong, we are your friends, after all.

228
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,530
Cheers.

229
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,570
Dinner is on me tonight
to celebrate our successful rehearsal.

230
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,260
We should watch a movie.

231
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,860
A movie?

232
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,500
I'm hungry.
We should get some food.

233
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,980
What do you have in mind?

234
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,090
This place.
I think the food here is good.

235
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:53,650
No, it's not.

236
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,180
Shi Xiaochun!

237
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,860
Come on, let's move up ahead.

238
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,740
Let's go.

239
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,330
Ling Chen, what's wrong?

240
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,060
A girl shouldn't put her hands
around a man's shoulder in public.

241
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,180
The Good-for-nothing League
is all about pure friendship.

242
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,300
There's no innocent friendship
between men and women.

243
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,210
You must not act so intimate

244
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,060
unless it's about work.

245
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,940
Why the sudden interest in my behavior?

246
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,010
Aren't you competing to play White Swan

247
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,180
and dance with me?

248
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,890
You should cultivate your relationship
with the prince.

249
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,940
If you have too much
physical contact with men,

250
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,980
it's going to affect our aura on stage.

251
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,010
For real?

252
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:40,980
Okay, fine.

253
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,300
Let's go.

254
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,820
He actually said that?

255
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,650
You know what?

256
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,010
He was so serious.

257
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,300
I'll do an impression.

258
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,260
Now,

259
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,890
you are me.

260
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:03,980
I'll be Ling Chen.

261
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,570
There is a sense of mystery in his eyes.

262
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,130
He said it.

263
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,890
"There's no innocent friendship
between men and women."

264
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,940
"You must not act so intimate

265
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,010
unless it's about work."

266
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,130
That's so funny.

267
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
What's so funny?

268
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,820
This is driving me insane.

269
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,090
Come on, analyze it for me.

270
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,940
When you danced with him,

271
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,650
did you feel your heart rate elevating?

272
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,210
Yes or no? You can tell me.

273
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,650
Yes.

274
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,650
Happy now?

275
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,500
That settles it.

276
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,620
If that happened when you two danced,

277
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,890
why can't you apply it to real life?

278
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,860
From what I see,

279
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,330
it's very likely
he has feelings for you too.

280
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,570
For real?

281
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,890
No way.

282
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,620
He is the mighty prince.

283
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,210
Enough about that.

284
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,300
Let's talk about you.

285
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,060
Tomorrow is your last dance.
Are you confident enough for it?

286
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,090
With your guys around,

287
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,330
I can nail it with no problem.

288
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,740
[Department of Ballet]

289
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,420
All right, gather at the center.

290
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,180
Come on.

291
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,770
Take off the mask.

292
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:24,690
Ms. Yu.

293
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,420
This Von Rothbart was remarkable, right?

294
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,330
Better than you.

295
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,060
I admit it.

296
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,940
Enough.

297
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,740
You always come up with new tricks.

298
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,890
But the effect was respectable.

299
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,450
Ms. Yu, what do you think?

300
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,770
She has more depth than Xiao Bu.

301
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,210
It's so-so, somewhat passable.

302
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,420
Thank you.

303
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,060
Ling Chen.

304
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:46,620
Yes.

305
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,130
You did so much better this time.

306
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,090
I don't know what happened,

307
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,690
but keep working on it.

308
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,330
All the best.

309
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,300
Thank you, sir.

310
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,060
Hong, that was awesome.

311
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,330
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

312
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,420
Congratulations to Hong

313
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,980
for getting the role of Von Rothbart.

314
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,690
All thanks to your help.

315
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:10,980
I think

316
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,570
I'm one step closer
to a successful transfer.

317
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,900
Don't get ahead of yourself.

318
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,980
It's almost time
for the cultural lesson's test.

319
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,540
Yeah.

320
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,050
The average score

321
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,980
has to be above 90.

322
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,980
What do I do now?

323
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,500
Me and my lousy English...

324
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,690
What now?

325
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,330
Don't give up just yet.

326
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,860
When we stick together,

327
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,290
nothing is impossible for us.

328
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,690
We conquered the entrance exam

329
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,290
and the role selection.

330
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,500
I think a test like this

331
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,620
will be a walk in the park for us.

332
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,210
The Good-for-nothing League can do it.

333
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,410
We are the best.

334
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,660
- Come, cheers!
- Cheers!

335
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,170
All the best!

336
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,170
My goodness,
this is too much and too hard.

337
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,980
Who knows what questions
we'll get later?

338
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,620
What if I can't do it?

339
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,690
Do I have to memorize the whole book?

340
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,410
Memorize as much as you can.

341
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,740
It might actually work.

342
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,690
Why do we have both
written and speaking tests for English?

343
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,380
I am so nervous right now
I feel like using the restroom.

344
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,050
I'm nervous too.

345
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,020
Nothing we can do about it.

346
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,690
There are a bunch of topics
I've never even read about,

347
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,380
much less memorizing.

348
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,380
Are you that scared of this small test?

349
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,540
Use the all-purpose English
template I sent in the group chat.

350
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,260
Follow those lines. It will work.

351
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,810
For real? It's that useful?

352
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,660
Of course.

353
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,980
I'll memorize it now.

354
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,410
- How did you do?
- How was it?

355
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,020
Was it hard?

356
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,570
What was the question?

357
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,380
What did the teacher ask?

358
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,020
It's not that hard.

359
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,290
Do what you normally do.

360
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,620
As for the question,

361
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,290
it was about the Far-East conflicts.

362
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,450
Far-East conflicts...

363
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,450
I can't even tell it in Chinese,
much less English.

364
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,570
What about the template?

365
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,500
It works the same way.

366
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,740
Next one, Shi Xiaochun.

367
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,450
It's my turn now.

368
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,980
All the best, Xiaochun.

369
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:09,930
Xiao Bu.

370
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,570
It's alright.

371
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:19,860
Hello.

372
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,050
Good morning, nice to meet you.

373
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,860
Hello, teacher.

374
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,660
Please take a seat.

375
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,020
Good morning.

376
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,020
Please.

377
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,330
Okay.

378
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,020
(Darn it.)

379
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,620
(It's the chapter I didn't read.)

380
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,570
(I don't even
understand a word on this.)

381
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,090
(It looks familiar, though.)

382
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,540
Well, global warming.

383
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,210
Well, don't panic. Just talk about

384
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:56,170
how to actively to environmental
protection as a college student.

385
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,690
(My goodness.
What is she even talking about?)

386
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,930
(She spoke lightning-fast.)

387
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,500
(I only heard "How" in the whole line.)

389
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,050
Use the template!

390

Template!

391
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,690
Template.

Have you ever heard about 3R?

395
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,290
(Very hard.)

396
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,050
(Great! I memorized that!)

397
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,410
Yeah.

398
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,620
I studied English very hard.

399
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,620
English is an important language.

400
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:48,210
Because English is most
widely used in the world.

401
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,900
Spoken is not...

402
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,500
One was bad enough,

403
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,620
and now you've done it as a group.

404
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:00,860
See this?

405
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,290
See your pathetic scores?

406
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,620
Do you think dancing is all that matters

407
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,140
so cultural lessons are not important?

408
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:11,410
Come on.

409
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,500
Aren't you a talent, Shi Xiaochun?

410
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,740
You scored zero points in
the speaking test.

411
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,900
Did you even go to English lessons?

412
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,410
You two are one and the same.

413
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,900
Were you daydreaming during the test?

414
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,450
And you, Hong Jiaoyang.

415
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,410
You were unbelievable.

416
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,500
It was a translation
from English to Chinese.

417
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,980
How did you mistake it for an essay?

418
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,930
What?

419
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,090
"Loving Your Life"
was about the translation?

420
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,500
What about the essay?

421
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,090
You find that funny?

422

If you fail, your right to participate
in the final is revoked.

432
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,290
But sir,
that means I won't get to transfer.

433

What were you doing the whole time?

434
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,170
Sir, do we have a chance
to make up for this?

435
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,290
Remember,

436
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,660
you only get to retake once.

437
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,900
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Lin.

[Fifth Attempt: Listening and Writing]

00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,740
I do okay in listening.

445
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,380
Is that so?

446
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,170
I felt as though
a breeze had passed me by.

447
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,410
I didn't hear a thing.

448
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,260
Am I hearing-impaired?

449
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,500
I'm never passing the retake.

Did you see this message?

453
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,450
(Wild Peacock, English is hard.)

No idea.

but she never replied.

She would never skip it.

Do not defend her.

508
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,570
I know the retake is important.

509
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,690
But so is the final.

510
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,450
Don't you know your priorities?

511
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,090
If you can't even make sure
you attend every lesson,

512
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,210
how can you compete
to be the White Swan?

513
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,210
Are you quitting the final?

514
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,210
No.

515
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,410
Enough.

516
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,540
Reflect on your mistakes.

517
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,290
Remember,

518
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,660
go to Ling Chen later.

519
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,140
I asked him to help you
with the lesson today.

520
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,570
Understood.

521
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,380
I'll be going now.

522
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,660
[Department of Ballet]

523
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,170
Shi Xiaochun.

524
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:15,780
Stop studying English.

525
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,900
Mr. Lin asked me

526
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,980
to help you with the lesson
you missed yesterday.

527
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,410
Hurry up and get warmed up.

528
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,660
English is almost
like an alien language to me.

529
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,410
The answer is C.

530
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,690
How do you know?

531
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,260
Don't you know verbs and subjects?

532
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,980
Come on, this is it.

533
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:39,860
Read this out for me.

534
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,210
But it's too long.

535
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,260
I can't read it.

536
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:50,660
What about this?

537
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,170
"Have been."

538
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,210
Yes, it's "have been."

539
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,930
"Have been" represents

540
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,260
the present perfect tense.

541
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,810
It can also mean

542
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,210
you visited somewhere once.

543
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,170
For example, "have been to Beijing."

544
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,810
It also means

545
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,020
at a certain point in time,

546
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,260
you keep doing something.

547
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,620
For example,
"have been studying English."

548
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,210
That is the present perfect tense.

549
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,290
For the past perfect,

550
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,500
it's "have done."

551
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,660
Wait, my brain can't take this anymore.

552
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,620
English has too many tenses.

553
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,860
I can't tell which is which.

554
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,170
They all

555
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,900
look the same.

556
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,570
How can I tell?

557
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:28,780
How about this?

558
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,660
If you have a hard time remember,

559
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,410
I'm sure you remember
the move sets in Swan Lake.

560
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:38,660
Get up.

561
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,020
This is the romance part in Act Two.

562
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,210
It's the simple lifting.

563
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,260
I'm sure you know the move.

564
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,740
This is past perfect.

565
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,660
You completed a movement

566
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,980
at a certain point in time.

567
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:14,810
Come on.

568
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,140
Onto the next move.

569
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,500
Xiaochun, this lifting

570
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,050
is connected to the next move.

571
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,860
If I didn't do well,

572
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,450
you couldn't have done well
with the backward lean.

573
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,570
That is present perfect.

574
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,260
The move just now

575
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,690
was a move in the past.

576
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,860
It still affects the present.

577
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,740
Do you understand it now?

578
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,380
I get it now.

579
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,380
When I can't
tell these two tenses apart,

580
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,170
I simply think about these moves.

581
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,020
It's much easier this way.

582
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,570
You're a great teacher.

583
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,980
You're too dense.

584
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,210
Genius.

585
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,780
Do me a favor.

586
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:05,410
Please.

587
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,170
Help me out.

588
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,780
Help me with English.

589
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,980
If I fail the retake,

590
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,900
I can't even be in the final.

591
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,450
Please! I beg of you!

592
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,810
I'll help you.

593
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,020
Thank you.
