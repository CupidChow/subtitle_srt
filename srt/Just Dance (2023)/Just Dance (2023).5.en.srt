21
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,110
Okay, Pan Pan did a great job today.

22
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,380
Keep up the good work.

23
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:40,600
Okay.

24
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,370
Next group.

25
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,090
Good luck, Xiaochun.

26
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,170
Okay.

27
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:51,960
Get ready.

28
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,090
Take a bow.

29
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,610
Alright.

30
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,810
Great teamwork.

31
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,170
Keep it up.

32
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,330
Return to your seats.

33
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,680
We're almost done with
the two big groups,

34
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,560
but it's not time to relax.

35
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,250
We have a new task next week,

36
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,090
so get your head in the game!

37
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,890
That's all for today.
Class is dismissed.

38
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,560
All rise.

39
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,890
Goodbye, Mr. Lin.

40
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,330
Isn't it normal to dance well
as a group?

41
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,610
What's the big deal?

42
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:53,840
Xiao Bu,

43
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,920
Ms. Yu asked you to see
the materials for the Demon King.

44
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,840
Do you want to try it out?

45
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,120
Why me?

46
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,840
I won't try it.

47
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,040
Why not?

48
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,970
I'm not that good.

49
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,760
The role is too big.

50
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,610
There's too many moves. I can't do it.

51
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,370
Nonsense.

52
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,040
You know all the moves
in street dance by heart,

53
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,280
how can you not dance
as the Demon King well?

54
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,400
Besides,

55
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,890
weren't you playing the Demon King
in that street dance performance

56
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,730
you did with Xiaochun the other day?

57
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,730
I never knew you approved of me so much.

58
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,170
However,

59
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,450
are you using me to piss Ling Chen off

60
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,400
because you're having
conflicts with him?

61
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:39,840
Nonsense.

62
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,730
I don't want to see a piece of gold

63
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,560
lose its chance to shine.

64
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,400
So I'm a piece of gold to you.

65
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,930
Are you doing it or not?

66
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,400
Stop beating around the bush.

67
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,050
I was about to say yes.

68
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,800
But with this attitude of yours,

69
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,080
forget it.

70
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,080
Just do it. There's nothing to lose.

71
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,120
Besides, this is the second
best role after the Prince.

72
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,490
What about this?

73
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,280
I'll play the role of the Demon King.

74
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,680
Since I granted your request,

75
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
you owe me a wish.

76
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,730
You'll have to fulfill it
when I've figured it out.

77
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,730
Okay?

78
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,400
What?

79
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:26,730
Come here.

80
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,010
Sealed with a pinky promise.

81
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,400
No changes in a hundred years.

82
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,330
Bye.

83
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,400
Are you trying to get out of it?

84
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,730
What a nutcase.

85
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,840
Xiao Bu!

86
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,280
The dean wants to see you in his office.

87
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,520
Right now?

88
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,120
Yes.

89
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,240
It looks serious.

90
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,960
He also called Mr. Lin and Xiaochun too.

91
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,890
Got it.

92
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,240
Come in.

93
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,050
Sir, Mr. Lin.

94
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,730
You two performed
outside school commercially?

95
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,960
You've misunderstood, sir.

96
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,010
This is not a commercial performance.

97
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,520
It's just a dance off
between dance enthusiasts.

98
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,650
We all know each other.
We're all friends.

99
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,610
It's just a out-of-school event.

100
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,080
But it was a ticketed event.

101
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,010
Didn't you know?

102
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,360
I didn't know there were tickets.

103
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,360
My friends invited me to the event.

104
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,210
We did not receive any payment.

105
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,840
Alright.

106
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,120
I'm not biased towards my students

107
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,520
but I think there's some
misunderstanding here.

108
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,330
They must have been taken advantage of.

109
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,360
Since Mr. Lin said so,

110
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,330
I'll trust you for now.

111
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,800
The department will carry out
more investigations.

112
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,280
You'll be suspended from classes
for a week during the investigation,

113
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,080
and be responsible for
cleaning every dance studio.

114
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,010
Every dance studio?

115
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:11,800
Be quiet.

116
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,170
The department has gone easy on you.

117
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,730
Go grab the cleaning tools

118
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,330
and start cleaning from the main
rehearsal room on the ground floor.

119
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,010
Got it, Mr. Lin.

120
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,800
Got it, Mr. Lin.

121
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,050
Dean,

122
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,610
where was the video posted?

123
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,610
Do you want me to look into it?

124
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,080
I'm done with this.

125
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,400
I haven't done anything but
cleaning all this time.

126
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,770
My training schedule has
gone down the drain.

127
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,080
What about this?

128
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,330
Leave this to me and
go for your training.

129
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,730
Really?

130
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,050
That would be so kind of you.

131
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,050
Stop acting.

132
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
I'm sure you're delighted inside.

133
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,730
Fine, but in all honesty,

134
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,730
there's so many studios.

135
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,930
I really feel bad.

136
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,650
Don't worry. I have someone
to call for help.

137
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,330
Someone?

138
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,520
Who's that?

139
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,120
Pan Pan?

140
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
Hong?

141
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,090
It's a secret.

142
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,920
A secret?

143
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,480
Are you in a relationship?

144
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,920
You look like you're in love.

145
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,210
No.

146
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:54,560
Fine,

147
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,720
I'll let you go for now.

148
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,800
But in all seriousness.

149
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,480
How did the department find out
about our video?

150
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,850
It must've been reported by an insider.

151
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,970
Reported?

152
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,330
Go back right now.

153
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,770
Or else I'll report you
to the department

154
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,360
for participating in this nonsense.

155
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,480
I got it.

156
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,600
Could it be Ling Chen who reported it?

157
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,650
Go on. What's the matter?

158
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,560
It's about
the two students from my class.

159
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,600
The ones who broke the rules
for attending out-of-school events?

160
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,330
Here's the thing.

161
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,160
They both have roles in
the Repertory Class rehearsal.

162
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,720
So the class suspension

163
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,970
will affect overall progress.

164
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,360
The department has investigated

165
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,680
the situation already.

166
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,090
They indeed did not receive any payment.

167
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,160
Well...

168
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,720
How about this?

169
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,890
Classes will be on as usual.

170
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,210
They still have to clean

171
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,160
during their free time.

172
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,800
Sure.

173
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,330
As long as they attend class.

174
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,160
Also, dean,

175
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,600
I watched the video

176
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,480
and felt that
street dance is interesting.

177
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,210
Do you think we can combine

178
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,330
street dance and ballet together?

179
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,560
It may bring an unexpected result.

180
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,120
Mr. Lin,

181
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,360
I understand that innovation is fun,

182
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,410
but there are risks too.

183
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,090
I am not against you being creative,

184
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,920
but you have to keep your limits.

185
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,090
We have less work to do
with this robot vacuum cleaner,

186
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,330
yet we're still afraid
of being punished.

187
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,330
Exactly.

188
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,890
Through the rigorous logic
of Hong Holmes,

189
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,160
this insider knew that Little Peacock

190
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,160
and Xiao Bu went together.

191
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,090
They must be someone we know.

192
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,530
I seriously think it's Yu Manman.

193
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,090
No.

194
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,160
No way.

195
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,600
For Yu Manman,

196
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,530
all she knows is dancing.

197
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,090
How could she know this?

198
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,480
It definitely wouldn't be her.

199
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,970
That's right.

200
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,800
You're right.

201
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,770
Then who is it?

202
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,720
Alright, stop guessing.

203
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,600
I'd say the prime suspect is Ling Chen.

204
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,890
Who else would it be?

205
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,530
Xiaochun, Xiaobu,

206
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,890
- Mr. Lin wants to see you in the office.
- Okay.

207
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,720
Let's go together, Pan Pan.

208
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:09,970
Let's go, Pan Pan.

209
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,650
Come on.

210
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,920
Who's going to clean the floor?

211
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,650
Don't worry, we have this robot.

212
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,160
See?

213
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,090
How annoying.

214
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,240
Come in.

215
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,090
Mr. Lin.

216
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
Mr. Lin.

217
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,010
Mr. Lin.

218
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,010
Here's the thing.

219
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,450
I've discussed with the department.

220
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:39,650
Shi Xiaochun,

221
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,720
Xiao Bu and you will
resume classes tomorrow.

222
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,920
This is the last time.

223
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,210
That's great!

224
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,560
I'm not done yet.

225
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,290
Cleaning will continue as usual

226
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,330
during your free time after class.

227
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,290
No lazing around.

228
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:50,680
Okay.

229
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,330
Xiaochun.

230
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,720
By the way, Mr. Lin,

231
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,920
Pan Pan wants to see you.

232
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,290
Mr. Lin, I...

233
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,480
It's nothing.

234
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,410
What's wrong?
Why are you backing out here?

235
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,040
Mr. Lin, Pan Pan wants to try
for the role of the Prince.

236
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,970
That's right, Mr. Lin.

237
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,330
Although Pan Pan is usually quiet,

238
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,330
he is full of potential.

239
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,450
He knows the moves of
the Prince by heart.

240
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,480
Pan Pan,

241
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,360
do you want to compete for the role of
the Prince with Ling Chen?

242
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,680
No, Mr. Lin.

243
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,650
Well,

244
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,720
you encouraged everyone to try out

245
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,480
their favorite roles.

246
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,160
I want to give it a try too.

247
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,680
Why are you not confident?

248
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,240
You dance very well.

249
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,680
That's right, Pan Pan.

250
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,770
Your foundations are good,

251
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,530
and you feel deeply.
I do see your potential.

252
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,330
Besides,

253
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,160
even Xiaochun dared to
apply for the White Swan.

254
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,450
What are you afraid of?

255
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,970
You're good at praises, Mr. Lin.

256
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,210
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

257
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,210
I...

258
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,330
I thought you never noticed me.

259
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,040
I would be a class teacher for nothing.

260
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,970
You all are the same to me.

261
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,330
Ms. Yu will be there tomorrow too.

262
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,770
I'll give you a chance to perform.

263
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,650
Do your best.

264
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,120
Look confident

265
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,530
when you're dancing.

266
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:11,890
Okay!

267
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,040
Okay, off you go.

268
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,560
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

269
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,410
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

270
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,720
You got this!

271
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,160
Pan Pan,

272
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,480
I'll practice the Prince role with you.

273
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,650
Give it your all.

274
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,890
Thank you, Xiaochun.

275
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,850
You're welcome.

276
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,530
Alright, you two go ahead with practice.

277
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,680
My princess is still waiting for me.

278
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,680
How's practice for the Demon King?

279
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,920
Don't mention it.

280
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,770
He's been tortured
to death by the Princess.

281
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,720
I'm leaving. Bye.

282
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,920
Bye.

283
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,920
Where do you want to eat later?

284
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:40,970
The cafeteria.

285
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,360
The cafeteria again?

286
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,450
Shi Xiaochun.

287
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,120
What's the matter?

288
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:48,770
Hi, my idol.

289
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,720
Why aren't you in the practice room?

290
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Didn't you beg me

291
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,090
to help you practice foundations?

292
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,850
I'm not free. I'm practicing
the Prince role with Pan Pan.

293
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,560
It's actually not urgent.

294
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,090
No. We must practice now.

295
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,920
Dance partners must develop
rapport and trust with each other.

296
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,210
Let's go.

297
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,920
Slow down, Xiaochun.

298
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,330
Sorry, my idol. Xiaochun...

299
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,890
What's wrong?

300
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,600
How is this holding my face?

301
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,720
You're trying to kill me.

302
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
Isn't this how the Demon King dances?

303
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,090
The Demon King is not a pure bad guy.

304
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,410
His feelings for White Swan are complex.

305
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,800
He is possessive and desirous of
purity at the same time,

306
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,330
so he can't help but compel her.

307
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,360
Don't you wonder

308
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,890
who would want to
compel such a fierce swan?

309
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,240
If I were the Demon King,
I'd run away now.

310
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,920
I won't be waiting to be killed by you.

311
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,530
That's because your my dance partner.

312
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,480
I haven't met someone like you.

313
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,090
During the battle,

314
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,090
you looked fearless.

315
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,160
When it comes down to business,
you're like this.

316
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,650
How incompetent.

317
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,290
Who are you calling incompetent?

318
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,720
What's wrong with liking to improvise?

319
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,120
I can't dance the way you want me to.

320
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,720
You've never been in
a relationship before, right?

321
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,040
What kind of joke is that?

322
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,330
I've met all kinds of women.

323
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,360
I'm telling you,

324
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,240
my ex-girlfriends

325
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,970
[Fouetté: A single-legged turn]
have danced more Fouetté than you.

326
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,410
[with one leg raised in rapid circles in the air]
Only you can pull off a flirtatious routine like that.

327
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,120
You've been in a relationship?

328
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,240
I don't believe you.

329
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,560
What's wrong with that?

330
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,410
How dare you talk about me.

331
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,680
Are you very experienced?

332
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,210
My apologies,

333
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,360
I don't have experience
in pursuing others,

334
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,090
but I am full of experience
in being pursued by others.

335
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,650
You didn't clean properly.

336
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,360
Now that you mention it,
I actually remembered.

337
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,480
Didn't you owe me a wish before?

338
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,210
I hadn't figured out what
I wanted you to do,

339
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,800
but I do now.

340
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:25,600
You...

341
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,720
will have to clean

342
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,890
all of the mirrors, windows,

343
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,010
glass, and floor

344
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,890
of the practice room.

345
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,530
Of course, you can choose not to.

346
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,970
We are very democratic.

347
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,800
If you don't clean, I won't dance.

348
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,120
Not only am I not going to dance,

349
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,890
I will let Ling Chen know

350
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,120
how you begged me to be the Demon King

351
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,680
just to piss him off.

352
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,560
Shut it.

353
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,120
What's wrong? Come on.

354
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,010
Hurry.

355
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,090
Didn't you say this was dirty?

356
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,120
Clean it.

357
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,240
Not bad, Manman.

358
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,120
You're becoming more like
the Swan Princess.

359
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,360
You did a great job.

360
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,570
But today,

361
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,320
I want to show everyone another
Prince and Princess team.

362
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,480
Shi Xiaochun and Pan Pan
prepared the same routine.

363
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,360
Since Ms. Yu is here too,

364
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,010
let's hear from Ms. Yu too.

365
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,120
Sure.

366
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,720
Well, it's not a bad thing to try.

367
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,320
Come on.

368
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:10,840
Okay.

369
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:11,890
Go on.

370
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,770
Go on.

371
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:15,890
Go on.

372
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:17,570
Pan Pan.

373
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,600
It'll be fine.

374
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,810
Let's go. Don't worry.

375
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:21,650
You got this.

376
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,720
Pan Pan.

377
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:27,960
Over here.

378
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,170
Okay, ready.

379
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,960
Action.

380
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,480
Why isn't he moving?

381
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,240
Move!

382
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,050
Pan Pan.

383
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
What's wrong?

384
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,690
Go on, Pan Pan.

385
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,240
What's wrong with Pan Pan?

386
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:39,930
Go on, continue.

387
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,060
He dances for fun.

388
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,290
Look at him. What is that?

389
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,600
Just change your career.

390
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,200
Pan Pan.

391
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,890
Shi Xiaochun.

392
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:01,960
Come back.

393
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,530
Let him calm down alone.

394
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,600
We did well during the
rehearsals, Mr. Lin.

395
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,770
Pan Pan may be too nervous today.

396
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,930
I know.

397
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,570
Don't worry, he's just out of it.

398
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:15,810
He even forgot the moves.

399
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,080
Don't worry.

400
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,570
The point of pas de deux is
for two people to work together.

401
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,720
If the partner has a problem,
they should be guided,

402
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,960
not ignored.

403
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,240
Shi Xiaochun,

404
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,720
don't you think you should
reflect on yourself?

405
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,650
Also Mr. Lin,

406
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,320
A classic is a classic.

407
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,690
It takes thousands of hours of practice

408
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,810
to understand the piece.

409
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,890
It is good to encourage students,

410
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,080
but if they get unrealistic ideas

411
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,770
about their own strengths,

412
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,810
shouldn't we, as teachers

413
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,960
ensure they get a grip in time?

414
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,660
[Department of Ballet]

415
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,480
I'm sorry for what happened at class.

416
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,810
You've suffered because of me.

417
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,360
Don't worry, Pan Pan.

418
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,570
How's practice going for you two?

419
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,290
You did fine offstage,

420
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,010
but it's a different story onstage.

421
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,240
I'm having a hard time
practicing the Demon King.

422
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:34,890
Let's take a rest.

423
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:36,690
Come on.

424
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,650
Let's take a break.

425
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,480
No, we still have to clean.

426
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,200
What happen to you two?

427
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,200
Practice didn't go well.

428
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,080
Don't worry.

429
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,360
It's all because of Ling Chen

430
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,720
that we have to clean every day.

431
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,120
There's no time to practice at all.

432
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,530
Maybe it wasn't Ling Chin
who reported it?

433
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,290
I don't think he's that type of person.

434
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,360
Alright, Pan Pan.

435
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,360
Stop speaking up for your idol.

436
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,810
Who else could it be?

437
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,290
Stupid swan.

438
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:23,930
I'm so mad!

439
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,010
Who's talking about me?

440
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:32,690
Excuse me.

441
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,690
Hi there.

442
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,930
May I know how to get to
the Department of Ballet?

443
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
Go straight ahead

444
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,600
and turn left.

445
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,290
Why are you heading there?

446
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,120
I'm looking for Pan Pan.

447
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,080
I'm his mother.

448
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,440
I'm his classmate.

449
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,930
I'll bring you there.

450
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,120
What a coincidence!

451
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,240
Thank you for your help.

452
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,050
No worries.

453
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:51,840
Let me help you.

454
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,290
I got it.

455
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:52,840
It's fine.

456
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,570
Thank you.

457
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,240
Let's go.

458
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,010
Okay.

459
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,010
What's your name?

460
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,010
Ling Chen.

461
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,360
Ling Chen?

462
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,440
I've finally met you in person.

463
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,440
Pan Pan always

464
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,650
talks about you.

465
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,840
He says you're his idol.

466
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,050
Not at all.

467
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,440
We've seen many dance videos
of yours before.

468
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,650
I was thinking why you look familiar.

469
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,960
We're almost there.

470
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,050
Let's go.

471
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:16,770
Sure.

472
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,200
Pan Pan.

473
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,170
Mom, why are you here?

474
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,810
I'm here to see you.

475
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,930
You should've called me.
I'd pick you up.

476
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,960
You kid.

477
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,170
You didn't pick up the phone.

478
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,810
It's all thanks to Ling Chin
for bringing me here.

479
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,570
Hello, aunty.

480
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,120
Hello.

481
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,690
Pan Pan,

482
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,530
your mom bought you these.

483
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,240
Thank you.

484
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,840
If there's nothing else,
I'll take my leave.

485
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,240
Pan Pan,

486
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,770
since your friends are here today

487
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,010
I'll treat you all to dinner
at our restaurant.

488
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,570
You run a restaurant?

489
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,360
Yes, we moved to Haicheng

490
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,570
to be closer to our son.

491
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,410
Our new restaurant is

492
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,200
down the street from Haicheng Dance.

493
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,770
We're not officially open yet.

494
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,690
Is it the one next to Jiajia Hotel?

495
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,360
Yes, how did you know?

496
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,530
I live there.

497
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,570
I know the place well.

498
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:04,720
That's great!

499
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,360
Let's all go together.

500
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,530
Sure.

501
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:08,960
Our Pan Pan

502
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,240
owes the help of everyone
here at Haicheng Dance.

503
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,890
Aren't you all practicing for
the Freshmen Performance?

504
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,050
I heard Pan Pan said
he got the lead role.

505
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,530
I'm beyond happy.

506
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,170
Mom,

507
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,320
it's not confirmed yet.

508
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,720
Why not?

509
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,240
If my son wants it,

510
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,890
he'll do well!

511
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,440
Let's all go have a meal.

512
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,360
Sure.

513
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,050
Aunty,

514
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,690
I have practice soon so I won't go.

515
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,930
How can that be?

516
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,840
Pan Pan said if it weren't for you,

517
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,050
he would not make it to Haicheng Dance.

518
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,480
You deserve

519
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,240
this meal the most.

520
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,080
His mom and I

521
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,570
had been working for others
for over ten years.

522
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,320
We made dishes after dishes

523
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,720
to send him to Haicheng Dance.

524
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,050
His mom wanted to be closer to him.

525
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,320
So the we both

526
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,440
made the decision to come out on our own

527
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:01,530
to be with our son.

528
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,530
I've heard that the teachers
think highly of him,

529
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,480
and gave him an important role to play.

530
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,650
All these years of hard work

531
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:13,810
are worth it.

532
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,200
Dad.

533
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:17,890
Help yourselves.

534
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,570
Have more, Ling Chen.

535
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,480
Thank you, aunty.

536
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:20,960
Go on.

537
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,320
Mom, go ahead and eat.
Don't worry about us.

538
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:24,690
Take care of him.

539
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,720
Here you go.

540
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,410
Here.

541
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,890
Have more.

542
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,890
My apologies, Ling Chen.

543
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,600
My mom is too excited.

544
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,120
Sorry for troubling you today.

545
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,690
You don't usually like these, do you?

546
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,170
No, I like them.

547
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:40,720
Okay.

548
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,080
Here's a toast to uncle and aunty.

549
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,530
Eat well.

550
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,570
Okay.

551
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,410
What's wrong, Pan Pan?

552
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,200
It's nothing.

553
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,360
It's just that my parents

554
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,840
don't know it's a casting call

555
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,930
and got the wrong idea that
I was going to be the main lead.

556
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:03,530
Pan Pan has worked hard.

557
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,120
I don't dare to tell them

558
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,050
that I still blank out on stage.

559
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,440
Practice can be quite tough.

560
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,720
When you blank out,

561
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,720
what comes to mind?

562
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,080
Faces.

563
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,010
Whose face?

564
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,320
We also welcome...

565
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,240
Faces of teachers and students.

566
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,290
- Don't be shy.
- I'm afraid.

567
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,240
No worries, aunty.

568
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,050
Pan Pan,

569
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,570
what are you afraid of?

570
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,050
I'm afraid they think
I'm not good enough.

571
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,360
I'm afraid I'll mess up.

572
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,290
I'm afraid I won't perform perfectly.

573
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,170
Pan Pan.

574
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,770
You are

575
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,960
afraid of being on the centre stage,

576
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,360
afraid of being the centre of attention.

577
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,290
Don't be shy.

578
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,080
In plain words,

579
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,320
you care too much about
what others think,

580
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,890
and it's holding you back.

581
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,290
The more critical the moment is,
the more nervous you are,

582
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,120
right?

583
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,010
That's where the problem is.

584
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,480
Uncle and aunty,

585
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,960
you've gone through such a hard time.

586
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,200
I must make a toast to you again.

587
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,570
Just a little will do.

588
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,010
Alright.

589
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,200
- Mom, dad, you've worked hard.
- Here.

590
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,960
Drink up.

591

[HX9 Dazzling Colors Ti Stars Awakening]

592
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:17,440
How's the food?

593
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,120
I made a big deal

594
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,410
in front of your parents tonight.

595
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,690
I'm counting on you to take
the lead role at the Freshman Final.

596
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:23,600
Good luck.

597
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,770
Even if you can't beat Ling Chen,

598
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,290
you must get an important role too.

599
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,890
Got it.

600
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,170
I believe in you. Let's go.

601
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,200
Shi Xiaochun.

602
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,050
What's the matter?

603
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:42,360
Why are you mad at me?

604
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,690
I'm not.

605
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,080
Then why are you ignoring me?

606
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,050
It's none of your business.

607
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,650
I just don't want to talk to you.

608
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,770
I should be the one that's mad.

609
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,480
You're the one who
spoke so harshly that day.

610
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,290
You said...

611
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,240
What did I say?

612
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,840
You said Xiao Bu is better than me.

613
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,720
How petty.

614
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,890
So you reported us because I said

615
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,810
Xiao Bu was better than you?

616
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,440
I did not!

617
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,200
You swear?

618
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,960
I swear.

619
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,530
I would not report you.

620
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,410
How could I bear
letting you get punished?

621

Also,

622
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,600
is Xiao Bu really better than me?

623
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,050
- Help me, Hong.
- Little Peacock.

624
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:37,440
- Little Peacock.
- Ling Chen.

625
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,650
Are you alright?

626
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
I drank too much.

627

No, you didn't.

- Then I...
- Yes.

629

Why are you acting?

630
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,450
I didn't drink much.
