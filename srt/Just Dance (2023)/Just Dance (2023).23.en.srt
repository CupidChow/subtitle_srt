00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,350
I'll buy you some more snacks.

171
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,200
Spicy sticks, instant noodles,
and chili paste.

172
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,880
Stop.

173
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,110
I haven't received
my enrollment letter yet.

174
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,440
Just sit here.

175
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,350
I'll pack by myself.

176
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,030
Can you do it yourself?

177
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,280
Well, look at this.

178
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:18,960
What is this?

179
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,790
Open it and you'll see.

180
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,550
Is this little Ling Chen?

181
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,320
So cute.

182
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,320
You were so good at modern dance
when you were a kid.

183
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,910
That's not modern dance.

184
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,320
That's a Grand Pirouette
from classical ballet.

185
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,350
To me,

186
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,400
it's very similar to
the spiral roll from modern dance.

187
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,590
I got it.

188
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,320
Modern dance and classical ballet,

189
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,280
there are similarities between them.

190
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,520
The way we use our force is different.

191
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,790
Force?

192
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,880
You were so cute when you were a kid.

193
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,760
Xiaochun.

194
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,320
You truly are my lucky charm.

195
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,280
What are you talking about?

196
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,640
Stop looking at my photos.

197
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,790
Let's go to the rehearsal hall.

198
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,960
Fast.

199
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,550
Mr. Lin.

200
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,590
I suppose you're busy packing right now?

201
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,470
Why did you call us here?

202
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,640
Yeah, so mysterious.

203
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,320
You didn't tell me even when I asked.

204
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,440
I've finally figured

205
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,200
how to dance the last eight beats.

206
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,590
I'd like you to check it out.

207
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,470
Sure thing.

208
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,670
Start dancing.

209
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,440
Great!

210
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,400
You've transitioned the Grand Pirouette
from classical ballet

211
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,910
to the spiral roll from modern dance.

212
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,760
This is very clever.

213
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,640
Yeah, why didn't we think of that?

214
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,790
Thank Xiaochun for this idea.

215
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,030
She's the one who looked
at my childhood photos

216
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,080
and said something to me.

217
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,880
She made me realize classical ballet

218
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,840
is quite similar to modern dance.

219
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,400
I'm the classical ballet dancer.

220
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,710
I'm also the modern dancer.

221
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,760
I shouldn't discard any of them.

222
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,670
I should blend the two together.

223
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,030
In this way, modern dance
and choreographies in the future

224
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,230
won't be a disadvantage to me.

225
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,550
Well said.

226
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,790
Let's have a drink.

227
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,230
Let's have some too, Ling Chen.

228
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,110
I told you.

229
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:20,840
There will be the day,

230
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,000
where I'll be reunited with you
on the highest stage.

231
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,200
We will make it.

232
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,550
We must do our best in our finals.

233
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,230
No regrets.

234
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,110
Cheers.

235
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,400
Sure.

236
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,440
For the final.

237
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,110
- Do the best!
- Do the best!

238
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,960
- Do the best for the finals!
- Do the best!

239
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,400
Count me in.

240
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,320
Ms. Yu.

241
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,150
Ms. Yu.

242
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,110
Have your seat.

243
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,320
- Please sit.
- Come on.

244
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,710
Mom, I can't believe you're here.

245
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,550
I thought you wanted
to give us a farewell?

246
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,910
How could I not come?

247
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,230
I can't believe you took the kids
to eat only these.

248
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,790
What kind of teacher are you?

249
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,080
It's really my fault.

250
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,880
If I knew Ms. Yu is coming,

251
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,110
I'd find a place that suits Ms. Yu.

252
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,550
Next time, you should
let us know earlier.

253
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,230
I'll bring you to the most
expensive place.

254
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:01,790
Okay.

255
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,400
I'd like to raise a toast to you,
Shi Xiaochun.

256
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,670
Good luck with the finals.

257
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,350
Thank you, Ms. Yu.

258
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,520
If you're here,

259
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,000
I promise to not let you down.

260
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,200
Oh, Xiaochun.

261
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,230
There's something I want to ask you.

262
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,230
When you rehearsed today,

263
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,150
why did you end your dance that way?

264
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,880
Actually, I didn't expect it either.

265
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,640
I realized that Ling Chen
truly found himself.

266
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,110
I could feel his joy and delight.

267
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,400
I am happy for him too.

268
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,550
Although I'd be sad when I know
he's about to leave,

269
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,710
but there's more anticipation
and longing for the future.

270
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,840
Thus, I can let go as well.

271
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,320
I will pursue the things I want to do.

272
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,320
Ling Chen, have you told everyone

273
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,000
you received your acceptance letter?

274
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,880
I just got it.

275
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,080
The enrollment is the day
after the finals.

276
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,550
After the finals,

277
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
I need to leave immediately.

278
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,790
This is too soon.
I'm not even ready for this.

279
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,230
I can't bear to part with you.

280
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,710
How can it be so fast?
I really can't bear to part with you.

281
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,110
Shi Xiaochun, you impressed me.

282
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,590
You were so confident just a moment ago.

283
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,960
Look at you now.

284
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,200
I didn't realize it was so sudden.

285
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,000
That's too soon.

286
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,910
Raise our glasses.

287
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,280
Let's congratulate Ling Chen.

288
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,150
Cheers!

289
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,280
Good luck for tomorrow.

290
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,520
Eat up.

291
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,840
(The finals are getting closer.)

292
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,280
(Our training is getting more intense.)

293
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,640
(I'm still struggling
with a few technical moves.)

294
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,350
(I have to try harder.)

295
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,760
One more time.

296
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,280
Stop.

297
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,790
I'd like to try again.

298
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,030
That's it for today.

299
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,710
Xiaochun,

300
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,640
when did you start becoming like this?

301
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,590
This morning, during early practice.

302
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,400
I was spinning and suddenly fell out.

303
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,110
It felt like I couldn't find my balance.

304
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,710
It's been like that all day.

305
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,710
Xiaochun,

306
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,760
are you not resting well or sick?

307
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,960
It's not that simple.

308
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,400
That's enough for today.

309
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,760
Let's go to the office.

310
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Yeah, come on.

311
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,790
Off track?

312
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,320
When a dancer progress
to a certain level,

313
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,110
this situation would happen.

314
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,590
No matter how you spin,
you'd end up falling.

315
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,590
You'd suddenly forget how to dance.

316
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,910
How is that possible?

317
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,110
The competition is around the corner.

318
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,760
I think you're experiencing
psychological pressure.

319
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,550
For now, put the competition aside.

320
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,000
Improve your basics first.

321
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,230
How is this gonna work?

322
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,320
I really don't have much time left
until the competition.

323
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,200
Besides, I'm not really stressed out.

324
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,230
I'm pretty good at calming myself.

325
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,760
I'm really fine.

326
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,080
Don't worry. You have to trust me.

327
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,790
Improve your basics in the meantime.

328
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,880
Take your time to get the feel of it.

329
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,110
Is it that bad?

330
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,200
I don't believe it.

331
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,910
I will work on it
for the next couple of days.

332
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,150
Just wait and see.

333
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,760
Shi Xiaochun is an overachiever.

334
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,760
The bigger the competition,
the better she'll do.

335
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,550
But what's going on this time?

336
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,080

Little Peacock, open the door.

504
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,760
You can't do this without me.

505
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,040
I'd say I'm a lot worse than you.

506
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,400
I got screwed for selling songs.

507
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,070
The girl I like doesn't like me either.

508
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,520
Didn't Pushkin say that?

509
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,430
If life deceives you,

510
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,160
don't be sad. Don't be...

511
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,280
What are you talking about?

512
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,000
Can you talk about something serious?

513
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,350
Xiao Bu, what did you just say?

514
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,590
I said if life deceives you...

515
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,760
Not this. Before this sentence.

516
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,430
I got screwed for selling songs.

517
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,590
The girl I like doesn't like me either.

518
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,110
Got screwed?

519
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,640
Xiaochun!

520
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,230
I figured out a way to get her out.

521
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,430
But I need your help.

522
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,860
[Seven days to the finals]

523
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,520
Counting down...

524
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,400
[Seven days to the finals]

525
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,350
Seven days...

526
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,560
Little Peacock!

527
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,280
Something bad happened!

528
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,070
Nothing is a big deal to me.

529
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,160
Don't try to trick me into going out.

530
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,880
I've got some training to do.

531
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,000
Xiao Bu is sick.

532
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,760
Sick?

533
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,680
He wanted to earn money
by selling his songs.

534
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,230
He ended up getting scammed.

535
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,760
He is lying in bed
without a bite of food.

536
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,280
He's afraid he'll hold you up.

537
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,880
He wouldn't let me tell you about this.

538
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,590
But I couldn't control my mouth.

539
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,760
It's nothing.

540
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,800
Just keep practicing.

541
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,430
Where is he?

542
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,190
I'll go see him.

543
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,800
She's on her way.

544
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,350
You guys keep an eye on the clock.

545
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,110
Little Peacock, wait for me!

546
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,560
Hong, why is the shuttle bus
going to the outskirts?

547
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,800
Where did Xiao Bu go?

548
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,070
My precious.

549
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,590
Xiao Bu, Ling Chen
and the rest have all arrived.

550
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,310
They're waiting for us. Don't worry.

551
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,040
We've arrived.

552
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,070
Hong.

553
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,350
What is this place?

554
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,590
Wait a little longer.

555
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,230
What about Xiao Bu and the others?

556
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,470
Don't be so impatient.
Just wait a little longer.

557
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,760
I don't even know what this place is.

558
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,880
I've never been here before.

559
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,470
Look across the street.

560
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,520
Go.

561
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,520
Okay.

562
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,760
I got it. How dare you to deceive me?

563
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,230
Do you have any idea
how worried I've been?

564
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,400
After the rehearsal,

565
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,070
you've been in a bad state.

566
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,710
We're all worried
that you might go crazy.

567
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,230
That's why we came up with this.

568
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,400
So that you can relax.

569
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,000
This is a crucial moment.

570
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,430
I need to get back to rehearsal.

571
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,880
You're not going anywhere.

572
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,110
Why?

573
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,830
There are only two buses here.

574
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,160
One in the morning and one in the evening.

575
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,430
If you want to go home,
you'll have to wait until evening.

576
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,880
I knew you'd think of something like this.

577
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,230
That's why we chose this place.

578
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,830
Where are the rest?

579
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,590
They're waiting for you in the park.

580
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,070
Let's go in.

581
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,830
Everybody

582
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,310
is trying to use their own way

583
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,430
to cheer you up.

584
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,830
I guess there's nothing else
I can do about it.

585
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,470
Let's go.

586
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:45,830
Xiaochun.

587
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,470
Just follow this path.

588
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,070
Pan Pan will be the first one
to wait for you.

589
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,000
I'll take this path
and wait for you at the end.

590
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,430
No buts.

591
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,000
Good luck.

592
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:56,830
Let's start.

593
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:57,950
I'm going then.
