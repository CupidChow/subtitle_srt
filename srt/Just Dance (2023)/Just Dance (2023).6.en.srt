22
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,930
Oh my goodness...

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,390
Damn it,
what kind of role suits Pan Pan?

24
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,070
So there's a moment of glory
for poor students, too.

25
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,070
You've sobered up, huh?

26
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,300
How did I get back yesterday?

27
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,620
Have you forgotten that Xiao Bu
and the others carried you back?

28
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,070
I guess I'm not much of a drinker.

29
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,790
Do you remember what you said

30
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,580
last night?

31
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,260
What did I say?

32
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,710
Nothing at all.

33
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,990
Glad that you can't remember anything.

34
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,230
You came just in time.

35
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,430
I thought Pan Pan couldn't dance
as the Prince anymore.

36
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,820
I'm trying to find him a different role.

37
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,310
No wonder you're so confused.

38
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,020
So you're helping Pan Pan find a role.

39
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,430
Let me show you something.

40
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,660
I've been thinking about this
for a while too.

41
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,790
I finally found a role that suits him.

42
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:45,740
What is this?

43
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,310
The Joker.

44
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,990
This is a supporting role in Swan Lake.

45
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,350
The male dancers are required
to wear clown makeup.

46
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,260
This character is also very skillful.

47
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,260
He has mysterious identity and origin.

48
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,460
Every version is different
depending on the plots.

49
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,820
There's an interesting saying about it.

50
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,590
The clown's level of skill

51
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,460
represents the level
of the whole choreography.

52
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,870
I got it.

53
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,150
Do you mean to let Pan Pan
dance as the Joker

54
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,710
so that he can use a mask?

55
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,820
In that case,

56
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,740
The audience won't know
who's actually behind the mask.

57
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,540
Pan Pan will be more relaxed then.

58
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,350
That's right.

59
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,820
If Pan Pan dances as the Joker,

60
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,870
He can dance in front of the crowd
while wearing a mask.

61
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,070
This only solves the problem for now.

62
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,870
Because...

63
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,710
Dancing in front of the crowd matters.

64
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,310
You're really clever!

65
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,430
But I think

66
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,380
before he dances in front of Mr. Lin
and our classmates,

67
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,380
he has to try to dance
in front of the audience first.

68
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,020
You have a point.

69
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,900
We shouldn't make hasty suggestions.

70
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,990
I have an idea!

71
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,540
Isn't their diner opening soon?

72
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,870
Since it's opening,

73
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,790
we'd have an event to make it lively.

74
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,620
Don't be lazy.

75

the commercial performance, didn't you?

86
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,630
I don't understand.

87

Stop pretending. I have proof.

88

Getting panic is the first thing
that happens when you lie.

it was me who reported it?

103
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,780
You reported me and Shi Xiaochun.

104

You're the one who got punished for me.

105

Why does this flyer guy so familiar?

So it's you.

What are you doing here?

174
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,060
Pan Pan and the others
told me you're here.

175
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,340
I just came to check. Are there more?

176

That's it.

Yeah.

Have you ever been afraid?

Pan Pan told me that

217
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,100
he's afraid of making a mistake
when he's on stage.

218
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,950
He is afraid of being replaced.

219
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,950

I've got one too.

00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,070
I can't believe you had it.

223
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,870
How did you get over it?

224
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,100
I didn't get over it.

225
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,340
Actually, every time I compete on stage,

226
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,580
I'd get nervous.

227
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,630
I'd be scared too.

228
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,540
I fear of making the wrong move.

229
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,140
But I've never resisted this feeling.

230
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,830
I call this feeling

231
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,630
a reverence for the stage.

232
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,310
The only solution is to keep practicing.

233
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,310
Keep getting better.

234
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,660
So what do we fear?

235
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,310
It's actually fear itself.

236
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,390
It has nothing to do
with wearing a mask.

237
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,630
We have to deal with ourselves.

Now that you've entered
Haicheng Dance Academy,

293
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,430
you have to consider yourself
as a professional dancer.

294
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,950
You should fully focus
on whatever you do.

295
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,900
Sometimes ballet,

296
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,270
sometimes Latin dance,

If you want to get it right,

300
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,220
you must choose only one of them.

301

00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:58,990

Take a look at Shi Xiaochun.

305
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,100
Though when she's dancing,

306
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,220
there are aspects to be improved,

307
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,870
but she's all about
getting good at ballet.

308
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,460
She's made a lot of progress.

309
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,430
You, on the other hand,
you're not making any progress.

310
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,270
Which means you're regressing.

311

It's not that the I won't allow you

312
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,220
to have your own personal hobbies.

313
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,340

when it comes to the big picture.

314

That's the smartest thing to do.

317
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,430

318
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:32,580

Here's the deal.

323
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,660

00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:46,830
Get in.

341
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,430
Here you go.

342
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,020
He's got double vision, hasn't he?

343
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,660
How did he know
I had chocolate in my bag?

344
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,630
Ling Chen is so smart.

345
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,190
He can see right through you.

346
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,950
The evils are powerful,

347
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,700
but the justice will defeat the evils.

348
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,510
Plum. 180 calories.

349
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,020
He has no humanity.

350
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,020
Hong, I've caused trouble for you.

351
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,990
Let's go practice.

352
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,510
From now on, all your meals
must be weighed.

353
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,100
You can only eat if the meals meet
the precise measurement standard.

354
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,990
You got it?

355
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,020
This is very inhuman!

356
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,660
We've been eating salads all day.

357
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,190
You are even weighing grass now.

358
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,540
I think you're going too far.

359
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,190
Are you two okay?

360
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,910
Do you want the meat?

361
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:11,670
Of course!

362
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,300
I will pass.

363
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:16,910
Take it away.

364
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,420
Prince Ling.

365
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,630
I've been troubled by a dance-related
issue for a while now.

366
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,630
Please help me out.

367
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:33,750
Go ahead.

368
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,180
This gesture...

369
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,030
Should I do it this way or that way?

370
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,670
Don't go too high.

371
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,670
Do you two realize that

372
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,910
a chicken nugget costs 258 calories,

373
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,870
and a rack of ribs costs 215 calories.

374
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,270
Jogging for an hour

375
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,910
only burned 500 calories.

376
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,060
Go run around the sports field
after this.

377
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,990
I can't hold it anymore!

378
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,270
I'll spit it out.

379
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,570
- What?
- Come on.

380
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,810
Hold on.

381
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,220
Go on.

382
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,510
Hong, it's too hard.

383
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,580
I didn't expect that my weight

384
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,390
would become a stumbling block
in my ballet journey.

385
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,460
You're not the only one.

386
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,180
Have you decided what character
you're running for?

387
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,060
How about the White Swan?

388
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,460
Let's have a showdown between sisters.

389
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,990
Little Peacock.

390
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,990
I don't want to join the play anymore.

391
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:44,870
What?!

392
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,460
Have you been tortured
too much by Ling Chen?

393
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,270
I really don't want to join anymore.

394
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,300
Let's go find Mr. Lin.

395
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,700
Let's discuss with Mr. Lin.

396
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,270
Shi Xiaochun!

397
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,030
Ling Chen is kind to supervise you.

398
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,180
Why show me this attitude!

399
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,180
Sir.

400
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,180
We can supervise each other.

401
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,220
We don't need him.

402
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,300
We can do it for the ballet.

403
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,390
Please believe in us.

404
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,750
That's good, Sir.

405
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,750
I'll be getting ready for my show soon.

406
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,030
I can't spare more energy for them.

407
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,670
Please ask the others to supervise them.

408
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,510
All right.

409
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,340
Shut up.

410
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,030
Mr. Lin, I have something to say.

411
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,580
Say it.

412
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,510
I want to change my major.

413
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,270
I'd like to transfer to the
Department of Dance Education.

414
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,910
The Department of Dance Education?

415
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,750
Wait.

416
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,910
Hong Jiaoyang,
what are you talking about?

417
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,580
Wait a minute.

418
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,030
Have you recently

419
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,820
been stressing about
your weight control a little too much?

420
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,550
No, I don't.

421
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,670
Both Xiaochun and I understand
the importance of physical fitness.

422
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:50,510
In fact, I've been thinking
about this for a long time.

423
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,700
Last time, you told me to be sure
of what I wanted to do.

424
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,870
And then do it without hesitation.

425
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,220
It makes me even more determined.

426
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,340
Sir, I can't give up Latin.

427
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,180
This is not a small matter.

428
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,100
Don't you regret it.

429
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,180
It won't be easy to come back.

430
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,390
Xiaochun.

431
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:13,750
I've made up my mind.

432
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,510
Sir, don't listen to her.

433
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,150
Hong Jiaoyang, what are you doing?

434
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,630
I've really thought this through.

435
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,420
Such a big decision.

436
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,030
Leaving without any reason.

437
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,750
Have you considered our
Good-for-nothing League?

438
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,790
Does our friendship mean nothing to you?

439
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,100
I...

440
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,790
Stop it. Leave me alone.

441
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,700
Xiaochun!

442
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,990
Sir, I'll go first.

443
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,790
Why isn't Shi Xiaochun here yet?

444
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,030
She's late for the dinner.

445
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,300
It's not like her.

446
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,100
Yeah.

447
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,910
Hello, where are you?

448
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,220
Come and eat.

449
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,580
I'm on a diet. You guys enjoy.

450
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,180
She hung up the phone.

451
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,630
What's going on?

452
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,870
Shi Xiaochun is a rice lover.

453
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,670
I can't believe she is not coming.

454
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,270
She probably won't come.

455
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,510
What's wrong?

456
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,670
I told Mr. Lin that I want to
change my major today.

457
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,750
Xiaochun is a little upset.

458
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,670
You're changing your major?!

459
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,510
Changing your major?

460
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,180
Which department are you going?

461
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,990
Which department?

462
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,910
The Department of Dance Education.

463
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,030
I want to be a Latin dance teacher
in the future.

464
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,340
So sudden.

465
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,750
Actually,

466
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,940
I've been working part-time
at a dance academy.

467
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,990
Being with some kids.

468
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,670
I really feel very comfortable.

469
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,420
And you know it.

470
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,630
Make progress in ballet in this way

471
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,990
is impossible.

472
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,630
Because strength is what I'm good at.

473
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,580
That's why I want to change my major.

474
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,460
As long as you're not in trouble.

475
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,700
Going after your dreams

476
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,990
is not a big deal.

477
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,390
You see, my heart
belongs to somewhere else too.

478
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,630
I'm not as brave as you.

479
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,300
You are brave to change your major.

480
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,510
Yeah, Hong.

481
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,180
I think you're brave, too.

482
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,150
I think Xiaochun will be okay soon.

483
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,870
She'll understand.

484
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:25,790
Here.

485
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,100
The Happy Fatty meal set.

486
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,630
I'm not eating.
I'm trying to lose weight.

487
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,670
Let's make an exception today.

488
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,030
Let's eat.

489
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,580
You'll feel better when you're full.

490
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,820
Well, I'll eat.

491
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,300
I knew it.

492
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,030
This burger is whole wheat.

493
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,820
This Coke is sugar-free.

494
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,270
But it's still good.

495
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,820
Thank you.

496
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:14,790
You're welcome.

497
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,550
Actually,

498
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,870
I think Hong Jiaoyang

499
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,460
must've thought for a long time

500
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,990
before she made this decision.

501
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,060
Think about it.

502
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,750
The best dancing major in Haicheng Dance

503
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,030
is the Ballet major.

504
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,990
She must be sure about her future goals

505
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,390
and

506
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,390
made this decision based on her dream.

507
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,670
Don't you think that

508
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,990
dreams are something
you keep persisting in

509
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,820
but you can still feel happy
at the same time?

510
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,460
If you were to give up ballet,

511
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,870
what would you do?

512
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,390
I...

513
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,670
Anyway, I understand her.

514
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,790
I think

515
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,940
dance education

516
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,790
is the dream she really
wants to hold on to.

517
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,820
But she can't just leave.

518
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,910
What am I gonna do when she's gone?

519
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,870
You still have me.

520
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,270
There's us, the classmates.

521
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,270
You have Xiao Bu

522
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,700
and Pan Pan.

523
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,100
It's good to have you guys.

524
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,910
Follow me.

525
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:38,700
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

526
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:44,940
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

527
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,030
- Hong.
- Three,

528
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,630
Two,

529
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,550
- Why is she here?
- Three.

530
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,790
- She really likes to teach Latin.
- Four, five, six.

531
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,420
- You see, when she's dealing with kids,
- Seven, eight, stop.

532
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,100
she looks like a different person.

533
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,790
This is not working. Let's try it again.

534
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:01,510
One, two, three, four.

535
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,300
Listen to me.

536
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,030
Xiaochun.

537
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,940
- When you do this,
- Not everything

538
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,180
- you need to open your hands.
- must go all the way to the end.

539
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,980
- Let's do it again.
- Hong works here

540
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,150
- One, two, three.
- not just to support her family.

541
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:13,790
Four.

542
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,390
- She's really suited to be a teacher.
- Five, six.

543
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,340
Seven.

544
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,630
- I think we should support her.
- Eight. Very good. That's it.

545
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,790
Am I right?

546
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,990
That's good. Keep it up.

547
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,550
Good.

548
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,820
Everyone got it right this time.

549
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,030
Let's end the class.

550
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,460
See you later, students.

551
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,870
Goodbye, teacher.

552
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,870
- Bye-bye. Take care.
- Bye, teacher.

553
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,100
Chun Chun.

554
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,940
Come to me.

555
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,460
Let's go.

556
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,220
Did you learn everything today?

557
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,790
Hong.

558
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,420
Chun Chun, you can go back now.

559
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,910
Thank you, teacher.

560
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,060
Take care of yourself on your way.

561
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,100
Xiaochun, what are you doing here?

562
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,870
You like to teach children how to dance.

563
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,510
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

564
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,340
Actually, I've been teaching here
for a long time.

565
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,990
But I've been afraid to tell you.

566
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,270
I was too impulsive last time.

567
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,150
I got mad at you.

568
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,510
I'm sorry.

569
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,060
It's all in the past.

570
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,580
Let's hug.

571
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,550
When I have time in the future,

572
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,550
I'll come with you and
teach the children how to dance.

573
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,060
How about it?

574
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,820
Sure!

575
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,820
Yu Manman, your eye contact.

576
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,270
Your legs.

577
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,060
Note the rhythm!

578
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,620
[Shi Xiaochun]

579
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,030
Why can't you even follow the music now?

580
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,670
Yu Manman.

581
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,670
Don't mind the precision!

582
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,580
Don't follow the usual steps!

583
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,300
Stop.

584
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,390
The Black Swan needs strength and charm.

585
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,820
Why are you calm like the White Swan?

586
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,030
How can you dance so poor
for the black swan?

587
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,390
Ling Chen.

588
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,220
I let you rest,

589
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,750
not to play with your phone.

590
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,100
You should focus on
your partner's movements right now.

591
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,940
Fifteen-minute break for Yu Manman.

592
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,390
Think about the moves.

593
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:57,460
Miss, I'd like to sign up
for the Black and White Swan.

594
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,300
Yu Manman,

595
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,630
are you alright?

596
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,580
Hong Jiaoyang,

597
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,550
about this.

598
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,390
I read the e-mail you sent me
for the transfer request.

599
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,580
I also believe that you are doing
this because you love education.

600
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,270
That's why you chose to transfer
from ballet to our department.

601
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,790
But according to school regulations,

602
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,420
your grade average must be above 90.

603
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:38,460
In addition,

604
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,870
you have to play a big role
in the annual school play.

605
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,390
Then you'll fulfill the requirements
for transferring to another department.

606
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,510
It's true that our department

607
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,820
has no precedent for a major change.

608
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,820
Mr. Lin told me about your situation.

609
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,750
We finally decided

610
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,550
to let you change your major.

611
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,180
But you must fulfill the requirements

612
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,820
mentioned by Mr. Liu.

613
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,030
In this way, you can prove to us

614
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,670
your expertises are up to standard.

615
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:04,670
What do you think?

616
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,630
Okay, I'll do it.

617
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,030
I found a problem.

618
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:20,910
What problem?

619
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,510
You're in bad state.

620
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,460
You're distracted.

621
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,630
I couldn't find the characteristics
of the demon king.

622
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,180
In a nutshell,

623
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,300
neither of us is good.

624
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,870
I know why you can't dance well.

625
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,940
The demon king is not just strong.

626
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,220
He's also extremely seductive.

627
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,510
He will irresistibly attract people.

628
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,910
To put it bluntly,
you have to be androgynous.

629
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,340
I can't act girly.

630
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,150
I don't fit at all.

631
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,460
I'm counting on you, okay?

632
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,510
I really want to play as the Black Swan.

633
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,030
Help me.

634
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,820
Manman,

635
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,550
I'm really worried
that I'd hold you back.

636
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,820
I think you should

637
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,030
find one that's really good for
playing as the demon king.

638
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,270
That way you'll improve more.

639
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,340
Forget it.

640
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,670
You and Ling Chen don't want
to dance with me.

641
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,670
I didn't mean anything by it.

642
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:18,700
I was just,

643
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,100
I just don't think I'm good enough
for the demon king.

644
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,420
I can be your practice partner.

645
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,420
Don't worry.

646
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,550
Before you found the new demon king,

647
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,910
I'll always be with you.

648
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,910
Don't look down.

649
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,630
Your crown will fall off.

650
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,750
You look better when you smile.

651
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:42,820
Here's the deal.

652
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,630
You can use me as a tool.
