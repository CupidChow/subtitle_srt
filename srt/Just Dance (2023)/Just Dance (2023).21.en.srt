00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,030
It's abuse.

172
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,790
Don't you know

173
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,230
the condition of your own daughter?

174
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,550
I heard about Manman's ankle

175
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,230
before we even started preparing.

176
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,150
So, I went to your house
to ask about her condition.

177
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,670
What did you tell me then?

178
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,200
Hello.

179
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,640
What?

180
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,710
Manman is missing?

181
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,030
Okay, I'll come now.

182
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,670
Yu Lihua,

183
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,440
if anything happens to Manman this time,

184
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
I won't be done with you.

185
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,550
Hurry, send teachers and peers
to find her.

186
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,110
Hurry, hurry.

187
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,080
Move!

188
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,280
Watch out.

189
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,590
Xiao Bu, you guys arrived just in time.

190
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,640
Yu Manman ran from the hospital.

191
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,150
All of you, contact all the students

192
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,000
and split up to find her.

193
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,910
- Let's go.
- She's missing.

194
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,080
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- Let's go.

195
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,000
Hurry!

196
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,710
Quickly, quickly!

197
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,550
I told you earlier.

198
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,910
This young lady seems nice.

199
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,640
Are you feeling lonely?

200
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,110
Do you want me to keep you company?

201
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,640
Where are you going?

202
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,080
Join me for a drink.

203
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,910
Come on!

204
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,880
Let's go, come on!

205
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:45,960
Let's go!

206
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,520
Get lost!

207
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,710
Who are you, you little brat?

208
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,280
Go away!

209
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,670
Go!

210
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,280
Just wait, I'll call someone.

211
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,910
Just wait!

212
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,080
I finally found you.

213
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,910
I'm sorry that I'm late.

214
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,150
What took you so long?

215
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,710
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,000

Ling Chen.

218
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,640
I heard from Xiao Bu
that he found Manman.

219
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,670
I've seen the message.

220
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,760
Have you seen Weibo?

221
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,520
Weibo?

222
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,470

Mom.

237
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,520
Didn't you teach me since I was young?

238
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,470
Don't care about
what others say about you.

239
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,230
Most importantly
is to be your best self.

240
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,670
These are just venting

241
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,400
on the internet.

242
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,670
I know, I won't let it bother me.

243
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,280
You should go to class now.

244
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,350
My daughter's privacy
has been completely exposed online.

245
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,030
What is all this stuff written online?

246
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,640
You must give me an explanation.

247
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,670
Mom, I've told you so many times.

248
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,840
Ms. Yu had no idea

249
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,350
about my ankle injury relapse.

250
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
What is all this about?

251
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,550
Are you still defending her even now?

252
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,840
Is the training plan she gave you

253
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,150
something a normal person can endure?

254
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,200
The netizens are more rational than you.

255
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,960
All right, all right.

256
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,840
There might be
some misunderstandings here.

257
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,150
I also understand Manman's perspective.

258
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,840
Ms. Yu, I think you should take a break

259
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,590
from the International Ballet Competition.

260
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,280
The situation online
is getting out of hand now.

261
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,440
I'm afraid the organizing committee
is aware of it too.

262
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,790
It's also affecting
the teaching at Haicheng Dance Academy.

263
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,400
So, let's put the classes on hold

264
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,230
for the time being.

265
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,880
Mr. Huang,

266
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,790
- I didn't mean it that way.
- I accept it.

267
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,790
Are you satisfied

268
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,470
with this resolution?

269
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,440
I will follow the school's arrangement.

270
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,960
I believe the school

271
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,150
will provide me with a fair judgment.

272
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,590
Ms. Yu.

273
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,350
It's okay. Go back and rest well.

274
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,590
Remember,

275
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,030
never do anything

276
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,350
that harms yourself again.

277
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,910
Ling Chen,
Ms. Yu suddenly stopped the classes.

278
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,350
I really don't know what to do now.

279
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,110
I feel so anxious.

280
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,000
The school has no choice

281
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,400
due to the online public opinion.

282
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,880
But don't worry.

283
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,150
Until the new teacher arrives,

284
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,400
I'll be here with you.

285
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,880
I'm glad to have you with me.

286
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh.

287
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:45,960
Xiaochun.

288
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,440
This is for you too.

289
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,790
It's a record I made
during the preliminary round,

290
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,760
detailing the unique traits and strengths

291
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,790
of each advancing contestant.

292
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,670
For your reference to be better prepared.

293
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,960
Ling Chen, it's good to have you here.

294
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do.

295
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,910
What's that all about?

296
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,960
Your official mentor is here
when I'm here.

297
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,030
Shi Xiaochun,
I want to formally inform you

298
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,470
that for this International
College Ballet Competition,

299
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,670
I will be your mentor,

300
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,280
put all into the competition with you.

301
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,470
Really? That's great!

302
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,150
Yes,

303
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,200
Ms. Yu

304
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,400
entrusted you to me.

305
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,880
Even though Ms. Yu stopped her classes,
she's still so responsible.

306
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,910
Ms. Yu is inherently

307
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,080
an earnest and responsible person.

308
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,960
Right,

309
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,640
Ling Chen, Xiaochun.

310
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,960
There's something
I'd like to ask both of you for.

311
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:56,790
Mom.

312
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,710
Ling Chen.

313
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,030
I've seen all the things online.

314
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,790
Don't let it bother you.

315
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,910
It's okay.

316
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,470
Even after changing my phone number,
they won't stop.

317
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,440
These people have nothing better to do.

318
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,200
Have you seen the messages
on your phone?

319
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,640
You see,

320
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,200
some of the messages

321
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,470
are from students you've taught.

322
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,280
Take a look.

323
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,910
(Ms. Yu, I'm from the 8th grade.)

324
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,470
(Hello, Ms. Yu.)

325
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,910
(It's because of a bet you made with me,)

326
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,350
(saying that with my height,
I would never dance well.)

327
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,350
(Finally, I've achieved the position
I wanted.)

328
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,790
(Don't bother the online controversies.)

329
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,320
(Just know that we, your students,)

330
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,080
(are here for you.)

331
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,520
(Ms. Yu, I'm Shi Xiaochun.)

332
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,320
(I've always wanted to say,)

333
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,590
(thank you for giving me a tough time)

334
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,030
(at the beginning of the school year.)

335
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,670
(I've come from being a wild card)

336

00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,160
Tomorrow will be the semifinals.

506
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,560
Consider it an indulgence for yourself.

507
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,000
It's not often

508
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,950
to hear such words coming from

509
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,520
a serious person like you.

510
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,280
But this semifinals
are only open to the media.

511
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,520
Otherwise, I would have liked you

512
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,110
to come and see my work with Mr. Lin.

513
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,160
Then tomorrow

514
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,160
I'll go with Mr. Lin.

515
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:28,160
I'll be at backstage
watching your performance live.

516
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,680
Alright.

517
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,800
I've already reserved

518
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,070
tickets for the finals for you.

519
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,400
I've spoke to the committee's

520
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,280
contact person.

521
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,160
If I make it to the finals,

522
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,830
I hope all the Good-for-nothing League
members can be there.

523
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,280
Okay.

524
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,430
If you really want
to specialize in contemporary ballet,

525
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,950
then San Francisco

526
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,920
is a haven for top-notch dancers.

527
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,310
I'll send you the information,

528
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,400
take a good look.

529
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,190
If you're serious about going,

530
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,880
we'll need to prepare
for the entrance exams,

531
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,470
and time is very tight.

532
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,710
Xiaochun,

533
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,070
there's actually something
I want to tell you.

534
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,880
Mr. Lin.

535
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,640
Mr. Lin.

536
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,110
Come.

537
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,560
That's quite a feast.

538
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,680
Mr. Lin, this was all my idea,

539
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,590
not Xiaochun.

540
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,470
I'll put it away now.

541
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,160
Who told you to put it away?

542
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,920
The water is boiling.

543
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:19,830
But

544
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,280
let's not make it a habit.

545
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,920
Mr. Lin, what are you doing?

546
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,190
I need to replenish myself too.

547
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,800
This period has really stressed me out,

548
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
and I'm exhausted.

549
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:36,920
By the way,

550
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,310
when the water boils,
cook me some slices of beef.

551
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,310
Sure.

552
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,560
Mr. Lin,

553
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,190
I really couldn't tell
that you were nervous at all.

554
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,430
Of course I won't show
when I'm really nervous.

555
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,310
I need to be steady to lead you.

556
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,430
Besides,

557
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,920
I've been studying ballet
for so many years.

558
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,470
I have confidence in you, in me,

559
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,520
and in the foundation that Ms. Yu

560
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,800
has laid for you.

561
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,920
Alright, that's about it.
Let's keep it up.

562
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,280
Okay.

563
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,560
Come.

564
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,190
Come.

565
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,680
Cheers.

566
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,520
Ladies and gentlemen,

567
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,470
welcome

568
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,640
to 30th International College
Ballet Competition

569
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,880
semifinals.

570
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,590
Out of the thirty dancers
who have advanced,

571
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,190
only ten will proceed to the finals.

572
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,310
Who will ultimately secure

573
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,160
these ten golden tickets

574
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,830
to the international finals?

575
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,880
Let's find out.

576
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,350
In this competition,

577
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,560
many of our participants
have delivered outstanding performances.

578
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,470
However, the most remarkable
is the young talent

579
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,230
who managed to turn the tide
in the preliminary.

580
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,710
Shi Xiaochun
from Haicheng Dance Academy.

581
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,800
Please welcome Anna Pavlova to perform

582
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,400
"Anna Karenina".

583
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,190
The Russian contestant
continues to showcase

584
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,430
her strength in classical ballet

585
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,160
with a traditional piece from

586
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,560
the ballet "Anna Karenina".

587
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,230
Due to forbidden love,
the female protagonist

588
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,680
was abandoned by high society

589
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,070
and tragically throws herself
under the platform.

590
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,940
[Judges]

591
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,040
Did you guys see that?

592
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,000
During the preliminary round,
she only gave it half her effort.

593
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
We underestimated her.

594
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:28,590
Judges, please score.

595
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,560
It's my turn next.

596
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,560
The next contestant, please be ready.

597
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,640
You're next after her.

598
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,830
Like last time,

599
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,160
let's steal the spotlight back.

600
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,710
Xiaochun, keep it up.

601
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,160
I'll always be with you,

602
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,000
no matter where.

603
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,160
Alright,

604
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,880
why are you suddenly
getting so sentimental?

605
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,520
Don't worry,

606
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,680
I'll do my best.

607
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,880
I'll go get ready now.

608
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:46,680
Okay.

609
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:48,920
Keep it up.

610
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,070
Be careful.

611
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,430
Next, we have Shi Xiaochun
from Haicheng Dance Academy,

612
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,800
performing "Fight".

613
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,340
[Judges]

614
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,230
Great!

615
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,470
Judges, please score.

616
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,470
The next contestant, please be ready.

617
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,520
Xiaochun,

618
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:11,920
good job!

619
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,950
It was great!

620
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,590
Thank you Mr. Lin.

621
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,470
But

622
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,310
why does it seem like
the judges' expressions

623
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,800
aren't quite right?

624
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,710
It's okay,

625
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
let's wait for the results.

626
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,590
The next contestant to take the stage

627
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,070
is Amanda McBroom

628
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,190
from San Francisco Dance Academy.

629
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,000
Performing "Carmen".

630
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,830
So powerful, her expressive performance
is truly remarkable.

631
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,430
It lives up to its reputation.

632
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,800
So this is
the San Francisco Dance Academy.

633
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,280
The San Francisco contestant

634
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,640
is nothing less than
the Russian contestant,

635
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,280
and she's Chinese.

636
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,830
It looks like
the San Francisco Dance Academy

637
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,070
is indeed very strong.

638
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,110
With the conclusion of

639
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,470
the final contestant's performance,

640
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,920
the rankings for the semifinals
are now available.

641
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,110
Let's take a look together.

642
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,830
The dancer
from the San Francisco Dance Academy

643
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,880
dominates the stage
with a clear advantage

644
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,920
and takes first place.

645
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
The St. Petersburg contestant
takes second place.

646
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,310
The remaining rankings are as follows,
Imperial Ballet School,

647
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,560
Elmhurst School for Dance,

648
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,920
English National Ballet School,

649
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,110
Central Ballet School,

650
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,560
St. Paul's School,
Maine Central Institute.

651
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,470
The 9th place goes to the Pratt Institute.

652
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,710
It seems like the competition
has reached a fever pitch.

653
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,310
Yes,

654
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,710
our most concerned Chinese contestant,
Shi Xiaochun,

655
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,710
although she performed exceptionally well,

656
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,830
it appears she didn't quite capture
the judges' favor.

657
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,470
She finishes in the 10th place
and secures her spot in the finals.

658
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,190
Yes.

659
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,560
I made it to the finals!

660
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,470
Although my scores

661
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,560
may not be particularly ideal.

662
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,640
It's okay.

663
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
There's a bit of regret,

664
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,310
but in the future,

665
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,920
let's work hard and keep going!
