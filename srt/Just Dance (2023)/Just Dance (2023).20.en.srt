Ms. Yu,

23
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,270
why did you keep away
all these teaching materials?

24
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,590
Manman is injured.

25
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,440
We have to quit the competition.

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,830
These won't be needed anymore.

27
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,440
That's a pity.

28
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,950
Well, I get to go to the class first.

29
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,550
All right.

Ms. Yu.

32
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,270
Regarding the competition,

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,190
is there really no other way for it?

34
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,830
After all, you've put
so much effort into it.

35
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,680
At this point,

36
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,310
is the competition still that important?

37
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,720
We should show more concern for Manman.

38
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,360
She's about to wake up.

39

Let's go to see her.

You shouldn't go for now.

She refuses to meet anyone.

54
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,080
to forfeit this competition.

55
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,630
Please pass on the message to Manman

56
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,830
and let her focus on recovering.

57
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,830

to not think too much about it.

I find you quite interesting.

60

Do you not realise
how the situation is caused?

61
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,750
How can you come here
and explain things calmly

62
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,080
without a hint of emotion?

63
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,520
Your ex-husband used to say
that you lacked humanity.

64
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,720
And, now I finally understand
what he meant.

65
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,360
What do you mean by that?

66
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,110
Don't.

67
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,270
That's enough.

68
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,800
Manman doesn't need your concern.

69
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,240
I will get the best doctor
for her treatment.

70
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,630
You can leave now.

71
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,830
She is not in a good state.

72
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,440
And her words are rather harsh.

73
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,240
Don't take it to heart.

74
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,600
I'm fine.

75
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,270
I'll go back now.

76
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,960
You should head back early too.

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,080
there's still a chance.

83

Xiaochun,

85
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,030
I thought about it all night.

86
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,030
If it's possible,

87
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,080
could you substitute Yu Manman
and participate in the competition?

88
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,960
Me?

89
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,600
That's impossible.
If anyone should go, it should be you.

90
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,750
How could it be me? Don't make a joke.

91
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,240
I can't.

92
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,270
No.

93
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,000
Now, I'm in a state

94
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,550
like a newborn baby.

95
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,270
I've just discovered
the nourishment of life

96
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,960
in contemporary dance.

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,320
I have to put in my effort
to absorb it all.

98
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,390
So, this competition

99
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,630
doesn't really mean much to me.

100
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,720
But, it's a different case for you.

101
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,390
Didn't you tell me

102
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,240
that you wanted to go on a bigger stage?

103
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,470
This is your chance.

104
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:21,800
I...

105
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,790
You just go ahead and dance bravely.

106
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,350
But, this is a very huge competition.

107
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,350
I haven't thought it through,

108
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,070
and I have no confidence at all.

109
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,760
Shi Xiaochun.

110
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,230
I understand you better
than anyone else.

111
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,600
You must believe me.

112
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,040
I

113
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,480
know about your progress

114
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,880
and your potential.

115
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,640
I have faith in you that you can do it.

116
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,440
You always say
your level isn't good enough.

117
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,790
But for me, you just lack
such a chance for challenge.

118
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,550
Okay.

119
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,270
I'll give it a try.

120
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
I won't be afraid of it.

121
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,320
As expected of the Wild Peacock
by the unnamed lakeside.

122
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,320
Well, stop discussing it here.
Everyone is watching us.

123
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,270
Let's think about
how to handle this first.

124
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,670
All right.

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,920
What happened?

126
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,110
The filming is about to start now.

127
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:32,880
All right.

128
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,160
I get it.

Why are you here?

132
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,440
The competition
hasn't officially ended yet.

133
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,760
We still have a chance.

134
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,880
There's still hope.

135
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,070
I've said it before.

136
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,640
Don't dwell on the competition anymore.

137
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,000
It's meaningless now.

138
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,760
But, the deadline for preliminary
hasn't passed.

139
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,390
We shouldn't give up now.

140
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,230
Many contestants prepare it in advance.

141
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,760
There's a channel on the official website

142
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,600
for the registered contestants

143
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,070
to modify their information.

144
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,510
The deadline

145

There are only 24 hours from now.

147
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,760
Can you tell me

148
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,790
where I can find

149
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,000
an identical Coppelia?

150
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,070
Ms. Yu, can you let me try it?

151
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,600
We've been practicing
Coppelia for so long.

152
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,480
How can you learn it in just 24 hours?

153
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,830
Shi Xiaochun, you're too naive.

154
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,950
Ms. Yu.

155
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,040
I didn't think too much about it.

156
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,390
I just feel

157
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,760
that Ling Chen is so sad
because of what happened to you.

158
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,110
So I wanted to help him

159
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,040
and also you.

160
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,000
There are only 24 hours.

161
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,440
I don't want to give up.

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is...

163
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,270
The Coppelia performance
by a Russian contestant.

164
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,270
If you're capable,

165
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,040
replicate the moves exactly
and let me see.

166
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,390
But, Ms. Yu,
how is it possible within 24 hours?

167
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,350
To be precise,

168
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,510
you only have

169
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,350
23 hours and 58 minutes left.

170
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,920
All right, Ms. Yu.

171
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:31,940
[Nurse Station]

172
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,830
Hello, Aunty.

173
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,350
You are...

174
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,040
I'm Xiao Bu.

175
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,440
I'm Manman's classmate.

176
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,550
I wanted to visit her.

177
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,670
Didn't I tell you already?

178
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,270
There's no need for you to visit her.

179
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,830
This will disturb her.

180
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,510
Aunty,

181
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,480
I brought her some of her favorites.

182
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,390
Please let me talk to her
for just a moment.

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,040
Only a moment, can I?

184
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,200
Didn't you hear what I said?

185
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,440
Moreover,

186
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,830
these are just cheap things.

187
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,230
Manman wouldn't like them.

188
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,070
How do you know whether she likes them?

189
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,350
She's my daughter. Of course, I know.

190
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,510
Please, I beg you,

191
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,320
don't come disturb her again
in the future.

192
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,270
Why do you have such kind of classmates?

193
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,720
Why are they so rude?

194
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,510
How did these kids even
get into Haicheng Dance Academy?

195
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Why haven't you left yet?

196
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,110
Don't come here again.

197
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,960
(These balloons
will accompany you here.)

198
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,960
(Think of me when you see them.)

199
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,960
Find the feeling
of being manipulated, Xiaochun.

200
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:38,910
Mind your expression.

201
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,790
Great!

202
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,760
Ms. Yu, I've already practiced it.

203
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,470
Would you please take a look?

204
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,590
Are you kidding me?

205
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,790
Just one night.

206
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,200
Ling Chen stayed up all night with me
to make the movements more precise.

207
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,910
I'm very confident.

208
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,200
Otherwise, I wouldn't dare
to have you here watching me.

209
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,520
All right then.

210
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,350
Go ahead and dance.

211
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,000
I'll play the music.

212
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,520
Okay.

213
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,470
Stop it there.

214
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,840
I told you,

215
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,230
it's impossible to learn it
just one night.

216
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,760
You didn't use your brain.

217
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,030
This is impossible.

218
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,760
We've carefully observed every movement.

219
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,320
The movement is all fine

220
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,030
and I can't find anything wrong with it.

221
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,880
There's only one issue.

222
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,790
You're not Yu Manman.

223
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,080
Mr. Yu,

224
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,550
what do you mean by that?

225
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,400
When Yu Manman danced this part,

226
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,000
I was deeply touched.

227
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,230
But, you are

228
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,320
just like an empty soul,

229
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,470
not even one percent of her.

230
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,790
So, what is the exact problem?

231
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,790
Could you please shed a light on us?

232
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,880
You don't need to think about it.

233
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,230
There's no time left.

234
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,670
Just give up on that.

235
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,150
Regarding the competition,

236
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,710
I really thank you for your intention.

237
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,200
Please stop it here.

238
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,030
Everyone is tired.

239
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,230
Ms. Yu.

240
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:45,790
It's okay.

241
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Come and take a rest here.

242
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,200
Hello, Xiao Bu. What's going on?

243
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,080
You finally answered the call.

244
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,520
No worries.

245
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,550
Take your time
and tell me what happened.

246
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,670
Yu Manman kept in touch
with me secretly.

247
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,670
Her mom found out,

248
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,440
and she was very angry.

249
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,520
They had an argument.

250
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,440
Yu Manman is in a bad mood right now.

251
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,710
She was crying while talking to me
on the phone just now.

252
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,910
And then, what happened?

253
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,440
The filming here is still ongoing.

254
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,110
I didn't care about the situation,
so I sneaked out.

255
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,400
But as soon as I left,

256
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,760
I was caught by the crews in the studio.

257
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,760
They won't let go of me.

258
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:25,960
All right.

259
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,350
Don't you worry,
I will go over there now.

260
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,000
All right. Thank you for your help.

261
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,280
All right.

262
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,150
I'll send you a WeChat message
when I reach there later.

263
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,520
Okay.

264
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:32,760
Let's go.

265
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,150
Let's go now.

266
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:34,710
Mrs. Yu.

267
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,840
Manman needs to rest.

268
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,000
Please let her rest quietly for a while.

269
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,350
I've told you many times.

270
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,760
I want to go out.

271
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,910
Let me go out.

272
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,470
You can't even stand up properly.

273
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,670
And, you want to go out.

274
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,840
You want to meet

275
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,550
the classmate who came to
visit you last time, right?

276
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,230
Do you think that I don't know

277
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,400
his intention?

278
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,640
Yu Manman, listen,

279
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,440
don't ever think of going anywhere
until your injury heals.

280
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,470
Yu Manman.

281
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,520
Enough, stop it, Mrs. Yu.

282
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,230
Manman needs to rest.

283
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,590
Please let her have some peace.

284
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,440
Manman, don't be stubborn.

285
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,710
With your current condition,
you still couldn't go out.

286
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,910
When your injury heals,

287
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,400
your mom could
take you out for a walk.

288
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,000
Mrs. Yu,

289
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,640
let's talk outside.

290
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,880
You make sure to look after her.

291
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,440
Before your injury heals,

292
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,320
never think of going anywhere.

293
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,080
Let's go in.

294
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,030
Let me do it.

295
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,520
Can you make it?

296
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:34,910
Trust me.

297
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,280
Go ahead.

298
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,030
Manman.

299
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,710
Why did you come here?

300
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Are you here to witness my unfortunate?

301
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,960
Xiao Bu asked me to come.

302
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,320
He's very concerned
about your condition.

303
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,280
How do you feel

304
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,280
about seeing me like this?

305
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,790
Are you happy now?

306
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,280
You're completely mistaken.

307
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,280
I feel just as sad as they do.

308
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,640
You don't need to pretend.

309
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,080
I heard from Xiao Bu that you're
replacing me for the competition.

310
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,200
You must be thrilled about that, right?

311
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,110
I think you've witnessed it now.
You can leave.

312
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,150
Manman,

313
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,230
do you know
who my biggest motivation for dancing is?

314
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,350
It's you.

315
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,200
I was so proud this morning

316
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,470
because I thought I had finally learned

317
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,590
all the moves well
from your competition recording.

318
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,840
But, it ended up
that Ms. Yu rejected me completely,

319
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,710
saying I'm not even
one percent of you as good as you.

320
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,350
Honestly, I was quite unwilling
to accept it.

321
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,550
But, it was in the moment
that I realised

322
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,400
you are my motivation for dancing.

323
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,440
If you're not there,

324
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,880
I won't have anyone
to challenge in the future.

325
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,150
And, my motivation for dancing
will be gone as well.

326
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,400
Even if I win first place
in the competition,

327
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
it will be meaningless too.

328
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:05,910
Manman,

329
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,880
for me, Shi Xiaochun,

330
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,230
in the whole class,
or even the whole department...

331
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:11,710
No.

332
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,030
In the entire world, the entire universe,
you're my most admired rival.

333
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,280
So, please recover quickly.

334
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,200
If you give up now,

335
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,550
you're no longer who you were before.

336
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,030
I'll be waiting for you
on the competition stage

337
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,030
and let's have a fair competition
with each other,

338
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,760
just like we used to.

339
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,350
That's all from me.

340

342
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,230
Wait a moment.

343
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,400
Didn't you want to know which part
you didn't perform as well as me?

344
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,230
This is the recording
of the entire process of my preparation.

345
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,150
You can watch it.

346
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,280
Although I've been reluctant to admit it,

347
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,790
I really admire you from my heart.

348
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,110
From the very beginning till now,

349
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,080
there have been several moments

350
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,910
when I felt like
I had already lost to you.

351
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,230
To be honest,

352
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,520
I really admire you

353
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,520
for not having any scruples.

354
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,880
You can always keep going forward
towards your goals.

355

I hope you'll do the same this time

356
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,910

I understand.

358
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,960
Thank you, Manman.

359
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,670
I'm leaving now.

360
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,880
Xiaochun, how is it going?

361
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,800
I've decided
to continue with the competition.

362
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,950
But my mom has already said
there's no need for that.

363
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,040
I do that not for Ms. Yu.

364
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,760
There is less than a month left
before the deadline of the preliminary.

365
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,800
My foot seems to hurt even more.

366
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,310
I took an extra pill last night

367
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,070
and it barely alleviates my pain.

368
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,590
But today, Ms. Yu finally praised me,

369
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,160
saying that I've taken
another step forward.

370
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,310
I don't know

371
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,950
why I started to have

372
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,920
a different feeling about Coppelia.

373
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,110
Coppelia

374
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,800
looks like

375
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,590
a cute and docile marionette,

376
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,830
manipulated by others

377
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,560
and never speaking a word

378
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,710
against the professor who created her.

379
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,950
But she's not like that.

380
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,640
There's a lot of helplessness
behind her.

381
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,160
It's only
when she slowly gets influenced

382
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
by the human emotions

383
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,760
that she starts to fight desperately

384
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,190
to break free from it all.

385
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,350
Honestly,

386
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,590
I admire her rebellion.

387
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,640
In a way,

388
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,230
all the things I want to do but dare not

389
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,280
are embodied in this dance.

390
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,070
So, I left it all for Coppelia
to fulfill it for me.

391
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,280
That's all for today.

392
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,280
No one is going to watch this.

393
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,880
And, there's nowhere
for me to express it.

394
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,230
Let's begin
the first run-through for today.

395
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,800
Xiaochun,

396
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,830
what are you watching?

397
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,350
I finally understand

398
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,830
why Ms. Yu said that.

399
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,950
Now I also understand why,

400
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,400
I can't surpass Manman

401
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,710
no matter how hard I try.

402
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,160
Because Manman is Coppelia.

403
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,310
She's dancing as herself.

404
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,230
She interprets the dance
with 18 years of her life experience.

405
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,520
So, with just a night of hard work,

406
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,430
it's impossible to surpass her.

407
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:02,680
You're right.

408
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,350
You don't experience
what she has gone through.

409
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,520
It's indeed impossible
to dance Coppelia.

410
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,800
But,

411
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,950
