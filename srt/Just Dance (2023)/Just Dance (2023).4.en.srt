that Shi Xiaochun is not fully liable

for causing your fall.

24

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,570
Your rhythm is good, keep it up.

173
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,420
Okay.

174
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,940
The rest can be dismissed.

175
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,130
Follow me, Shi Xiaochun.

176
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,890
I know what is in your mind.

177
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,300
Mr. Lin.

178
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,060
I prefer to dance white swan.

179
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,530
You can't even remember
the steps for the corps de ballet.

180
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,380
How could you dance white swan?

181
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,060
The choreography of the white swan

182
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,450
is more complex
than the female corps de ballet, Xiaochun.

183
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,570
But being a female corps de ballet
is never my goal.

184
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,420
You have to understand, Xiaochun.

185
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,530
Your passion for dancing

186
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,620
is your strength.

187
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,570
However, if you rush things,

188
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,530
it might turn into your weakness.

189
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,420
I've seen

190
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,060
too many students trapped by their talents
in Haicheng Dance Academy.

191
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,620
I don't wish
that you'll become one of them.

192
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,500
You resemble your father very much.

193
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,770
You're both passionate about dancing.

194
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,420
To be honest,

195
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,380
I was in the same batch
as your father in Haicheng Dance.

196
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,330
We were in the same dorm.

197
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,420
When you had your first interview,

198
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,330
I knew that you're
Shi Xiangyang's daughter.

199
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,210
Your father is a virtuoso dancer.

200
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,570
Back then,

201
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,380
- among our batch,
- What brings you here, Ling Chen?

202
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,860
- I almost...
- I'm here to fill in the form.

203
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,740
Okay, you can have a seat here.

204
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,330
Xiaochun.

205
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,980
Remember.

206
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,060
There are no minor roles in dancing,

207
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,450
but reckless ballerinas.

208
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,260
Hence, take things easy
at your own pace.

209
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,330
Let's do it slowly.

210
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,480
You made it
into Haicheng Dance Academy.

211
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,690
You mustn't let me and your father down.

212
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,570
I understand, Mr. Lin.

213
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,820
I'll work together with the rest

214
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,740
to excel
at the female corps de ballet part.

215
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,740
Good.

216
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,940
I have faith in you.

217
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,210
Ling Chen.

218
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:27,740
How about this?

219
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,260
We

220
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,450
- can pick a position.
- Can you please focus?

221
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,740
Look what you've written
for the award and achievement section.

222
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,380
I'm sorry, Madam.

223
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,650
I'll rewrite it.

224
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,650
Thank you.

225
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:54,570
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,530
What's the matter with you?

227
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,770
You were acting like this in class too.

228
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,130
You're still the same now.
Are you doing this on purpose?

229
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,940
Do you want everyone
to do this again and again with you?

230
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,210
I don't think you'll improve
even if we practice this with you again

231
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,980
Well, she's aiming
for the principal role.

232
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,820
She disdains
to do the corps de ballet with us.

233
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:08,890
It's my fault.

234
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,530
How about this?

235
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,130
You can practice accordingly as planned.

236
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,770
I'll practice my part first,
before synchronizing with you.

237
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,130
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,420
Why is she so poor
at onstage positioning?

239
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,530
She's dragging our progress.

240
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,450
Yu Manman,
stabilize your supporting leg.

241
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,650
I grew up together with Ling Chen.

242
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,450
We're known to be the golden pair.

243
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,130
Aside from me,
no one is qualified to stand by his side.

244
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,180
There are no minor roles

245
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,330
in dancing,

246
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,650
but reckless ballerinas.

247
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,330
Hence, take things easy
at your own pace.

248
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,330
Let's do it slowly.

249
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,450
You mustn't let me and your father down.

250
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,530
Well, she's aiming
for the principal role.

251
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,620
She disdains to do
the corps de ballet with us.

252
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,060
Xiaochun.

253
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,860
Why are you here at this hour?

254
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,820
Are you reflecting life
under the moonlight?

255
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,530
I was just emptying my mind.

256
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,890
Enough with the self-reflection. Come on.

257
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,530
I'll bring you somewhere fun.

258
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,450
Where?

259
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,210
It won't be disappointing.

260
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,380
Come on.

261
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,420
Stop.

262
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,740
What's wrong with the both of you?

263
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,890
You're not in your best condition today.

264
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,180
I didn't rest well yesterday.

265
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,620
As a professional danseur,

266
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,210
whether did you have a good rest or not

267
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,820
shouldn't affect
your onstage performance.

268
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,620
Did you know?

269
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,530
I'm sorry, Ms. Yu.

270
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,330
I missed the practice
due to my leg injury.

271
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,690
I'll make sure I don't fall behind.

272
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,060
Let's have a short break.

273
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,620
Adjust your condition.

274
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,530
Ling Chen.

275
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,260
Let's avoid having our feelings
interfere with the practice...

276
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,010
Okay.

277
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,060
[Music]

278
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,530
They're really incredible.

279
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,180
There are so many people
and the stage management is complex.

280
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,380
How did they manage
to find the centre stage?

281
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:32,940
Well.

282
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,530
This is nothing to them.

283
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,890
As the saying goes, experts live
among the common people.

284
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,570
Xiao Bu.

285
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,450
Come on.

286
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,620
- I can't.
- Just dance ballet.

287
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,860
This is my schoolmate. Treat her well.

288
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,210
Okay.

289
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,140
Xiao Bu.

290
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:16,620
Come on.

291
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,260
Change the music to "Swan Lake".

292
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,290
Xiao Bu.

293
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,050
This is too fast.

294
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,410
You can do it too.

295
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,410
I can do it too.

296
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,330
Come on, drink something.

297
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,450
I'll do the introduction.

298
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,740
Shi Xiaochun.

299
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,090
My schoolmate from Haicheng Dance Academy,
the Little Peacock of Department of Ballet.

300
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,660
Queen, Bear.

301
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:23,930
Hello.

302
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,450
You can address me as Little Peacock.

303
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,500
I thought why you're so good at ballet.

304
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,140
Turns out you're Xiao Bu's schoolmate.

305
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,500
Haicheng Dance is indeed
a school with gifted students.

306
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,780
We're nothing compared

307
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,050
to dancers like you who do dance-offs.

308
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,260
The stage is huge

309
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,540
and the lights are blinding.

310
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,660
How did you manage
to locate the centre stage?

311
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,290
There's a knack for this.

312
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,450
Every steps are connected.

313
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,290
Hurry up.

314
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,020
Teach her.

315
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,900
She's troubled over this.

316
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:49,930
Come on.

317
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,660
It's actually simple.

318
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,260
First, you need
to be familiar with the stage

319
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,290
and establish a sense
of space with the stage.

320
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,210
Here.

321
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:56,930
Shut your eyes.

322
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:58,860
Close your eyes.

323
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,930
Trust me, close your eyes.

324
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,810
Come on, give me your hands.

325
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,140
Follow my lead.

326
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,660
Come on.

327
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,260
Is it possible?

328
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,540
Of course, let's give it a try.

329
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,500
Be careful. Come on.

330
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,690
Feel the size of the stage,

331
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,620
the distance and your position.

332
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,210
Now, we're at the centre stage.

333
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:21,900
Let's move backwards.

334
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,290
Okay, let's return to centre stage.

335
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,740
Back to centre stage.

336
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,540
Now, let's move forward
from centre stage.

337
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,380
Okay.

338
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,330
Feel it with your heart.

339
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,290
When you're at centre stage,

340
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,860
you can't see anyone
aside from yourself.

341
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,140
At this moment,

342
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,260
the stage is your only partner.

343
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,540
Don't be afraid of it.

344
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,020
Face it and feel it.

345
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,690
Treat it as your bed, Shi Xiaochun.

346
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,450
When you're sleeping in,

347
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,740
you love to roll in your bed, don't you?

348
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,380
That's the key.

349
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,780
Xiao Bu.

350
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,900
Close your eyes.

351
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,810
Try to dance one section.

352
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,900
Let's see if you could
return to the original position.

353
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,090
Okay, I'll give it a try then.

I manage to find the centre stage!

365
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,170
Perfect.

366
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,380
Thank you so much, Bear.

367
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,660
Thank you too, Queen.

368

No worries, I hope you got inspired.

369
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,020
You're a peacock, while I'm a bear.

370
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,210
We're both animals.

371
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,500
We should help each other
to build a harmonious community.

372
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,540
My gosh, your joke is so lame.

373
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,620
Isn't it funny?

374
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,140
You only thank them both, what about me?

375
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,620
There's no thanks in friendship.

376
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,620
Well, it depends.

377
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,690
Treat me to a meal later.

378
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,140
So, you're waiting for this, aren't you?

379
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,450
I still haven't had enough fun yet.

380
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,140
How about a dance-off?

381
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,860
Come on.

382
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,050
Let's go.

383
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,140
Teach me that move.

384
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,290
What is this move?

385
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,020
Like this.

386
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,540
You did great earlier,
you just need to relax a little.

How was it?
My friends are cool, aren't they?

392
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,450
They're so cool.

393
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,140
When did you pick up street dance?

394
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,330
I learned it when I was thirteen.

395
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,050
I was a teenager then.

396
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,140
I was really rebellious.

397
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,660
My family didn't support me then.

398
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,780
They said that I was a good-for-nothing.

399
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,020
I thought my existence
was a mistake too,

400
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,170
until I learned street dance.

401
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,210
My perspectives changed.

402
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,620
Street dance makes me feel

403
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,330
that as long as I persevere,

404
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,090
I'm the centre of the world.

405
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,290
The centre of the world.

406
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,090
As long as you're passionate
about the stage

407
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,260
and you have the stage in your heart,

408
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,900
you're fearless.

409
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,740
That's right. For the kids who grew up
in the backstreets of Haicheng Dance Academy,

410
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,740
the stage is wherever we go.

411
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,410
Come on.

412
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,740
Xiao.

413
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,170
I didn't expect you
to be good at street dance too.

414
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,740
He's not only good at dancing,

415
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,620
Xiao Bu can sing and dance well.

416
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,690
The songs he composed are great too.

417
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,980
- It's wonderful!
- However, to us,

418
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,980
we're surprised that he'd go for ballet.

419
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,660
I've been learning ballet since little.

420
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,170
When I was in middle school,

421
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,050
I fell in love with underground culture.

422
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,540
Back then,

423
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,290
I caused so much chaos in my family.

424
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,500
My dad thinks that ballet is
classic and formal.

425
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,810
He said that I don't have to worry
about getting a job with this skill.

426
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,740
Of course I rather die
than compromising.

427
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,330
Due to this,

428
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,450
my dad almost had a heart attack.

429
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,660
What could I do?

430
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,500
I could only go for ballet.

431
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,570
I didn't realise
that you didn't like ballet

432
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,330
when you're in class.

433
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,540
Well.

434
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,930
I'm just waiting for my graduation.

435
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,860
After I graduate, I'm free.

436
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,540
No wonder you're always

437
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,450
acting like a dead pig
who's not afraid of boiling water.

438
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,540
- Dead pig.
- Dead pig.

439
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,450
However,

440
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,290
you looked so focused and serious.

441
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,980
I've never seen you like that.

442
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,810
Dead pig?

443
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,780
Eat more food and shut your mouth.

444
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,740
Honestly,

445
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,330
I like ballet.

446
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,980
Especially your performance today.

447
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,170
It inspires me a lot.

448
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,500
I think we could arrange a choreography

449
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,860
to combine ballet and street dance.

450
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,380
It'll surely be a hit.

451
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,170
I like this idea.

452
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,860
I'll join.

453
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:10,780
Count me in.

454
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,450
Come on.

455
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,690
Cheers!

456
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,860
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

457
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,260
Tonight,

458
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,620
the bill is on me.

459
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,170
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

460
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,330
I'll treat you next month.

461
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,210
Come on, cheers.

462
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:25,930
- Let's have a toast.
- Come on.

463
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,900
Let's have a toast to Mr. Lin.

464

Eat up.

465
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,540
There are so many dishes.

466
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,570
Eat up, Ling Chen.

467
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,540
That's enough, Mom.

00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:37,580
Eat up.

470

- I'll fill up your cup.
- Eat this.

471
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,020

473
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:45,050

- Come on.

474
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:45,810
Well,

475
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,290
eat it slowly.

476
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,660
Listen.

477
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,900
Here's a toast to Ms. Yu.

478
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,260
Okay.

479
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,330
I wish

480
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,780
that Ms. Yu becomes
more beautiful with each passing day.

481
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,740
Good.

482
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:56,860
- No.
- That's right.

483
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:57,810
I can't drink.

484
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,090
Ms. Yu.

485
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,930
I can't drink anymore.

486
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,170
If you can't drink,

487
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,810
your son should drink then.

488
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,260
Come on, have a drink, Ling Chen.

489
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,020
- He can't drink too.
- That's right.

490
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,620
- Have a drink, Ling Chen.
- He's not allowed to drink.

491
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:08,410
Bottoms up.

492
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,210
Well.

493
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,690
Come on, Ling Chen.

494
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,290
I'll fill up your cup.

495
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,260
Here's a toast to you, Mr. Lin.

496
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,860
Okay, drink slowly.

497
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:20,530
Very well.

498
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,700
- He's good.
- Not bad.

499
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,740
He's a grown up now.

500
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,170
Come on, cheers.

501
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,140
- Eat up.
- Cheers!

502
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,620
Come on.

503
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,450
Here's a toast

00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,050
to all the teachers.

505
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,450
Okay, come on.

506
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,260
Okay.

507
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,260
Stop drinking.

508
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,570
Go home.

509
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,210
Go home now.

510
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:43,860
Okay.

511
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,660
My

512
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,090
apologies.

513
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,020
I shall leave first.

514
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,330
- Ling Chen.
- Ling Chen.

515
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,980
Please excuse us.

516
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,540
He's not allowed to drink.

517
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,540
- Here, cheers!
- Come on.

518
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,290
Let's enjoy the night.

519
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,980
Listen.

520
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,330
Actually, my dream is not dancing.

521
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,620
I want to be a superstar.

522
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,210
Shi Xiaochun.

523
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,140
Why are you here, Ling Chen?

524
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:16,690
Shi Xiaochun.

525
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,810
Follow me.

526
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:18,740
I need to talk to you.

527
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,980
You can say it here.

528
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,410
They're my schoolmates
from Haicheng Dance Academy.

529
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:25,570
The both of them...

530
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:26,930
Well, you know.

531
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,290
Come on, cheers!

532
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,050
Cheers!

533
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:33,740
Ling Chen.

534
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,450
What are you doing?

535
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,500
You dragged me all the way here,
yet you didn't say anything.

536
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,260
Is this you?

537
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,930
Who posted this online?

538
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,980
Are you this close with Xiao Bu?

539
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,980
We're comrades of the art examination.

540
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,930
Comrades?

541
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,660
As a girl,

542
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,170
don't you have some sense of safety?

543
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,740
You dance in such a dodgy place.

544
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,050
You drink alcohol with a bunch of guys.

545
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,500
Don't you know how to protect yourself?

546
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,410
Follow me back now.

547
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,570
Otherwise,
I'll report you to the department

548
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,930
that you're joining some sketchy events.

549
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,810
Do you think
that I'm always looking for trouble?

550
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,690
I'm doing this
to get the white swan role.

551
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,570
Hence, I went to Xiao Bu

552
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,570
to learn how to master the stage.

553
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,860
I'm here to learn.

554
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,410
Learn?

555
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,020
Yes.

556
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:18,850
Why do you always

557
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,090
improve your dance skills

558
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,450
through weird channels?

559
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,330
Am I a bad teacher?

560
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,780
You're a good teacher.

561
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,570
Never mind.

562
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,020
Do you think that these tricky ways

563
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,210
are more effective
than boring and rigid practices?

564
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:35,860
Am I right?

565
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,210
I didn't mean that, Ling Chen.

566
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:37,740
Shi Xiaochun.

567
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,860
You can't

568
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,140
dance the white swan in this state.

569
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,660
Mr. Lin is right.

570
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,740
You should focus on
female corps de ballet.

571
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:46,740
Ling Chen.

572
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,740
What makes you think
that you're superior

573
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,980
and can criticize my choices?

574
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,210
Listen.

575
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,450
Xiao Bu has a greater passion

576
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,540
for dancing than you.

577
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:03,540
Some things can't be done

578
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,410
with passion alone.

579
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,860
But nothing can be done without passion.

580
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,690
I'll prove myself right, Ling Chen.

581
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,420
[Female Dormitory]

582
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,540
(I didn't expect that Xiao Bu)

583
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,410
(would look so cool onstage.)

584
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,980
(How was it? Am I cool?)

585
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,930
(Not bad.)

586
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,090
(Can I take this as a subtle compliment)

587
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,170
(from my highness?)

588
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,860
(I'm so touched.)

589
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,210
(You're such a narcissist.)

590
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,050
(Did you know that joining an off-campus
performance without permission)

591
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,500
(is against the school rules?)

592
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,380
(I'm just there to support my friends,)

593
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,330
(it's not a performance.)

594
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,860
(If you're onstage,
that's a performance.)

595
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,330
(I'm helping Xiaochun to find her feel.)

596
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,140
(That's why I brought her there.)
