Let's play Truth or Dare.

Sure.

I'll play with you for a while.

Mr. Lin, do you prefer Truth or Dare?

I choose Truth.

Let me ask!

40
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,680
Mr. Lin,

41
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,360
why did you suddenly wear a suit

42
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,190
to class yesterday?

43
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,000
Did you go on a blind date?

44
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,190
Please answer.

45
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,000
It was my wife's memorial day.

46
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,390
Yesterday was her birthday.

47
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,880
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin.

48
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,440
I have no idea about it.

49
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,320
It's nothing. It's been a long time.

50
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,630
Mr. Lin, I've never heard
you talk about your wife.

51
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,080
Can you tell us your love story?

52
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,880
Honestly,

53
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,440
my love and my marriage

54
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,360
are two different things, really.

55
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,000
There's nothing we can't talk about.

56
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,670
Me and my wife,

57
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,800
we are partners.

58

We're a perfect match.

59
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,670
During our time,
the Department of Ballet

60
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,270
recognized us as the best partners.

61
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,520
However,

62
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,600
I had a girlfriend at that time.

63
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,830
She was very pretty,

64
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,880
very talented,

65
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,440
and had a unique personality.

66
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,670
She only danced solo.

67
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,320
She never danced with others.

68
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,960
I noticed her when I was a freshman.

69
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,880
Then I encouraged myself to pursue her.

70
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,270
In dancing, the two of us

71
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,960
always competed with each other.

72
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,390
As the time passed,

73
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,110
we were inseparable from each other.

74
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,750
We ended up being together.

75
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,520
Our relationship was stable.

76
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,360
Before our graduation,

77
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,800
I planned to propose to her formally.

I'm just thinking about Mr. Lin's wife
sitting in a wheelchair.

131
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,230
She must be desperate.

132
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,830
She's far from her favourite stage.

133
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,440
The man who stayed by her side

134
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,670
has always deeply loved another woman.

135
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,760
A failure of a lift.

136
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,070
No one had ill intentions.

137
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,390
But she became the most innocent victim.

The barbecue is done.

139
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,440

140
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,070
All right.

141
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,390
I always thought this world
is filled with sunshine.

142
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,550
Even when we face some difficulties,

143
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,830
we just need to overcome them
with a positive mindset.

144
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,000
Listening to Mr. Lin's story, I realized

145
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,000
that some pains
are named pains for a reason.

146
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,720
It's because there's nothing
a person can do to change it.

147
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,950
Enduring the pain is the only way.

148
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,950
The girl Mr. Lin decided to give up,

149
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,510
she must have felt very helpless too.

150
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,880
Silly girl, these things
are all in the past.

151
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,670
Besides, we're not the ones involved.

152
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,320
It's not really our place to judge.

153
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,790
I've heard that

154
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,480
Mr. Lin

155
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,640
used to be very eager to try everything.

156
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,440
He's good at everything,
from street dancing to rock music.

157
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,790
But ever since his wife passed away,

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,550
he has turned
to a completely different person.

159
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,550
He has put all his energy into teaching.

160
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,160
And he always
talks about us, the students.

161
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,070
Perhaps there are some things

162
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,880
that simply have no right or wrong.

163
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,600
One more thing.

164
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,790
Instead, I think

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,230
this matter has gotten to you so much.

166
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,790
I think it's a good thing for you.

167
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,830
Why?

168
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,270
Think about it.

169
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,670
This proves that you, the little swan,

170
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,670
have a great ability to empathize.

171
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,600
You've never experienced
something like this yet,

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,000
Every year, we'd send students

it's too hard to learn dancing.

to be a preaching session.

it's more like communication.

In our academy,

What did they mean?

504
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,470
Is that what you sent them to do?

00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,430
No way. I asked them when they got back.

506

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,560
your department's performance.

512
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,230
Don't they know what that stage is for?

513
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,950
It's for assignment evaluations.

514
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
Dance quality aside,

515
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,310
they didn't communicate with the school

516
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,430
and made these invitations
without authorization.

517
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,590
In the future, if our school

518
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,880
encounters loss of reputation,

519
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
who'll be responsible for this?

520
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,880
Calm down.

521
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,760
I personally think it's a good thing.

522
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,110
The quality of the performance,

523
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,920
Ms. Yu and I guarantee it to be good.

524
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,070
Don't say you don't trust us.

525
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,400
This performance is innovative.

526
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,190
Then the audience can't be limited

527
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,590
to the few teachers in our department.

528
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,520
These kids,

529
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,040
they're meant to convey through dancing.

530
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,560
So that more people can see it.

531
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,920
To inspire more people.

532
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,400
Talking about the performance,

533
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,950
we'd like to book a theater.

534
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,680
Forget about the grand theater.

535
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,400
The Department of Chinese Dance
has recently rehearsed there.

536
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,560
The school has already booked
the theater for them.

537
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,430
Mr. Lin,

538
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,520
if this issue didn't happen,

539
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,800
I can still discuss this matter

540
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,640
with the school leadership.

541
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:07,520
Now,

542
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:08,800
no chance at all.

543
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,430
No way.

544
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,110
Sir.

545
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,760
No.

546
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,230
Sir.

547
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,830
Sir, hear me out!

548
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,190
I've told you everything.

549
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,110
It's been approved. We can't get it.

550
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,000
Besides, this is an experimental dance.

551
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,110
There might be a performance risk.

552
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,590
So where should my students perform?

553
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,710
It can't be the classroom.

554
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,190
That would be too informal.

555
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,070
It's kind of old,

556
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,110
but we'll make it happen.

557
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,760
Quickly come in.

558
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,590
- Enjoy your stage and theater.
- What's going on here?

559
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,350
I want to play in the new theater too.

560
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,590
This is an old theater.

561
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,470
It's been here
since the founding of the school.

562
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,520
Since we had Haicheng Dance theater,

563
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,520
we don't use it much anymore.

564
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,470
You're still new here.

565
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,640
It's okay not to know.

566
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,520
This stage is really small.

567
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,680
It doesn't matter.

568
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,160
Anyway, the audience

569
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,950
would be only the teachers
from our department.

570
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,680
So there's no problem.

571
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,190
Let me tell you.

572
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,400
This time it's different.

573
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,640
We need to get a new audience

574
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,230
to enjoy your performance.

575
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,350
You can invite your friends,

576
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,710
family members or even people
you don't even know.

577
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,680
As long as they love to dance,

578
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,640
they can be your loyal audience.

579
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,110
It's true that we can attract
our own audience.

580
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,640
Are we really going to perform here?

581
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,400
Are the facilities new?

582
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,560
Mr. Lin.

583
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,560
Shouldn't we give feedback
to the school?

584
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,070
You don't have to worry about this.

585
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,280
The school will send someone
to upgrade our equipment.

586
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,350
This was considered a top-tier
back in my days.

587
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,520
It witnessed

588
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,560
numerous glorious moments of our school.

589
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,160
Come on, kids.

590
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,800
We're gonna make something new.

591
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,800
There'll be unexpected difficulties.

592
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,830
However, as a dancer,

593
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,920
we just have to make sure
the performance is good.

594
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,070
It's enough to be recognized
by the audience.

595
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,470
You guys should know this.

596
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,310
Back in the day,

597
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,040
when contemporary ballet
has just been introduced to China,

598
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,560
the audience didn't recognize it.

599
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,470
They couldn't understand the dance.

600
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,110
They felt it was meaningless.

601
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,520
But didn't our predecessors

602
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,000
persevered with the comments?

603
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,760
And now it's getting better and better.

604
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,520
So it doesn't matter where you dance.

605
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,590
The important thing is

606
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,040
us, the dancers.

607
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,470
Come on, kids.

608
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,710
Have faith.

609
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,000
Wherever we are,

610
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,000
that's where the stage is.

611
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,350
Good!

612
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,190
One, two, three.

613
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,310
Keep it up!

614
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,640
Okay, now let's clean up the theater.

615
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,470
Let's start!

616
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,520
Let's do it!

617
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,110
Go,

618
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,280
get the broom.

619
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,280
[Male Dormitory]

620
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,430
Do you have time to come see me dance
at the end of the month?

621
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,110
I'll see you at the end of the month.

622
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,640
I have a school performance coming up.

623
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,430
Invite some friends for me.

624
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,830
The more the better.

625
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,430
Okay, I'll see you at school.

626
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:08,800
Bye.

627
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,430
How's it going?

628
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,230
I've invited all the people

629
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,190
who like to watch dance performances.

630
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,590
I've also reached out to my friends.

631
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,230
This reformation is actually good.

632
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,640
My parents have been wanting
to come here for a long time.

633
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,710
They want to see me dance.

634
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,430
This time,

635
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,160
they can finally fulfill that wish.

636
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,950
Well, you need to do better than that.

637
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:33,830
Xiao Bu?

638
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,040
Hello, brothers.

639
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:36,680
Hello.

640
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,830
Long time no see.

641
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,560
How's it going? Are you free today?

642
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,110
I finished rehearsal early.

643
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,110
What are you guys doing?

644
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
Busy mobilizing the audience
for the final performance.

645
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,280
What do you mean?

646
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,560
Our final assignment.

647
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,560
Is it going to be open to the public?

648
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,280
Yeah.

649
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,560
For the sake of this reformation,

650
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,590
Mr. Lin has ordered us

651
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,040
to invite more people

652
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,560
to feel the power of this stage.

653
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,880
That's right, Xiao Bu.

654
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,640
Actually, you can also invite

655
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,520
people who like to watch your show
to come and watch you dance.

656
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,430
Alright, during my recording tomorrow,

657
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,310
I'll tell the audience about it.

658
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,040
Good.

659
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,470
Good luck with your competition.

660
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:12,680
Bye.

661
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,280
Bye.

662
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,920
Bye.

663
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,000
Let's try to invite more.

664
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,400
Okay.

665
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,880
(Did you get me the painkillers?)

666
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,560
I've got a performance coming up.

667
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,520
Can you invite more friends for me?

668
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,430
Alright.

669
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,230
(Got it. I'll give it to you tomorrow.)
