it must not be like calisthenics.

00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,060
Please excuse me. I have to practice.

337
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:24,580
Sure.

338
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,580
You carry on.

339
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,030
Why are you not leaving yet?

340
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,150
You performed this move gracefully,

341
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,630
I want to know if you have any secrets.

342
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,270
Do you really want to know the secret?

343
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,460
In fact, I couldn't do this move well.

344
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,870
It's due to a lack of abdominal strength.

345
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,750
Then I practiced crunches like crazy,

346
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,940
and it became very easy.

347
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,630
Are crunches helpful for this move?

348
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,550
Of course it works,

349
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,060
but you have to do more and harder
to be effective.

350
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,550
Then how did you practice before?
Teach me, please.

351
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,910

352
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,460
I've never told anyone about this.

00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,550

354

Alright.

But you must never tell others.

360
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,820
That's fifty sets of crunches every day,

361
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,270
sixty a set.

362
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,910
You will see the results

363

after ten days of doing it.

Do you think it's that simple
to get a move well?

367
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,670
Anyway, I've told you the training plan,
