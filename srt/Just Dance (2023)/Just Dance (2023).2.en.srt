00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,170
Shi Xiaochun
is lacking in her basic skills.

176

for 30 seconds first,

339
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,610
You can do this solo dance
for the Freshmen Performance.

340
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,970
But you still need to work more
on some movements

341
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,930
to refine them.

342
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,530
Alright.

343
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,410
Thank you, Ms. Yu.

344
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,850
On that note, why didn't you

345
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,090
discuss with Ling Chen
to work on a pas de deux?

346
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,770
I have mentioned it to him.

347
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,610
I was thinking of doing "Carmen"

348
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,330
for the Freshmen Performance.

349
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,450
I'm sure it will be amazing.

350
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,130
But he doesn't seem to be
in a good condition lately.

351
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,330
It's like he resists dancing.

352
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,690
I'll try talking to him.

353
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,090
(That's my "Carmen".)

Don't bother them.

357
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,170
I was pretty good, wasn't I?

358
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,850
Do you admit that I'm good now?

359
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,810
You're still not good enough

360
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,370
to challenge me with those poor skills of yours.

361
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,090
Practice your basics first.

What do you think of Shi Xiaochun?

373
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,450
She is a piece of raw jade

374
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,570
that still needs to be polished.

375
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,970
I want her to partner with Ling Chen

376

for the Freshmen Performance.

What's the matter?

378
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,330
Why do you suddenly want
to change partners for Ling Chen?

379
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,010
A new environment calls for a change.

380
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,530
The kids are still young.

381
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,850
They don't necessarily
have to fix a partner right now.

382
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,690
Ling Chen has traveled around

383
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,730
to perform with me
since he was a young kid.

384
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,410
Everyone is tired of watching him

385
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,690
pairing up with Yu Manman.

386
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,970
Think of it as a change for the audiences.

387
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,210
I get it.

388
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,810
Ling Chen

389
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,930
hasn't been himself
while dancing lately. Am I right?

390
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,010
Shi Xiaochun has what Ling Chen lacks.

391
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,530
It is passion. The passion for dance.

392
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,770
You are hoping that Ling Chen can find

393
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,730
his passion for dance
through Shi Xiaochun. Am I right?

394
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,210
Ling Chen can also help Shi Xiaochun.

395
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,850
It's a win-win. Don't you get it?

396
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,930
I didn't say it wasn't. Relax.

397
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,890
Help me

398
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,490
talk to Shi Xiaochun about this.

399
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,530
What's in it for me?

400
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,210
How dare you negotiate with me?

401
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,170
A full Chinese calligraphy set

402
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,970
and a brush holder. No more.

403
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,330
Deal!

404
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,530

405
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,530
Getting chosen for the Freshmen Performance
is a good thing.

406
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,090
On top of that,
you get to partner with Ling Chen.

407
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,210
Why do you seem unhappy about it?

408
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,290
Little Peacock.

409
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,290
Are you afraid
that you can't handle this important task

410
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,410
and will embarrass yourself?

411
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,610
Keep quiet if you don't have nice things to say.

412
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,450
Eat your skewers.

413
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,410
Can you be more gentle?

414
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,730
- Have some.
- What's up with Hong?

415
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,330
She didn't reply to my messages.

416
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,530
Hong?

417
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,170
She disappeared as soon as class ended.

418
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,650
I don't know where she went.

419
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,890
Hey, dad.

420
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,730
Hey, Rascal. I miss you.
What are you doing?

421
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,450
I'm having skewers with my friends.

422
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,410
Skewers?

423
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,170
Getting along with your peers.

424
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,450
Is everything going well?

425
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,330
Yes.

426
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,490
I even got chosen
to be in the Freshmen Performance.

427
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,850
Way to go! That's my good girl.

428
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,330
How's the preparation?

429
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,130
When is the performance?

430
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,170
It's okay, I guess.

431
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,170
I'm not sure.

432
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,730
You silly pumpkin.

433
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,090
A clever peacock will work hard
to spread its feathers

434
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,250
so that others can notice their beauty.

435
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,090
Since the teacher has chosen you,

436
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,250
that means they have noticed your potential.

437
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,490
Practice hard.

438
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,090
Don't let them down.

439
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,610
Don't worry, Dad.

440
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,650
I will become your pride.

441
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,690
Great. I have faith in you.

442
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:30,730
You got this!

443
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,570
Okay.

444
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,730
Get back to your work.

445
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,290
Bye-bye!

446
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,490
Was it your dad?

447
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,490
I miss home.

448
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,610
Little Peacock, have some confidence.

449
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,090
Even though Ling Chen dances
with a lot of skills,

450
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,410
he's too typical.

451
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,650
He's just like...

452
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,130
He is like a dancing robot with no emotions.

453
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,450
But you're different.

454
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,210
You are a living ballet mascot.

455
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,730
Dance well. Don't let him bully you.

456
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,170
Are you sure you were complimenting me?

457
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:03,650
Hong.

458
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,410
Hong is here.

459
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,410
You three ate first

460
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,890
without waiting for me.

461
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,010
You finally made it.

462
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,050
Pan Pan will finish the skewers
if you get here any later.

463
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,410
No, I wasn't.

464
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,330
Good-for-nothing League's first meeting
in school can't be held without me.

465
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,530
Come on. Cheers!

466
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,850
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

467
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,610
What's the matter?

468
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,810
I have signed you up
for the Freshmen Performance

469
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,730
to perform "Carmen".

470
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:41,730
I don't want to.

471
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,410
You will be partnering with Shi Xiaochun.

472
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,370
What?

473
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,050
She doesn't even have basic skills.

474
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,250
You are letting her perform?

475
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,690
She doesn't have a solid foundation.

476
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,890
That's because

477
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,370
she didn't have proper training as a child.

478
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,210
But she has passion for dance.

479
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,850
If you can partner up with her,

480
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,170
I'm sure she can inspire you to dance.

481
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,610
Can you please stop

482
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,050
using people as a tool?

483
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,610
I didn't come here to discuss this with you.

484
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,170
I understand that you feel lost.

485
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,130
But you can't lock yourself up again.

486
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,650
You must snap out of it now.

487
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,290
I have put your name in.

488
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,850
Whether you want it or not,

489
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,130
you still have to dance.

490
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,210
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

491
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,970
I'm fine. Let's try it again.

492
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,770
Okay. Three, two, one.

493
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,370
Are you okay?

494
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,330
How about this?

495
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,090
Let's make some changes to this movement.

496
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:29,850
No.

497
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,690
We mustn't change the rules
just because of

498
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,610
my incompetence.

499
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,850
Isn't it always that way for you?

500
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,530
Let's try it again.

501
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,490
Are you sure?

502
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,730
Okay.

503
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,500
One, two, three!

I have.

00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,410
Where is it?

542
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,130
- The trashcan.
- Trashcan?

543
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,010
You threw it away?

544
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,650
You didn't keep it or wring it dry.

Why do you want to keep this junk?
For New Year?

548
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,930
Still, you didn't have to throw it away.

549
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,410
You could have told me.

550

Told you?

551
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,210
You took my spot
for the Freshmen Performance.

552

You took my spot beside Ling Chen.

553
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,450
Did you tell me?

554
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,690
Ling Chen and I grew up together.

555

We were deemed the perfect partners.

Yu Manman.

559

Don't be rude.

560
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,370
It was Ms. Yu and Mr. Lin's decision

561
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,250
to partner Ling Chen with Xiaochun.

562
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,810
If you don't like it, take it up with them.

563
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,450
It's okay. It's not your fault.

564

Come on. Let's go somewhere to relax.

565

568
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,250
Why did you want Ling Chen
to do "Carmen" with Xiaochun?

569
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,970
I'm supposed to be his partner.

570
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,970
Manman, calm down.

571
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,610
I have my reasons.

572
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,610
You and Ling Chen

573
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,570
have been partners for a long time.

574
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,410
But switching partners once in a while

575
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,890
might bring you surprises.

576
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,050
But I did

577
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,810
all the previous pas de deux with Ling Chen.

578
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,330
Ling Chen has agreed to it.

579
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,530
He did?

580
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:03,610
Yes.

581
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,330
Your previous show
also happened to be a solo.

582
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,010
I have already slotted you in.

583
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,370
It won't affect your performance.

584
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,770
Hi, Boss!

585
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,610
Hello.

586
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,050

587
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,740

Do you come here often?

591
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,210
This is where I usually work part-time.

592
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,290
I usually come here after class.

593
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,330
I normally perform here too.

594
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,770
Perform?

595
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,810
The people here love music and dance.

596
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,610
You've been so stressed lately.

597
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,610
So I brought you here to relax. Come on!

598
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,000
Zhang Bo, settle the bill!

599
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,490
So? Do you feel more relaxed now?

600
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,810
That was so relaxing.

601
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,850
I've gotten rid of all my unhappy thoughts.

Hong.

603
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,330
I've realized that ballroom dancing
really exercises your waist.

604
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,490
Ballroom dancing

605
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,010
isn't like ballet

606
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,050
where it's always very structured.

607
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,490
A lot about it is improvised and free.

608
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,210
That's why I like ballroom dancing.

609
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,370
Hong.

610
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,650
Whenever you come here to work next time,

611
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,690
I'll come and dance with you.

612
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,450
This way, I can learn ballroom dancing

613
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,490
and train my waist.

614
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,330
Sure.
