Candidates who are late for more than
30 minutes are banned from the audition.

672
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,350
You're the assistant.

673
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,830
Do you not know the rules?

674
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,190
I've already messaged Mr. Huang.

675
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,390
He knows about this.

676
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,630
Besides, according to the academy rules,

677
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,350
if the candidates report an emergency

678
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,470
before the end of the audition,

679
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,830
auditioners must allow
the candidates to complete the audition.

680
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,590
I'd like to implore you again.

681
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,270
Please allow Shi Xiaochun
to attend the audition.

682
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,590
Since you've already reported
to Mr. Huang,

683
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,390
we should give her an audition.

684
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,390
Ms. Yu

685
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,870
cherishes talents very much.

686
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,510
It's too bad

687
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,230
if we miss out on a good student,
am I right?

688
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,510
Ms. Yu.

689
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,190
The principle of our student recruitment

690
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,790
is to provide them

691
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,350
with the best audition service
and environment.

692
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,590
Since she has made it here
at the last minute,

693
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,470
we should give her a chance.

694
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:49,870
All right.

695
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,590
Shi Xiaochun.

696
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,070
Don't waste this opportunity

697
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,550
they claimed for you.

698
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,990
Act now, Shi Xiaochun.

699
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,390
Get ready.

700
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,730
Okay.

701
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:02,950
Good luck.

702
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:18,090
[Audition piece:
Riverdance (Foreign folk music)]

703
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,190
(I think dancing)

704
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,750
(is the happiest joy in life.)

705
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,030
(My father failed to achieve his dream
back then.)

706
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,950
(I want to make it happen for him.)

707
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,710
All right, that's all for the audition.

708
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,630
You may leave.

709
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,390
Oh, right.

710
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,950
Thank you for your help.

711
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,150
If it wasn't for you,

712
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,510
I would've missed the audition.

713
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,750
Let's exchange our WeChat contacts.

714
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,990
I'll send you the passport
once I come back.

715
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,910
I'm leaving, then.
