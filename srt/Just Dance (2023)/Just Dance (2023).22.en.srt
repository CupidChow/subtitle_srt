Do you think I'm being naive?

23
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,820
I've gotten a little bit ahead
of myself in the preliminary round.

On the stage, your determination

It just happened that in this round,

00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,860
the contestants
from San Francisco and Russia

00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,140
chose songs that better aligned
with the judges' expectations.

36
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,780
Given the current situation,

37

To overcome that problem,

43
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,310
I would envision my acceptance speech.

44
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,140
I imagined what it would be like to win.

45
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,550

00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,820
How is your leg?

171
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:42,910
I'm fine.

172
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:46,540
Sir,

173
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,100
what happened?

174
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,230
Come and sit here.

175
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:49,910
I can't right now.

176
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,420
The female model you're partnering with.

177
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,590
I couldn't get in touch with her.

178
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,380
She didn't even answer my call.

179
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,790
Will this affect Xiao Bu's shooting?

180
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,510
Of course.

181
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,140
If we can't find someone,
today's shooting will be canceled.

182
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,230
What kind of female model
you're looking for?

183
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,260
Do you think I can replace the model?

184
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,070
We've got a ready-made
beautiful young lady right here!

185
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,070
Xiao Bu, is she your assistant?

186
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:12,860
No, she is not.

187
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,100
Do me a favor.

188
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,380
Let her replace the model for today.

189
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,820
I can't do it.

190
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,860
She has a broken leg.

191
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,660
Let me try.

192
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,070
You can't get your work delayed.

193
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,510
Deal.

194
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:23,420
Thank you very much!

195
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:24,540
I appreciate it.

196
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:25,860
Director!

197
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,350
Why am I more nervous than you?

198
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,500
How about this?

199
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,870
I'll teach you
the three elements of acting.

200
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,670
Listen, watch and feel.

201
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:44,550
Got it?

202
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,060
Come on.

203
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,820
Every department please prepare.

204
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,380
Okay.

205
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,790
Coming.

206
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,470
Remember what I told you.

207
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,940
Turn on the camera!

208
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,620
Three, two, one.

209
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,500
Action!

210
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,260
[Recording]

211
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,910
I believe that the current executives

212
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,470
are either engaging in internal conflicts

213
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,910
or have poor decision-making abilities.

214
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,260
They're completely unqualified.

215
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,140
I suggest firing them immediately.

216
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,300
Xiao Bu, your turn!

217
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:11,550
You're right.

218
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:12,820
Tell me your opinion.

219
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,590
I meant, including you.

220
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,380
You can fire your boss
just by drinking Dazzle Drink!

221
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,620
Cut!

222
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:22,870
Pass!

223
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,350
That's great.

224
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,260
I was thinking to teach you to act.

225
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,670
I didn't realize you were so natural.

226
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,670
Being mean to you was easy.

227
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,790
I didn't need to act for that.

228
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,380
I see...

229
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,260
Xiao Bu.

230
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,260
Director.

231
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,790
Your little assistant here

232
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,470
is great.

233
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,230
I heard she's from the dance academy too.

234
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:43,550
Yes.

235
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,470
She's my classmate.

236
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,060
She is great.

237
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,470
I'll ask her to work with me again
on my next project.

238
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,910
Thank you very much, Director.

239
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,550
This little girl looks great.

240
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,940
It's a shame you're not an artist.

241
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,500
I agree.

242
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,740
It's a shame she's not an artist.

243
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,350
She acted well.

244
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,230
Bye, Director.

245
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,180
Why did you say that?

246
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,790
What did I say?

247
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,820
The director said
he'd work with me next time.

248
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,670
And you said yes.

249
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,260
Yeah. What's wrong?

250
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,620
About that...

251
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,910
I was just saying.

252
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,870
Actually, if you could
change your careers.

253
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,550
I think that's not bad.

254
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,030
I'm tired. I'm going to change.

255
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,030
Manman!

256
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,790
I shouldn't have mentioned that!

257
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,990
Manman, wait!

258
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,700
I'll take a cab.

259
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,350
Let me drop you off.

260
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,430
I know I always messed things up.

261
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,590
I didn't mean to hurt you.

262
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,110
You're right.

263
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,740
I can't dance anymore.

264
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,350
What's wrong with finding another path?

265
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,350
I...

266
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,180
I didn't mean that.

267
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,300
What I meant is...

268
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,140
I think that even if you can't dance...

269
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:55,740
I...

270
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,030
I was trying to say...

271
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,380
I think that even if
you can't dance anymore,

272
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,180
you should live a better life!

273
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,820
- You still have many possibilities.
- Let's go.

274
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,030
You have your friends and family.

275
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,820
You may have found true love.

276
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,350
For instance...

277
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,060
Me...

278
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,180
Stop.

279
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,060
Xiaochun.

280
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,550
If you keep dancing with this state,

281
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,910
we're not going to make it
to the finals.

282
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,230
What do you think?

283
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,030
I know you've worked very hard
for this competition.

284
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,670
I want to do my best too.

285
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,110
But I think this dance right now,

286
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,740
the adaptation has gone too far.

287
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,430
I understand what you're saying.

288
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,500
But we're up against
a very strong opponent.

289
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,030
How can we beat them
without making it harder?

290
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,180
But I think,

291
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,260
it's no better than the previous dance.

292
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,230
Mr. Lin, the dance for the finals,

293
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,590
I've been trying really hard
to get used to it.

294
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,670
But the result is still not great.

295
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,350
Maybe I have poor ability.

296
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,870
I can't meet your expectations.

297
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,870
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin.

298
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,110
I disappointed you.

299
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,140
It's okay.

300
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,260
That's it for today.

301
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,670
I appreciate your feedback.

302
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,590
Thank you for your honesty.

303
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,030
It's my problem
if we can't solve this issue.

304
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,230
You mustn't blame yourself.

305
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,550
You're the best student I've ever had.

306
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,620
There's nothing wrong with your ability.

307
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,990
I should go back and think about it.

308
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,870
I should think of the solutions.

309
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,900
[Summary of San Francisco Dance Academy]

310
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,740
Xiaochun?

311
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,550
What are you doing here?

312
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,700
Why did you leave class so early today?

313
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,230
Mr. Lin ended the class early today.

314
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,870
I was thinking

315
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,910
to take you to dinner after your class.

316
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,670
I'm not in the mood for dinner.

317
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,550
What's the matter?

318
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,180
It's about the final dance performance.

319
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,990
I'm having a hard time with it.

320
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,470
I just couldn't hold back.

321
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,300
I told Mr. Lin what I was thinking.

322
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,380
I don't think it is wrong.
Just say what you have to say.

323
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,590
That's the Xiaochun I know.

324
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,180
Honest and straightforward.

325
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,110
Let's not think about anything else.

326
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,230
I'll take you for a walk.

327
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,180
Next time. I want to go to the library.

328
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,820
I'll see if I can get some ideas.

329
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,500
Okay, I'll go with you.

330
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,740
I'm glad to have you by my side.

331
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:47,940
Don't worry.

332
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,140
I am always here for you.

Yu Manman, where have you been?

334
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,740
Tell me when you're going out.

335
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,910
I will take you there.

336
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,300
It's not safe for you to go out alone.

337
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,590
Nothing is dangerous out there.

338
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,470
I can walk.

00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,470
Oh, right, I can't dance now.

340
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,590
Am I useless to you now?

341
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,940
Nonsense.

342
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,990
You know what's going on.

343
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,180
You don't have to pretend
in front of me.

344
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,300
What do you mean?

345
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,820
Now you're blaming me.

346
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,380
You're the one who told me
to priorities the competition.

347
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,230
You asked Ms. Yu to give me
more training.

348
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,820
You're the one
who made the news trending, right?

349
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,350
Ms. Yu has resigned.

350
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,030
What else do you want?

351
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,180
Do you mean I forced her to resign?

352
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,030
She's had a lifetime of smooth sailing.

353
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,940
She has resigned. So what?

354
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,700
She's now teaching
in San Francisco Dance Academy.

355
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,500
You can't tell how happy she is!

356
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,820
I couldn't beat her during my school days.

357
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,910
My daughter couldn't even beat her son!

358
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,140
Ling Chen has been distracted.

359
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,470
You finally had a chance to catch up.

360
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,700
Look at you! She's ruined you!

361
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,620
Mom.

362
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,500
You hate me, don't you?

363
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,670
Because you're pregnant with me.

364
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,430
You had to give up your job
in the dance troupe.

365
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,790
This is why you've always pushed me
to accomplish things you couldn't do.

366
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,790
Do you know?

367
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,140
I've tried really, really hard.

368
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,940
For the sake of fulfilling your wish,

369
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,380
I've been spinning non-stop
like a spinner.

370
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,500
Non-stop!

371
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,470
Now I'm broken!

372
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,030
Yes. I'll never be able to dance again.

373
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,470
Does it mean
that I'm not your daughter anymore?

374
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,470
Manman...

375
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,300
Mr. Lin.

376
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,550
Mr. Lin!

377
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,110
What time is it?

378
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,300
It's seven o'clock in the morning.

379
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,940
How did I sleep here all night?

380
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,180
Ling Chen and I have come up
with an idea this morning.

381
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:40,700
What idea?

382
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:42,940
It's like this...

383
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,380
Last night,

384
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,990
we spent the night watching all the videos
of the previous competitions.

385
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,620
We watched a female contestant
from British in the year 2008.

386
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,030
During the finals,

387
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,620
she invited a partner to dance with her.

388
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,380
They danced a duet together.

389
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,140
They complemented each other.

390
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,740
This player was able to avoid
her weaknesses by doing so.

391
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,670
So I'm planning

392
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,740
to dance with Xiaochun in the finals.

393
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,630
That's a great idea.

394
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,820
You two haven't worked together
in a while.

395
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,150
Dancing together
in such a great competition

396
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,590
would make a nice memory.

397
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:12,390
Yes, it is.

398
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,270
After all, I can finally dance
with Xiaochun in this way.

399
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,990
We don't even know if there's a next time.

400
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,270
Why are you two grown men getting
so sentimental all of a sudden?

401
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,780
There'll be plenty of opportunities
in the future.

402
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:25,900
You're right.

403
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,470
I think so.

404
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,390
That's right.

405
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,940
This duet you two are performing,

406
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,780
do you have a theme for the dance?

407
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,470
The theme is our story.

408
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,270
Xiaochun, you can dance as the real you.

409
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,700
The real me?

410
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,230
Yeah.

411
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,180
Think about it.

412
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,390
When the two of us are together,

413
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,420
you'd feel relaxed and real.

414
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,750
I think you in that state,

415
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,870
is the most invincible version of you.

416
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,470
I want to get up there
and give you strength.

417
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,780
I hope you win.

418
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,660
I can't believe you thought of that.

419
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,590
That's great.

420
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,750
It doesn't matter
how creative or innovative you are.

421
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,180
The real you is indeed power.

422
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,060
Just show your inner self.

423
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,270
There won't be a problem then.

424
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,020
Thank you.

425
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,230
All right, this is our final decision.

426
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,630
I'll see you in the finals.

427
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,780
See you in the finals.

428
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,230
It's not easy to guide Ling Chen.

429
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,150
There's one more thing we need to do.

430
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,420
What is it?

431
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,390
Both of you are working together.

432
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,020
I can't handle you two on my own.

433
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,180
How about we invite your mom over?

434
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,060
Ling Chen.

435
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,060
You said you're going
to help Shi Xiaochun.

436
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,180
What about your entrance exam?

437
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:38,630
Mom,

438
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,820
it's not just about helping Shi Xiaochun.

439
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,510
I do it to help myself too.

440
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,020
What do you mean?

441
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,350
Think about it. This competition

442
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,020
is a rare opportunity for me.

443
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,590
The students
from the San Francisco Dance Academy,

444
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,390
I can compete with them on a fair basis.

445
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,180
Through this competition, I can also tell

446
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,510
if I'm good enough to go there or not.

447
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,780
You're leaving soon.

448
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,820
Did you tell Shi Xiaochun about this?

449
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,470
Not yet.

450
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,300
You two will be dancing as a duo soon.

451
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,540
I think you should tell her.

452
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,150
It's better for both of you.

453
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,660
Ms. Yu.

454
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,350
Ms. Yu.

455
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,300
Mr. Lin, I can't wait to work with you.

456
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,660
Me either.

457
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,820
Ms. Yu,

458
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,820
I'm glad to have you back to help us.

459
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,870
It's been a long time

460
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,510
since I last joined your training.

461
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,390
I miss you very much.

462
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,110
Although I'm not in this school anymore,

463
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,540
I'm still your teacher.

464
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,940
Don't try to get so close to me.

465
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,870
I got it.

466
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,590
This time,
I'd like to make three requests.

467
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,590
Okay, go ahead.

468
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,470
Firstly,

469
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,900
I want the right to adapt the dance.

470
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,900
I can adapt the dance moves as I wish.

471
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,660
No problem.

472
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,510
Secondly,

473
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,660
Your amount of training is inadequate.

474
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,300
You must train more.

475
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,300
At least twelve hours a day.

476
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:05,940
Deal.

477
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,110
The third request.

478
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,510
Before the finals,

479
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,990
please put all the distractions aside.

480
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,660
Completely obey me.

481
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,020
Ms. Yu, as long as you're willing to come,

482
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,470
we'll agree to anything.

483
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,870
Of course, I'll do my best.

484
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,900
I'll help you to present

485
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,060
the most perfect dance.

486
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:23,630
Sure.

487
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:23,900
Got it.

488
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,150
It's a deal then.

489
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,590
The two of you show me your dance now.

490
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,660
Miss.

491
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,780
Ling Chen is not good at ballet barre.

492
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,750
Let's practice that one first.

493
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,470
Okay. Warm up.

494
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,000
Okay.

495
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,010
Okay.

496
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,390
If Ling Chen
can't learn ballet barre well,

497
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,540
how about replacing it

498
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,870
with spiral roll from modern dance?

499
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,350
Sure, we'll listen to you.

500
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,750
We'll do whatever you say.

501
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,900
Ling Chen, we'll do as Ms. Yu said.

502
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,990
Replace the ballet barre with
the spin roll from modern dance.

503
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,180
Why modern dance?

504
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,020
Because...

505
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,510
Ling Chen is preparing

506
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,870
for the entrance exam
to the San Francisco Dance Academy.

507
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,270
He majors in modern dance.

508
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,660
Is he going abroad?

509
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,870
He asked me not to tell you yet.

510
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,300
Somehow,

511
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,900
I went through this too.

512
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,420
I know.

513
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,020
You value each other very much.

514
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,060
This matter is different.

515
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,870
If you keep avoiding it,

516
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,420
it will definitely intensify the conflict
between the two of you.

517
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,390
Therefore,

518
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,700
I must tell you.

519
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,230
Ling Chen,

520
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,660
you should tell Xiaochun about this.

521
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,270
Mr. Lin,

522
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,420
let the two of them talk for a while.

523
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:50,750
Sure.

524
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,750
Ling Chen,

525
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,020
why didn't you tell me
you're going abroad?

526
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,420
When are you going to tell me?

527
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,820
Or maybe...

528
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,150
You're not gonna say goodbye
until you're on the plane.

529
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,180
I didn't tell you because I didn't want
to spoil your competition.

530
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,630
Besides, this whole going abroad thing.

531
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,350
It is not a final decision yet.

532
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,060
Xiaochun.

533
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,180
I'm afraid in such a critical moment,

534
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:18,750
if I tell you this,

535
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,630
it'll definitely
affect your performance on stage.

536
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,270
Am I not reliable to you?

537
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,020
Or is it that...

538
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,060
You have no confidence

539
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,270
in our relationship at all.

540
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,940
Of course, I do!

541
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,940
I have faith in our relationship!

542
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,820
I've been trying to tell you too.

543
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,820
But I never expected

544
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,150
this competition to be so hard.

545
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:39,390
There's more.

546
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:39,870
Stop!

547
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,510
That's enough!

548
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,350
Stop saying that.

549
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,270
I didn't realize
there's a secret between us.

550
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,470
Tell me what I did wrong!

551
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,900
Now you're blaming me!

552
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,470
Look at our child now!

553
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,390
It's all your fault!

554
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,390
My fault?

555
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,510
Am I the one who hurt her?

556
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,750
Am I the one
who stopped her from dancing?

557
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:21,900
Didn't you make her do it?

558
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:22,870
What did you say?

559
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,230
Stop talking nonsense!

560
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,630
Enough.

561
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,270
I'm leaving.

562
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,230
Okay, stop for a minute.

563
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,180
I want you to know

564
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,780
that the beat in this part is too fast.

565
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,270
A spiral roll is uncontrollable.

566
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,630
If you can't do it, we should

567
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,820
consider changing to a simpler move.

568
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,630
We can't change it!

569
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,420
I'm sure Ling Chen can make this move!

570
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,660
He's just having a bad day.

571
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,510
It has nothing to do with him.

572
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,700
It's just that the move
you're asking him to do is hard.

573
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,350
Because you're asking for too little!

574
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,870
This is why Xiaochun
didn't do well in the semifinals!

575
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,300
I'm here to make a difference.

576
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,300
All right, Miss.

577
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,420
Stop arguing.

578
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,700
Ling Chen has been busy preparing
for going abroad lately.

579
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,390
After he is settled,

580
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,990
he'll have more time to train.

581
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,700
I'm sure he'll do fine with this move.

582
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:16,900
As you said.

583
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,350
I'll check on him again.

584
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,110
Let's smooth out the movement
a little more.

585
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:21,700
Let's do it again.

586
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,750
I have one last question.

587
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,750
Our dance is about the story
of two lovers.

588
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,110
Their story goes from loving each other

589
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,820
to having conflicts
and finally getting back together.

590
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,470
What's the ending?

591
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,350
Have you two thought about it?

592
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,020
This question...

593
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,750
Kind of fits the current situation.

594
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,470
Am I right?

595
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,700
I think we should just go with the flow.

596
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,020
Let the two of us

597
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,700
to walk towards our desired paths.

598
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,870
I bet two people
who really love each other

599
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,350
would be so carefree.

600
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,780
You're oversimplifying things.

601
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,630
Miss and Sir.

602
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,750
I think the ending

603
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,630
should be happily ever after.

604
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,940
If only reality were that harsh.

605
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,180
The stage at least

606
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,020
should have a better ending.

607
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,420
Am I right?

608
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,350
Shi Xiaochun.

609
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:13,350
Fine.

610
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,270
The ending part,

611
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,060
Ms. Yu and I will redesign it.

612
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,900
I have to warn you.

613
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,180
Both of you

614
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,350
are now comrades in arms.

615
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,350
If there's a problem,
you should talk about it.

616
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,630
I won't allow

617
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,870
you to bring your emotions to the stage.

618
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,590
Got it.

619
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,990
Understood.

620
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,150
Alright.

621
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,060
Ms. Yu and I will work on the ending.

622
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,060
You two think about what I said.

623
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,110
Bye, Sir.

624
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,180
I think that's it.

625
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,420
Let's continue our training tomorrow.

626
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,150
Wait!

627
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,750
Do you really want the ending
to be an open ending?

628
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,020
Do you care that much about my answer?

629
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,900
What else?

630
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,350
How did your interview go?

631
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,270
The results are out today.

632
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:13,110
Well, good luck.

633
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,230
[Dear Ling:]

634
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,630
(We're very pleased to inform you.)

635
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,990
(You've passed our interview.)

636
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,420
(You grew up learning classical ballet.)

637
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,510
(We know it means a lot to you.)

638
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,630
(Between classical
and contemporary ballet,)

639
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,940
(have you made your choice yet?)

640
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,060
(We recognized your strength.)

641
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,150
(Please decide before the enrollment.)

642
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,870
(The choice is yours.)

643
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,750
Goodbye, Liang Liang.

644
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,180
Bye, Miss.

645
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:55,900
Bye bye.

646
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,510
Bye.

647
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,470
- Bye.
- See you again.

648
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,750
Let's go home for dinner.

649
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,180
Xiaochun?

650
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,390
What brings you here?

651
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,780
Ling Chen's results
from the San Francisco Dance Academy

652
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,900
will be announced today.

653
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,350
I'm sure he'll get it.

654
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,900
I thought you said you didn't care
about your grades.

655
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,350
You're still upset, aren't you?

656
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,870
Yes, I am.

657
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,990
I'm so confused.

658
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,660
I really hope he passes the interview.

659
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,700
Somehow...

660
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,020
Deep inside, I couldn't stop thinking

661
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:35,510
it'd have been nice if he failed too.

662
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,350
I guess I've been
pushing myself all along.

663
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,300
In fact, in my head,

664
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,630
I know I can't let him go.

665
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,420
But I don't want to be a burden to him.

666
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,900
I want him to make choices
without the burden.

667
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,350
It's been a really hard time for me.

668
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,820
I don't know who else can I talk to.

669
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,150
You're the only one
who came up in my mind.

670
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,940
It's fine.

671
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,230
This kind of matter,

672
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,590
it's good to talk about it.

673
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,270
It'll pass.

674
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:06,940
Xiaochun.

675
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,350
Ling Chen?

676
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,940
Why are you here?

677
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,300
What is the result?

678
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,060
I passed the interview.

679
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,700
But the examiner

680
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,630
wants me to reconsider.

681
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,780
He thinks I'm more suited
to classical ballet.

682
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,300
After all, the San Francisco Dance Academy

683
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,180
is a place to study contemporary ballet.

684
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,780
Classical ballet is your root.

685
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,270
Contemporary ballet

686
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,700
has given you new inspiration and passion.

687
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,020
It's really hard to choose
between these two.

688
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,510
If you want me to stay,

689
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,510
I would stay for you.

690
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,390
No!

691
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,150
I just hope that your choice

692
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,510
is motivated by your plans
for dancing and your future.

693
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,470
And not because of me.

694
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,420
I don't want to be a burden to you.

695
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:53,820
Xiaochun.

696
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,630
You're not the one holding me back.

697
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,180
I have also included you
in my plans for the future.

698
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,870
It's just...

699
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,630
It's just that if I leave...

700
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,110
It'd be four years.

701
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,020
Are you willing to wait for me?

702
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,630
I'm not sure.

703
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,510
I haven't made up my mind yet.

704
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:15,750
Little Peacock...

705
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,510
Give her some time.

706
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,940
Can't you see she is sad?

707
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:19,780
Jiaoyang...

708
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,540
It's okay.

709
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,540
Let's give each other some more time.

710
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,900
We shall think about it.

711
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,420
I'm leaving.

712
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,540
Xiaochun!

713
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,110

714
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,870
Xiaochun!

715
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,510
Xiaochun, wait for me!

716

Are the lights ready?

717
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,050
Makeup artists, please check
on the costumes of the contestants.

718
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,540
Come on, everyone, pay attention.

719
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,300
Tonight is the finals.

720

You can't go in!

- Lights!
- What are you doing here?

741
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,020
Manman's gone again.

742
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,630
What?

743
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,150
She went out early this morning.

744
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,630
She hasn't come back yet.

745
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,660
She took everything related to dancing

746
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,510
and put them away.

747
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,940
Her father and I are going crazy.

748
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,510
I'm worried that she's going
to do something stupid.

749

Don't worry.

Miss, please go out.

You're not allowed to come in.

Look over there.

760
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,900
- Is someone there?
- Someone is sitting there.

761
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,900
- Yeah, that's too dangerous!
- That's dangerous!

- What's going on?
- On the roof!

763

- That's dangerous.
- Why is she sitting there?

764

Look!

Come down!

Can somebody do something?

771

Call someone.

It's too dangerous!

773
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,800
It's too dangerous up there!

774
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:20,910
Should we call the police?

775
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,630
Anyone know her?

776
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,470
Can somebody call the police?

777
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,890

Someone knows her.

779
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,730
Go talk to her!

780
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:27,790
I don't know her.

Me either.

782
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,810
Find someone from her class.

00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,590
