1
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,375
What's the fuss?

2
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,625
Didn't you like it in the first place?

3
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:43,750
It hurts exactly
because it's someone you like.

4
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,750
He just admitted it!

5
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:48,100
No!

6
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,875
Let the world know what you like.

7
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:50,625
I beg you!

8
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,375
No!

9
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:25,242
Just because I like someone,

10
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,000
I got raped four times a night.

11
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,250
( Mother )

12
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,250
I am eligible to die.

13
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,500
( Sister )

14
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:36,250
( Mother )

15
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,875
Before I tell this story,

16
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:32,500
let me briefly introduce my friend, Liang.

17
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,500
I knew him for three years, in Shanghai.

18
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,125
We're good buddies.

19
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:41,367
He's raised by his grandma

20
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,500
but he's not been healthy in particular.

21
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,375
The year before I acted
in the film “Adonis”.

22
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,750
He just turned thirty.

23
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,125
I mentioned to him that

24
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:58,250
he could be my assistant during shooting.

25
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,500
And he's excited about it

26
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,250
so we decided right away

27
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,625
and went for visa applications.

28
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,750
We planned everything.

29
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,625
However, the week before our trip,

30
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:15,250
Liang caught a cold in a rain or something.

31
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,000
He became too sick to even get out of bed.

32
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,375
The departure date was approaching.

33
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,000
Liang's still very ill

34
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,250
so I said let's forget about it this time.

35
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,625
You take good rest first.
I can handle it alone.

36
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,625
Then I left.

37
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:38,625
The filming in Taiwan went smoothly.

38
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:46,375
Until the moment I travelled to Taipei
to do mold making.

39
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:52,875
I suddenly felt very unwell.

40
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:57,867
I was in a trance and exhausted.

41
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,750
Since I had to be standing

42
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,625
all the way

43
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:06,625
to make an exact copy of my whole body.

44
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,500
It took hours while I could hardly stand

45
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,000
and I collapsed in the studio.

46
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,725
The crew rushed me to the hospital.

47
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:22,195
The doctor said my symptom
was just like that of a flu.

48
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,850
An injection and some pills and that's it.

49
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,898
So I went with Scud to
the Torino Film Festival.

50
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,750
But soon after my arrival,

51
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,250
I had a fever again.

52
00:09:34,734 --> 00:09:38,725
I felt drowsy to begin with

53
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,523
thought it was a jet-lag.

54
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:42,812
I told Scud I really want a nap.

55
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:45,554
Then he said you just take a rest.

56
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:48,375
Don't worry about the events.

57
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,382
He could attend the screening.

58
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:51,500
So I fell asleep.

59
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,500
I lost consciousness.

60
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,500
The moment I woke up,

61
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,779
Scud looked perplexed.

62
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:01,875
I said why? I just took a nap.

63
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,125
He said you have slept
for two days straight!

64
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,031
Was it too painful for you?

65
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,437
This is making my work easy

66
00:10:51,462 --> 00:10:53,351
but I wonder how long it can last.

67
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:09,101
Let's call it the day. I am tired.

68
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,375
Hey, wake up.

69
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:13,796
Hey.

70
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,125
Hey.

71
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,125
Hey!

72
00:11:22,577 --> 00:11:23,203
Hey!

73
00:11:23,937 --> 00:11:24,687
Hey!

74
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,875
Don't fool me.

75
00:11:26,343 --> 00:11:27,343
Don't scare me!

76
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,500
Please…

77
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,718
Hello, body shop.

78
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,203
Joe.

79
00:12:01,976 --> 00:12:02,601
Joe.

80
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,000
New business. Fresh meat.

81
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:13,625
Turn the ignition.

82
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:16,125
Foot on the brake pedal first.

83
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,875
Now release it gradually.

84
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,234
Press the park button again.

85
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:30,759
Release it.

86
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:36,367
Turn more, more, further.

87
00:12:43,406 --> 00:12:44,453
Bro Simon.

88
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:45,750
What's up?

89
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You're aware of my skill level.

90
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,906
Aren't you afraid that there
would be 3 bodies in this car?

91
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:52,500
What nonsense!

92
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,500
One way or another, sooner or later.

93
00:12:55,703 --> 00:12:59,125
Dying in my good hands is your last luck.

94
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,250
This business of ours, may not last long.

95
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,500
Sooner or later, until the last day.

96
00:13:09,883 --> 00:13:13,758
We are contributing to the earth
everyday though.

97
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:14,975
How noble

98
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
a grand funeral for your great efforts?

99
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,875
You know I don't care about that.

100
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:19,875
Bro Simon.

101
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,750
Come on, spit it out.

102
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,875
I am an orphan.

103
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,875
In case I died...

104
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Hey, come on.

105
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:34,664
How can you foretell your
ending to the audience?

106
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:36,875
Audience?

107
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,250
At least someone up there is watching.

108
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,031
There's a ghost audience here.

109
00:13:46,056 --> 00:13:49,593
A hanged ghost.

110
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,326
I committed suicide

111
00:13:54,351 --> 00:13:56,875
so I became a wandering ghost.

112
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,500
And then...

113
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,000
I found my power to possess.

114
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,375
Especially hosts with weak wills.

115
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,500
My first destination was Japan.

116
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:30,725
I ran into my idol
who came for film promotion.

117
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,125
Adonis.

118
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,000
My luck came after death.

119
00:14:47,523 --> 00:14:50,250
Then he took me to Spain.

120
00:15:57,305 --> 00:15:58,788
OK, that's it.

121
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:00,273
Thank you Erik, you're the best.

122
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,303
I look good.

123
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:04,243
You're welcome, enjoy your party.

124
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:07,340
I wish you can enjoy it too.
I want to visit my friends,

125
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:09,755
they keep asking me
about my Asian hair stylist.

126
00:16:11,378 --> 00:16:14,938
Hey, come on, let's go, it's been
six months already.

127
00:16:15,376 --> 00:16:17,223
You need to find a new one to love you.

128
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,388
Hey, where do you live now?

129
00:16:22,413 --> 00:16:24,393
I'm staying with my friend.

130
00:16:26,437 --> 00:16:27,390
In his house.

131
00:16:27,414 --> 00:16:29,312
- Oh, OK.
- Until...

132
00:16:30,477 --> 00:16:31,570
I see.

133
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:35,242
Thank you Erik, so much for this.

134
00:16:37,336 --> 00:16:39,695
By the way, I will let you
know when I finish my work.

135
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:40,429
OK.

136
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:41,273
See you.

137
00:16:41,297 --> 00:16:42,914
- Bye bye.
- See you, bye bye.

138
00:16:49,523 --> 00:16:51,217
Okay, bye.

139
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:52,117
Thank you.

140
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:53,866
See you next time.

141
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:17,805
Hey.

142
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:20,216
You live at my next door, right?

143
00:18:20,985 --> 00:18:22,571
Your first time here.

144
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:25,322
Let me take care of you.

145
00:18:27,618 --> 00:18:28,992
Do you dance?

146
00:18:29,036 --> 00:18:30,614
Let's go.

147
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:49,157
I must be possessed by a ghost.

148
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:19,274
Ow.

149
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:21,813
Why so fluid?

150
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:33,821
Thank you.

151
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,852
Are you serious?

152
00:21:46,445 --> 00:21:47,445
I am Erik.

153
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,125
What's your name?

154
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,125
Touya?

155
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,625
Nice to meet you.

156
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:04,149
I know every handsome guy in Barcelona.

157
00:22:05,196 --> 00:22:09,094
Everyone is a tourist here by nature.

158
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:15,469
Erik.

159
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,875
It's my sheer luck
and pleasure to meet you.

160
00:22:20,524 --> 00:22:21,225
Wow.

161
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,297
Very good your Spanish.

162
00:22:24,352 --> 00:22:25,625
Thank you.

163
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,586
Bravo.

164
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:37,375
I kept asking about Liang
when I was abroad.

165
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,000
Whether he's still sick or gotten better.

166
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,375
To my repetitive question,

167
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,000
his friend answered that

168
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,123
he's been quite well.

169
00:22:44,148 --> 00:22:45,625
Expecting your return.

170
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,625
He's just a bit weak.

171
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,960
Maybe his doctor kept his
mobile away from him.

172
00:22:49,985 --> 00:22:54,843
Let's go visit him together
when you're back.

173
00:22:54,868 --> 00:22:57,125
So I put it down somehow.

174
00:22:57,351 --> 00:23:00,163
Until I went back to Shanghai
right after the shooting.

175
00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:04,125
My first thing was asking to see them.

176
00:23:04,297 --> 00:23:05,850
His friend picked up the call.

177
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,125
I asked Liang's whereabout.

178
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:09,554
I was told
he returned to his origin in countryside.

179
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:11,350
I was puzzled

180
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,475
because the level of medical
treatments in Shanghai

181
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,250
must be far superior than his hometown.

182
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,500
Whatever happened to him,

183
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,132
he should have stayed in Shanghai.

184
00:23:18,476 --> 00:23:20,750
They just told me to forget about it.

185
00:23:21,335 --> 00:23:23,625
Let's have a dinner after all this time.

186
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:27,775
I refused to eat
without being told the truth.

187
00:23:28,023 --> 00:23:29,875
We did nothing in the restaurant
for a long while.

188
00:23:30,148 --> 00:23:31,023
Eventually...

189
00:23:31,562 --> 00:23:36,421
he knew there's no way to hide any longer.

190
00:23:37,046 --> 00:23:40,350
Then he told me that.

191
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,140
Liang's gone.

192
00:23:42,632 --> 00:23:45,007
My instant response was that

193
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:48,273
has he moved to his old home or what?

194
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:53,226
He said he's just...

195
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,250
gone.

196
00:23:55,906 --> 00:23:57,100
Then I...

197
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,975
the moment when I heard that

198
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,562
with many patrons around.

199
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,750
My tears kept running down.

200
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,882
I couldn't stay in the restaurant anymore.

201
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,975
So we went back to where Liang
and him used to live together.

202
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,117
He told me that Liang passed away
the first week I was in Taiwan.

203
00:24:22,273 --> 00:24:27,000
We recalled and confirmed that

204
00:24:27,025 --> 00:24:30,875
it's exactly the night
I was in the hospital.

205
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,500
I concluded afterwards that...

206
00:24:36,132 --> 00:24:40,156
maybe he's longing to see Taiwan so much.

207
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:42,125
Maybe he just...

208
00:24:42,867 --> 00:24:46,500
I wonder if you believe
this kind of thing or not?

209
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,375
But after the incident,

210
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,850
I really believed in that.

211
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:52,804
He did possess me

212
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:55,375
and went with me to Taiwan.

213
00:24:56,006 --> 00:24:57,975
And the day when I got sick in Italy.

214
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,929
It was exactly the 7th day after his death.

215
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,000
Right, the 7th day,

216
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,046
maybe he went with me to Italy as well.

217
00:25:10,757 --> 00:25:12,085
How do we say?

218
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:14,375
I just think that...

219
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:57,742
Visit Barcelona,

220
00:25:58,242 --> 00:26:00,117
a very romantic place.

221
00:26:00,695 --> 00:26:02,008
A beautiful city.

222
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:04,594
And see the people.

223
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,555
They are happy and
they are enjoying their life.

224
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,898
And I hope you can come
back in a while.

225
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,781
To visit me.

226
00:27:56,038 --> 00:28:00,555
I hope we can stand here again.

227
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:05,164
And look at this building
when it's finished.

228
00:28:05,711 --> 00:28:07,883
Stay here forever?

229
00:28:08,507 --> 00:28:09,641
I think so.

230
00:28:09,665 --> 00:28:12,062
- That's so romantic.
- Yeah.

231
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:49,500
As I'm gaining in experience,

232
00:33:49,525 --> 00:33:51,796
sometimes I could preempt
the mind of the host.

233
00:34:07,861 --> 00:34:09,854
When are you coming back to Asia?

234
00:34:12,765 --> 00:34:13,498
Well,

235
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:22,013
Hong Kong is out of the question.
Umm, Taipei, another place? Maybe Singapore?

236
00:34:22,172 --> 00:34:23,319
Go to Thailand.

237
00:34:24,627 --> 00:34:27,040
Umm... what?

238
00:34:28,248 --> 00:34:30,041
Are you having a reason for that?

239
00:34:32,858 --> 00:34:34,558
Whatever you say, it's OK.

240
00:34:46,338 --> 00:34:48,284
I obviously have a reason.

241
00:35:49,265 --> 00:35:51,000
After the experience

242
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,539
about...

243
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,975
about...

244
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,546
possession,

245
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:02,992
I became a believer.

246
00:36:03,742 --> 00:36:06,600
It may sound bad, even horrible to many.

247
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:09,812
I couldn't think of a better word
for the phenomenon.

248
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:13,225
But I think it's actually
a really really good thing.

249
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:17,632
Liang's friend, actually his husband,
went all the way to Taipei

250
00:36:19,031 --> 00:36:22,625
to watch this film “Adonis” at the theater.

251
00:36:23,117 --> 00:36:26,000
He watched it over and over.

252
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:28,100
And he told me that

253
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:29,500
you know what?

254
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,140
The storyline of this film
resembles Liang's life a lot!

255
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:39,242
As if the writer had done his research
face to face with Liang.

256
00:36:39,585 --> 00:36:41,867
Simply too many coincidences.

257
00:36:42,328 --> 00:36:44,500
Even some lines in the film

258
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,750
had been spoken by Liang in the past.

259
00:36:47,234 --> 00:36:50,875
I then talked to Scud about this.

260
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:55,031
I said you didn't even know
this friend of mine existed.

261
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,500
Yet how could you...

262
00:36:59,109 --> 00:37:02,125
write a life so similar?

263
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:03,250
It's...

264
00:37:04,062 --> 00:37:10,250
sending chills down my spine
when I reflected on it.

265
00:37:24,226 --> 00:37:26,125
Dusts to dust. Dirt to dirt.

266
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:28,265
Everything is fine. All taboos are off.

267
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,772
Welcome to Bodyshop.

268
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:33,375
The martyr didn't leave a will.

269
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:37,125
His organs will be treated
by convention as following:

270
00:37:37,843 --> 00:37:40,007
Heart goes to parents.

271
00:37:40,032 --> 00:37:41,718
Liver to children.

272
00:37:42,163 --> 00:37:43,944
Testes to spouse.

273
00:37:44,758 --> 00:37:46,874
Lungs to siblings.

274
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,625
Kidneys to other relatives.

275
00:37:50,288 --> 00:37:52,319
Genitals to lover.

276
00:37:52,905 --> 00:37:55,530
Other body parts will
be shared by everyone.

277
00:37:56,304 --> 00:37:57,500
Any objections?

278
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,250
Daluy (27 years)

279
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:08,272
I'm Yu,

280
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:10,319
Daluy's boyfriend.

281
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,304
We've been together for seven years,

282
00:38:12,967 --> 00:38:14,647
just yet to be registered.

283
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,750
Dust to dust. Dirt to dirt.

284
00:38:22,775 --> 00:38:24,775
Everything is fine. All taboos are off.

285
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:27,375
Welcome to Bodyshop.

286
00:38:58,477 --> 00:39:01,070
You have yet to tell me
why you wanna come here.

287
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,281
I don't know.

288
00:39:03,305 --> 00:39:04,640
I really don't.

289
00:39:20,055 --> 00:39:21,305
You look terrible.

290
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,133
Jet lag, maybe.

291
00:39:23,514 --> 00:39:25,039
You should take a good rest.

292
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,476
I need a drink.

293
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,585
Really?

294
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:30,734
Tonight.

295
00:39:32,023 --> 00:39:33,164
OK.

296
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,250
This is my sister

297
00:40:10,156 --> 00:40:12,203
who used to be my brother.

298
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,687
Now the ghosts can't see you,
but you can see them.

299
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:26,367
Remember their faces and tell me later.

300
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,781
My mom likes sukiyaki,
so she named us Suki and Yaki.

301
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:46,351
But these names hadn't
brought us good luck.

302
00:40:57,944 --> 00:40:59,805
I think I know her from somewhere.

303
00:41:01,757 --> 00:41:03,476
Let's try one more time.

304
00:41:04,031 --> 00:41:05,000
This one?

305
00:41:07,687 --> 00:41:09,109
Same as what I told you.

306
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,125
Don't worry.

307
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,446
No big deal.

308
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:13,031
Hey.

309
00:41:54,773 --> 00:41:57,804
Unfortunately not.
I feel like I'm being followed.

310
00:41:59,608 --> 00:42:03,390
You must be targeted by Krasue or Krahang.

311
00:42:03,764 --> 00:42:05,116
You scare me.

312
00:42:05,141 --> 00:42:06,358
I buy enough.

313
00:42:07,187 --> 00:42:08,281
Bye.

314
00:42:09,242 --> 00:42:10,586
I go with you.

315
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:12,250
It's alright.

316
00:42:13,537 --> 00:42:16,765
You know, what I will do.

317
00:42:18,968 --> 00:42:20,648
Let me have you.

318
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:29,390
What a night it was in China.

319
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:31,435
We should celebrate our union.

320
00:42:34,175 --> 00:42:36,261
There's my husband, Tyrol.

321
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,117
Wow, handsome.

322
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:40,562
You're lucky.

323
00:42:40,586 --> 00:42:41,663
Thank you.

324
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,875
You lock the shop
after this last customer leaves.

325
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,884
Okay.

326
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,203
Maybe he's a drag?

327
00:43:01,031 --> 00:43:02,312
Maybe she's a drag?

328
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,648
I guess so.

329
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:58,125
Have you seen mom again?

330
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:01,780
No.

331
00:45:01,937 --> 00:45:04,015
She said she would come down to find me.

332
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,569
But you are still up here.

333
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:08,601
You're the one she missed.

334
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,780
You should go back to see her.

335
00:45:13,171 --> 00:45:16,663
If we're able to face each other,

336
00:45:17,608 --> 00:45:19,140
then I didn't need to run here.

337
00:45:22,249 --> 00:45:23,523
Thinking back,

338
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,452
it might be me causing your misery.

339
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:29,741
I didn't become gay because of you.

340
00:45:31,804 --> 00:45:32,875
I mean

341
00:45:34,991 --> 00:45:36,476
if I didn't leave home,

342
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:38,913
you wouldn't have to face it alone.

343
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,625
Forgive me

344
00:45:45,281 --> 00:45:47,281
for not even making it to your funeral.

345
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,375
Reading your last letter,

346
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:55,710
I wanted to take my life too.

347
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:21,125
Now we got to know what death is like.

348
00:46:24,523 --> 00:46:25,952
You live a better life.

349
00:46:27,148 --> 00:46:29,125
I couldn't stay much longer with you.

350
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,491
Life can be like hell too, Yaki.

351
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,875
But I will try.

352
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:25,023
Water lamps carry away
bad luck from the living.

353
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:29,375
Sky lamps release the souls of the dead.

354
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:34,257
I left that atheistic country
for just a few months,

355
00:51:34,282 --> 00:51:36,335
now I'm surrounded by all sorts of gods.

356
00:51:42,804 --> 00:51:44,085
You can't put it on.

357
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,641
We cherish life because it's got to end.

358
00:52:13,258 --> 00:52:16,141
We pursue love because it's never the way

359
00:52:16,844 --> 00:52:18,508
we expect it to be.

360
00:52:19,641 --> 00:52:21,414
What is that, about love?

361
00:52:22,891 --> 00:52:26,992
I will return to Sukiyaki tonight,
for my second form.

362
00:53:15,758 --> 00:53:17,305
I'm really sorry, Adonis.

363
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,250
But you know that.

364
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:22,656
You had to be like another
person those few days.

365
00:53:23,898 --> 00:53:25,742
I was possessed, alright.

366
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:27,984
That's not my point.

367
00:53:28,677 --> 00:53:30,130
Remember the film...

368
00:53:30,305 --> 00:53:31,695
we acted together?

369
00:53:50,305 --> 00:53:51,594
I do not forget.

370
00:53:52,219 --> 00:53:53,961
Even when we're up there.

371
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,515
His country has legalized
homosexual marriage.

372
00:53:58,804 --> 00:54:00,554
When he returns there
by the end of the year,

373
00:54:00,796 --> 00:54:02,125
I'll go with him.

374
00:54:05,773 --> 00:54:07,164
To marry you.

375
00:54:12,781 --> 00:54:13,836
Are you proposing?

376
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:33,750
Thank you, darling.

377
00:54:34,694 --> 00:54:36,576
Now, it's my turn.

378
00:54:37,477 --> 00:54:38,680
To say sorry.

379
00:54:58,984 --> 00:55:00,000
On his birthday,

380
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,750
we went to his grave in Zhejiang.

381
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:09,281
I remember clearly that

382
00:55:09,734 --> 00:55:12,500
after we had poured him some wine,
served some dishes

383
00:55:12,525 --> 00:55:14,773
when all the scent sticks
and candles were still burning,

384
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:18,375
I asked my friends to leave
me alone for awhile.

385
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,796
I chatted with him.

386
00:55:23,375 --> 00:55:24,726
And then...

387
00:55:26,062 --> 00:55:27,625
we talked about a lot of things;

388
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:33,500
I told him I was suddenly
very sick in Taiwan.

389
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,375
Did you come to my set?

390
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:38,132
And a lot more.

391
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:41,500
Finally I wished him
a happy life over there.

392
00:55:41,525 --> 00:55:44,275
It's getting late

393
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,125
and we'll chat again next time.

394
00:55:47,148 --> 00:55:49,656
Suddenly all candles went out,
just like that.

395
00:55:50,452 --> 00:55:51,952
Thank you so much, Suki.

396
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:53,570
You are my survivor.

397
00:55:53,953 --> 00:55:55,797
I feel much better now.

398
00:55:57,859 --> 00:55:59,234
I have been...

399
00:56:00,188 --> 00:56:01,789
lying to you.

400
00:56:01,813 --> 00:56:03,367
I'm sorry.

401
00:56:04,344 --> 00:56:08,945
You are sick because of
my brother is possessing you.

402
00:56:09,516 --> 00:56:12,898
He is also here.

403
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:22,750
So he can't see you.

404
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,750
How can he see you?

405
00:56:32,461 --> 00:56:33,593
So you,

406
00:56:34,305 --> 00:56:35,563
and your brother,

407
00:56:35,587 --> 00:56:37,054
what are you talking about?

408
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:41,703
He said that...

409
00:56:42,985 --> 00:56:51,156
he can only be seen by
married, close people.

410
00:56:52,995 --> 00:56:54,304
Like me,

411
00:56:54,329 --> 00:56:56,664
and my love.

412
00:56:58,516 --> 00:56:59,796
May I see his picture?

413
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:06,617
Oh, he's cute.

414
00:57:07,273 --> 00:57:08,672
Handsome like you.

415
00:57:12,711 --> 00:57:14,875
Do you think I'm good looking like him?

416
00:57:15,016 --> 00:57:16,492
Let me be your brother too.

417
00:58:50,187 --> 00:58:51,375
That thing of yours...

418
00:58:51,585 --> 00:58:53,625
when're you going to get rid of?

419
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:55,500
Soon maybe.

420
00:58:55,828 --> 00:58:57,226
When I found my true love,

421
00:58:57,515 --> 00:58:59,000
I'll do that for him.

422
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:02,000
You mean that TV star?

423
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:04,429
He's gay.

424
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,148
I am a man then.

425
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:33,789
No luck.

426
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,976
Now I understand

427
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:57,437
what differentiates death from life

428
00:59:57,945 --> 01:00:00,664
is the loss of the capability to love.

429
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,375
She keeps on losing,
but she keeps on loving.

430
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:09,054
I had to leave the world
without tasting love!

431
01:00:10,038 --> 01:00:11,343
I better leave now.

432
01:02:39,836 --> 01:02:41,000
Will you marry me?

433
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,523
Should we go for dinner?

434
01:02:57,085 --> 01:03:00,125
Liang once told him that
if he died one day,

435
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:02,406
he wouldn't stand seeing him
with a new lover,

436
01:03:02,431 --> 01:03:05,500
He'd float outside the window dressing
in red to scare them to death.

437
01:03:08,093 --> 01:03:12,070
Three years after the death of Liang,

438
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:14,523
his ex had been seeing
someone occasionally.

439
01:03:14,548 --> 01:03:17,164
But whoever he met,

440
01:03:17,189 --> 01:03:20,381
they parted with no reason.

441
01:03:20,406 --> 01:03:25,375
Until Liang's birthday this year,

442
01:03:25,992 --> 01:03:29,500
we went to his grave and talked with him

443
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,250
that he should let go.

444
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:33,250
It'd been long enough

445
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:38,000
for both of them to start a new life.

446
01:03:38,796 --> 01:03:39,975
Soon after that,

447
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,500
maybe less than a month later.

448
01:03:42,523 --> 01:03:49,242
This poor gentleman
eventually got new company.

449
01:03:49,523 --> 01:03:52,523
I wish him luck with my whole heart.

450
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:08,875
Somebody's here.

451
01:04:41,733 --> 01:04:44,500
My name is Xiang, means flying.

452
01:04:45,125 --> 01:04:47,804
I am a big fan of Wolfe and Kafka

453
01:04:47,837 --> 01:04:50,538
so I simulate the radical ways
they got inspired.

454
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:55,250
They're both achieved, and they died early.

455
01:04:56,070 --> 01:04:58,250
That's my ideal.

456
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,875
That scene's too surreal to believe.

457
01:05:24,828 --> 01:05:27,023
Maybe my insomnia, maybe not.

458
01:05:27,585 --> 01:05:30,382
The realities these days
become like hallucinations.

459
01:06:44,225 --> 01:06:46,265
I heard that there's a voluntary
body treatment scheme, right?

460
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:47,540
Sure, a moment.

461
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:55,234
(Voluntary body disposal authorization)

462
01:07:04,125 --> 01:07:07,250
(Reason of giving up: Nothing to live for)

463
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:14,125
(Genitals)

464
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:13,875
Wait.

465
01:08:19,210 --> 01:08:21,125
Coming.

466
01:09:25,914 --> 01:09:27,625
How about this one?

467
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:26,750
Bye, bye.

468
01:13:26,775 --> 01:13:27,672
Wait.

469
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:29,375
How can I find you?

470
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,875
I might come back for you.

471
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:32,875
Wait!

472
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:35,125
You haven't told me your name.

473
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,005
Karen the troubadour.

474
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:12,000
What's up?

475
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:14,250
Come in.

476
01:14:14,599 --> 01:14:15,875
Have a seat.

477
01:14:17,216 --> 01:14:19,250
A new work again?

478
01:14:21,146 --> 01:14:22,125
Let me listen!

479
01:14:22,865 --> 01:14:23,935
See if it's better.

480
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:53,857
This one is different.

481
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,000
Hello, body shop.

482
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:19,250
He's gone. Who's it?

483
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,500
What's the matter?

484
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:30,216
Is he gone?

485
01:16:36,703 --> 01:16:37,750
Okay.

486
01:16:49,375 --> 01:16:51,125
One way or another.

487
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,250
Thought you'd improve somewhat.

488
01:16:59,312 --> 01:17:04,468
What entitled you to be
a designated driver?

489
01:17:06,226 --> 01:17:08,187
You womanizer!

490
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,265
Like rushing to die.

491
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:13,265
Now what to do with the money you saved?

492
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
For whom?

493
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:29,000
Joe!

494
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:45,242
One way or another.

495
01:18:02,585 --> 01:18:03,375
Master!

496
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:04,500
Master!

497
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:05,695
Aren't you open today?

498
01:18:05,875 --> 01:18:07,000
None of your business!

499
01:18:07,765 --> 01:18:08,625
Really?

500
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,100
I heard from my fellow...

501
01:18:12,125 --> 01:18:17,437
I heard from colleagues
that your business is flourishing.

502
01:18:18,523 --> 01:18:20,350
Keep away, would you?

503
01:18:20,375 --> 01:18:21,500
Wait!

504
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:26,742
I am actually a reporter
from Western Daily.

505
01:18:27,125 --> 01:18:32,000
In search of insight.

506
01:18:32,025 --> 01:18:35,750
You know how tough
it's to reveal some truth nowadays.

507
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:41,000
Take it as a favor to our readers,
would you?

508
01:18:41,445 --> 01:18:43,648
Just bother you a few seconds.

509
01:18:44,531 --> 01:18:46,601
Please help! Thank you!

510
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:15,914
Don't move!

511
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,460
Get out!

512
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,148
Get out!

513
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:21,859
Raise your hands!

514
01:20:40,625 --> 01:20:42,000
Indeed.

515
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:44,625
It's me again.

516
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:50,250
Nobody can escape the judgement.

517
01:20:50,664 --> 01:20:52,867
You're no exception.

518
01:20:56,367 --> 01:20:58,375
Mr. Simon Tam.

519
01:21:01,625 --> 01:21:05,375
Have you heard about the crime
namely “Improper disposal of a corpse”?

520
01:21:05,953 --> 01:21:09,250
Also known as “Prevention of the lawful
and decent burial of a body”.

521
01:21:09,835 --> 01:21:14,664
You have 150 charges against you!

522
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:19,296
Nothing improper.

523
01:21:19,664 --> 01:21:21,930
Every one of them was voluntary.

524
01:21:22,539 --> 01:21:23,625
Voluntary?

525
01:21:24,195 --> 01:21:26,687
Have they all signed you an authorization?

526
01:21:27,625 --> 01:21:30,125
And by the way you've burnt
most of the documents.

527
01:21:30,687 --> 01:21:31,890
Really?

528
01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:34,203
Good!

529
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:36,070
Don't be so excited.

530
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:42,039
DNA can help us to find the identities
of all the accomplices.

531
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:44,328
You're really something though.

532
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:48,625
You got hundreds of mitigation letters
and applications for bail.

533
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:52,218
People nowadays fear no death really.

534
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:56,000
One way or another, sooner or later.

535
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,125
Are you cursing me?

536
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:04,875
Is it really as delicious as rumored?

537
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:10,070
So, are any of yours dying?

538
01:22:10,570 --> 01:22:13,250
I can treat you a feast.

539
01:22:16,687 --> 01:22:19,437
Your case is severe and inhumane.

540
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,250
Long jail term is inevitable.

541
01:22:22,275 --> 01:22:25,275
Don't you fantasize leaving here,
maybe for a whole life.

542
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:27,031
Can you stop me?

543
01:22:27,976 --> 01:22:29,601
What's that supposed to mean?

544
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:33,000
There are parallel universes

545
01:22:33,375 --> 01:22:36,475
allowing us to traverse heaven and hell.

546
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:39,475
The ghosts can show up
anytime and anywhere.

547
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,475
Some are beside you now.

548
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,100
Same as the aliens.

549
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:46,000
You don't have to wonder how they can
arrive from so many lightyears away.

550
01:22:46,025 --> 01:22:49,625
Quantum entanglement is proven
to be the fastest,

551
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:52,640
many many times over the light.

552
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:01,515
Cheers.

553
01:24:03,266 --> 01:24:04,922
So it's not like you like them, right?

554
01:24:04,946 --> 01:24:06,601
- Yeah.
- No.

555
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:07,703
They like me.

556
01:24:07,728 --> 01:24:09,453
So you wanna feel good today...

557
01:24:09,478 --> 01:24:11,359
That's right.

558
01:24:11,492 --> 01:24:13,148
How did you die?

559
01:24:14,797 --> 01:24:16,203
I came to death.

560
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,375
What a waste that my body was confiscated.

561
01:24:19,375 --> 01:24:20,875
I couldn't eat myself.

562
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:24,562
It's past the expiration date anyway.

563
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:26,250
I am blessed.

564
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:30,225
I could eat my lover fresh as our love.

565
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:33,375
The hair removal
before hand facilitated the cooking too.

566
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:38,350
Had I learn of this way to end,
I'd die in a better form.

567
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:40,250
Humans are too stupid.

568
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:43,626
Burning every corpse is total waste
of our resources on Earth.

569
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:47,250
One way or another, sooner or later.

570
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:51,125
Dying in your good hand is our last luck.

571
01:24:51,875 --> 01:24:53,850
Our Halloween is approaching.

572
01:24:53,875 --> 01:24:55,750
Where should we go to celebrate?

573
01:24:55,775 --> 01:24:57,000
You know better than us,

574
01:24:57,025 --> 01:24:58,976
Mr. frequent traveler.

575
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:02,375
Japan is bustling.

576
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,179
People mingle with ghosts.

577
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:38,875
Spain is fun.

578
01:25:38,928 --> 01:25:39,975
Spain is fun?

579
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,750
Spain is real fun.

580
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:00,054
Taiwan...

581
01:26:00,632 --> 01:26:01,875
is deserted.

582
01:26:24,875 --> 01:26:26,437
Thailand...

583
01:27:00,367 --> 01:27:06,453
