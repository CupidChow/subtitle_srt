1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,150
   

2
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,190
   

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,670
   

4
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,950
   
   

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:33,120
 Timing and subtitles brought to you by 
 Are You The One Team @ Viki 

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,030
   

7
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,770
 Nothing lasts forever. 

8
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,920
 There's nothing you can hold onto either. 

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,650
 The only thing we can do is to live and love... 

10
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,160
 today, at this moment. 

11
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,510
Nice to meet you. I'm Ha Yeong Eun.

12
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,220
I don't know what others might say,

13
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,340
but Jae Gook is a very precious son to me.

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,360
He lived his entire life feeling small because of mistakes made by his elders.

15
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,280
On top of that, once the whole world finds out whom he loves,

16
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,740
he'll have to live out the rest of his life the same way.

17
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,440
So as his mother, I couldn't just sit idly by which is why I asked to meet you.

18
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,620
How do you feel about Jae Gook?

19
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,110
Miss Ha Yeong Eun.

20
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,850
How do you feel about him?

21
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,080
It's love.

22
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,250
I didn't give birth to him, but he's a brother to Soo Wan.

23
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,420
And I've already confirmed that

24
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,470
my feelings won't change because of that fact.

25
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,110
I see.

26
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,790
Then please convince me.

27
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,880
How certain you are, up to what point your sincerity lies...

28
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,310
If you can convince me,

29
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,970
then I'll accept it.

30
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,500
   

31
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,430
   

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,300
   

33
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,940
Don't save it for Ji Min and eat it up!

34
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,590
Anyway, it looks like you passed one obstacle.

35
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,800
It was not what I expected.

36
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,240
But now there is a different concern about how I can convince her of my feelings.

37
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,950
As long as you two are happy, it's enough.

38
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,800
There's no need to convince her.

39
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,680
Right?

40
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,080
I'm laughing in front of you.

41
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,120
Hey, you have to laugh so I can, too.

42
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,960
"How's your illness? Is your condition all right?"

43
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,900
It's far better and more fun than the same old questions I've been getting.

44
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,520
Seeing you happy, hearing about it.

45
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,730
But what's all that?

46
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,770
Hey, why am I losing so much weight?

47
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,050
There is nothing I can wear.

48
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,220
I am trying to organize ahead of time.

49
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,890
Stop making me upset.

50
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,220
Don't nag at me.

51
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,640
As soon as my husband wakes up, he talks about chemo or getting hospitalized.

52
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,960
My ears are tired of his nagging.

53
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,920
Get chemo. Let's get you hospitalized.

54
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,830
After expecting and hoping...

55
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,090
if the outcome is worse, then I will end up falling down even lower.

56
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,100
Showing temper due to the pain, and then getting mad for others not being understanding...

57
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,920
I can't spend my time that way.

58
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,930
Mi Sook.

59
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,350
I want to say my goodbyes well.

60
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,800
So I'm going to give my all to each day.

61
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,590
Until the last day that I am given,

62
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,270
I am going to do everything I can so that I have no regrets...

63
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,260
I'm going to say my goodbyes well.

64
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,820
I should throw these out before Ji Min comes home.

65
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,130
She's seven, but there's a little lady living inside of her.

66
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,180
Sometimes my answers aren't good enough.

67
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,880
Give them to me.

68
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,960
It's cold these days. You can't catch a cold.

69
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,010
   

70
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,440
You know why your friend is saying that.

71
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,770
But I can't acquiesce just like this and say goodbye.

72
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,610
There are so many things I haven't done for Mi Sook.

73
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,530
Like your friend said, do what you can today

74
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,920
and then do what you can tomorrow.

75
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,780
Do everything you can for her.

76
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,090
How's your mother?

77
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,360
Has she said anything since?

78
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,510
Not yet. I don't really know what it means

79
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,350
to convince her up to what point our sincerity lies,

80
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,810
but let's just do what we've been doing.

81
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,220
Let's do what we can.

82
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,580
Oh, I'm here.

83
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,240
Talk to you later.

84
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,130
If it's for your girlfriend, these are nice.

85
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,240
The meaning of pink roses is happy love.

86
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,430
Please make me a full bouquet then.

87
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,050
Okay.

88
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,930
This is why I told you I'd buy you an outfit for Dad's retirement ceremony.

89
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,430
I'm going to stop living with your dad.

90
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,590
Does this make you look older?

91
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:54,120
Leave it! I can just put on whatever I get my hands on in the morning.

92
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,730
But you have to think about his reputation.

93
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,890
Everyone will be coming by to say hello since you're the vice principal's wife.

94
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,520
It's enough that for nearly 40 years I got up at 6 AM,

95
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,280
dunked my hands into cold water to cook and feed him breakfast,

96
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,960
and sent him on his way to work.

97
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,590
What more do I owe your dad?

98
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,030
It's my graduation too.

99
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,930
On my graduation day, I want to dress however I want! What's wrong with that?!

100
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,690
Then why did you call me over? You said it was urgent.

101
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,660
It is urgent. Sit here.

102
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,740
Get married before I get a divorce.

103
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,990
Now you're threatening me?

104
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,200
Let me live freely!

105
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,500
In two days, I'll be free of your dad!

106
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,210
Because of you, my life's homework isn't done!

107
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,130
How long do I have to keep studying?

108
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,990
- I have a man. 
 - Exactly!

109
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,730
Huh? What?

110
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,080
I have someone.

111
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,360
Oh, who is it? Who?

112
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,900
What does he do? How old is he?

113
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,320
When can I meet him? This girl!

114
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,740
What's the occasion?

115
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,740
To win some brownie points.

116
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,020
I heard you met with Yeong Eun.

117
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,280
She told you to do this?

118
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,240
No. It was completely my idea.

119
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,030
You must be hungry. What would you like me to make? What do you feel like eating?

120
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,630
Spicy noodles. I came because I want to eat that, Mother.

121
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,750
Okay, I understand. Wait here then.

122
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,960
These pants only go up to size 66?

123
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,340
Yes, ma'am.

124
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,800
But it comes oversized, so even sizes 66.5 can wear it.

125
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,940
I couldn't even zip it up.

126
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,670
Excuse me, do you have one half size bigger?

127
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,870
Oh, we don't have half sizes.

128
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,510
You're really not going to make more sizes?

129
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,160
You know it's not that simple.

130
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,510
The Hills asked me to come work for their newly launched, imported brand instead of staying with Sonó.

131
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,800
So did you give them an answer?

132
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,520
I run my own business.

133
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,130
Handling old inventory monthly and paying my employees

134
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,720
while selling domestic brands is not easy.

135
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,420
But I'm enduring it through waiting for the after effect of Galeries Lafayette.

136
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,600
It's not just me. Bigger store managers got offers too.

137
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,490
The world has become so diverse,

138
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,520
but why do clothes still only come in three sizes: small, medium or large?

139
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,070
I'll make a strong proposal.

140
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,280
Don't make a proposal. Give me the result.

141
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,730
Who cares if the sales department keeps going on about

142
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,820
how the sell-through percentage has to be over 60% to make a profit?

143
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,720
You have to let us be able to sell. Don't you think?

144
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,040
Okay. I understand what you're saying.

145
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,980
So she wants to strike while the iron's hot.

146
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,930
I'm sure she's getting lots of customers with talk of Galeries Lafayette.

147
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,460
Can you get me the report before the meeting?

148
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,390
 The chief is going to be screaming again. 

149
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,050
Probably.

150
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,300
Yes, I'll be right there. Please take care of it until then.

151
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,990
   

152
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,060
There are sizes 44, 55, 66, and free size, too. 
  (Free size is a "one size fits all") 

153
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,650
Why is she asking for more sizes?

154
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,980
Sometimes sizes 77, 88 are the first ones to be sold out on home shopping networks.

155
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,540
That means there's a demand for them.

156
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,920
Do different sizes appear out of thin air?

157
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,770
We need to make separate patterns and run different factories.

158
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,380
That's all money! Money!

159
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,630
In the US, women's sizes go from 2, 4, 6 to 12.

160
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,900
They differentiate long, regular, and short pants depending on leg length, too.

161
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,790
So customers are able to pick a size that fits them the best because there are many choices.

162
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,190
That's because so many different races live in the US.

163
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,560
At this rate, why don't you go visit each person and make them clothes to measure?!

164
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,290
I asked you to make something for Paris. What's this nonsense?

165
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,700
Stay true to your job!

166
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,390
Making clothes that suit the customers' needs

167
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,910
is also one of my jobs.

168
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,340
Hey, Team Leader Ha.

169
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,110
If we lose a competent store manager, we'll lose customers, too.

170
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,420
Please consider it earnestly, Chief.

171
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:31,150
We don't get along. We really don't get along!

172
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,800
Got over one hill...

173
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,300
Team Leader Ha! Yeong Eun!

174
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,420
Another hill to climb over is approaching me.

175
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,160
Has my father said anything?

176
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,340
Did you cause a problem? Why?

177
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,290
What is it? Who is it this time?

178
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,730
What problem?

179
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,890
Hey, CEO Seok confessed that he likes me.

180
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,460
What's with that expression? I'm offended.

181
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,640
Since when? Are you serious about him, too?

182
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,760
Hey, not me! You know he's not my type.

183
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,910
But how does CEO Hwang know about this?

184
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,880
Well... there was something...

185
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,410
Anyway, you're saying you did cause a problem.

186
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,460
With the CEO of one of our subcontractors at that.

187
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,830
Wench, you always think that you've got me figured out.

188
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:26,650
But there is something I can do that you don't know about.

189
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,020
Where are you going in the middle of the conversation?

190
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,450
Don't you have to report to Father?

191
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,490
I'll go get the answer for you to write down.

192
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 I know how foolish and reckless this emotion is.  

193
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,760
 But if I am this way regardless, it is because I am serious about Yoon Jae Gook.  

194
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,400
 But this self, this foolish and reckless self... I welcome it. 

195
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,910
 Why are you so reckless? Why are you so foolish? 

196
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,270
 Even if we go through this marriage, we can't be happy. 

197
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,150
 I thought I loved you but found out it's something else. 

198
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:29,140
 What we have is comfort from knowing each other for so long. Like a sibling or a friend. 

199
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,210
 Our engagement period was too long, 

200
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,510
 so you can think that. 

201
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,420
 I'll try harder. 

202
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,460
 To me, you are still a man. 

203
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,010
 And I love you. 

204
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:49,590
 With someone else in my heart, accepting you out of responsibility and duty... 

205
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,040
 - That's not right. 
 - It doesn't matter. 

206
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,430
 It doesn't matter to me! So stay by my side. 

207
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,150
 Don't go, Soo Wan. 

208
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,330
   

209
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,490
Soo Wan, you were the one who did me wrong.

210
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,330
She did me wrong.

211
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,010
I always watch the ending credits.

212
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:08,070
Sometimes, those names that go up endlessly

213
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,330
are more touching than the movie itself.

214
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,260
Because I can see

215
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,400
how many people's time and effort went into this one movie.

216
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,700
Missing the post-credit scene does feel quite terrible.

217
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,520
I like this music.

218
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,060
♫  I'll give all I can to you  ♫

219
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:45,700
♫  You'll always be the one I remember  ♫

220
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:51,780
♫  You'll always take my breath away  ♫

221
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:56,800
♫  You'll always be my heart, my life  ♫

222
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,590
♫  Every second, every day  ♫

223
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,430
What should we go eat?

224
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,570
Should we get Korean? Then what?

225
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:08,420
- Today, I feel like— 
 - Are you... Jae Gook?

226
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,350
Soo Wan's little brother, Yoon Jae Gook, right?

227
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,540
- Hyung. 
 - Hey! How long has it been?

228
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,230
You know Soo Wan, right? He's Soo Wan's brother.

229
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,200
This is my wife.

230
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,140
Hello.

231
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,200
It's hectic at the hospital,

232
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,980
but this kiddo wanted to watch an animated movie for her birthday present.

233
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,750
Was it the anniversary of his death recently?

234
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,130
Is that why you came back?

235
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,680
Yes.

236
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,710
I'm too busy with life that I keep forgetting.

237
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,830
- It's okay. 
 - By the way, you're resembling Soo Wan more and more.

238
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,930
Like people won't know you're brothers, huh?

239
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,600
Who is she?

240
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,410
This is my girlfriend.

241
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,710
Oh, hello. I'm friend of Jae Gook's brother, Soo Wan.

242
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,450
Hello, I'm Ha Yeong Eun.

243
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,460
Goodbye.

244
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,620
Reality hit me straight in the face.

245
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:23,720
Hearing the name Soo Wan out of the blue nearly made my knees buckle.

246
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,340
Is that so?

247
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,940
I think I lost about half of my fighting spirit too.

248
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,050
You still have the other half left.

249
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,010
Why are there so many hills to climb over?

250
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,250
Since you're climbing anyway, let's go over one more hill.

251
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,720
I want to meet

252
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,480
your mother too.

253
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,760
What did you just say?

254
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,620
Help me out until the Paris deal is wrapped up.

255
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,230
After it's all done, we say goodbye?

256
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,770
Yes, like it's no biggie.

257
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,860
I think that proposal is a little too harsh for me.

258
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,810
I got rejected when I confessed, and now we'll break up after the contractual relationship ends?

259
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:24,100
Don't you also have to get to Paris safely?

260
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,990
Wait till my father finds out.

261
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,150
He hates being deceived the most.

262
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,130
It happened regardless of my will,

263
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,460
so why should I take responsibility together with you?

264
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,960
After conquering Paris, shouldn't we proceed to Milan, London, and New York?

265
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,550
Anyway, you're saying we should start dating?

266
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,660
It'll be a short-term contract.

267
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,560
I would say we are a show window couple for business reasons.

268
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,270
So what should I do?

269
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,190
First of all, you need be seen often at my company.

270
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,490
And how outwardly passionate?

271
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,940
Just enough heat from both of us.

272
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,780
On some circumstances, an appropriate amount of physical touch may be needed.

273
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,460
To what extent?

274
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,620
Let's consent up to light kisses.

275
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,780
We already did all those.

276
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,950
Then I'll take that as a yes,

277
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,980
and until our contract is up, let's do well.

278
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,490
Let's do that. Let's go for it.

279
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,960
We can never get caught, okay?

280
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,040
My dad hates being deceived the most.

281
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,510
Yes, come in.

282
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,300
Soo Ho. Then I'll leave you two to work.

283
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,260
   

284
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,490
Senior Manager Gwak, what is this?

285
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,520
It's a resignation letter.

286
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,940
Why so suddenly?

287
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,440
I'm sorry to have made this decision so suddenly.

288
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,090
I've organized all of the ongoing projects I am on,

289
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,750
and I'll make sure my absence won't make a big—

290
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,670
Have you been scouted somewhere else?

291
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,190
What was their condition?

292
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,160
If there was something lacking on my part, you should've talked to me first.

293
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,120
This is what you give me after all the time and effort

294
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,490
we put in to build up this company from when there were just five of us?

295
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,460
My wife...

296
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,940
is sick.

297
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,410
What are you saying, Soo Ho?

298
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,300
Mi Sook is sick?

299
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,480
- Where is she sick? 
 - Senior Manager.

300
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:13,470
What? What is it this time?

301
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,030
What is it that you're like this?

302
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,300
Did something not go well with CEO Seok?

303
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,220
Why didn't you tell me?

304
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,100
What didn't I tell you this time?

305
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,970
I heard Mi Sook...

306
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,930
is sick.

307
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:36,140
You wenches. Just between you two.

308
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,470
Always sharing between you two and leaving me out!

309
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,090
Why didn't you tell me? Why?

310
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,210
I was the only one who didn't know.

311
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,960
You wenches.

312
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Mi Sook can't be sick!

313
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,580
Why is she sick? Why?

314
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,090
What are you doing?

315
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,380
Where have you been? Why didn't you answer the phone?

316
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,670
I went to Mom and got some side dishes.

317
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,260
Then I went to Ji Min's preschool and took her to her piano lesson.

318
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,990
I didn't hear the call.

319
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:24,190
But why are you home at this hour? And what is all this?

320
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:28,230
From now on, we'll just eat brown rice.

321
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,020
Did you take the day off to do this?

322
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,540
Did you miss work?

323
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,410
I quit.

324
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,230
What?

325
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,940
Please don't be flustered.

326
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,790
We'll leave his desk as is.

327
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:47,620
Senior Manager Gwak must return here, to this desk.

328
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,490
We don't know when that'll be, but till then, this desk will remain as is.

329
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,680
Please get back to your work.

330
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,220
Are you nuts? Should all three of us stop living?

331
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,570
Let's get you admitted to the hospital. I can't part with you like this.

332
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,910
- Honey. 
 - I won't let you be in pain by yourself and collapse again.

333
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,310
Hey, Gwak Soo Ho!

334
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,320
I'm sorry, Mi Sook.

335
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,200
What are you doing right now?

336
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,150
I was a bastard.

337
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,990
Ji Min's dad!

338
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,570
They said you're dying,

339
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,630
but the first thing that came to my mind was

340
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,150
"What happens to me now?"

341
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:36,710
Then "What happens to Ji Min?"

342
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:42,420
Then finally I worried about you.

343
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,680
I'm a total bastard.

344
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,930
I'm a selfish bastard

345
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,950
who only cares for me.

346
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,930
Don't do this.

347
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,070
What do I do with you?

348
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,780
What do I do with you?

349
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,990
Are you done crying?

350
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,050
Drink this.

351
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,620
You wench.

352
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,470
You can stop there.

353
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,010
I don't have the energy to listen to any more of that.

354
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,850
I'm going to find the best doctor in that field.

355
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,260
I'm going to get her a VIP room at the hospital and use all of my connections,

356
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,440
so be responsible for bringing Mi Sook. Got it?

357
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,940
- Chi Sook. 
 - Don't exclude me ever again!

358
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,850
I'm going to...

359
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,180
Bring Mi Sook, got it?

360
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,220
♫  Stay my shiny dreams  ♫

361
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:04,420
♫  My close friend, you will come find me, right?  ♫

362
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,320
Assistant Manager Seo.

363
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,360
I'd like you to handle the Sonó pop-up at Galeries Lafayette.

364
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,940
- Me? 
 - You've been working with Senior Manager Gwak this whole time,

365
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,910
- so you understand the work you need to do, right? 
 - What?

366
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,180
- Yes. 
 - We can't ignore the impact of a call-to-action,

367
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,890
so keep in touch about the first floor show window,

368
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,510
and before we go into the art work concept meeting,

369
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,320
get the drafts ready.

370
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,810
Okay.

371
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,380
Oh, right.

372
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,960
Could you also manage Cookie's schedule?

373
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,470
Okay.

374
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,310
 Senior Manager, please contact me. 

375
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,660
 A letter of resignation? What on earth is going on? 

376
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,200
  How could you do this to me? 

377
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,220
Gosh, seriously.

378
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,070
You got dessert today?

379
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,120
I got it after waiting a long time in line, so please enjoy.

380
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,600
Did that woman suggest this as well?

381
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,550
She didn't suggest it,

382
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,740
but it's true that we bought it together.

383
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,350
Give me a moment.

384
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,480
Yes, Yeong Eun?

385
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,490
Yes.

386
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,080
Yes, I got it.

387
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,890
That sounds good.

388
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,980
I'll do that.

389
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,660
All right.

390
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,910
What sounds good?

391
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,080
I'm...

392
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,580
going to meet Yeong Eun's parents tomorrow.

393
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,680
It's the end.

394
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,710
It's the beginning.

395
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:53,230
What's so great about white rice

396
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,560
that I spent my youth inhaling half air and half chalk dust

397
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,330
because I was so afraid of running out of it?

398
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,660
Now I am going to enjoy the rest of my life with my pension.

399
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,000
You know, they say the middle of your life starts at 60 years nowadays.

400
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,760
They say medicine has improved so you could easily live to 200.

401
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,190
You should eat up lots.

402
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,090
I couldn't even be sick with a cold comfortably.

403
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,470
I've lived a sincere life

404
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,360
all for the sake of my family.

405
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,550
Why are you eating that?

406
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:43,690
Every morning, I cooked this white rice and made soup.

407
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,820
All year, I ironed dress shirts.

408
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,270
- So I, too, have worked hard. 
 - That's mine though.

409
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,010
Did you put your name on it?

410
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,850
Who said it's yours?

411
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,660
I need to eat well too

412
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,240
so that I can get energy to move around.

413
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,870
- What will you do? 
 - As of today,

414
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,990
you're retiring from my life.

415
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,730
I'm going to send Yeong Eun off to marriage.

416
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,000
It's so good!

417
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,250
So this is what it tastes like!

418
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,780
To those who came to the Sambong Middle School's retirement honoring ceremony,

419
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,040
we thank you once again.

420
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,300
Next, we're going to be hearing a speech from

421
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,690
the president of the alumni association.

422
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,600
   

423
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:37,960
Teachers, you have taught us with warm love for so long,

424
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,750
and for that we thank you.

425
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:43,590
Our alumni association sends a round of applause to cheer

426
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:47,520
as you stand at the starting line of your new future.

427
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,310
Next up, we will hear

428
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,620
the retirement speech from vice principal Ha Taek Soo.

429
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,850
When will you show me?

430
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,060
- It's Dad's retirement ceremony. You should focus on him a little. 
 - As I stand here today,

431
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,590
rather than what I did well,

432
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,760
what I regret

433
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,080
comes to my mind more.

434
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,190
Now, my life as a teacher comes to an end,

435
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:22,550
and this second chapter of my life that I've been given,

436
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,830
I wish to write it anew

437
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,570
with my life's forever companion.

438
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,060
He wants to start a new life with you.

439
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,020
Why did he decide on such an important thing

440
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,640
however he wanted without asking me?

441
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,110
Is it a second chapter just in your life?

442
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,980
I have my life, too.

443
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,500
Teacher.

444
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,180
- You've worked so hard all this time. 
 - Thank you.

445
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,430
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

446
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,560
Stop being so late to school.

447
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,670
How great would it have been if there were four of us

448
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,290
including your husband on a day like this?

449
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,210
It's always just the three of us.

450
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,100
Oh, here.

451
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,870
Hello.

452
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,000
Say hi. These are my parents.

453
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,070
Nice to meet you. I'm Yoon Jae Gook.

454
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:24,320
Oh, yes, hello.

455
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,580
  This is Mrs. Min's son? 

456
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,160
  Why is Mrs. Min's son...? 

457
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,510
He's the person I'm dating, Mom.

458
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,040
Mother.

459
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,450
Jae Gook and that girl, their feelings are resolute.

460
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,410
Soo Wan died.

461
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,710
If that woman hadn't called for him that day,

462
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,040
I wouldn't have lost my fiancé,

463
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,660
and you would still have your son.

464
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,250
Yet you're saying you'll accept her?

465
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:11,000
- As Jae Gook's woman of all people? 
 - I can't lose my child again.

466
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,020
The only child I have left is Jae Gook.

467
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,300
- Mother. 
 - Even in my dreams,

468
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,970
I've never lived a day without remembering Soo Won.

469
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,720
Because

470
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,510
I'm a mother.

471
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,160
So that's why, Yoo Jeong,

472
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,560
in the end,

473
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,150
those two will not work out.

474
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,290
One, two.

475
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,310
- Looks great. 
 - We're finally four.

476
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,360
Yes, it looks good.

477
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,840
I can take a family picture.

478
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,510
Yes!

479
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,840
Him too.

480
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,440
We should take it together. Let's take it together!

481
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,910
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

482
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,890
Could you take a picture for us?

483
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,600
Yes.

484
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,970
Honey. Here.

485
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,450
- Taking it now. 
 - Get closer.

486
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,350
Sit here.

487
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,480
Up to what point did you two discuss about your relationship?

488
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,880
Seeing how you introduced us to him,

489
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,090
you guys are thinking of marriage, right?

490
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,250
I can't believe it.

491
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:54,570
How could you two be together?

492
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,650
I'm all for it.

493
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,650
I like him no matter what.

494
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,020
Mom, regard us keeping just what you saw

495
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,890
and felt today in mind.

496
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:14,230
- I'm asking this of you. 
 - I can't look at something else?

497
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,100
What's wrong?

498
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,030
What?

499
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,950
What did you just say?

500
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,950
Who?

501
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,890
Yoon Soo Wan.

502
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,230
He's my older brother.

503
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:39,320
It was ten years ago. The relationship only lasted two months.

504
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,520
- Close that mouth. 
 - It's not like it's been decided,

505
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,410
who I can like and who I can't.

506
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,290
He's his younger brother.

507
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,990
Does this look normal to you?

508
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,580
What's normal?

509
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,260
What's abnormal?

510
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,010
Who decides?

511
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,920
- Yeong Eun. 
 - Mom.

512
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,910
There are so many people in this world.

513
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:03,120
They all look, think, and live differently.

514
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,890
So how can there be a right answer?

515
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,600
Whose thoughts are right?

516
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,300
The wide path that others walk on is the correct one.

517
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,280
It is a flat and well-paved road.

518
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,510
Going on that road is correct.

519
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,020
The world is changing. Ways of thinking are changing too.

520
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,730
Things from your time that were not accepted are accepted now.

521
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:25,010
You're so blinded.

522
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,310
Why am I alive?

523
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,810
What have I been living for?

524
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,720
You should have fooled us completely instead.

525
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,510
I didn't want to do that to her parents.

526
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,210
It's not enough that just you two are happy.

527
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,670
You don't live alone in this world.

528
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,070
I heard you came from Paris.

529
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,940
You have a place to return to whenever you want.

530
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,410
If you leave like that, what about my daughter?

531
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,230
What about Yeong Eun?

532
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,860
Go to work. That's the way to help me.

533
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,800
All I did was to take you as my wife.

534
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,990
I never did anything for you.

535
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:49,590
Ji Min's dad, please at least let me feel comfortable.

536
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,940
If you're done eating, go lie down.

537
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,760
I'll go pick up Ji Min, so get some sleep.

538
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,860
   

539
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,880
I'll let it go only till today. Go to work starting tomorrow.

540
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,950
 What? 

541
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:30,230
I looked into a hospital.

542
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:33,690
I already took care of it so that you can get hospitalized right away. So pack what you need to take, got it?

543
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,710
Not you too.

544
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,160
I'm tired of repeating myself.

545
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,430
- Hey, Jeon Mi Sook, this isn't the time to be— 
 - Hanging up.

546
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,860
Why not hang up the clothes he wore instead?

547
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:03,200
 I'm in front of your apartment. 

548
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:13,360
I told him to send them for dry cleaning right away.

549
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,450
Are you crazy? How dare you come here?

550
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,340
Since you haven't replied to my texts after reading them!

551
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,790
Go. Hurry up and go.

552
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:28,390
What about me?

553
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,950
Let's go. Let's talk outside.

554
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,950
Assistant Manager Seo?

555
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,560
Hello.

556
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,050
Why did you come out?

557
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,670
It's cold. Go inside.

558
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:55,480
The CEO told me to come since there were some tasks still left to be transferred over to me.

559
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:01,790
I'm sorry. He'll be back at work soon but we made you come all this way.

560
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:02,930
It's okay.

561
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,970
Come in. Come in and talk.

562
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,350
No, no. We'll talk outside.

563
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,430
I just need a moment.

564
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,880
Come in, Assistant Manager Seo.

565
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,280
Come in.

566
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,590
Over here.

567
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,690
Honey, sit down.

568
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,160
Okay.

569
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,840
Please have a seat, Assistant Manager Seo.

570
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,390
Okay.

571
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,880
If you had called, I would have prepared something.

572
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,580
I couldn't get a hold of him. It seemed like he was very busy.

573
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,390
I stopped by while heading home.

574
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:06,000
Oh no. He keeps creating problems for you.

575
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,280
It's okay.

576
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,950
Please drink before it gets cold.

577
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,050
Thank you.

578
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:25,000
Honey, go in and get some rest.

579
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,280
Oh, look at me. I talked too much when she came by to see you.

580
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,380
- It's okay. 
 - Take your time.

581
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,460
I'll go to the dry cleaners then.

582
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,010
Okay.

583
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:55,420
♫  When you look deeply into my heart  ♫

584
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,260
♫  There is one small hole  ♫

585
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:09,690
♫  No one knew, even I didn't know  ♫

586
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:14,370
♫  It was growing  ♫

587
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:19,050
I fully expected my mom to react that way,

588
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,690
but now that it actually happened, it's harder than I thought it would be to deal with it.

589
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:29,820
Still, you dealt with it better than I thought.

590
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:33,620
I was worried that you might completely

591
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,520
lose the will to fight.

592
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,390
I'm not so far from it...

593
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:45,150
As soon as anyone adds one more opinion, I will be completely out of energy.

594
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:50,000
♫  Until the night passes  ♫

595
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,600
This won't do. Let's recharge.

596
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,370
♫  Hug me tightly  ♫

597
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:05,390
♫  Please hold my hand  ♫

598
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:09,780
♫  Please don't leave me alone  ♫

599
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,580
I love you.

600
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:19,550
♫  If you stay with me tonight  ♫

601
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:31,080
♫  I think I will be fine again  ♫

602
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,460
   

603
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:59,060
The sizes 55 and 66 were made in 1981.

604
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:04,790
That time, the average female height was 155 cm and bust width was 85 cm.

605
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,920
Size 55 was created by taking the last digit of the two values.

606
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,790
What? We were being pessimistic about not fitting into a size defined 40 years ago?

607
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:17,220
Based on last year's numbers, the average female height has increased by 6 cm since then.

608
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,350
Using a system from 40 years ago is just too much.

609
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,660
People buy to fit their hip size then get the waist size altered.

610
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,000
For coats, they buy to fit their shoulder width, then take the seam allowance to increase the sleeve length.

611
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,120
It's wrong to take that as a given.

612
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,280
Body types and builds have become diverse.

613
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,160
It's only right for us also to make different sizes.

614
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,580
The report should focus on the problem of the sizing system and the need to increase number of sizes offered, right?

615
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,030
Yes.

616
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:41,670
Why are you alone? What about Chi Hyeong?

617
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,990
He went out for work.

618
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,230
Ah, I'm so tired. This work life really isn't for me.

619
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:52,800
You're coming here empty-handed, so I wonder why you're tired.

620
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,880
Sunbae, work isn't always done at the desk at the workplace.

621
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,690
I just had a meal with Hye Rin.

622
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:03,070
I told you to help out So Yeong since the samples are coming in today.

623
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:06,390
All of this happened because I was trying to help Jeong So Yeong.

624
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:10,140
If you all understood how big a sacrifice I'm making right now,

625
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:14,230
you'll revalue my love for this team and this company.

626
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:18,080
- We're missing one thing. I'll go check and bring it. 
 - Okay.

627
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,480
What are you doing?

628
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,830
Me?

629
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,980
Give it to me. I'll bring it.

630
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:38,150
It's fine. I'll do it.

631
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,550
I said I'll do it.

632
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:43,720
I won't say anything about you coming to work as a hobby,

633
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,090
but I'd like it if you didn't use me as an excuse.

634
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,130
It's offensive that someone, who thinks living life is the easiest thing because he will become an assistant manager

635
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:52,240
and then a senior manager when the time is right, is using me, who works hard, as an excuse.

636
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,790
- Excuse me. 
 - I moved all of the boxes by myself.

637
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:59,250
Isn't it embarrassing to take the credit for other's hard work?

638
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,770
   

639
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:19,330
Ah, changing the pants length per hip size.

640
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:22,190
Adjusting the sleeve length based on the shoulder width, too?

641
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:25,960
Sonó is such a friendly brand.

642
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,320
When sizes change and new patterns are created, we need to make at least 100 copies for training!

643
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,760
To make one blouse, we draw it a hundred, a thousand times until we get it right.

644
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,540
Then, we alter it. And after quality check, we make more alterations.

645
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:41,560
To achieve this, we need three factories operating. Then what will happen to the other clothes in the meantime?

646
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,660
And after all that, what if stock just piles up?

647
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,390
Will you take all of the responsibility?

648
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:49,530
How much longer will we hold on to an outdated sizing system from 40 years ago?

649
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:52,120
Body types have changed, and the clothes that people want are changing.

650
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,750
Despite that, people fit themselves well into the sizes and buy them just fine!

651
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,990
Why does the body have to fit to the clothes?

652
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:01,410
- The clothes should fit to the body. 
 - Really, will you keep talking back to me?

653
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:06,700
Should I bring it up to the director or the CEO directly?

654
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:14,560
Ah, seriously... seriously!

655
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:19,320
I'm going to think about it for one more minute.

656
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,770
She's back.

657
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:29,730
How did it go?

658
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,460
   

659
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:41,550
Awesome!

660
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,690
- Great! 
 - All right, let's get busy again.

661
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:47,200
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

662
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,360
Let's go!

663
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,370
Here.

664
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:56,300
Did you come here today to ask me to go easy on her again?

665
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,770
That'd be nice.

666
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:01,990
But I really did want to eat with you.

667
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:04,990
It'll get cold. Hurry and eat.

668
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:14,110
Oh, and... I'm going to start a new job.

669
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:15,600
What job?

670
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,420
Now, I want to take pictures of people, not clothes.

671
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,720
  Let's take it together. 

672
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,050
 I was always wandering around. 

673
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:32,000
 Get closer. Closer. 

674
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,810
 Because there was no place to settle my heart. 

675
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,490
 Because there was no place to put it. 

676
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,790
Being too close to, bumping into, and bothering each other.

677
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:52,220
It felt nice. I wanted to keep doing it.

678
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:58,160
To take pictures of people, you need to know who they are,

679
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,020
what they're like, and what they like in order to express them.

680
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:08,880
Are you two perhaps even thinking of marriage?

681
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,400
If she wants to.

682
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:22,870
Do you want to bring her home once?

683
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:29,040
I want to make her a meal.

684
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,540
Mother.

685
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,450
Bring her home.

686
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,230
What's all of this?

687
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:58,330
You want to go back to your student life in Paris?

688
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:03,190
It's been a while but I'm using the skills I had to practice twice because I had to do your homework too.

689
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:07,140
It will take too long to complete by myself, so you can assist me this time.

690
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:10,690
I'm already feeling so upset and sad from thinking about Mi Sook.

691
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:13,600
I don't want to feel annoyance from assisting you on top of that.

692
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,840
Whatever it is, work hard.

693
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,980
These are clothes for Mi Sook.

694
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,310
The clothes she bought with courage,

695
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:27,400
the clothes she rashly bought when she was happy,

696
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,550
the clothes she wore for the preschool event,

697
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:33,510
and the clothes she wore to look cool on her wedding anniversary.

698
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:37,050
These are all a part of her past,

699
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:39,960
so I couldn't just leave them in the donation box.

700
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:43,450
If they're too big, we can make them smaller.

701
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:46,540
If they get bigger, we can re-make them even smaller.

702
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:50,630
What should I do?

703
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:54,910
We need to shorten the length, so cut the hem.

704
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:57,580
I'm the best with scissors.

705
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,960
- From here? 
 - Yeah.

706
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:17,660
How is it? Do I look good?

707
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:21,500
As expected, whoever the designer was that reformed it is amazing.

708
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,360
Can you tell whoever it is that she wouldn't have been able to finish if it hadn't been for the assistant?

709
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,260
Hey! I used to be a rising model years ago.

710
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,840
Even though it was for a short time.

711
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,640
Anyway, this skinny body

712
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,800
is completing your work. What do you say?

713
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,060
- You're right. 
 - 100%.

714
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,460
It's so pretty.

715
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,990
When did you wear this?

716
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:42,480
For Ji Min's first birthday photo shoot.

717
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,410
Oh, this is that?

718
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:46,720
Try this on, too. This will complete the look.

719
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,850
Wasn't this long before? Did you buy it?

720
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:50,500
- No... Is this the long coat? 
 - Yeah.

721
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,770
I cropped it.

722
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,240
- She's acting like she did it all by herself again! 
 - It's a disease. A disease.

723
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,510
I did the scissoring myself.

724
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,310
Oh, you're all so skilled.

725
00:50:58,310 --> 00:50:59,680
It makes your legs look long. It's pretty.

726
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,310
Yeah, I wanted to buy something like this. People wear it a lot these days.

727
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,450
A cropped jacket like this.

728
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,060
I think I'll get treatment.

729
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,070
Mi Sook.

730
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,510
Jeon Mi Sook!

731
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:20,220
I was just thinking about throwing it away.

732
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:23,360
I didn't know there were other methods.

733
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,740
If I want to say goodbye well,

734
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,560
I need to live well first.

735
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,060
I'm going to try till the end.

736
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,770
"You did well."

737
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,880
"You did all that you could."

738
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,600
So I won't have any regrets.

739
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,850
Thanks, Mi Sook.

740
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,360
Thank you.

741
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,680
Go to the VIP room.

742
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,810
Yeah, let me use that money of yours.

743
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,910
Hey, these clothes are calling for you to walk. Go walk!

744
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,950
Show us your walk.

745
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:54,250
Let's go with the power walk.

746
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:56,780
Oh, your walk is still great.

747
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,190
- Your talent didn't go anywhere! 
 - It's still great!

748
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,470
Let's see.

749
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:03,030
What is that?

750
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:07,260
Hey, it's good that I lost weight! It makes these clothes look so good.

751
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,940
Saying goodbye is also a method of love.

752
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,980
It's been 20 years, since I was 18.

753
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,420
I've spent half of my life with her.

754
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,060
"Okay, yeah."

755
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,860
"Goodbye."

756
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,620
How can I do that?

757
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,930
Does saying goodbye

758
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:34,120
always have to be mushy and full of affection?

759
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:37,660
That's just a stereotype.

760
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,750
You should ease her heart before she passes.

761
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:43,960
That's love, too.

762
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:55,030
Love doesn't have just one side to it.

763
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,490
Can I lean on you?

764
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:02,800
Why do you even ask?

765
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,720
My shoulder is yours whenever you need it.

766
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,720
Whenever.

767
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:21,520
♫   Please lean on me for a moment with your eyes closed  ♫

768
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:27,260
♫   Please do not worry about anything   ♫

769
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:35,510
♫  These past days, do not look back at them  ♫

770
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:40,430
♫   Let them go now   ♫

771
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:49,680
♫   You can fall asleep   ♫

772
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,870
Hello!

773
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:02,160
Nice to meet you.

774
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,310
I've come to see Director Hwang Chi Sook.

775
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:07,500
- You're going to drink coffee, right? 
 - Yes.

776
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,000
I've come to see Director Hwang Chi Sook.

777
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,020
Hello, CEO.

778
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:22,440
I actually had a reason to come here, so I thought I might as well.

779
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,230
Do you like flowers, by any chance?

780
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,690
Follow me.

781
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,780
   
   
   

782
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,270
You were born in 1982, the year of the black dog.

783
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:39,560
Is that true?

784
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,760
Although I look young for my age, that's right.

785
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,240
When was your company established?

786
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,050
Yes! Vision PR was established eight years ago with the spirit of five members.

787
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:50,320
We currently have about 400 employees,

788
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,270
and as the center of the domestic fashion industry,

789
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:55,920
we are in charge of top tier brands' shows.

790
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,430
Do you know that Chi Sook's unrequited love

791
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:11,180
was always rejected?

792
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,920
Is that so?

793
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,030
She's only liked people who look like models.

794
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:19,300
But... she's dating you?

795
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,320
If you get to know me, I'm pretty charming.

796
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,120
The incident from that day.

797
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,890
Was it mutual or one-sided?

798
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:27,320
Oh, that incident.

799
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,140
If you think it's mutual, it's mutual.

800
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,770
If you think it's one-sided, it's one-sided.

801
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:35,080
You two planned it, right?

802
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,560
  It's a short-term contract. 

803
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,490
 I would say we are a show window couple for business reasons. 

804
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:40,970
 We can never get caught, okay? 

805
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:44,240
 My dad hates being deceived the most. 

806
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,890
Why aren't you answering?

807
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,840
I'm sorry.

808
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,670
You can't lie?

809
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:53,770
I'm sorry.

810
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:56,180
So how sincere are you?

811
00:55:56,180 --> 00:56:00,290
I am 100% sincere.

812
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,850
I confessed my feelings...

813
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:04,620
but I was rejected.

814
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:08,870
You truly have the desire to date Chi Sook?

815
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:10,230
Although we are a short-term couple by contract,

816
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:13,430
I want to be with her in that way at least.

817
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,590
Keep me updated from now on.

818
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:24,630
- What? 
 - Hey! If you want to date her,

819
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:26,340
you need to do something with that hair first.

820
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,910
Oh, this is my signature.

821
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:29,170
You don't like Chi Sook that much?

822
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:31,240
CEO, please respect my hair.

823
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:36,150
You little rascal, my kid only looks at the face alone!

824
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,780
What kind of style would be best?

825
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:52,600
Foreigners will order thousands of yards so why would I sell just a little?

826
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,610
It's not like you will even pay full price.

827
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,780
You'll try to lower the price from the beginning saying it's domestic.

828
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,760
We won't sell less than 1,000 yards.

829
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,220
We don't want to have too much in stock.

830
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,970
So basically it's hard for both sides right now.

831
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:07,130
Then there's no other way. It has to be done the way it has been done.

832
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:10,450
How many yards of the tweed do you want?

833
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:22,120
Even if we start developing new materials, it'll take at least three months.

834
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,570
What if the result is not really anything good?

835
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:26,680
It's not like we can take responsibility for all of it. We can't do this.

836
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,360
We have the skills to easily outdo the Japanese or Italians.

837
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,980
But it feels quite stifling to know that we have to keep this for another time.

838
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,630
For now, set up the meeting. Maybe we'll find a solution then.

839
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:38,570
So Yeong, take Chi Hyeong with you and go to the warehouse.

840
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:41,120
It seems like they are complaining about not getting any support.

841
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,660
Okay.

842
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:48,350
Noona, I am very sensitive to dust and scents.

843
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,980
Wear a mask and go.

844
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:55,330
Hold it properly.

845
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:03,550
Here.

846
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,610
With this, I'm done.

847
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:22,100
The dust here is no joke.

848
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:26,740
Let's shower my throat with iced Americano.

849
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:29,130
We have to quality check and separate out the ones that don't meet expectation.

850
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,310
What is that?

851
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:35,950
Ones that came out smaller than the spec sheet due to shrinkage and ones that have dyeing faults.

852
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:38,530
We have to separate them out and return them.

853
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:44,040
Look here... if you live without resting, your joints will give out.

854
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,730
- You guys are Sonó's newest employees? 
 - Yes.

855
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:48,880
After the quality check, trim the hanging threads too.

856
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,900
There's a thread snipper over there.

857
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,030
Us?

858
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,770
I will give a good report to your team leader.

859
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,480
I can't do this any longer.

860
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,840
Before I shrink, I will leave now.

861
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,990
Stop right there!

862
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,250
You need to do your part before leaving.

863
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,680
I said that I don't have any intention of doing more.

864
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,490
I don't want to do it.

865
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:16,880
Do it.

866
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,030
I said that I won't do it.

867
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,960
You came? What about Jae Gook?

868
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,410
There was suddenly an opening for a photo studio,

869
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:29,290
so he said he would come after looking at it.

870
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:31,030
He's probably on his way.

871
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:33,320
I see. Come inside.

872
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:37,470
I bought something that's not too sweet.

873
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:40,400
Place it down anywhere in this area.

874
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,850
Should I help you with anything?

875
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:51,000
Wash your hands first.

876
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,800
The bathroom is at the top of the stairs.

877
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,040
Yes.

878
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,210
Because a child is not something that can be erased or swept aside.

879
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:06,890
I am the same as I was 10 years ago.

880
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:11,590
Jae Gook is probably the same.

881
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:16,560
Soo Wan will always be next to Jae Gook.

882
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:21,400
The people who know Soo Wan and traces of Soo Wan

883
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,250
will probably remain forever.

884
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:27,320
Saying that you want to go all the way with Jae Gook

885
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,910
means that you will endure it all.

886
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:34,000
As if you are not fazed, shamelessly...

887
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,700
Will you be able to do that?

888
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:09,440
 A scary but clear reality. 

889
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,210
 A persistent and harsh perception. 

890
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:16,090
Mother, I am here.

891
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:19,570
Yes, Jae Gook. It's all done. Come on in.

892
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:32,780
Yeong Eun, I ran over because I thought I was going to be late.

893
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:36,360
The table is ready. Come and sit down.

894
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:38,940
I'm sorry.

895
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:44,390
I'm sorry. I will leave first.

896
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,160
For what reason did you leave it opened?

897
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:10,360
I wanted to confirm if she can really overcome Soo Wan.

898
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,300
I told you she can't.

899
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:16,270
She won't ever overcome it.

900
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,610
Let's go together.

901
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:35,880
- You see, I... 
 - I know.

902
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,490
I know why you are acting this way,

903
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,720
so you don't have to say anything.

904
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:44,700
Stay together with me.

905
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:15,320
   

906
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:20,450
It's my photo studio.

907
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:24,740
I did run away.

908
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:30,520
When I saw Soo Wan's room,

909
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,960
I totally lost my will to fight.

910
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:39,740
For two months, I am going to do a pop-up here where I only shoot photos of people.

911
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:43,650
Your mother was right.

912
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:45,970
How can I overcome this?

913
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:53,410
After that, if I want to shoot more photos, I might just settle down here.

914
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:56,620
Imagining it in your head...

915
01:04:56,620 --> 01:05:01,560
and experiencing it in real life were really this different.

916
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:08,360
I didn't try to get permission from my mom.

917
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:14,280
If she really must disapprove, then there's nothing that we can do.

918
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,890
No matter what anyone says...

919
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:23,210
I will go on my path with you.

920
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:31,250
 The four of us can't live together. 

921
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:33,710
 Burying one child in my heart, 

922
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:36,320
 and seeing the woman who took him away from me 

923
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:39,310
 smile with the child I have left... 

924
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:43,260
 As a mother, I just can't bear to see that. 

925
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:46,350
 Is this something that cannot be possible to this extent? 

926
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:49,630
 But if you still say you will go, then you must go. 

927
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:51,800
 What can I do? 

928
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:58,220
 But I... will be gone. 

929
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:02,050
 Is this something to be this cruel about? 

930
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:08,280
I regret it...

931
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:18,640
To the point where I want to cut out those two months from ten years ago...

932
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,990
I regret it so much.

933
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:30,020
To the point that I regret all those times for the first time,

934
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,140
I love you.

935
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,230
That's why I'm so sorry.

 Yeong Eun, you shouldn't go down this road. Don't go.  

951
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:28,490
 - Mom. 
- Your daughter should stop.  

952
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:29,480
 Is it my daughter's fault? 

953
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,780
 You should at the very least be sorry and not do this. 

954
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:37,330
 That's it, right there. The big, bright eyes and the straight nose bridge. 

955
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:39,150
 You changed completely. 

956
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:41,110
 Just wait, Chi Sook! 

957
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:42,640
 While you're at it, why don't you seal the deal? 

958
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,430
 Tonight? 

959
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:45,600
 I'm confused. 

960
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,140
 My body speaks to me everyday with aches, Yeong Eun.  

961
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:51,250
 We're near my house. 

962
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:53,250
 I still need you. 

963
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:56,810
 So this is the place where my Cookie wants to start his new life. 

964
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:57,950
 We want to take a picture. 

965
01:08:57,950 --> 01:09:00,080
 You said that you wanted to take a picture before you started chemotherapy. 

966
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,800
 - Okay. 
- Leave your body to the rhythm of the music. 

967
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,040
 Look at me, look at me.  

968
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:06,470
 Those who are left behind have to live with only the memories of their passed one. 

969
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:09,920
 You are quite selfish. That isn't love. That's greed. 

970
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,340
 What's your reason for going this far? Why exactly are you doing this? 

971
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:16,750
 It seems that you don't know anything. Ten years ago, Hyung had already... 

972
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:19,720
♫  Do you know the love drawn inside me  ♫

973
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:24,870
♫  I am waiting only for you  ♫

974
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:29,450
♫  After this long night ends  ♫

975
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:39,370
