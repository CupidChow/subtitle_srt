2
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,190
   

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,930
   

4
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,150
   
   

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:33,280
 Timing and subtitles brought to you by 
 Are You The One Team @ Viki 

6
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,000
   

7
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,610
 What are clothes? 

8
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,500
 It's a question I ask myself every day. 

9
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,200
 Which clothes will you wear? 

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,590
  Who will you be? What kind of life will you lead? 

11
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,190
- Yeong Eun. 
 - Yes, CEO?

12
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,110
When I finished business high school and headed straight to Dongdaemun,

13
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,990
it was very cold since spring had not yet come.

14
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:14,770
But the reason why it was colder was because I had no roof or walls for shelter.

15
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:20,310
I became painfully aware then how it feels

16
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,820
to continue day after day while being hit by the cold wind.

17
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,460
 The life I'm given: a safe choice. 

18
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,420
I will accept the challenge.

19
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,800
 The life I want: the courage to break, shatter, and even fail at times. 

20
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,780
Hey, Yeong Eun!

21
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,040
I mean, Team Leader Ha. What are you saying right now?

22
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,120
I heard you are leaving by yourself.

23
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,060
 Some might say I am behind the trend.  

24
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,470
 Some might say it doesn't suit me.  

25
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:57,530
 But good clothes are the clothes that I want 

26
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,850
 and the clothes that suit me the best. 

27
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,940
Thank you, Yoon Jae Gook,

28
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,150
for loving me.

29
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,850
For allowing me to love.

30
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,490
Now, I won't be afraid.

31
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,940
Just like we loved, with that strength,

32
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,280
I will live on.

33
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:42,020
 One article of clothing, buried deep in my closet, is asking me, 

34
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,380
 "What will you live as?" 

35
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,360
 I responded, "I will live as myself." 

36
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,840
     

37
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,410
   

38
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,710
   

39
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,760
Yeong Eun, are you really leaving?

40
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,020
Thank you for everything.

41
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,720
Noona, I'll ask you one last time.

42
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,920
Why exactly are you quitting?

43
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,750
I want to do my own designs before it's too late.

44
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,280
Do them! I'm telling you to do them.

45
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,970
Whether you do them here or with Sonó after you leave, you can do them.

46
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:33,850
You know that maintaining Sonó's color and signature

47
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,920
while doing something new is not realistic.

48
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,340
I will start with an empty sketchbook with nothing drawn inside.

49
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,380
It's well-spoken but there is a reason why no one was able to do it yet.

50
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,720
The severance pay must be quite reliable.

51
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,950
Factory, fabric, subsidiary materials...

52
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,610
by meeting the minimum quantity required for production,

53
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,160
losing millions to tens of million wons is reality.

54
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,750
Here, the CEO and Director tell her how amazing she is and how well she's doing,

55
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,050
so everyone else thinks that that's how things are.

56
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,290
Everyone talked about Sonó so much that I thought we could not survive without Sonó.

57
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,980
But I guess that's not it either.

58
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,500
   

59
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,940
What about Sonó?

60
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,860
Team Leader, you launched it and led it to this point.

61
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,140
The CEO acknowledges it also which is why he asked you to go independent.

62
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,920
Yes... that's what I thought too.

63
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,610
But it turns out, that's not it.

64
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,000
What are you talking about now?

65
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,220
Na Ri and Seon Joo spent their twenties here.

66
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,930
The seamstress, the pattern maker, the director, the chief...

67
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,940
just like me, they all spent 10 years with Sonó.

68
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,370
So why is Sonó mine? It's all of ours.

69
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,970
Yes, that's true.

70
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,260
Since we're on the subject, these two wrinkles were drawn by Sonó.

71
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,320
- That's not fair. 
 - What's not fair, Manager Nam?

72
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,410
- How were those drawn by Sonó? 
 - One of the two was drawn by you.

73
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,600
- Then have you not thought of me and the team leader's wrinkles? 
 - One of them was drawn by you.

74
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,220
Then have you thought of my wrinkles?

75
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,930
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,030
Hey girl! We're turning forty really soon.

77
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,780
When you're in your twenties, your metabolism is fast,

78
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,110
so when you're tired, sleeping makes you feel refreshed.

79
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,400
But you're going to leave and go independent at this age?

80
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,970
Why are you making things harder for yourself?

81
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,220
It's fortunate I'm doing it before I'm fifty, isn't it?

82
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,970
You bad wench...

83
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,360
It seems that I am never going to be your real friend until the end.

84
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,360
Because I decided on my own without a discussion?

85
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,810
Chi Sook.

86
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,380
What?

87
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:37,650
My twenties and thirties were difficult and exhausting.

88
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,950
If it weren't for you, I probably would have struggled more.

89
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,760
It wasn't more difficult because of me?

90
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,730
The reason I covered for you whenever you caused problems

91
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,650
wasn't because you were a director or because I wanted to receive a good performance rating.

92
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,660
It was because you are you.

93
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,930
I did it because you were my friend.

94
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,590
Because it was my friend's mistake.

95
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:08,430
Thanks to the shelter you provided, I was able to do so many things.

96
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,100
You went easy on me

97
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,020
much more than I went easy on you.

98
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,930
Thank you.

99
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,220
We won't be working together, but I'm not going anywhere.

100
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,940
I'll continue to be your friend, a real friend.

101
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,050
Why is everyone acting like that?

102
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,170
- Team Leader... 
 - Thank you for everything.

103
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,320
I was able to do it thanks to all of you.

104
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,650
But Team Leader, why aren't you asking us to leave with you?

105
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,920
Being independent sounds nice, but I will be starting from scratch.

106
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,900
This business may disappear in a year or even before that.

107
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,180
Nothing is for sure,

108
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,380
so I don't want to burden you guys who are working well already for my sake.

109
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,810
But Noona... Do you...

110
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,510
It's a personal question.

111
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,740
A question that I'm asking someone very special, whom I've seen since I was in elementary school.

112
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,120
- Are you asking if I have a plan? 
 - You must.

113
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,090
Because you're a very realistic and wise person.

114
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,800
I do.

115
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,350
It's something that everyone would say is impossible, but it's something I want to do.

116
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,960
So do you have a plan or not?

117
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,960
Take care of Sonó.

118
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,700
- What about the price tag? - It's here.

119
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,130
Hold on...

120
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,060
Don't you think we should fix the waistline?

121
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,560
Just a minute. Then...

122
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,300
I think we'll have to change the buttons.

123
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,800
- Change the buttons? 
 - Yes.

124
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,990
It doesn't go with this color.

125
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,570
You're quite impressive. Leaving Sonó behind.

126
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,600
You are very different from me to the end, Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun.

127
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,910
We are exactly the same in that we want to do well and make nice clothes.

128
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,420
I'm still going to get jealous and envy you.

129
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,680
So I will continue to wonder how you're doing.

130
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,060
I'll take it as an encouragement to do well.

131
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,050
   

132
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,460
   

133
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,160
   
   

134
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,260
   

135
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,450
Stay well.

136
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,030
Please eat. This extreme amount of sugar will raise your spirits a little.

137
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,030
I really don't get it.

138
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,520
If the silk blanket has been spread for her, she should know to roll around.

139
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,940
Why is she leaving instead?

140
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:42,750
A monthly wage gives stability for exactly one month, but it is quite difficult to give up.

141
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,400
Even so, Team Leader Ha made a difficult decision.

142
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,390
How is she going to get a factory and fabric without a company?

143
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,170
She's going to have to run around by herself!

144
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,350
But days where she smiles will be more frequent.

145
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,090
- Because she's doing what she wants? 
 - Yes.

146
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,790
So don't worry and root for her!

147
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,650
Aren't you her real friend?

148
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,530
This girl... that's exactly how she said it, so I can't hold on to her!

149
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,640
Anyone can worry for her,

150
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,680
but the only ones who can sincerely wish for her to succeed are her true friends.

151
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,740
I'm going to work really hard for Sonó.

152
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,110
I worked on Sonó with her.

153
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,170
She'll worry if things go wrong without her.

154
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,930
You're so cool.

155
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,680
There's no support more secure than the person left behind living diligently in the position left behind.

156
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,220
I will root for you very passionately.

157
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,950
Because my feelings for you are also real.

158
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,570
But... how is Soo Ho doing?

159
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,350
The extent of your wife's love for Ji Min

160
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,460
and how much she loves you...

161
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,510
I am in no place to speculate

162
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,700
nor do I even have a way to ask for forgiveness.

163
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,990
I'm in the same position.

164
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:35,400
If Ji Min needs an older sister as she grows up, I'll help at any time.

165
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,110
At the very least, I want to apologize to your wife this way.

166
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:46,310
And I'll see you as nothing but a good superior.

167
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,630
♫  Whenever I take a step forward  ♫

168
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,590
 Don't open the pickles right off the bat. 

169
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,230
 You can't get fish sauce and plum extract mixed up! 

170
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,580
I know, I know. Even I can tell them apart now.

171
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,590
 As for soy sauce for soup, don't buy it at the store. 

172
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:28,280
 Use what my mother makes in order for the soup to be flavorful and delicious. 

173
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,980
Dad, I'm all done!

174
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,930
Okay! I'll bring in your underwear in just a second!

175
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:38,850
♫  Stay with me always  ♫

176
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:46,320
♫  I said that like a fool  ♫

177
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:54,180
♫  Because it's you, I hold your hand because it's you  ♫

178
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,820
♫  Even if I run away for a long time again  ♫

179
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,140
 When she starts budding, around third grade, 

180
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,630
 use juniors' first stage. 

181
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,980
   

182
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,130
   

183
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,120
 For when she's going through puberty around fifth grade, 

184
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,570
 here is a secret diary with a lock and key. 

185
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,390
♫  Being filled with memories which are our painful memories  ♫

186
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:40,730
♫  I think I can smile brightly   ♫

187
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:45,000
 Show this to her when she's having trouble with friends in middle school. 

188
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,970
♫  Because it's you, I hold your hand because it's you  ♫

189
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,960
 You have a lot of friends and are a very loved child. 

190
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,170
♫  To be with you forever  ♫

191
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,230
Dad, hurry!

192
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,100
Okay! I'll be there in a second!

193
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,000
♫  Like my unchanging heart, forevermore  ♫

194
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,410
I won't be able to do this as well as you.

195
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,620
But I still...

196
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,060
will do my best.

197
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,120
Don't worry about anything, okay?

198
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,390
What did you just say?

199
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,650
- I said I quit working at the company. 
 - When?

200
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,430
I left today.

201
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,060
Why?

202
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,560
I'm just like you.

203
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,690
My life so far wasn't all bad.

204
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,970
There were good times, and it was quite worthwhile.

205
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,920
But now, I want to do what I've really wanted to do

206
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,290
and what I've been putting off due to my lack of confidence.

207
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,300
I'm sorry for not being a daughter with an impressive position at a large company.

208
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,030
Crazy wench, who asked you to be that?

209
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,060
You went through a lot

210
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,500
working and dutifully being your mother and father's daughter...

211
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,780
There aren't any other daughters like you.

212
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:30,160
But, Mom, I'm empty-handed at the moment.

213
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,110
Nothing is set in stone.

214
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,260
Then what are you going to do?

215
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,130
I know, right? I'm too aimless, aren't I?

216
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:44,380
But Mom, I really like where I am right now.

217
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:51,650
It feels like I have taken off clothes that had been tight on my body.

218
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,690
I can breathe better, and I feel like I could just run around.

219
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,620
There's a possibility that it might not work out.

220
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,620
It might even fail.

221
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,420
But I don't think I'll regret it.

222
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,960
So what if it fails? I'll give that a shot.

223
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,100
Mom, I...

224
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,050
am a bit proud of myself

225
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:22,780
for having confidence alone with no plan.

226
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,280
Whatever happens, if you're happy, I'm happy.

227
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,720
How reassuring!

228
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,360
As expected, Mom's support is the best in the world!

229
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,720
You call this support?

230
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,340
My mom...

231
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,050
My daughter!

232
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,260
   

233
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,540
   

234
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,680
 I don't know how long it will take. 

235
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,290
 But this time, 

236
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,660
 I'll reach you 

237
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,660
 on my own strength through my clothes. 

238
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,060
I won't be doing any of that interior design whatnot.

239
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,910
If we say we'll be repairing the house,

240
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,140
Yeong Eun will worry for no reason!

241
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,160
Are you saying that because of money?

242
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,770
Don't worry. We have enough money.

243
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,130
Why would you spend that on the house?

244
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,480
We should leave it alone and split it as alimony.

245
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,310
It's been 15 years since we've done the wallpaper!

246
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:23,190
Even the interior designer said that if we peel back the wallpaper, there will be mold everywhere.

247
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,270
And you were the one who wouldn't stop talking about the sink cabinet!

248
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,000
Why would we put up new wallpaper?

249
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,630
Do we have a young child? Did someone draw on the walls or peel it off?

250
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,050
As for the sink cabinet door hanging off?

251
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,600
I can just tighten the screws and keep using it.

252
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,100
I don't want to hear about your resentments anymore.

253
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,020
I'll just fix what's been ruined while I've lived with you and leave.

254
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,480
Forget it.

255
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,750
As for the wallpaper, Yeong Eun made a big decision

256
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,660
and spent her bonus on it.

257
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,300
As for the sink cabinet, I got that instead of going on a trip to Thailand with you.

258
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:01,060
My daughter's heart and what was supposed to be my first trip abroad are a part of them.

259
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,200
Who gave you the right to take them down?

260
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,200
As life goes on, you get hit by wind and rain,

261
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,310
and things get worn down.

262
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,020
Not everything is good, but not everything is bad either.

263
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,100
- Even with me? 
 - Don't try and sneak a leg in the door now.

264
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,960
Hurry and stamp the document!

265
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,530
 It's boiling! Open the lid. 

266
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,800
 Put in the sliced tofu. 

267
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,530
 You can do it alone next time, right? 

268
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:10,040
 Since you've practiced, cook for yourself at least once or twice a week. 

269
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,620
Yes, hello?

270
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,810
The fabric? That's...

271
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,140
Hold on a second, oh no! The signal is weak, I can't really hear you...

272
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,280
Yes, hello. This is Sonó's design room. 
    

273
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,540
Oh we didn't ask for a thousand yards, but... 
    

274
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,430
   

275
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,690
- Let's go with a large collar and shorten the sleeve length. 
 - Okay.

276
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,450
Can you grab the sleeve?

277
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,960
We should shorten it here.

278
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,310
- Team Leader Ha! 
 - Oh my god!

279
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,700
That's not the entrance!

280
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,420
She's not here.

281
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,570
Manager Nam, this is the list of orders.

282
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,260
Contact the factory to increase the quantity.

283
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,620
Okay.

284
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,240
Oh right, the incentives for the Sonó team have come out.

285
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,690
- Oh, really? 
 - Really?

286
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,720
How much is it?

287
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,510
After doing all the work...

288
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,910
She should have left after enjoying it.

289
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,680
Done!

290
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:50,980
This girl Yeong Eun, is she doing okay?

291
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,180
Executive Kang, how are you doing?

292
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:58,960
Above other things, I've ended up going independent.

293
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,540
Yes, this is Ha Yeong Eun.

294
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,180
I'm calling about the mini line we discussed previously.

295
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,530
All of your bulk orders are full?

296
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,660
Well, it can't be helped.

297
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,420
Hello, President Park.

298
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,990
Is Team Leader Ha launching her own brand?

299
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,660
Did you agree to do it with her?

300
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,410
I did receive a call,

301
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,200
 but you can't make money making a mini-line. 

302
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,040
I didn't really have anything good to say so I didn't answer.

303
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,830
President Kim, is the minimum still 1,000 yards even for an individual?

304
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,290
Team Leader is just launching a private brand.

305
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,070
How can she order 1000 yards?

306
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:37,170
So you didn't offer a fabric contract to her?

307
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,480
Yes, Sir. Have you been well?

308
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,540
Last time, you told me you knew of a good pattern maker.

309
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:52,570
You have to make at least 100 pieces for patterns to have any profit margin.

310
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,750
You don't work with any individuals?

311
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,920
Because of the prints. Of course, I've saved all the prints separately.

312
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,280
Yes, I'll come right away. Yes.

313
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,080
I didn't know you'd really come.

314
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,020
I thought you were just asking.

315
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,900
If you ordered a lot, I'd do it for you even today.

316
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,410
But this amount is difficult even after considering that it's for an independent label.

317
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,900
Then how much?

318
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,050
It costs 300,000 won just to cut one pattern for the design.

319
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:29,100
We have to print out at least 3,000 pieces to give my workers their salary.

320
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,290
I see.

321
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,710
President.

322
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,090
Yes, I'm coming.

323
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,050
Go ahead.

324
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,920
   

325
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,710
 Not even one person showed up? 

326
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,810
 You really aren't made for a business life. 

327
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,800
 What do you think people look at when they see their photos? 

328
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:13,690
 For me, a woman who bought my picture, 

329
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,120
 that no one else glanced at, changed my life. 

330
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,600
 Because of that, when I was about to give up on photography, 

331
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,860
 I didn't end up doing that. 

332
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,220
 Now, I won't be afraid. 

333
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:32,610
 Just like we loved, with that strength, 

334
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,290
 I will live on. 

335
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,230
Yes, President. This is Ha Yeong Eun.

336
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,830
I came to make my own independent label.

337
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,110
Yes.

338
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,500
There are nothing but roadblocks from all directions.

339
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,190
In the end, money is the problem.

340
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,080
Of course, if your order amount is small, the labor costs are high.

341
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,950
Some places can't trust you, so they ask you to bring cash.

342
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,570
If your payment is late by one day for any reason, they immediately hold your product hostage.

343
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,160
Then there's no one who will work with her?

344
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,840
No one.

345
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,150
Let's work.

346
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,410
- Oh my! I'm so surprised. 
 - Gosh, I was so surprised.

347
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,510
Why do you keep sneaking around the back?

348
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,140
Chief, what are you doing in someone else's office?

349
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,650
"Someone else's?"

350
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,310
Am I "someone else?"

351
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,110
Until when will I be "someone else?" Why am I "someone else?"

352
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,130
And did I come somewhere I shouldn't?

353
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,420
That's enough.

354
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,350
Anyone who has seen Team Leader Ha's sketchbook raise their hand.

355
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,530
Sketchbook?

356
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,540
What is she doing?

357
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,530
Oh my, crazy wench.

358
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,660
That's why she doesn't have anyone willing to work with her.

359
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,590
If she ignores all the trends, will it sell?

360
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,330
Brands cut patterns and put them on celebrities.

361
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,900
Then you and I follow them and wear it.

362
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,320
Trends are when the same clothes make rounds around the neighborhood,

363
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,050
but will I truly become hot because I wear that?

364
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:13,700
No. The person who can digest their own style properly is actually the hot one.

365
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,360
Were you a teacher in a previous life?

366
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,790
That's the kind of talk that comes out of a textbook.

367
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,980
If you ignore all the trends, will people buy it and wear it?

368
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,870
That's what everyone will say.

369
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:27,950
People said the same thing when I started Vision PR.

370
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,790
What do you think Team Leader Ha needs right now?

371
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,270
Would it be a factory or fabric?

372
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,470
It's a friend.

373
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,230
I know it's difficult.

374
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:05,560
It's okay. Yes.

375
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:16,040
It's okay. I can do it again.

376
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,960
Am I not taking enough care?

377
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,710
   

378
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,390
Congrats for now, since independence is independence.

379
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,240
Thanks.

380
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,560
- That's good. 
 - Champagne and ramyeon.

381
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,070
I heard you're blocked at the factory and for fabric?

382
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,690
I have to search again.

383
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,410
If you can't?

384
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,030
Until I can.

385
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,700
If you fail?

386
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,830
A good experience.

387
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,540
It's hard.

388
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,050
It's hard. I'm scared and nervous,

389
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:48,070
but it's still fun so far.

390
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,560
Nothing is working but it's fun?

391
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,380
You strong wench.

392
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,360
What's up?

393
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,350
We'd be doing this if Mi Sook were here.

394
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:01,840
Now, you and I only have each other to say our innermost thoughts to.

395
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,110
I have to be on your side, at least.

396
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,460
I feel reassured.

397
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,620
So salty. How can this be so salty even after it's ripe?

398
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,660
We should save it and eat a little at a time.

399
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,820
Isn't it a good thing that I suggested we use less salted shrimp that time?

400
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,280
The seasoning was right for the pickles.

401
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,050
Mi Sook liked instant ramyeon bowls too.

402
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,100
Let's drink.

403
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,100
Mi Sook's kimchi goes perfectly with ramyeon.

404
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,350
 You're here, just as you were. 

405
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:10,390
 You can't come one step outside of there. 

406
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:15,460
 Everyone else is moving on from your time.  

407
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:20,510
 But, Soo Wan, I still 

408
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:25,090
 miss you so much. 

409
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,590
Wow, it looks so delicious!

410
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,270
Enjoy.

411
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,930
I will eat it well.

412
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:39,640
By the way, have you not heard from J?

413
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,610
Cookie isn't the type to call just to say hello.

414
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,860
Only his name is Cookie. He's not sweet at all.

415
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,450
Shall I say he's a cookie without sugar?

416
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,540
But Yeong Eun is here. He's not curious about Yeong Eun's news?

417
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,840
Not at all. There's no contact.

418
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,560
What about Team Leader?

419
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,950
Does she ask about Cookie at all?

420
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,040
No, not at all.

421
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,090
They're so tough.

422
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,570
How can love be put away in one moment?

423
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,480
For me, even if one call doesn't connect during the day,

424
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,250
it's so hard.

425
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:16,950
And if I'm so busy that one day goes by without seeing your face,

426
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,980
right here, my heart aches.

427
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:28,400
Your heart even ached?

428
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,120
That's how I knew.

429
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,100
I really love CEO Seok.

430
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,790
It's delicious.

431
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,430
What

432
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,350
did you just say?

433
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,050
It's delicious?

434
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:54,960
"I really love CEO Seok", that?

435
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,820
Yes, that.

436
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,940
Do you really

437
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,010
mean that?

438
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,140
Of course I mean it.

439
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,960
How many times do I have to say it?

440
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,150
This is really delicious.

441
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:17,750
♫  Are following your back  ♫

442
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:23,710
♫  The air I feel while going home  ♫

443
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:29,040
♫  After I touch it and blow it out  ♫

444
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:36,370
♫  I feel as warm as if you're covering me  ♫

445
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:39,170
♫  I think I am falling  ♫

446
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:41,800
♫  It's my first feeling  ♫

447
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,580
♫  You make me lovely, lovely smile  ♫

448
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,800
♫  Oh darling, we're falling  ♫

449
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:56,750
♫  It might be love, in love  ♫

450
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,680
♫  Awkward feeling  ♫

451
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:07,040
♫  The heart which is lost and confused is yours  ♫

452
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,800
♫  Wanna hear you telling, telling  ♫

453
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,930
♫  “You are my starry night”  ♫

454
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:35,060
 Wow, you did all this? In one month? 

455
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,610
 Yeah. 

456
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,440
 Wow... 

457
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,810
 How did you hold in your passion for so long? 

458
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,140
 I know, right? 

459
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:58,220
 I didn't think I had so much inspiration and was this talented. 

460
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,910
 I almost thought I was Mozart. 

461
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,110
 So you found out that you're a genius? 

462
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,790
 These designs are too good to look at alone. 

463
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:12,760
 Shouldn't we get all the buyers and sellers and let them know? 

464
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,710
 Should I? Should I just do another fashion show? 

465
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,950
 Of course. 

466
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,890
 How about Paris this time? 

467
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,980
Shouldn't you go to work? It's the morning and you—

468
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,650
What brings you guys here this morning?

469
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:21,150
I want to work with you, so I came.

470
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,570
What?

471
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,050
Me too.

472
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,280
Don't be immature and go to work.

473
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,430
I turned in my resignation.

474
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,760
It's already been processed.

475
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,440
Since I'm at the bottom rung, there's not even a mention of training a replacement.

476
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,820
Chi Hyeong.  So Yeong.

477
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,720
You said that you didn't want to burden us,

478
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,930
but you did not say that you didn't want to work with us.

479
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,050
Please accept us.

480
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,060
I understand your intentions

481
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,810
but this is a really difficult path.

482
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:59,190
I can't promise anything to you guys.

483
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:03,940
Nowhere's easy, but there's a place with a person we want to learn from.

484
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:08,030
Give me the chance to become a designer who can have pride in her clothes.

485
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,620
I'm thinking about investing.

486
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,840
Noona, I don't need shares. I just have one condition...

487
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,860
No matter what, give me a higher position than Jeong So Yeong.

488
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:20,360
Noona, you'll be CEO Ha, I'll be Chief Hwang, and Jeong So Yeong...

489
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,280
You can be the design team leader, okay?

490
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,240
I'll answer after I see how much money you will invest.

491
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,620
As I expected, you're getting right to the point, Team Leader Jeong So Yeong.

492
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,830
So what should we do first?

493
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,570
Which factory and fabric did you decide on?

494
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,500
There isn't any.

495
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:40,120
Still? You're making clothes though, right?

496
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,410
Yes, you can come right away.

497
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:49,890
There's another person coming?

498
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,290
♫  When we're together they don't stand a chance  ♫

499
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,360
♫  The world is in our hands  ♫

500
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,080
♫  We light up like a trance (come pull me closer to you)  ♫

501
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,400
♫  And when we take the wheel we never crash  ♫

502
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,780
♫  We ride out like a flash  ♫

503
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,610
Let's hurry up.

504
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:08,000
♫  Cause what we have is natural  ♫

505
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,330
♫  When we're together  ♫

506
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,450
♫  You and I, feels so right  ♫

507
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:16,320
♫  When we're together, hearts on fire  ♫

508
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,410
Yes, Sunbaenim.

509
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:34,400
 Yeong Eun, why is Chi Sook acting like this again? 

510
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,430
Chi Sook?  What about her?

511
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,700
Chi Sook wanted to throw you a farewell party.

512
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,200
Since the place is already rented, eat a lot before you leave.

513
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,180
Up to here is my treat, on the house.

514
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:02,280
What is all this?  It's been a while since I resigned.

515
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,250
That's what I'm saying. The people here are all so busy.

516
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,710
Do you know how difficult it was to find time in everyone's busy schedules?

517
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,020
I can imagine.

518
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,720
With all who are gathered here, a piece of clothing would be finished in a snap.

519
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,670
Here, take a drink.

520
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,400
Did you find a factory?

521
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,670
They said that all the bulk orders are full.

522
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:24,060
When all of the factory lines are in production, they can't make time for small orders.

523
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,390
The same goes for fabric, right? You don't really work with individuals.

524
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,330
Even for the color fabrics,

525
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,870
at least 1,000 yards are needed for us to even consider feeding it into the machines.

526
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:36,100
What fabric business would take an individual's order for 50 yards?

527
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,670
For subsidiary materials, you do even small orders no?

528
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,490
If they pay well, we do.

529
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:43,780
But we can't do it for 500 won a piece like we do for bulk orders.

530
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,520
They would have to pay extras for detailed work as well.

531
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,480
Isn't this a farewell party?

532
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,430
Then why don't you give me some cheers or encouragements?

533
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:55,020
You all said that you respect Team Leader Ha.

534
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,140
Even if they're just empty words, you're not offering to go with her.

535
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,100
Respect and livelihood are different things.

536
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,410
Yes, the company is a battlefield, but it's hell when you leave.

537
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,120
The alcohol tastes bitter.

538
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,510
I'll supply the fabric.  Our Team Leader Ha is going to be independent.

539
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:10,640
Whether it be 30 or 50 yards, I should give you what you need.

540
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,350
It's only 500 won per piece for the first time.

541
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:16,870
Once you become successful, I'm going to raise it a lot.

542
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:20,300
If you're looking for a factory, you should have come immediately to me.  Why are you searching aimlessly?

543
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,110
Just because you've become independent, you're not going to give me your business?

544
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,090
You are the people who made Sonó.

545
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,940
I shouldn't disturb Sonó's line of work.

546
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,620
Do we work only with Sonó?

547
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,800
We work on Sonó and other labels as well.

548
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,530
I wasn't going to come here because I felt disappointed.

549
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,960
Ah, really.

550
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,640
Are you going to make me cry like this?

551
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,400
I'll stay behind.

552
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,330
Sonó... I'll make sure it keeps going in its original style and form.

553
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,940
Since So Yeong and Chi Hyeong left,

554
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,760
I need to stay by Manager Nam's side

555
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,240
to help her and cover their work as well.

556
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:00,790
Thank you so much.  Make sure you do that.

557
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:05,690
Hey, thank the chief.  He's the one who arranged this gathering.

558
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:12,150
Director, well that... kind of thing should be said in a  long and detailed fashion.

559
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,330
It's true. I arranged this gathering.

560
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:21,230
Thank you.  I'll accept it all.

561
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:26,310
I'm too desperate to worry about my dignity.

562
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:30,030
And since I have two employees that I need to support,

563
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:33,700
I'll accept it thankfully, with gratitude.

564
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,220
Thank you.

565
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,970
It will work out well.

566
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:41,370
As for the fabric, I'll give you the best quality.

567
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,460
Whether it's one or two patterns, send it over whenever.

568
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,390
- I'll get them done even if it means I don't sleep. 
 - Okay.

569
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,030
On that note, let's toast!

570
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,730
- Okay, let's! 
 - Let's!

571
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,160
What should we toast to?

572
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,890
Toast to Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun!

573
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:58,520
No, now it's cheers to CEO Ha Yeong Eun!

574
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,670
Cheers!

575
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,840
Thank you.

576
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:12,940
♫  Lean on me for a bit and close your eyes  ♫

577
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:17,950
♫  Don't worry about anything  ♫

578
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,920
I got an expensive one.

579
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,430
Not you, too.

580
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,730
Hey, open it! It looks like she actually spent a lot.

581
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,410
Come on.

582
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,100
What are you doing? Open it.

583
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,230
All right, fine.

584
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:42,230
Hwang Chi Sook, that's a great present.

585
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:45,330
That a new time has started for you

586
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:48,810
is what I think that girl up there is saying.

587
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:54,380
That's right. At our age, we have to express ourselves like this.

588
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:58,050
Yeong Eun, try it on.

589
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:02,510
♫  Hurry and close your eyes  ♫

590
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,320
♫  When spring's sunset comes  ♫

591
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,770
Thanks.

592
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:16,040
I'll use my time well.

593
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:21,380
It really suits you. Don't I have a good eye?

594
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,710
My goodness, I'm so proud.

595
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:28,990
Ah, my friends are so beautiful.

596
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,010
It's the first snowfall!

597
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:39,200
It's snow!

598
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,270
So pretty!

599
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:52,170
 The springtime of my life was brilliant but short. 

600
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:57,990
 Summer brought passion then left. 

601
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:02,020
♫  Fall asleep peacefully  ♫

602
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,440
 Passion led to longing. 

603
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:13,360
 Longing led to yearning. 

604
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,010
 Yearning led to desire, 

605
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:24,030
 and that desire became a reason to live on. 

606
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:50,570
 Summer passed. 

607
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:06,230
 The traces of that summer's love 

608
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:08,750
 make me live again. 

609
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:51,920
 - You put eggs in ramyeon, right? 
 - No, I don't. 

610
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,660
  Wow, we really aren't compatible.  

611
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,520
  We're probably going to fight a lot in the future, right?  

612
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:22,750
  Do you want more soup?  

613
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:25,090
 - Oh, that's hot. 
 - It'll get on your gown. It's expensive. 

614
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:27,280
 -  It's not like you're going to wash it. 
 - Okay. 

615
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,980
  Eat up and wash it in the laundry before you go.  

616
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,680
 Longing stays permanently. 

617
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:15,030
 Above the love we left behind, 

618
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:20,110
 life flows. 

619
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,670
   
   
   

620
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:40,090
 While the unfading love 

621
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,950
 stays behind there. 

622
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:52,910
   

623
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,800
 I miss you. 

624
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,590
 I wish that one day 

625
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,460
 on a street corner, 

626
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:32,000
  you would be there like that day. 

627
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:41,470
 Then I wouldn't let you go, 

628
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:44,310
 and you wouldn't let me go. 

629
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:46,420
 That is my wish. 

630
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:09,760
 Hello, Mr. J. This is Formélaine. 

631
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,730
 We would like to work on the next— 

632
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:14,270
 Hello, Mr. Yoon Jae Gook. This is the Charif Art Gallery. 

633
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:17,870
 I have looked over the photos you submitted to the magazine previously. 

634
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:20,160
 Hello, J! This is Cédric. 

635
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,170
 Why aren't you answering your phone? 

636
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:25,900
 I am going to launch a new brand at DPHP— 

637
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:34,070
 The person you are calling cannot answer. 

638
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:37,560
 Please leave a message after the beep. Thank you. 

639
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,260
 Hello, Yoon Jae Gook. 

640
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:43,970
 I am Gwak Hyo Jin, a member of the Korean Fashion Business Federation committee, 

641
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:48,100
 who is overseeing the third Busan Fashion Week. 

642
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,650
 This time, we are planning to facilitate a fashion week 

643
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:54,580
 with representative domestic brands and next-generation designers. 

644
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,010
- Where did you say? 
  - Pardon? 

645
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,690
 Ah, yes. 

646
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,590
Yes.

647
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:09,990
Yes, yes.

648
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,670
Yes.

649
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,350
Deep down, I want to ask you to come stay at my house,

650
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:24,840
but now that's impossible, Cookie.

651
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,180
I have a housemate now.

652
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:30,350
You got married? Wow... without even sending me a wedding invitation?

653
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:32,170
You're so loyal, you know?

654
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:35,030
It's not marriage, it's cohabitation.

655
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:40,190
Yes, this is Seok Do Hoon from Vision PR.

656
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:42,230
 Hello CEO, this is Sonó! 

657
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:43,610
Yes, Team Leader Nam.

658
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,220
 What's the status on our product placement? 

659
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:49,960
For this season, Department Head Gwak Soo Ho will be in charge of that.

660
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,860
Yes, don't worry.

661
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,420
Keep up the good work!

662
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:01,490
Team Leader Ha started her own brand.

663
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:03,530
She quit.

664
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:07,060
It's been maybe... two years?

665
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:15,590
And that's all?

666
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:18,210
That's all.

667
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:22,550
Why didn't you tell him where Yeong Eun is, and what she's doing?

668
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:24,900
It's a relationship the two of them have wrapped up.

669
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,700
Let's leave it to them, whether they meet again or not.

670
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:32,330
And let's get on with continuing our relationship.

671
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:35,520
What? In the morning?

672
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,180
   

673
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,580
Dad!

674
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,020
 You two better run here right now! 

675
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:55,360
Have the ceremony. Have it before living together.

676
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,730
We will live together and see if it's doable.

677
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:59,770
If it is, we'll hold a grand, traditional wedding.

678
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:01,880
Is that what you think, too?

679
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:07,550
As marriage is a process where two different people meet and become one,

680
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:11,450
I believe that the process of overcoming each other's differences is needed.

681
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:13,590
What will people say?

682
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:16,390
Why do they matter?

683
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,640
Since marriage is between one man and one woman,

684
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:23,050
we do not think third parties are needed.

685
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,290
The air from your nose... is cold.

686
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:00,180
Move... your face.

687
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:10,170
I told you I could just hire someone to do it.

688
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:12,730
Why would you hire someone when you're always worried about money?

689
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,590
It's not like I live far away.

690
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:18,450
It takes less than 10 minutes to walk from the studio apartment out front.

691
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:21,550
You really aren't going to move?

692
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:26,820
How can I leave you when you spend two days in the dark just because you can't fix things like this?

693
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,740
And you're the most afraid of the dark, too.

694
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,850
Are you leaving?

695
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:37,450
I should go back to my house.

696
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,920
These are the kinds of things I wanted you to do.

697
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:46,980
Nothing big, just small things like this.

698
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:52,770
Just, for a moment... worrying about me.

699
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,530
Thinking about me.

700
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:02,400
Call me anytime the power goes out.

701
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,260
We're getting old, so we don't sleep much anyway.

702
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,730
Why wait for the morning?

703
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:08,780
What about dinner?

704
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,880
I made a pot yesterday. It should last until tomorrow.

705
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,920
Wait here.

706
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:21,730
♫  The song I wrote all night  ♫

707
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:25,480
I did a bad job portioning, so I made too many side dishes.

708
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,420
If I leave them, I'll end up throwing them away.

709
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:35,300
Take them, Neighbor.

710
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,750
Well it'd be a waste to throw them away.

711
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:43,640
It looks like I won't have to worry about side dishes for a few days.

712
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,240
I'll eat them well.

713
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,800
♫  Stay my shiny dreams  ♫

714
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:54,840
♫  My close friend, you will come find me, right?  ♫

715
00:54:56,690 --> 00:55:00,800
  On this day next year and the year after,  

716
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,090
 or on this day any year after,  

717
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:08,000
 if I ever walk on a road like this,  I'll think of this.  

718
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,160
  Of today, of us.  

719
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,570
 This is Busan. 

720
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:19,860
 You arrived safely, right? 

721
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:23,420
 Then, I'll see you in Busan tomorrow. 

722
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:36,350
 The third K-fashion week in Busan. 

723
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:39,440
 Join us as we celebrate its grand opening. 

724
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,830
Hey, Jeong So Yeong.

725
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:46,030
Does it feel nice to be invited to Busan as a designer?

726
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:47,340
It does.

727
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,370
Congratulations.

728
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,170
You too.

729
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:02,010
This is nice. What should we eat?

730
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:03,450
I was going to ask the same thing.

731
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,720
Really? Should we get some sashimi?

732
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,590
Jinx!

733
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:17,000
Dad!

734
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,050
Hurry up! I have to show Mom the award certificate!

735
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:25,100
But we need to take some coffee since your mom likes it.

736
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,650
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

737
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:31,990
Just wait a little bit! It's almost done!

738
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:52,080
 On the day you come, I wish the wind would blow. 

739
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,830
Mom!

740
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:03,340
 So at the sound of your arrival, I can come greet you first. 

741
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,460
Mom, I got an award!

742
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:07,930
See? I know you can see it.

743
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:10,950
Ji Min, let her have her coffee first.

744
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:14,530
Oh right! Ji Min, you said you'd find a four-leaf clover for Mom.

745
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:18,500
Oh yea! I'm going to find you a four-leaf clover, okay?

746
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,510
Look at this in the meanwhile. 
     
   

747
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:21,790
   
   

748
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:24,940
Honey, Ji Min is so good at drawing.

749
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,760
Here you go.

750
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,500
Dad!

751
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:33,830
Let's go together! Together!

752
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:38,860
Hurry! Let's look for a four-leaf clover together.

753
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,780
This isn't a four-leaf clover.

754
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,880
How about this one?

755
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,040
That's cool.

756
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,060
I like it.

757
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:45,700
Yeah? Never.

758
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,770
I'd like one please.

759
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:51,200
Here you go.

 Timing and subtitles brought to you by 
 Are You The One Team @ Viki 

770
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,120
 On the day I meet you, 

771
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:04,380
 I hope the winds blow. 

772
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:11,320
 So that my longing would reach you 

773
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:14,970
 and create a path. 

774
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:45,960
Yeong Eun.

775
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:49,980
Jae Gook.

776
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:01,980
Yeong Eun.

777
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,700
Say hello. This is photographer Yoon Jae Gook.

778
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:12,000
Oh, hello.

779
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,120
Hello.

780
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:17,470
I am Kim Soo Min, the one in charge of planning this fashion week.

781
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:20,270
You'll be going to the party later, right?

782
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:22,270
Do you want to go with me? I'll drive.

783
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:23,960
Sure.

784
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,200
Honey!

785
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,990
I'll see you later.

786
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:31,440
Okay.

787
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:46,450
Have you been well?

788
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,240
Yes.

789
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:54,460
I saw your exhibition

790
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:57,160
through pictures in a magazine.

791
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:04,620
But it was still admirable.

792
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:08,200
How are you these days?

793
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:18,760
 Team Leader... I mean, CEO. 

794
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,920
 By the way, what is the name of our brand? 

795
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:24,560
 Well, how about I come up with one as the chief? 

796
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,220
 We have a name. 

797
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,020
 What is it? 

798
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,710
   

799
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:38,400
 Hwa? What does it mean? 

800
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,740
 Hwa-dap (response). 

801
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:44,930
  The promises I made with you. Your love has made a path. 

802
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:47,990
To the new designers who were invited to the sideshow, please come this way!

803
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:49,630
Okay!

804
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:54,580
 Walking down that path 

805
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:59,090
 is my response. 

806
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:02,310
How are you these days?

807
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:10,390
♫  I let out a long sigh and just stare blankly at the sky  ♫

808
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:13,390
♫  Already charred black  ♫

809
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:17,120
 And like that, 

810
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:20,820
 now, 

811
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:23,170
 we are breaking up. 

812
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:26,690
♫  I miss you  ♫

813
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:33,630
♫  Both the season of youth and the warm wind  ♫

814
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:39,120
♫  Don't mean anything  ♫

815
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:42,690
♫  Because you're not here  ♫

816
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:46,690
♫  To clear my head  ♫

817
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:53,700
♫  When I keep aimlessly wandering the streets  ♫

818
01:03:53,700 --> 01:04:02,390
♫  Without being aware, I'm here in front of your house  ♫

819
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:07,710
♫  At first, I was calmer than I thought I would be  ♫

820
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:13,980
♫  The longing hurts more than breaking up  ♫

821
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:18,790
♫  It is just a day to endure  ♫

822
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:22,070
♫  The more time passes, the more it intensifies  ♫

823
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:31,450
♫  Love leaves. Why does only the farewell remain?  ♫

824
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:38,210
♫  Even still, I, who am truly like a fool  ♫

825
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:43,790
♫  Survive like this  ♫

826
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:49,980
♫  Turning away again  ♫

827
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:55,180
♫  My departing footsteps are heavy  ♫

828
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:59,120
   

829
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:04,360
