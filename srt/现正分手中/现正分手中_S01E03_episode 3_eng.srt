00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,070
   

2
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,100
   

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,700
   

4
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,090

 Timing and subtitles brought to you by 
 Are You The One Team @ Viki 

6
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,960
   

7
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,300
By any chance,

8
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,030
do you know someone

9
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,020
named Yoon Soo Wan?

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,360
   

11
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,080
 Excuse me. 

12
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,400
 Hello. 
 (in French) 

13
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,680
 I'm looking for someone. She's named  Ha Yeong Eun. 

14
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,170
 I'm not understanding you. 
 (in French) 

15
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,670
 Oh, okay, okay. 

16
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,940
 Oh, that's why I got this ready in case. 

17
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,420
 I'm looking for Miss Ha Yeong Eun. 
 (in French) 

18
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:52,350
 I have a delivery for Miss Ha Yeong Eun. 
 (in French) 

19
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,950
 Ha Yeong Eun... is right here. 

20
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,010
 - It's so pretty.
 - Yeah, it's so pretty. 

21
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,230
 - It's going round! 
 - I'm the only one in the frame. 

22
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,850
 I think my face came out too big. 

23
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,570
 - There's no such thing. 
 - Put your face forward. 

24
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,580
 Yeong Eun, what should we have for dinner? 

25
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,220
 Dinner? Hmm, kimchi stew? 

26
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,890
 You didn't bring it with you?  Oh, you're no good. 

27
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,540
 How could you not bring it? 

28
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,710
 Fine, fine. 

29
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,950
 I see a lot of people taking pictures here. 

30
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,980
 It's pretty. Let's take that picture.  

31
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,520
 - That? 
  - Yeah. 

32
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,250
 One, two, three. 

33
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,670
 He, who comforted me during my tiring life... 

34
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,630
 Don't do it. 

35
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,450
 I'm going to kiss you before I take the picture. 

36
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,600
 Love that was short but splendid... 

37
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,530
 One that I dared to believe would last forever... 

38
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,580
I do.

39
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,710
 She's that Ha Yeong Eun. 

40
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,160
Can I ask how you know him?

41
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,640
Can I ask why I need to answer that?

42
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,990
Team Leader, the models are ready.

43
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,710
The models have finished getting ready.

44
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,000
We should start.

45
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,870
   

46
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,660
   

47
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,240
   

48
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,740
Yes, I scheduled it.

49
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,750
Of all the people in the world, he is the one I somehow ended up meeting

50
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,630
right there in Busan of all places.

51
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,860
Then when I got to Seoul, he was here, too!

52
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,960
On top of that, he's Mr. J.

53
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,740
 You didn't know? 

54
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:28,300
 Oh, my god. That Mr. Paris is J? 

55
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,370
 Mr. Paris? 

56
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,740
 When did he get that name? 

57
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,550
This is what I call a quite unusual coincidence.

58
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,460
There's no need to put so much meaning into a coincidence.

59
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,010
Fate comes looking like coincidence.

60
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,570
So if you let it pass by, it's coincidence, and if you grab onto it, it's fate.

61
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,590
So I ask for active cooperation.

62
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,720
From today on, I'm going to make our coincidences into fate.

63
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,320
   
   

64
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,190
You have an age spot on one side.

65
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,200
Skin is aging quite quickly.

66
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,980
Some people must think you're older than your age.

67
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,410
My existence was even denied.

68
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,800
 No, no... it wasn't this face. 

69
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,620
 Seok Do Hoon isn't of this quality. 

70
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,140
Your skin will improve quickly if you get laser treatment and keep up with good aftercare.

71
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,870
You have to stay away from alcohol, smoking, and sun exposure,

72
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,690
and especially try not to get stressed.

73
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,250
Stress is the main culprit of aging. 
    

74
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,130
It's not like I want to get stressed.

75
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,580
It just happens often and whenever.

76
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,760
Like this very moment.

77
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,940
CEO Seok Do Hoon, you're more capable than I thought.

78
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,420
"Than I thought" gives me pause, but I am indeed capable.

79
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,330
And it seems like you take compliments very well.

80
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:28,220
I'm the CEO of Vision PR, the foremost PR company in Korea.

81
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,990
It's strange for me to say this about myself, but I'm known as Sak Do Hoon in my field

82
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,170
because I succeed in everything I do. 
  (Sak = everything) 

83
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,860
Because I leave everyone else in the dust.

84
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,220
Mr. Seok Do Hoon!

85
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,840
Where are you?

86
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,700
I'm in the middle of a very important meeting.

87
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,410
Mr. Seok Do Hoon?

88
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,760
I'll call you again.

89
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,740
But then again, this is a very important meeting.

90
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,600
Is that... what I said?

91
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,280
You have a very poor memory.

92
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,320
You didn't eat the numbing cream, did you?

93
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,550
There's no need to be embarrassed. Effort is a beautiful thing.

94
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,870
Be careful not to get wet.

95
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,170
It stays on very well, so I'm giving it to you especially.

96
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,750
Oh, this isn't necessary.

97
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,370
I'm asking to make some real progress.

98
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,410
By "progress" you mean...

99
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,370
I'd like to write out the future together.

100
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,670
By "future" you mean...

101
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,830
Please continue to take good care of Yoon Jae Gook.

102
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,200
I believe my part was already done.

103
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,750
Even blemishes take more than one session to get rid of.

104
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,140
And we are talking about fate between two people here.

105
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,810
Wow, the photos are great!

106
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,410
As expected from Cookie, your work is different.

107
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,100
There's just a different feel to it.

108
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,630
Will you be done after selecting the photos?

109
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,320
Do you have something to say to me?

110
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,980
Hey. Who are you?

111
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,800
You're Mr. J, Cookie, and even Mr. Paris who swept across New York, London, and Paris.

112
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,740
That's who you are yet you worked on a domestic brand for the first time,

113
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,970
so it's just a shame for you to end it like this.

114
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,390
What is it?

115
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,130
Actually, I have a request.

116
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,180
An interview?

117
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,880
With Yoon Jae Gook?

118
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,630
I told him all about it.

119
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,720
Mr. Paris is Mr. J.

120
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,970
He's a photographer who only works with high-end brands.

121
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,650
Even if we propose an interview, I'm unsure if he would accept.

122
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,670
- Did you get a definite answer? 
 - It'll be the day after tomorrow at 3 PM.

123
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,040
I even got a text from CEO Seok stating that the editor-in-chief of ELLE will come herself.

124
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,590
Yoon Jae Gook agreed to do this?

125
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,150
He must be well-connected with foreign celebrities, too.

126
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,900
If they post about it on Instagram,

127
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,500
Hye Rin doesn't even compare to their class level.

128
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,010
And yes, I accomplished this hard feat.

129
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,390
Team Leader Ha, what do you think?

130
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:36,070
I think it'd definitely help with increasing The One's brand worth.

131
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,560
I'll prepare the materials for the interview separately and send them to the marketing team.

132
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,650
Team Leader Ha, go and support them in person.

133
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,520
For once, Director Hwang enthusiastically got this opportunity for us.

134
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,750
Make sure you see it through without any problems.

135
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,640
Okay.

136
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,590
You're not meeting him just because of work.

137
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,960
Don't forget that it's a relationship between two families.

138
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,490
Okay.

139
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,200
You don't seem too into it.

140
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,300
Feeling flustered is more accurate.

141
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,790
What is there to be flustered about?

142
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,840
You can just keep doing what you were doing, right?

143
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,470
I'll talk to the marketing team and send the promotional materials to your office.

144
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,560
Before that, let's settle things.

145
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,820
If we get caught that you went on the blind date instead of me at Busan...

146
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,260
I won't be the only one being called in.

147
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,980
I'm sure.

148
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,120
Since you're his daughter, you'll just get a slap on the wrist,

149
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,370
but in my case, it'll be reflected in my performance assessment.

150
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,430
So what will you do?

151
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,690
It was hard to build up my reputation,

152
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,420
so I'll have to protect it.

153
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,800
Oh, you'd like to eat first?

154
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,930
Yes, of course.

155
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,850
Yes, it'd be good to get to know each other before the interview.

156
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,320
That'd help with the atmosphere, too. That'd be nice.

157
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,540
I'm not going.

158
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,000
But what can I do?

159
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,360
Mr. J. is a loner who likes seclusion.

160
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,000
He likes eating by himself.

161
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,330
I'm sorry, Team Leader Ha.

162
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,390
It's just an ordinary pre-meeting meal.

163
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,620
There's no need to feel pressured about it.

164
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,270
When should we meet?

165
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,690
If you tell us when it would be convenient for you, we will work around your schedule.

166
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,590
Let's meet tonight.

167
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:32,460
Alright then. I'll contact you again to confirm the time and location.

168
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,220
I'll be waiting.

169
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,290
Why are you suddenly getting into it?

170
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,780
It's just... I'm a little interested.

171
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,320
I also needed an excuse.

172
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,830
An excuse?

173
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,810
There is something I need to find out.

174
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,300
What is it?

175
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,980
We got a message from Elle.

176
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,330
They want to know if you'll use Mr. J, Cookie, or real name Yoon Jae Gook.

177
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,790
Okay. Cookie? J?

178
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,150
What is the name that I can call you by to turn you into a flower?

179
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,700
The person I met that day wasn't Ha Yeong Eun,

180
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,850
but Hwang Chi Sook?

181
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,690
At a company, the one who carries out the action and the name that reaps the credit are often different.

182
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,660
What I do is the same as Director Hwang having done it.

183
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,410
How your company works isn't my problem.

184
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,020
But I can't lie.

185
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,910
Misunderstandings are uncomfortable, and explanations are inconvenient.

186
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,560
Were they uncomfortable misunderstandings?

187
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,330
The times you and I spent in Busan and Seoul?

188
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,150
They were happenings.

189
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,190
Was it just a happening between you and Yoon Soo Wan as well?

190
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,240
This is The One's company profile. We're working together,

191
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,590
so I thought you should at least know basic information.

192
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,660
Aren't you curious

193
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:31,310
about the relationship between me and Yoon Soo Wan?

194
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,280
This is information on this season's items and their press release.

195
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,930
You can refer to these for the interview.

196
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,590
   
 I'll be there in five minutes. 

197
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,210
  You've made the atmosphere all nice and warm, right? 

198
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,990
Director Hwang will be arriving soon. I'll excuse myself.

199
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,270
You like to enjoy,

200
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,320
yet you don't want to take responsibility afterward.

201
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,120
You don't like being lonely,

202
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,780
but you hate getting serious.

203
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,450
I can understand because I'm the same way.

204
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,420
You just crossed the line right now.

205
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,410
But you should've considered whom you're dealing with.

206
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,970
Men aren't all like me.

207
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,620
- Yoon Jae Gook! 
 - Yoon Soo Wan

208
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,470
said he was serious.

209
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,610
Did you know that?

210
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,730
Your guest has arrived.

211
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,380
Oh my, I hope I'm not too late?

212
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,100
I already explained the situation.

213
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,580
Then, please enjoy your conversation.

214
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,970
Team Leader Ha, eat before you leave.

215
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,680
Let's eat. We work so we can eat.

216
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,150
Team Leader Ha doesn't really like course meals.

217
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,260
She works for me, but I shouldn't mess with her dining style.

218
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,420
This looks delicious.

219
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,360
 Yeong Eun, why do you eat with such haste? 

220
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,620
   

221
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,830
 I have little time but a lot of work. 

222
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,890
 I lead a life that requires me to use 24 hours like they are 48 hours. 

223
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,040
 Setting aside time to eat is a privilege to me. 

224
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,990
 Now I can live. 

225
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,510
 Is it good? 

226
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,830
 Ta-da. 

227
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,770
 I followed the recipe, but I can't guarantee the taste. 

228
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:33,590
 At least once a day, enjoy an actual meal. 

229
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,980
 You can allow that much in your life. 

230
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,620
 It's delicious. 

231
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,900
Jerk.

232
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,200
   

233
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,390
You don't have to do this all the time.

234
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,560
You said you're releasing other colors.

235
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,780
Aren't you working till late tonight too?

236
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,500
Eat it with your ramyeon.

237
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,080
It's because I feel bad.

238
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,210
Team Leader Ha and I don't have that kind of relationship.

239
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,080
No need to feel bad.

240
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,720
You must be busy. Go ahead.

241
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,980
I'll leave after organizing this.

242
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,420
We'll enjoy it. Thank you!

243
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,010
Team Leader Ha knows all kinds of people.

244
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:06,400
Celebrities help her, and you support her so well.

245
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,270
Team Leader Ha can eat some and you can eat some.

246
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:13,250
I brought plenty so that everyone here can have some.

247
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,930
You came because you heard people were saying good things about Sonó's new item, right?

248
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,580
But getting the CMT job for that will be hard. 
    

249
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,930
They had to make everything happen so quickly that they already decided on the toll processing subcontractor.

250
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,520
Still. I'm sure Team Leader Ha will give us some work, too.

251
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,840
In any case, I would need the spec sheet to even calculate the headcount.

252
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,700
So Yeong, say hello.

253
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,780
She's Chief Choi from one of the subcontractor companies that handles everything but the design.

254
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,550
- Oh, hello. 
 - Hello.

255
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,430
She's our newest employee.

256
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,740
It'll be quicker to ask her for any references.

257
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,060
Oh, nice to meet you. I hope we can work together.

258
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,600
Me too.

259
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,450
But... is that the spec sheet?

260
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,500
Yes.

261
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,100
Chief Choi!

262
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,110
I heard you were out. Are you just getting back to the office?

263
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,480
What brings you here at this hour?

264
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,910
I made some kimchi.

265
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,910
I told you, you don't have to.

266
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,090
I know you always make so much effort to get me work.

267
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:30,060
Sharing some kimchi is the least I can do.

268
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,840
Take the taxi.

269
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,540
If you continue to do this, I won't be able to come anymore because I feel bad.

270
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,830
You said your knees hurt. Ride comfortably.

271
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,060
I'll contact you soon.

272
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,870
- Welcome back. 
 - You're back.

273
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,830
Are all the labels taken care of?

274
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:02,310
Yes. We're cross-checking the number of labels that were sent to the factory with the number of clothes produced.

275
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,250
It's a race against the clock from now on. It's only a matter of time before copies show up.

276
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,890
That's why I am going to go keep watch by going to the factory right after work.

277
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,030
Protect the spec sheets well so no one can take the labels to put on copies.

278
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,990
Got it.

279
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,320
Oh no! No, I can't believe it.

280
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,590
Both of our free evenings are filled with housework.

281
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,720
That Chi Sook wench is enjoying herself at a wine bar.

282
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,710
 Day 1 for him and me. I want to get drunk tonight. 

283
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,210
What? The guy is good-looking.

284
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,190
How do you know?

285
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,710
What fun they're having.

286
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,210
And my husband is busy keeping everyone happy.

287
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,810
Yeong Eun, you know what? My husband actually...

288
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:18,050
He even knows a lot.

289
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:22,000
He's also an intellectual? How attractive.

290
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,080
He knows Soo Wan.

291
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,650
What?

292
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,890
How does he know him? So where is that guy and what's he up to these days?

293
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,710
What good would it do to know that now?

294
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,590
He ruined your life. You should at least get to throw a glass of water on him.

295
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:43,400
If you had stayed in Paris, you would have done fashion shows every season

296
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,820
and been interviewed by Vogue!

297
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,950
Soo Wan didn't force me to come back. I chose to.

298
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:56,650
I'm just angry that with your talent, you have to clean up after Chi Sook all the time.

299
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,220
I agree, I'm wasting my talent too much.

300
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,520
You're basically giving it away at a 90% discount.

301
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,510
But in return, I have an apartment in the middle of Seoul in my name, I own a car,

302
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,600
and I get to happily give my parents allowance once in a while.

303
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,200
Don't you think others will think I'm doing pretty well?

304
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,840
How long is Soo Wan going to hold a place in your heart?

305
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,730
Tell him to move out if he doesn't mind since he is not even paying rent!

306
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,570
Let's hang up now. I'm in the middle of cleaning the bathroom. I have to spray water.

307
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,550
Anyway, how does he know Soo Wan?

308
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,520
- Didn't you ask? 
 - Hanging up!

309
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,530
That's refreshing.

310
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,270
 The guy is good-looking. 

311
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,420
I'll get nothing in return being hung up on it.

312
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,220
Throw away what I don't need and live the way I have been.

313
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,530
That's the smart way.

314
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,640
 Yeong Eun! Let's have another drink! 

315
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,610
Why leave your expensive mattress and use mine all the time?

316
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,980
If you're that scared of your dad, go to a hotel.

317
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,920
You wench, if I set it all up for you, you should have taken care of the rest by yours—

318
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,470
I'm sorry, Team Leader Ha.

319
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,000
She said she wanted to buy us a round of drinks for securing the interview,

320
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,690
but instead she is making us rudely intrude on you like this.

321
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,000
Excuse us. We couldn't do much more to stop her.

322
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,800
Yeong Eun, show Jae Gook in.

323
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,120
- Shoes. 
 - Yes.

324
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,260
She says to come in.

325
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,000
Welcome to Yeong Eun's house.

326
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
Do you have hard liquor?

327
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,170
There are tons of bars outside.

328
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,120
Why don't you have a drink alone with him?

329
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,920
He must massage his face day and night with ice water. He's very cold.

330
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,900
Why else do you think I called out those guys?

331
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,570
Oh, my god.

332
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,960
Your wife is probably waiting.

333
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,970
Shouldn't you go be going home early?

334
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,270
I should, but wow, I only heard from my wife.

335
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,800
The house is just... so nice!

336
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,960
Ingo Maurer. Bang and Olufsen.

337
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,410
Even the real Royal Albert...

338
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,230
Your taste is very similar to mine. Except for this photo.

339
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,300
It's an unsophisticated work of an amateur that doesn't suit your elegant taste.

340
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,920
How about it? Would you like me to choose something that would suit better?

341
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,360
These days, there are artwork that you can rent out for a monthly fee.

342
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,370
Just let it be.

343
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,820
That is the embodiment of Yeong Eun's true self.

344
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,880
- This is worth 20 euros. 
 - What?

345
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,610
It's an amateur's work that she bought off the street in Paris.

346
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:26,450
But she says it inspires her or consoles her or something.

347
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,180
Either way, whenever she's having a hard time,

348
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,070
she stands in front of that gloomy photo of pouring rain

349
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,350
for dozens of minutes making a scene.

350
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,850
I have no idea why.

351
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,630
That photo is the one thing that simply does not get upgraded.

352
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,730
So what will it be? Will you have another round here?

353
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,910
Not sure. I'm a bit drunk.

354
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,910
Let's have just one more round.

355
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,590
If you don't mind.

356
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,350
Who would mind? My relationship with Yeong Eun is not like that.

357
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,080
Yeong Eun, let's round up with one glass each.

358
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,950
Does wine sound good?

359
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,490
Great!

360
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:07,130
Okay, this house has a great view. Look!

361
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,350
Ta-da!

362
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,440
She is basically above the Han River.

363
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,710
 Jae Gook. 

364
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,510
- Help yourself. 
 - Have some with us.

365
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:39,650
I have a new product launch tomorrow, so I'll have to decline.

366
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,130
Don't stay standing and come over here.

367
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,980
Ah, okay.

368
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,140
- You never do what I want from you. 
 - Pardon?

369
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,980
Never mind.

370
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,640
What good is it to live alone in a great place like this?

371
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,520
As for me, all I need is someone who would let me use his arm as a pillow.

372
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,650
There is nothing better than comfort from sharing body temperature.

373
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,440
At least you get what I'm saying.

374
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,270
Cheers.

375
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,950
Cheers.

376
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,690
 No need to go all out. Come home. 

377
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,960
Why did he have to follow her all the way here and see my current state?

378
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,400
Actually, who cares? Doesn't matter anymore.

379
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:48,490
This is the reality you wanted to protect?

380
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,960
I said you guys can have another round.

381
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,940
It didn't mean that you could come in all the way here like this.

382
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,680
I wanted to see for myself

383
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,210
and confirm something as well.

384
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,660
Director Hwang is outside. I don't want any misunderstandings.

385
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,690
Are you sure that's what you're worried about? A misunderstanding? Or do you just not want to get caught?

386
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,360
- Yoon Jae Gook. 
 - Yoon Soo Wan.

387
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,020
Does he really not mean anything to you?

388
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:30,470
Are you sure he means nothing to you?

389
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,620
Just what does he have to mean to me?

390
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,030
He was serious about me. What do you want me to do about that?

391
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:42,150
He was so serious that he chose to ghost* me like that?

392
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:45,000
 (To ghost: to abruptly cut off contact without warning or explanation) 

393
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,920
What do you mean?

394
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,870
   

395
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:13,950
♫  Forget all the painful days  ♫

396
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:21,850
♫  Just stay there just the way you are  ♫

 The person you are trying to call cannot be reached at the moment. Please leave—

♫  I love you exclusively, just you  ♫

409
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,340
 Soo Wan, it's me, Yeong Eun. 

410
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,070
 It's taking a long time for you to come. 

411
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:55,680
 Did I perhaps make a mistake about our meeting place? 

412
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:04,970
♫  Looking at you from a distance, I am crying  ♫

413
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:12,180

414
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:18,260
♫  Do you know how I feel  ♫

415
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:26,480
♫  I love you exclusively, just you  ♫

416
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,770
♫   After this long night ends   ♫

417
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,960
 A man? 

418
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,210
 Love? 

419
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,230
 Now that I've been through it, I understand. 

420
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,680
 False hope. 

421
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,720
 A foolish choice. 

422
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,950
 Hastily placed faith. 

423
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:09,110
 The end of love... 

424
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,610
 so this is how clear it is. 

425
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,870
That's why I won't do such silly things again.

426
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:30,800
It's not that I'm breaking with Yoon Soo Wan right now,

427
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,230
but the feeling of despair and misery that I felt under the rain that day,

428
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,500
I'm in the process of breaking up with all those things.

429
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,730
Yeong Eun.

430
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:50,550
Ha Yeong Eun! Do we not have any ice?

431
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:58,050
What I'm enjoying right now... it's a prize I've earned for working so hard

432
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,470
after erasing men from my life.

433
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,900
- Yeong Eun! 
 - Team Leader Ha.

434
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,570
Director Hwang has chosen you.

435
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,010
The CEO who is in charge of my performance assessment

436
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:12,840
has ordered me to foster a good relationship between you two.

437
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,240
I need to get out there and find her ice.

438
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,540
This is my reality.

439
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,920
I've thought about it a hundred times.

440
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,620
Was my love that mediocre that I had to be dumped without given a reason?

441
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,420
Did I do something wrong?

442
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,080
Was I not enough?

443
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,820
I dwelled on it for so long. I regretted it. I got drunk.

444
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,610
But...

445
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,590
having done so, did anything change?

446
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,220
So that's why

447
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,390
I'm only going to walk on the path ahead of me.

448
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,910
Cheers.

449
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,680
- Let's go. 
 - Yes, it's quite late.

450
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,780
- We should go. 
 - Where are you going?

451
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,150
Here, here. We'll be going now.

452
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,590
- Please excuse us. 
 - I can have one more glass.

453
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:09,490
- No, no. We can't. 
 - Just one more glass.

454
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,750
Next time, next time.

455
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,470
- You're not working tomorrow. 
 - You can take your leave.

456
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,670
It's not that expensive!

457
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,920
Oh, I'm in the totally opposite direction.

458
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,970
It's just wasting money and time.

459
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,690
She's a client, a director at that.

460
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,420
So it's good manners to match her level with the CEO on our side.

461
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,570
- Are you coming or not? 
 - Yes, I'm coming!

462
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,650
- One round. 
 - Fine then.

463
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,270
Rock, paper, scissors!

464
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,330
See you tomorrow.

465
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:51,150
- Jae Gook. 
 - I need to go back to the studio.

466
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,710
If you're not coming, then take her.

467
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,820
Yes, I'm coming.

468
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,050
Oh, hold on.

469
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:00,650
 Why did I return? 

470
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,330
 What did I want to ask? 

471
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,780
 Perhaps all the questions 

472
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,410
 were just an excuse. 

473
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:35,550
 I wanted to check. 

474
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,420
  Just how much of a hold you have on me. 

475
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,630
 Just how much 

476
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,470
  I mean to you. 

477
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,620
That I couldn't leave...

478
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,240
You knew, didn't you?

479
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,690
What I have

480
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:41,300
and achieved,

481
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,870
I don't want to lose them

482
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:46,760
by playing with emotions.

483
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,750
I've already experienced enough of that.

484
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:56,510
Experience doesn't give courage.

485
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,540
It instills fear.

486
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,970
Right now, I'm scared

487
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,350
of you.

488
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:10,970
What's this? Hey, you—

489
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,910
If you drank, just sleep.

490
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,180
Don't start getting all bold for no reason.

491
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:19,720
Don't cause any damage!  Sleep deeply and quietly!

492
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,860
I slept peacefully last night!

493
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,190
What's wrong?

494
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,400
Did something happen?

495
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:56,030
Last night, I was chaste.

496
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:00,870
All I wanted to do was to take Director Hwang home out of kindness.

497
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:03,970
 I don't want to go home. 

498
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:07,060
 What? You don't want to go home? 

499
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:12,550
 It's time we be honest. 

500
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:14,750
 About what? 

501
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,640
 Why did you want to come with me? 

502
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:23,270
 Oh, I lost at "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against Soo Ho earlier, so... 

503
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,910
 I'll talk first. 

504
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:30,710
  I liked you as soon as I saw you. 

505
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:34,040
  Uh, well, thank you. 

506
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:42,980
  Let's stop. 

507
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,950
  Oh, stop the taxi? You want to get out? 

508
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:47,770
  Driver. 

509
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:49,900
 I'm talking about flirting. 

510
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,950
 Let's not pretend anymore. 

511
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,890
  Why are you doing this? 

512
00:45:54,890 --> 00:46:00,630
 Let's not suppress the desire we have for each other any more. 

513
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,390
  Wait, hold on. 

514
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,120
But why are you dawdling like this? Aren't you going to the interview?

515
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,160
Nope, I'm not going.

516
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,990
It's been cancelled.

517
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,290
 Ha Yeong Eun! Ha Yeong Eun! 

518
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,760
   

519
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,980
Did something good pop up?

520
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:04,600
Copies always exist, but getting your best product stolen really sucks.

521
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,960
Knockoffs have good quality and are cheaper these days.

522
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,100
We can't block the consumers from buying them, right?

523
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:16,160
Because you sang "Italy, Italy,"  I paid for Italian fabric.

524
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,340
You kept whining about how you had to get it made quickly,

525
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:21,000
so we stopped the Lamong line and handed it off to Sonó.

526
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,990
But this is what you are bring to the table?

527
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,890
If you're in the position of a team leader,

528
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:27,340
you should be managing these issues!

529
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:29,750
I'll find out how it happened.

530
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,160
I don't need to know how.

531
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,380
All I need to know is how you're going to repay the money that you used

532
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:37,260
and the harm you inflicted on the company!

533
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,120
How can you be so bad at protecting the spec sheets?

534
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:51,370
  You have a lot of orders, right? 

535
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:54,620
  - Yes, it's always overtime. 
 - Oh, no. 

536
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,040
  But it's feels good even though it's physically tiring, right? 

537
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,220
 Even I feel happy about how well Sonó's new products came out. 

538
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,810
  Yes, well. 

539
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:06,130
 But I need to prepare in advance to be of any use. 

540
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,980
  What can I do first? 

541
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:14,380
  My team leader hasn't said anything yet. 

542
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,590
  Oh, you must not know since you're a newbie. 

543
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:22,450
 Normally, they show us the spec sheet in advance. 

544
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:24,030
  Let me see. 

545
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,120
 Sure, here you go. 

546
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,770
  Oh, the line of the clothing is so pretty. 

547
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:33,840
  We'll have to be precise with the sleeves. 

548
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,590
  Ah, yes. 

549
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:37,210
 Let me hold it for you. 

550
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,380
 Gosh, thank you. 

551
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,400
 The darts go here. 

552
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,280
  We're going to use this and black as the other color. 

553
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,840
 Black? Black would look good too. 

554
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,320
  Yes. 

555
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:00,030
I'm sorry.

556
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:05,060
   

557
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,320
Wrap it up.

558
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:29,240
What about the interview with Mr. J?

559
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,620
What's the point of promoting clothes when its copies are out on sale already?

560
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:34,090
The products are already out.

561
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:37,720
So what? You'll have them laid out on display for a special sale?

562
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,970
You hate that the most.

563
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:44,090
If we sell at a reduced price, we would only earn a little.

564
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:46,310
But in the long run, it's a loss in the end.

565
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:49,000
The brand's image will worsen and if you raise the price later on,

566
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,290
people will think it's inflated. It'll end up being harmful.

567
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:55,030
- Yes, that's true. 
 - So just scrap it.

568
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:58,170
It's the first release, so there aren't that many made anyway.

569
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:01,610
It's something I worked so hard for though.

570
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,870
Father!

571
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,970
What's wrong?

572
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:17,240
So Yeong wants to quit.

573
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,050
   

574
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,400
She's saying it's her responsibility.

575
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,100
   

576
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,510
Quitting won't make a difference.

577
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:35,740
I'm just so sorry.

578
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,720
I became a burden to the whole company.

579
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,790
It's so hard for me.

580
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,600
Then you should take responsibility.

581
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,200
What good would it be for you to run away?

582
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:52,740
What can I do to take responsibility?

583
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,320
Don't make a mistake like this ever again.

584
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,280
And put your best efforts into whatever you can do.

585
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,430
That's the only way you can make up for this mistake.

586
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:03,430
Team Leader.

587
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,140
Don't you dare try quitting like this again.

588
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:10,550
You'll be in big trouble then!

589
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:19,040
- Where are you going? 
 - To work.

590
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:59,020
This is inevitable in our field.

591
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:02,750
I know. Copies are day-to-day life in this field.

592
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,680
But you shouldn't have done this to our youngest member,

593
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,810
who has no decision power,

594
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:11,480
has no sense of judgement because she's walking on thin ice, and can't say no.

595
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,250
I wanted to do well and prepare ahead of time,

596
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:16,160
so I asked to see the spec sheet.

597
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:21,040
Then, you should've waited for our orders.

598
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:25,080
If a design is good, people change the collar or the number of buttons,

599
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,230
and copies come out within one to two weeks.

600
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:30,010
That's how Dongdaemun works.

601
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:32,410
I'm not only working with The One.

602
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:37,330
The others were asking this of me, so I couldn't refuse.

603
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,770
My kid wants to go to art school.

604
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:44,010
All I have are my skilled hands and a good eye, so...

605
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:46,370
Everyone has their own circumstances.

606
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:48,740
I don't know when you're going to give me work,

607
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,230
but I already have my child's tutoring fees to pay.

608
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:54,760
So I had to sit in front of the sewing machine. I'm a mom, after all.

609
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:02,270
I know you're a good person,

610
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:06,830
but you stepped on other people's time, dreams, and efforts

611
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:09,750
just to send your kid to college.

612
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,510
I'm not sure if that makes you a good mother.

613
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:15,100
We're going to be filing a lawsuit against the company that put the order in.

614
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,050
You'll have a lot of work to do then

615
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:21,870
since other companies will be curious about just how similar the copies are

616
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:24,120
and make orders so they can have it too.

617
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:28,000
But don't enjoy it too much.

618
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,710
I came here to tell you that.

619
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,060
Team Leader Ha.

620
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:44,450
Take this.

621
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:46,590
I didn't give this to you with ill intentions.

622
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,940
I really am thankful.

623
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,750
I brought this because I had nothing else to offer.

624
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,970
Prepare for the lawsuit.

625
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:56,990
And don't trust that the company that put the order in will protect you.

626
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:59,910
We're going to do our best to prepare for it.

627
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:02,950
I'm telling you this out of gratitude for your kimchi.

628
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:17,670
Boss.

629
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,830
   

630
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,290
   

631
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:33,270
I chose this first.

632
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:37,340
Excuse me.

633
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:42,160
These ones here.

634
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:47,180
Yes? Okay.

635
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,230
What's your size?

636
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:05,270
 Why is everything so complicated for you? 

637
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:10,400
 Just act according to your heart. 

638
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:25,440
Manager Nam, tell the factory not to scrap it.

639
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,320
We are going to release as planned today.

640
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,150
What? You're going to go through with it?

641
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:34,800
If we act rashly, we might end up with a lot of stock piling up.

642
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,910
That's just a guess. We haven't done anything yet.

643
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:40,640
What if the CEO finds out?

644
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,990
As long as the results are good, we can ask for forgiveness on the process later.

645
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:49,140
The internet already thinks that the knockoff is the real product.

646
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:52,590
 If we search for it, only that site shows up in the top results. 

647
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:57,970
Did you hear that?

648
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:01,170
This isn't something new we're dealing with.

649
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:03,910
It's expected every time something gets sold out.

650
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:07,280
 There will always be people who seek out our products. 

651
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,460
 Even if there's a Chanel knockoff being sold for ten or twenty thousand won, 

652
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:13,070
there are people who will buy the real product for over a hundred thousand won.

653
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:16,390
Because that's the original.

654
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:30,670
 Hey, Ha Yeong Eun! Do you think work is a joke? 

655
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:31,970
 Is there no such thing as seniority? 

656
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:34,680
I'll speak to the CEO myself.

657
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,640
You're saying you'll bypass the approval process however you like now?

658
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:41,550
Come back immediately! Come back immediately!

659
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,670
I'm really going to go crazy.

660
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,970
I heard there was a copy made.

661
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:17,380
We will reschedule the interview for later.

662
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,980
It won't be possible today.

663
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,920
Are you okay?

664
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:24,410
I'm not okay.

665
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,740
Even if we file a lawsuit, it'll take a few years.

666
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,650
If they move the location of the zipper and call it an homage,

667
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:33,080
there is nothing I can do even in a copyright lawsuit.

668
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:37,640
But is that why you're here? To ask if I'm okay?

669
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,520
Did you have lunch?

670
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,210
I don't have time for that.

671
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:43,050
I need to get back to the office.

672
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:48,740
Nevertheless, at least once a day, enjoy an actual meal.

673
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,990
 At least once a day, enjoy an actual meal. 

674
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:04,720
How do you know?

675
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:11,870
Yoon Soo Wan...

676
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:16,290
how do you know him?

677
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,960
This must be your son!

678
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,410
Yes, he's my son.

679
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:43,350
♫  Don't pass me in a flash  ♫

680
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:45,850
He's my brother.

681
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:50,930
And my brother...

682
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,670
died ten years ago.

683
00:58:54,670 --> 00:59:01,230
♫  I won't let go of the person who is etched  ♫

684

♫  Deep inside my heart  ♫

00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:23,580
♫  I love you exclusively, just you  ♫

00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:29,450

00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:03,000
♫  How should I say this  ♫

694
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,610
   

695
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:09,110
 What was I holding on to all this time? 

696
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:10,710
 Hyung? Is something wrong? 

697
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:13,030
 Hyung? Hyung? Hyung! 

698
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:16,380
 While Soo Wan was on his way to me... 

699
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:20,260
 What was I trying to forget that I've lived this tirelessly? 

700
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:23,430
  Although they fought head-to-head with originality as the main weapon after copies surfaced... 

701
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:25,180
  Responsibility? You didn't want to lose. 

702
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,610
  - I'm sorry. 
 - This is not something that can be solved with an apology! 

703
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:30,020
 There's nothing more foolish than holding onto what's already passed. 

704
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,340
 Breaking news! 

705
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:35,210
 He will be working under Team Leader Ha in the Clair Marie licensing team. 

706
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:39,730
 It's hard enough for her to take care of Director Hwang's matters, but now her brother's, too. 

707
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,910
 I completely understand. 

708
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:46,570
 It would be best to not talk about what happened when we were drunk. 

709
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:48,590
 - Why did you come find me? 
 - To ask for some work. 

710
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:50,790
 I think I'm going to be staying here longer this time. 

711
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:52,250
 It's a brand you created. 

712
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:54,110
 How can you just abandon it like it's nothing? 

713
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:55,750
 Can you be okay with that? 

714
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,530
 I'm not okay. How can I be okay? 

715
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:59,310
 Does it look like I'm okay to you right now?! 

716
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:01,480
  -  Is there someone you like, by chance? 
 - Yes. 

717
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,290
  Is it the girl you met at the arranged date from last time? 

718
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:07,270
 That person was saying Soo Wan was his older brother. 

719
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:11,670
  - Maybe... 
 - From where did our start go awry? 

720
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:12,610
 Jae Gook. 

721
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:17,380
 How many times have we passed by each other? 

722
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:20,650
 What should I do?
