1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:05,980
   

2
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,090
   

3
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,650
   

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,910
  
  

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:32,000


6
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,010
   

7
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,720
Would letting your mother go

8
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,960
be the right thing to do?

9
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,480
If I were to respond as your daughter,

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,690
I would like it if you and mom

11
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,830
spent a long time growing old together.

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,580
But...

13
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,710
If I respond as a woman,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,660
Dad,

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,300
I think letting go is the right thing to do.

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,960
You're always on your mother's side, aren't you?

17
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,920
I have absolutely no idea.

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,930
About what?

19
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:35,000
For my whole life, it was my job to graduate kids every February.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,500
How do I graduate your mother

21
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,350
from my life and our marriage?

22
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,980
   
   

23
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,200
 The man, Yoon Jae Gook, 

24
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,400
 will ask the woman, Ha Yeong Eun, 

25
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,020
 this one thing just once more 

26
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,680
 for the last time. 

27
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,910
 Will you come with me? 

28
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,910
Dad, how did you let them go every year?

29
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,090
Was it not hard letting go every time?

30
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,250
A relationship doesn't just end when people can't see each other.

31
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,490
All they did was exit the school's doors.

32
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,120
When they run into difficult problems in life,

33
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,160
they will think, "Ah, Teacher Ha Taek Soo told me to do this."

34
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,570
Sometimes I am curious whether or not that kid is doing well.

35
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,890
They will always be a part of your life like that.

36
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,090
But what about Mom?

37
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,960
I can't let her go.

38
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,400
She was my best friend for nearly 40 years.

39
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,660
Even if there are nine things that she hates about me,

40
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,220
I want to leave one good thing in her hands.

41
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,110
That living with me wasn't all bad...

42
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,720
Even if that's what it takes, I want to grow old with your mother.

43
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:53,580
 What does it mean for love to be eternal? 

44
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,750
   

45
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,670
   
   

46
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:17,680
 What must one do to succeed in love? 

47
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,590
   

48
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,340
   

49
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,790
   

50
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,310
The company gave her a place and raised her,

51
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,240
but all it took was one sentence. "Take Sonó and become independent," and they're bouncing off the wall.

52
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,370
The company's sales took the hardest hit.

53
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,830
Even though we said Sonó was at its end, Sonó was a cash-cow brand.

54
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,570
Why didn't you bring Sonó's monthly sales records?

55
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,140
It's not like you guys are sergeants about to be discharged from the army!

56
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,320
You have all lost your military discipline.

57
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,680
I'm seeing the CEO in a whole new light!

58
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Even if you want to become independent, you need a factory, fabrics, an office, and all that.

59
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,280
You can't even come close to covering that with the severance pay.

60
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,670
But he said we could use all of the infrastructure.

61
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,390
I like not fighting with Chief Go the most.

62
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,510
I can do whatever I want as long as you give the okay, Team Leader.

63
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,760
Do I fight for no reason?

64
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,090
You sure do come to our office often these days.

65
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,130
Is Sonó run by the designers alone?

66
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,800
It's all thanks to me managing risks and covering from the back.

67
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,550
That's why Sonó is here today!

68
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,340
Wow... people these days.

69
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,910
Affection stemming from hate is still affection, but all you're thinking about is leaving completely.

70
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,160
You're not giving me an energy drink to raise spirits today?

71
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,980
Why would I? I won't!

72
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,560
I won't cling onto someone who's leaving!

73
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,860
- He's found his character. 
 - Give me a report on the monthly sales records

74
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,180
and bring a detailed strategy plan for the special offer product by the end of today.

75
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,370
How are we supposed to do all of that today?

76
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,920
I don't know either!

77
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,140
- Do it by the end of today. 
 - That—

78
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,980
Do what I say!

79
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,370
Follow me. We have to do it.

80
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,940
Seriously!

81
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,530
If Sonó leaves,

82
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,590
there will be a lot of changes to the company as well.

83
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,130
Since we decided to rely on Vision PR for all of our marketing—

84
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,200
There's no need for that now.

85
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,260
What?

86
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,260
There's no need to intentionally get tangled up with Vision PR because of me.

87
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,460
What are you talking about?

88
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,570
I mean, since when have you viewed Vision PR so highly?

89
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,340
You didn't have any interest in them before!

90
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,370
You're doing it on purpose in vain so that CEO Seok and I can stay together.

91
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,390
You're even giving him money.

92
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,490
So what you're saying is

93
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,000
to send you off in marriage,

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,160
I'm holding onto Vision PR by spending an enormous amount of marketing expenses?

95
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,240
Is that what you're saying?

96
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,100
It's true though.

97
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,950
How pitiful.

98
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:54,400
Right, I'm pitiful.

99
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,280
But whose fault is it that I got like this?

100
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,380
Always tsk tsk tsk, always untrustworthy, always pitiful!

101
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,570
Am I lacking because I want to be?

102
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,650
Am I pitiful because I want to be?

103
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,230
I, too, tried everything I could to do well.

104
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,330
You should have just left me alone.

105
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,690
You should have just sat and watched,

106
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,920
but you couldn't trust me that you gave away marketing rights and what not.

107
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,860
Do you know how miserable I felt?

108
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,710
How pathetic I felt?

109
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,360
Just what do you see your father as?

110
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,920
I see you as my dad. How else would I see you?

111
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,160
Gosh, you are so frustrating!

112
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,380
Do you not know me even after watching me from my side?

113
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,040
Have you ever seen me treat those with no skills as human beings?

114
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,860
I was the same when you fell for that guy Jimmy!

115
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,320
Have I ever given him a job as a model?

116
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,370
Then... is it not true?

117
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,990
Do you know how many employees and their family members' livelihoods are at risk for my company

118
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,460
that I would throw around company money for my daughter's love life?

119
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,030
Is that all you see your father as? Your father.

120
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,400
  One hundred percent I earned it with my abilities.  

121
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,650
 It's true that I liked you. 

122
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,210
 And it's also true that I became close to CEO Hwang through you. 

123
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,870
 Do you think my work became easier because of that? No, it didn't. 

124
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,020
 It became more difficult and challenging. 

125
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,240
  Because I would have to work harder and better to not hear these kinds of words.  

126
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:18,560
 But you, of all people, are suspecting me? 

127
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,220
 I don't want to hear any more of these offensive things.  

128
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,940
   

129
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,880
  So please leave. 

130
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,880
Then why was it CEO Seok of all people?

131
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,330
I can't even work with someone you're dating?

132
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,130
No, it's not that. It's just—

133
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,650
Whether you want to date him or break up with him, do as you please!

134
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:51,440
Because I, for one, think he is quite skilled and has a good head on his shoulders,

135
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,240
so I plan on working with him well into the future.

136
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,230
Why are you so down?

137
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,400
My blood sugar must be low.

138
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,570
I'm at that age now.

139
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:17,100
When I wake up, the pillow wrinkles on my face don't disappear quickly,

140
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,340
and things that I used to be able to brush aside with the help of a glass of alcohol

141
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,970
remain as bitter feelings.

142
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,020
Are you really going to go independent?

143
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,250
When are you leaving?

144
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,730
I'm not sure.

145
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,270
But you won't say that you aren't going.

146
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,960
I guess I'm really alone now.

147
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,520
Why are you alone?

148
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,980
What happened to CEO Seok?

149
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,860
I broke up with him!

150
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,200
What?

151
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,890
Limited edition? Hey, he gives up quite easily on a limited edition.

152
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,680
Forget it! It's really nothing.

153
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,830
Speaking bluntly, did I get proposed to?

154
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,780
Did I reserve a wedding hall?

155
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,310
It's okay! I'm fine.

156
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,320
That's your fifth sugar.

157
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,900
Didn't you misunderstand?

158
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,430
Say you're sorry and apologize—

159
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,250
He said let's do that as though he had been anticipating it.

160
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,620
It's not because you said something?

161
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,470
Well, things can go wrong while talking.

162
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,800
You think this is the Charter of National Education or something that I would have spoken as though written precisely?

163
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,450
This time, it seems like you've caused a problem with your words.

164
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,500
It's fine. Life is about living on the edge.

165
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,750
But... are you okay?

166
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,300
With what?

167
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,320
Are you okay with living without seeing J?

168
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,960
   

169
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,500
♫  I close my eyes and feel it  ♫

170
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,820
   

171
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,400
   
   

172
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:27,950
♫  Carrying your breath  ♫

173
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,390
♫  It's the sound of the wind  ♫

174
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,970
Yes.

175
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,190
I'll be out by this weekend.

176
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,760
I'll tell you the passcode, so you can show the studio.

177
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,620
Yes.

178
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,720
I have another call to answer.

179
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,010
Just a second.

180
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,390
Yes, thank you.

181
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,290
Hello? Yes.

182
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,420
- Team Leader Ha, you're here. 
 - Yes.

183
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,540
You were already here.

184
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,100
Cookie is tall, but his survival skills are quite low.

185
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,420
I am his agent and personally his friend.

186
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,610
You know, I was just with Chi Sook.

187
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,280
I don't really have to worry, right?

188
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,670
No, you don't have to worry.

189
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,530
There was a small misunderstanding,

190
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,500
but it's something Chi Sook and I need to figure out.

191
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,870
And it's something that we have to go through even if it takes some time.

192
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:43,030
Please take care of her so she won't be hurt for too long.

193
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,490
I know.

194
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,390
Yes, I understand. Okay.

195
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,200
Are you done talking with the realtor?

196
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,620
When will he return the deposit?

197
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,260
You have to get it before you return the keys.

198
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,700
I got it. I got it.

199
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,990
Did you call everyone to pick up their photos?

200
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,050
I'm doing it.

201
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,210
It's crazy.

202
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,440
There's a lot to do.

203
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,390
I told myself that I would bring in only what's necessary,

204
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:05,070
but without realizing it, there is so much equipment here now.

205
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,470
- What's coming in here? 
 - A coffee shop.

206
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,340
Since it's a different business, we'll have to clean everything up.

207
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,680
It's a shame everything, especially the lighting, needs to go.

208
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,390
   

209
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,000
Just a second.

210
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,170
Yes, Mother.

211
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,650
 Are you going to Paris? 

212
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,240
Yes, I've decided to do that.

213
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,890
When are you leaving?

214
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,960
Team Leader Ha.

215
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,590
Are you really going to remain in Seoul?

216
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:54,590
I think Cookie still has hopes that you might go with him.

217
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,880
Can't you just go with Cookie?

218
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,560
No.

219
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,960
I'm going alone.

220
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,410
I see.

221
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,600
Before you leave,

222
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,360
you'll visit me, right?

223
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,640
Yes.

224
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,390
Mi Sook's pictures.

225
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,720
 What are you doing again? 

226
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,340
 Let's try it, let's try it! 

227
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,000
 How should we do it so that we look like Miss Korea?  

228
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,290
They turned out nice and bright.

229
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,040
I don't want to send her off.

230
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,680
All of the equipment

231
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,700
will be moved tomorrow.

232
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,310
Then I

233
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:42,610
will be done preparing to leave.

234
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,500
   

235
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,930
What should she wear on the first day of school?

236
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,390
That one. The one in the middle.

237
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,440
This one?

238
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,880
Since it's spring, let's use the yellow pin, yes, that big one.

239
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,450
How is it?

240
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,280
- Okay. 
 - It's pretty.

241
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,970
Mom, I'm done showering.

242
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,590
Let's see. Let's see.

243
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,150
No soap anywhere. You did so well.

244
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,310
My sweetheart.

245
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:48,890
I'm sorry for making you wash yourself when you're only seven.

246
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,970
Now I wash by myself everyday, right?

247
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,660
- Yes. 
 - Since you can't do it because you're sick.

248
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,520
Still you'll check everyday, right?

249
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,240
Ji Min, it's time for your piano lesson.

250
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,050
- Let's dry your hair. 
 - Okay.

251
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,090
 The metastasis to surrounding tissues is accelerating. 

252
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,770
 You can have bloody sputum if blood vessels around the stomach are damaged. 

253
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,090
 If you get massive hemoptysis, it could become dangerous 

254
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,930
 since it may block the airway or drop blood pressure. 

255
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,400
   

256
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,580
There are too many.

257
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,540
There are too many things that I need to take care of.

258
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,900
What do I do?

259
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,670
I feel so bad for Ji Min. What do I do?

260
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,690
I can do them.

261
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,950
I can do them.

262
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,780
It's as easy as chewing gum.

263
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,330
It's so simple.

264
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:33,250
It's been so long since I asked you to bring a business proposal,

265
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,450
but I still haven't received anything.

266
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,760
I'm still contemplating.

267
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,740
Now that you're about to leave, you're wondering if it's the right decision,

268
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,010
but you feel like you'll regret it if you stay? Is that it?

269
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,940
How did you know what I'm feeling?

270
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,900
So when can I get your answer?

271
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,940
Please give me till this weekend.

272
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,670
Are you thinking something else by any chance?

273
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:09,600
I will organize everything including that something else and report to you.

274
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,260
Okay, I understand. You may leave.

275
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,100
Were you looking for me?

276
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,930
Oh, Team Leader Ha.

277
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,830
Just a minute.

278
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,430
Here... Sonó spec sheets.

279
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,690
You kept every single one?

280
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,090
How can I throw away the hard work by

281
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,530
Team Leader Ha, Manager Nam, and Assistant Manager Ahn?

282
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,170
I thought they might help some day if I kept them.

283
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:56,990
Thank you for nitpicking even down to the 0.1 mm.

284
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,300
I'm sorry for being so meticulous.

285
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,630
Thanks to that, the samples were always the best.

286
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,560
I hope you do well after you leave.

287
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,360
But how come you aren't going home?

288
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,030
I still have a bunch of Clair Marie stuff to do.

289
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:13,790
- How about dinner? 
 - I'll just get something quick.

290
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,200
Since you're here, do you want some toast to eat?

291
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,900
Shall I?

292
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,450
Your toast is the best.

293
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,200
Right.

294
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,310
You're going to miss this.

295
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,490
You did my first T-shirt as well.

296
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,460
You were so happy then.

297
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,270
If you do anything with that mindset, you'll do great.

298
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,610
Yes.

299
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:11,180
   

300
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,090
 Can't you just go with Cookie? 

301
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,530
You said you were going to pack during the weekend.

302
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,170
I'm here to help.

303
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,270
I can do it alone.

304
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,540
What are you going to do with those?

305
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,240
I'm just taking things I need.

306
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,420
From Europe to China, I'm an expert in business trips.

307
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,680
Packing skills of reducing volume and taking only the necessities

308
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,050
are a must for a designer.

309
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,410
What are you taking?

310
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,070
It wasn't practice.

311
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:21,020
I had a good subject.

312
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,710
Do Hoon said he had a meeting.

313
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,440
Did he forget the passcode or what?

314
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,510
Who is it?

315
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,010
You said you were going to be gone for a long time, so I brought some necessities.

316
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,510
Please have a seat. I'll bring out some tea.

317
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,490
I'll leave you two to talk.

318
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:18,500
No need. I'll leave.

319
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:26,190
Please spare me some time, Son.

320
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,810
You said you were going to help me pack.

321
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:55,460
Then shall we get to it?

322
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,300
The vitamins won't fit.

323
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,620
You just have to shove them in between things.

324
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,880
They all fit.

325
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,600
They do.

326
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:22,420
 One moment passes by. 

327
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:28,450
 Another moment rushes you. 

328
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:34,310
 The moment you and I love. 

329
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,670
 The moment you and I must part. 

330
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,370
You don't know when your father will barge in.

331
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:57,510
When he eats bread for breakfast, he suffers all day with indigestion.

332
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,780
I'll put the bone broth in the freezer.

333
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,740
Just boil it once.

334
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,710
Are you sure you're divorcing?

335
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,760
I should hurry and sign it.

336
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,950
He bothers me when he is in my sight

337
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,250
and when he is out of my sight.

338
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:17,280
But whenever I try to say the "d" of divorce, he disappears.

339
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,240
How about you just stop now?

340
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,000
Is this some joke

341
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,600
that I would be saying this and that?

342
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,000
I know.

343
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,470
I'm the one who said we should break up,

344
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:35,630
but seeing him all packed up

345
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:39,370
makes me wonder if this is right.

346
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,050
What are you saying?

347
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:43,500
Who's packing what?

348
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,980
Jae Gook is leaving to Paris.

349
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,780
What?

350
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,720
Right now, what I say

351
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,580
might sound mean and you won't like it,

352
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,490
but life

353
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,220
is about walking on a winding road.

354
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:17,510
You come by a crossroad and a cliff.

355
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,710
The people who were with you,

356
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:25,520
one may go this way while the other goes that way.

357
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,990
It's a shame.

358
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,570
You want to go with them.

359
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,300
But what can you do?

360
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,440
Everyone has their own path.

361
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,640
He asked me to go with him.

362
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:45,840
I have you

363
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,290
and Dad here.

364
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,520
All my people are here.

365
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:58,530
But I couldn't immediately say

366
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,140
"No. I can't do that."

367
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,300
Whatever season it may be, in which of them do we not feel disappointment as they pass by?

368
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:15,090
Whatever flower it may be, which of them do we not wish to pluck to put by our side?

369
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:19,590
But you must let them go.

370
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:23,340
You must let them be.

371
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,790
   

372
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,490
   
   
   

373
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,310
   

374
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,810
   

375
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:37,030
Team Leader, to prepare for next season, we need to put in the fabric purchasing order ahead of time.

376
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:41,590
Do we say the recipient is The One or Sonó, which is now independent?

377
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,100
If it's The One, we can keep the format as usual.

378
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,960
Otherwise, we need to create a new contract.

379
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,920
So they requested we get back to them ASAP.

380
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,220
Tell them that I will contact them.

381
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,750
Okay.

382
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,280
   

383
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,800
We're not in business. Sorry.

384
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,590
You're almost done packing here too.

385
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:26,300
I just need to take out the equipment later.

386
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,960
It's fortunate that I came before that.

387
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,150
- Sit here. 
 - Actually,

388
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:35,860
I had something I really had to request of you.

389
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,040
That's why I came.

390
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,950
With me...

391
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:47,160
Let's take a picture, Jae Gook.

392
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,010
The lighting.

393
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:05,710
It looks like you used this for a long time.

394
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:10,390
Oh, this is about to fall off.

395
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,830
There's a lot that needs to be repaired in the kitchen too.

396
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,300
The sink is too old.

397
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,160
Whether it be people or homes, when they become old,

398
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,190
their knees give out and their backs go out.

399
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,210
Our house is just like that.

400
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:27,750
It looks like you never repaired anything while you lived here.

401
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,330
I was busy teaching the future stars.

402
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,570
There was no leisure time to look after other things.

403
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,520
I think we need to hurry and fix the plumbing first and foremost.

404
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,360
Is the tile okay?

405
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,920
Get a good look to see if it's slippery or not.

406
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,240
It'll be a big incident if someone falls.

407
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,150
Yes, yes. I'll be sure to check.

408
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,220
You're the interior designer from that street right in front. Hello.

409
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,000
Hello, madam.

410
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,440
Mr. Principal said that he'd do the interior.

411
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,640
Then I'll be on my way. Okay.

412
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,040
Okay.

413
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,210
Please make sure we get a good quote.

414
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,560
Yes. Yes. I got it. I'll be in touch.

415
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,790
Okay, take care.

416
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,550
Okay.

417
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,660
What are you doing?

418
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,130
Did you learn well at the culture center?

419
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:12,410
Taking a backpack to and fro doesn't make it an academic pursuit.

420
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,460
Don't miss a single word of what the teacher said.

421
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,860
I said, what are you doing?!

422
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,740
Is she a megaphone or what?

423
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,640
Didn't you hear that I put the house up for sale?

424
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,770
Why are you investing money in a house that is going to be sold?!

425
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:34,520
Who can we give this house to when Yeong Eun poured her income into it month by month to keep the house?

426
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,920
Must we go to the judge?

427
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:45,020
You live here. I'll leave.

428
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,530
Because I lived well here for a good chunk of time,

429
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:51,330
I should fix what is broken before I leave, no?

430
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:55,400
Until then, just think you're renting out the small room.

431
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,700
Okay?

432
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,230
 I think it has become one of the leisure activities for the young. 

433
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:05,100
 Yes. Do you think it's like that only for our country or other countries as well? 

434
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:39,190
To you, I may be a cold-hearted mother,

435
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:44,630
but as a mother, if I have to be, I must.

436
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:48,960
And until the end,

437
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,020
I will live as your mother.

438
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,510
The fact that I'm waiting here,

439
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,550
don't forget that.

440
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,510
   

441
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,430
Mother!

442
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,710
I will call you.

443
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,310
   

444
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,410
Yes, Soo Ho.

445
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:44,280
Since it has metastasized to the stomach, bleeding started there.

446
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,100
For now, as it was urgent, we've stopped the bleeding at the upper blood vessels through bronchoscopy.

447
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,920
Then what happens now?

448
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,200
There aren't any other medications?

449
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,360
Eventually, a massive hemorrhage can develop.

450
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,680
At that stage, it can be fatal.

451
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:06,600
Doctor... how much time do we have left?

452
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:11,230
If there are any family members or other people that she must say her farewell to,

453
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:14,660
it's best to do it quickly.

454
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,360
Mi Sook, Mi Sook...

455
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,140
Mi Sook...

456
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,840
Let's get hospitalized.

457
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,460
I will take care of Ji Min.

458
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,090
Ah, I don't want to.

459
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:51,340
Hey! What's there for you to like or not like?

460
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,810
Are you a doctor? You are a patient, you brat.

461
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,570
Ah, quiet.

462
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,380
Did Soo Ho ask for your help?

463
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,500
Soo Ho is worrying a lot about you.

464
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,960
After I'm done with all of this medication,

465
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,170
I'm going to go home.

466
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,380
I have so much to do right now.

467
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,620
Hey Jeon Mi Sook, are you really going to be like this?

468
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,160
There are 48 colors in a colored pencil pack.

469
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,820
I've only placed a name sticker on half of them.

470
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,430
Her name needs to be written on the inside of the slippers using a permanent marker.

471
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:28,650
Ji Min can't tie her hair by herself.

472
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:32,160
We decided to practice together today.

473
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,770
She said I'm the best at tying it into two braids.

474
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,880
She said to make sure I teach her.

475
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,970
You brat, really...

476
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,940
Can't I do it?

477
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,320
I will do it for you, Mi Sook.

478
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,950
I am a mother.

479
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,340
I'm still a mother.

480
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,370
I'm so upset...

481
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,110
Yeong Eun,

482
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:04,590
please let me be a mother.

483
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,620
Ah, I'm so upset...

484
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,350
Mom!

485
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:00,910
 Meeting, living, loving, and breaking up 

486
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:07,590
 must be one aspect of life 

487
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:14,120
 like this scenery of a normal evening. 

488
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,600
 That's the path of life. 

489
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:37,350
 Living is sometimes sad or painful, 

490
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,340
 but we can't help but walk down that path 

491
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:48,380
 with acceptance. 

492
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,520
   

493
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,750
This crazy bastard.

494
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,050
You scared me!

495
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:37,630
My heart dropped!

496
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,530
Why are you peering into someone else's car?

497
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,430
Do you know how surprised I was?

498
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:45,650
What are you doing in front of my house?

499
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,000
How is this in front of your house?

500
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,530
Are you the only one who lives in this neighborhood?

501
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:53,410
I just came out for a drive.

502
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,650
Here?

503
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,690
It's my decision where I want to go.

504
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,400
I didn't come to see you.

505
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,860
It's just that even if I seek comfort from Yeong Eun,

506
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,740
she's probably not feeling herself either.

507
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:07,760
I have nowhere to go anyway, so I naturally came here.

508
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,960
What am I saying?

509
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:16,740
Then what are you doing not coming into my house?

510
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,820
What?

511
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:25,230
I also missed you very much.

512
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,180
Didn't we break up?

513
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,210
So why would I go into your house?

514
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,910
Who said that we broke up?

515
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,610
I like you so much that a mere misunderstanding wouldn't make me break up with you.

516
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:44,210
I... never broke up with you even for a minute or a second.

517
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,440
And I want to continue on that way well into the future.

518
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,390
Really?

519
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:54,520
You are really telling the truth, right?

520
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,890
♫  Lean on me for a bit and close your eyes  ♫

521
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:16,780
♫  Don't worry about anything  ♫

522
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,810
I also missed you.

523
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,790
I missed you very much, but...

524
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,990
I didn't know what to say.

525
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,000
I missed you very much.

526
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,390
While debating whether to call you or not,

527
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,780
I didn't call you, but...

528
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:36,940
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

529
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:46,240
♫  Stay here with me for a bit and stay the night  ♫

530
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,360
♫  Melt your tired heart  ♫

531
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:57,120
Tomorrow, you will be on your way.

532
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,800
Yes.

533
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:05,010
♫  Hurry and close your eyes  ♫

534
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,680
 We are standing at a crossroad.  

535
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,230
Why aren't you asking me?

536
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:25,780
You didn't ask me what I was going to do.

537
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:31,550
Your standpoint, your situation, and the reason you can't...

538
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,420
I fully comprehend and accept them.

539
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:40,920
But the reason why I still booked the ticket and asked you to come with me...

540
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,970
is because my heart is still the same.

541
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,500
I thought I should at least tell you that.

542
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:52,830
Even if I leave alone,

543
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:56,610
it's not because my heart has cooled down

544
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,830
or because my feelings have diminished.

545
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:03,400
I am still in love with the woman named Ha Yeong Eun.

546
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,980
Tomorrow and the day after.

547
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,960
It will still be that way.

548
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:13,430
It will go on like that.

549
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,920
I felt that I must tell you this.

550
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,310
 Do we really have to part ways? 

551
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:29,810
♫  When we are together, there are more things to laugh about  ♫

552
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:34,430
♫  Stay with me  ♫

553
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,190
Wow, why did you make so much?

554
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:17,220
If you are doing an exhibition, there's no guarantee that you will come back next year.

555
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,110
I don't know when we will eat together again at my house.

556
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:22,740
This is a very small gesture compared to how I feel.

557
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,440
I didn't prepare a lot, but eat well.

558
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,190
When you come to Paris, contact me.

559
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:29,350
Why are you saying something that's certain?

560
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,100
At that time, I will use your bed, so keep it vacant.

561
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,690
I will go to the airport by myself.

562
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,490
Seeing you off and greeting you is my signature.

563
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:42,640
Ah... you want to go cozily with Team Leader Ha?

564
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,910
I understand, you jerk.

565
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,810
Wow, it looks delicious.

566
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,160
Hyung, you ordered this, right?

567
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,980
The soup is hot, so cool it off before you eat.

568
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,410
Tell me the truth quickly.

569
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:55,990
Did I get caught?

570
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:59,430
I should start with the acorn jelly salad.

571
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:03,270
It tastes so good.

572
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,820
Team Leader... what are you doing?

573
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,740
Organizing.

574
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,400
Have you made up your mind?

575
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,960
- Yes. 
 - Are you really moving out?

576
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,430
Noona, you have to keep pace.

577
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:30,780
How can you start packing by yourself first?

578
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,540
Now, now... let's clear our desks.

579
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,570
Not you guys.

580
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:41,000
You guys stay here and keep Sonó going.

581
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:55,180
   

582
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,890
What is this right now?

583
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:03,290
I'm sorry, CEO.

584
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:04,940
Yeong Eun.

585
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:09,170
Thank you for everything thus far.

586
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,520
You won't regret it?

587
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:18,950
Maybe.

588
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,950
But if I don't go down that road now,

589
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:30,080
I think I will regret it much more and for a longer time.

590
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:10,330
   

591
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:38,140
You came.

592
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,920
Yes.

593
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,020
Mom!

594
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,600
Ji Min, you're back.

595
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,760
Did you have a good day?

596
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,800
Mom, I went to the bathroom by myself!

597
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,120
You did very well.

598
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:48,460
I also told my teacher that I tied my hair by myself.

599
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:53,190
Ji Min, when you are back from kindergarten,

600
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,710
I might not be here.

601
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:56,960
Why?

602
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,660
Um... I am very sleepy and tired that I might need to go to sleep.

603
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,480
I want to go too.

604
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,490
You can't come.

605
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:09,100
You can come when you are 100 years old.

606
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,720
Until then, eat a lot of food,

607
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,960
grow up tall, and come very, very late.

608
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,970
- You aren't 100 years old. 
 - No.

609
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:22,990
But I am very sleepy and tired.

610
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:26,080
Maybe it's because I didn't eat a lot of food.

611
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:32,260
So you need to eat a variety of side dishes, okay?

612
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,390
Yes!

613
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:35,790
Ah, so pretty.

614
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:45,030
So pretty. I love you.

615
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,290
Is this something to be this serious about?

616
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:58,020
Director.

617
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,960
 I came because I had something I must tell you. 

618
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,240
 Just because I am not going with you, 

619
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,610
 it doesn't mean that I don't like you enough 

620
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:44,230
 or that I can't trust my heart. 

621
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:50,200
 The woman Ha Yeong Eun 

622
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,480
 loves the man Yoon Jae Gook as usual. 

623
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,670
 At first, 

624
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,980
 I wasn't confident in my love. 

625
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:16,650
 But because of you, 

626
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:19,590
 I have learned that this love works. 

627
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:28,840
 Very impressive! 

628
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:39,260
 Because of your love, I went where I haven't gone 

629
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:46,950
 and I've achieved something that even I myself thought was impossible. 

630
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,400
 Thank you. 
 (Informal speech) 

631
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:57,930
 Thank you. 
(Formal speech) 

632
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,940
 I was thoroughly happy. 

633
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,370
 I have loved overflowingly. 

634
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,920
 Okay. 

635
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:23,030
 Thank you, Yoon Jae Gook, 

636
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,510
 for loving me. 

637
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:30,030
 For allowing me to love. 

638
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:34,630
 Now, I won't be afraid. 

639
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:39,430
 Just like how we loved, with that strength, 

640
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,520
 I will live on. 

641
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,490
♫  What I should say  ♫

642
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:54,400
♫  Both the season of youth and the warm wind  ♫

643
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:59,820
♫  Don't mean anything  ♫

644
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,370
♫  Because you're not here  ♫

645
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:07,150
♫  To clear my head  ♫

646
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:14,720
♫  Without being aware, I'm here in front of your house  ♫

647
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,970
That's right. Pulling it straight through.

648
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,840
That's right. With the rubber band.

649
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,460
What is this?

650
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,800
   

651
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,420
Ji Min.

652
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:28,050
 - Love is not eternal  
 - The fried rice comes with a fried egg.

653
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:30,270
 - because you are together,  
 - You have to tell your teacher to take that out, okay?

654
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,670
Okay.

655
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:35,020
 - but through that love, one changes,  
 - Okay. Oh yeah!

656
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:39,720
 - and as that love told you and taught you,  
 - Ji Min, should we show her your Shin-chan dance?

657
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:45,050
 - you live the remainder of your life.  
 - Good job.

658
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,350
Soo Ho,

659
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:56,240
because I loved you, I was very happy.

660
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:04,230
I said that no matter what happened, I would protect you

661
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,980
and that I would be your guardian angel.

662
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:11,370
I'm sorry for not keeping that promise.

663
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:18,390
Honey, you... are my guardian angel.

664
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:25,320
When I came home angry, you always took my side.

665
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:31,500
When I got frustrated because nothing went my way, you drank beer with me.

666
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,560
When I was angry, you made me laugh with your nonsense.

667
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:42,240
When I was happy, you were happier for me.

668
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:48,510
You... were my guardian angel.

669
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:52,460
I'm sorry for letting you go alone.

670
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,830
I am sorry

671
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,280
that I cannot volunteer myself saying that I would go with you.

672
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:09,690
Please take good care of Ji Min.

673
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:15,050
I'm sorry to make you do everything alone.

674
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,650
Watch us well.

675
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:20,770
When we meet later,

676
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:24,250
let's recognize each other at once.

677
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:28,760
Yes, let's.

678
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,980
♫  The song I wrote all night  ♫

679
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:34,140
♫  Seems just like a burned moth  ♫

680
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:41,270
♫  Stay my tiny dreams  ♫

681
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:44,840
Please be sad for just three days.

682
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:48,780
Then shake off the past

683
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:53,100
and live your life.

684
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:55,270
♫  Stay my shiny dreams  ♫

685
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:58,300
♫  My close friend, you will come find me, right?  ♫

686
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:03,950
 One day it rains, and one day it's sunny. 

687
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:08,610
 One day I'm there, and one day I'm gone. 

688
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:27,370
 Sadness comes by for a short while, 

689
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:33,040
 and loneliness brushes by like the wind in your life. 

690
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,560
♫  Stay my tiny dreams  ♫

691
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:42,700
♫  When the one star in my small room goes out  ♫

692
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,530
♫  Stay my shiny dreams  ♫

693
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:50,990
 While living nonchalantly, 

694
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:55,310
 please think of me briefly 

695
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:58,680
 some day, randomly. 

696
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,760
   
   
   

697
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,220
 Then live on. 

698
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:10,240
♫  If I lie down hungry  ♫

699
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:18,810
♫  I think I will be discovered in a mess  ♫

700
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:25,000
♫  Covering the long night with a blanket which slipped off  ♫

701
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:31,300
♫  Stay my tiny dreams  ♫

702
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:37,400
♫  When the one star in my small room goes out  ♫

703
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:45,040
♫  Stay my shiny dreams  ♫

704
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:51,220
♫  My close friend, you will come find me, right?  ♫

705
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:18,250
   
   

706
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:43,220
We will pay a silent tribute to the deceased.

707
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:59,560
   
   

708
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:04,080
   

709
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,050
Farewell.

710
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:01,060
Ji Min, you will be late. Let's hurry and go to kindergarten.

711
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:03,220
Yes, Auntie.

712
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:12,860
Auntie, I tied my hair better today than yesterday, right?

713
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:15,150
You need to say goodbye to Mom.

714
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:19,200
Mom, I'll be back.

715
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:37,640
Once again, I'm sorry, Yeong Eun. I have a morning meeting.

716
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:42,080
Hurry and go. I'll make sure Ji Min goes to kindergarten before I leave.

717
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,070
Then, please do the favor for me.

718
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:46,080
Ji Min, when you get to kindergarten, tell the teacher—

719
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,750
I have an egg allergy.

720
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:49,600
Please take out the fried egg.

721
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,960
You must take the egg out of the kimbap.

722
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,150
Rather than castella, do you have rice cake?

723
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:56,150
- Okay! 
 - Okay!

724
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:57,440
See you later!

725
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,600
Thanks.

726
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,580
Shall we go?

727
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:05,180
The weather is nice, isn't it?

728
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,720
Your ribbon is pretty.

729
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,180
It's for Mom to see.

730
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:11,780
I think she will see it very well.

731
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,410
Ji Min!

732
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:21,060
I have an egg allergy. Please take out the fried egg.

733
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:23,360
You must take the egg out of the kimbap.

734
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,510
Rather than castella, do you have rice cake?

735
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:28,560
I do! Shall we go in?

736
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:36,000
 Eternal love permeates the life of the beloved. 

737
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:44,790
 It stays as part of their life and is always with them.  

738
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:48,160
   
   

739
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:50,610
   
   

740
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:04,400
Hey, Yeong Eun!

741
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,360
I mean, Team Leader Ha. What are you saying right now?

742
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,790
I heard you are leaving by yourself.

743
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:13,220
Manager Nam, starting tomorrow when you come to work, check the daily sales first.

744
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:16,180
I'll tell HR to give you permission to see the details.

745
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,370
You wretch.

746
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:21,190
No, Team Leader Ha.

747
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:25,580
Seon Joo, if the fabric is wrinkled or if there are any dye issues,

748
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:28,850
notify the production, business, and development departments right away.

749
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:31,980
It's most accurate and efficient to solve it together at once.

750
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,950
Hey, Team Leader Ha, are you sure you thought it through thoroughly?

751
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:37,680
Say it, even if it is now.

752
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,560
I'll tell the CEO to reconsider your resignation.

753
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,440
Chi Hyeong and So Yeong, make sure to keep the sample room tidy.

754
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:51,030
Be careful of the magnetic buttons so they don't leave scratch marks on each other.

755
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:52,250
Just what's the matter with you, Noona?

756
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:55,320
If you're told to take Sonó and become independent, the answer should be either yes or no.

757
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:59,360
Why is it that you always write out a long response to a multiple choice question?

758
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:12,760
 Not with Sonó, but I will become independent by myself. 

759
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,090
 The reason? 

760
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:20,360
 There are designs I've wanted to do but haven't been able to do. 

761
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,660
 I thought I was going to fail. 

762
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:26,960
 And knowing so, I didn't think there was a reason to choose a difficult path. 

763
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,710
 I thought doing things in moderation was enough. 

764
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:35,270
 I found out that it was an excuse I made for my lack of self-confidence. 

765
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:39,090
 Now, I want to try those designs. 

766
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:41,620
 So you have confidence now? 

767
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:46,340
 I still feel nervous. I am still concerned. 

768
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:50,960
 But if things break, they break. If they fall, they fall. 

769
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,480
 I have the courage to try going down that path even if it may be so. 

770
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,020
 There will be laughter in freedom. 

771
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:59,700
 But difficulties will lie ahead. 

772
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,980
 I am determined. 

773
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,910
 I understand what you mean. 

774
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,190
 It's an answer suitable to you. 

775
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,210
 Thank you. 

776
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:27,730
 I met someone. 

777
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:31,220
 I loved that someone. 

778
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:36,400
 But we just can't be together. 

779
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,720
 That love has made a path, 
    

780
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:45,610
 and I walk down that path with that love. 

781
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:48,490
 The love that will come true. 

782
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:52,360
 The love that will last forever. 

783
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,580
 This is what those are. 

784
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:58,100
♫  When I keep aimlessly wandering the streets  ♫

785
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:06,880
♫  Without being aware, I'm here in front of your house  ♫

786
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:12,270
♫  At first, I was calmer than I thought I would be  ♫

787
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:18,440
♫  The longing hurts more than breaking up  ♫

788
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:23,280
♫  It is just a day to endure  ♫

789
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,510
♫  The more time passes, the more it intensifies  ♫

790
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:33,980
♫  Love leaves. Why does only the farewell remain?  ♫

791
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:39,940
   

792
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:43,910
 What did you just say? Why? 

793
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:48,580
 I want to do what I've really wanted to do and what I've been putting off due to my lack of confidence. 

794
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:52,660
 Wow, you did all this? These designs are too good to look at alone. 

795
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,320
 Should I just do another fashion show? 

796
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,750
 How about in Paris this time? 

797
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:56,990
 Do what? 

798
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:58,730
 I don't know how long it will take. 

799
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:00,860
 But this time, with my own strength... 

800
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:02,930
 By the way, have you not heard from J? 

801
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:05,600
 Cookie isn't the type to call just to say hello. 

802
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,760
 It's a relationship the two of them have wrapped up. 

803
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,910
 Let's leave it to them, whether they meet again or not. 

804
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,320
 I miss you. 

805
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:20,380
 I wish that one day on a street corner, you would be there like that day. 

806
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:26,460


807
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:36,150
