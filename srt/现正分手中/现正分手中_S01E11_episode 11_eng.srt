1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:06,260
   

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,150
   

3
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,670
   

4
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,950
   
   

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:33,010
 Timing and subtitles brought to you by 
 Are You The One Team @ Viki 

6
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,040
   

7
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,460
If we didn't have much time left to spend together either, what would you like to do?

8
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,370
Since nothing lasts forever.

9
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,550
What about you?

10
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,680
Love passionately without any regrets.

11
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,110
Getting my hopes up, I see.

12
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,370
No matter what people say, kissing in the middle of a crosswalk.

13
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,170
Anytime.

14
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,530
Not going to work or taking care of anything and spending all day together.

15
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,940
Doing my best to get the remote back if you take it away.

16
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,340
Being together by the ocean, just the two of us.

17
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,490
No cellphones or laptops.

18
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,330
Pushing a cart together while grocery shopping then betting on who'll do the dishes.

19
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,530
Sharing an umbrella together on a rainy day

20
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,110
and walking until our shoes get wet.

21
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,010
That even after being nagged at all day,

22
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,150
when I open my eyes in the morning,

23
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,280
for the first person I see

24
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,650
to be Ha Yeong Eun.

25
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,860
 To me, who asked what our end would be like 

26
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,060
 he is 

27
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,260
 giving me answers to life. 

28
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,610
After doing everything we want,

29
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,270
should we break up?

30
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,050
 If you still insist on carrying on with Jae Gook, 

31
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,890
 I won't be here on this earth. 

32
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:59,820
 Seeing Jae Gook distressed his entire life after I die...  

33
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,110
 Is that the kind of love that you want to have? 

34
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,940
Before we hurt each other,

35
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,440
without fighting or becoming tired of each other,

36
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,780
if we do what we wanted to do,

37
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,410
just the good things,

38
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,850
and spend good times...

39
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,990
Then, we won't have any regrets or lingering attachments.

40
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,940
After that, with smiling faces,

41
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,850
should we break up?

42
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,420
   

43
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,430
   

44
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,250
   

45
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,970
What happened all of a sudden?

46
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,840
Senior Manager Kim from the business department said

47
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,710
- that the audit team is evaluating. 
 - Why?

48
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,130
No way. Is our company perhaps being sold?

49
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,400
- It's here. 
 - Ah, yes.

50
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,410
- What about the chart? 
 - I'll show you.

51
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,010
How far has the pop-up with Lafayette progressed?

52
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,450
We are in the process of confirming the designs.

53
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,200
We are planning on choosing them within a few days.

54
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,110
We have found that many directly managed stores are losing money.

55
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,140
Can we get a list of directly managed stores and other retail stores?

56
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,250
I understand.

57
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,520
- As soon as it is ready, I will report it to the business department. 
 - Okay.

58
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,810
Can we get not only the income statement and the balance sheet,

59
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,610
but also more information about the cost of debt and brand name value?

60
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,300
Yes, let's do that.

61
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,680
- What is this about, Team Leader? 
 - Not sure...

62
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,040
I did hear that there are stock market rumors going around that a clothing company is being sold.

63
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,280
No way. It's not our company, right?

64
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,810
My brother-in-law is in the financial sector.

65
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,090
He said that a foreign company is paying attention to one of the leading domestic fashion companies.

66
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,510
They contacted each other behind the scenes, but they are almost done talking.

67
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,950
Are you sure it is us?

68
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:51,960
It's been 30 years since its founding. The leading brand is S. It recently launched a new brand.

69
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,720
- That obviously sounds like us. 
 - No way.

70
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,810
We have Lafayette and our season collection is doing well.

71
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,060
You have to sell when the business is doing well so that you can sell it at a good price.

72
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,160
Did you perhaps hear anything, Team Leader?

73
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,120
No, I haven't.

74
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,710
Father, is our company being sold?

75
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,100
What are you saying this early in the morning?

76
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,370
Why is the audit team suddenly sifting through the whole company?

77
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,980
That's because there is a use and need for all of it.

78
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,720
How much are you planning to sell it for?

79
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,510
What is this? You've already started talking about the selling price?

80
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,440
You were proceeding, and I am the only one who was out of the loop again?

81
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,770
- And what is that about? 
 - You always do that!

82
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,230
At the company and at home, I'm always the outcast!

83
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,430
You and Chi Hyeong always know, but I'm the only one who doesn't.

84
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,970
If you sell the company this time,

85
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,560
I definitely have a share in this.

86
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,530
Launching SonÃ³ and Clair Marie.

87
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,820
I did all of that. You know, right?

88
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,590
- Me too! 
 - What did you do?

89
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,520
I boosted team spirit as the maknae and

90
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,670
separated out products that didn't meet expectation while using muscle pain spray.

91
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,510
Since I took care of that unfinished work on my own,

92
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,050
Yeong Eun was able to focus on the big tasks.

93
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,260
You can say that I covered her back.

94
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,240
If you were going to cover, you should have been on the front line.

95
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,420
How dare you as a newbie.

96
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,050
The front line?

97
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,490
Ah, then it's neither of us. It was Yeong Eun.

98
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,910
Right, Father? You would have to give a share to Yeong Eun.

99
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,920
You think you can walk all over me like this?

100
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,240
- It's Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun. 
- Come in!

101
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,510
Look at this, look at this.

102
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,280
Look at Team Leader Ha doing all the work by herself.

103
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,060
How is it progressing with Lafayette?

104
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,510
- Was there a response from them? 
 - Not yet.

105
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,550
Because it seems that there are quite a lot of requirements.

106
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,550
We'll organize as much as we can on our end and report it to you within this week.

107
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,320
Okay, I got it. Leave.

108
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,530
Why? Do you have something to say?

109
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,940
There is a strange rumor going around in the company, CEO.

110
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,450
If you are talking about the acquisition rumor, I've already went at him once, Yeong Eun.

111
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,920
They say that the buyer is a foreign company.

112
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,500
Really? A foreign company?

113
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,920
- It was a foreign company, Father? 
 - So noisy!

114
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,420
Don't be so rash.

115
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,030
Just proceed well with Lafayette.

116
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,950
He definitely won't say anything.

117
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,060
The CEO position is like that.

118
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,200
Until it's definite, he will never talk about it.

119
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,810
We need to know too though.

120
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,780
We are employees of this company and that is definitely our business.

121
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,680
You really don't know how to run a business.

122
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,900
That would do nothing but lower an individual's performance and the company's value as well.

123
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,710
Then what do we do?

124
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,930
There is no guarantee that the acquiring company will accept us.

125
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,700
Hey, Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun,

126
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,230
do you know something?

127
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,990
If it's regarding Lafayette, I don't have a response yet.

128
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,810
If you're talking about art wall approval, I'll ask for it sometime today.

129
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,280
Are you naive or senseless?

130
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,840
Don't you know that the company is being sold?

131
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,660
No, I didn't hear about that.

132
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,310
Then...

133
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,500
Okay. Work hard!

134
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,740
Since it's going to be someone else's company anyway, spend all of the budget.

135
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,340
What should we do, Chief?

136
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,290
I don't even know my own way forward.

137
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,580
How can I know yours?

138
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,350
In this case, the quick one wins.

139
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,530
Like a flash of lightning, find your own way to survive.

140
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,950
Find your own way to survive.

141
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,190
This is Chief Go of The One.

142
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,840
Yes, yes, yes.

143
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,200
How about having a refreshing drink later?

144
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,760
Well, I also have things to discuss about the company.

145
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,770
What are you talking about?

146
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,840
- An acquisition? The One? 
 - Yes.

147
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,690
That's what they say. There's a rumor about an acquisition right now.

148
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,650
Seeing that an audit team has been formed, it seems like it's actually happening.

149
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,950
So? What will happen to Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun?

150
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,140
It's probably one of two things.

151
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,360
Either she remains with the company or she leaves.

152
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,830
   

153
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,910
   

154
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,300
This is all of the feedback from Lafayette?

155
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,990
Yes, I think it's going to take a long time to coordinate.

156
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,730
That's so vague.

157
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,440
Since they say it's a matter of style and trend...

158
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,740
There was also a problem with size and length.

159
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,250
They asked for a comfortable look for the dress.

160
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,630
So how about we use an elastic band at the waist to make it slightly looser?

161
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:28,010
We probably need to consult the pattern makers first, right?

162
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,890
Nam Na Ri.

163
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,100
Do we still have to work hard like this?

164
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,900
What if we don't work hard? Are we just going to let go of the project with Lafayette?

165
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,020
When our company might get acquired,

166
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,860
would anyone pay attention?

167
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,990
Yes, someone will.

168
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,900
I will.

169
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,400
Did the company get acquired already?

170
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,390
There's no official announcement regarding the acquisition.

171
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,640
Why are you turning over the company already?

172
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,240
Isn't it just a matter of time since the audit team has been formed?

173
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,710
Those who run the business in our company will take care of that.

174
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,510
Designers just need to focus on making clothes.

175
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,550
I guess you aren't even worried.

176
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm the same as all of you.

177
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,060
I am worried and anxious just like you.

178
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,790
But that changes nothing.

179
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,910
The only things I get more of by worrying

180
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,370
are my sighs and tight shoulders.

181
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,880
So let's focus, okay?

182
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,780
Get an appointment with the chief of pattern making.

183
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,900
Yes, I understand.

184
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,930
I will go to the pattern room.

185
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,090
Yes... I'll leave that to you then.

186
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,390
Leave what?

187
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,680
I've put the house up for sale with the real estate agency,

188
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,730
so if they come, show them around.

189
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,690
- Put what up? 
 - If it gets sold, we might not be able to pay back all of the debt

190
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,760
that Yeong Eun paid off for us, but we can give her at least some.

191
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,870
And we'll divide the rest in half.

192
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,500
- It's my house so at whose wishes? 
 - Is it your house alone?

193
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,970
Half of it is mine.

194
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,990
Whatever, I can't divorce. No, I won't!

195
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,280
- Why can't you? 
 - Because it's ungrateful!

196
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,240
I let you live your whole life being called madam,

197
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,630
but you bring out divorce papers before the retirement ceremony flowers wilt?

198
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,420
If anything, due to indignation, I won't divorce you!

199
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,560
- Should we go to trial? 
 - Fine, let's!

200
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,340
To put it bluntly, did I gamble? Beat my wife? Cheat?

201
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,470
In my case, I have not done anything to deserve being divorced!

202
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,590
You did cheat!

203
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,980
I did?

204
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,380
When?

205
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,370
Whoever it is, I don't have the energy or heart to fight.

206
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,430
Since I'll cleanly end things between us, go and live with her!

207
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,760
And who exactly is she?

208
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,670
Mo Gyeong Ja!

209
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,320
- Mo Gyeong... 
   - This is my number. 

210
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,070
 If you ever need my help, feel free to contact me. 

211
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,330
 Mok Gyeok Ja (means witness). 

212
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,030
 Mo Gyeong Ja (sounds similar to "witness" and also sounds like a normal name). 

213
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,310
Oh, that! No, that is...

214
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,850
That is... no. Hey! That'sâ

215
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,180
Gosh, really...

216
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,620
I'll have a chicken sandwich combo, and please add a salad.

217
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,050
Yes, coming right up.

218
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,690
A merger and acquisition isn't always a bad thing.

219
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,370
The company could actually grow.

220
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,250
I'm not concerned. It doesn't have anything to do with me anyway.

221
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,600
Why would your company's issues have nothing to do with you?

222
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,430
I don't know anything about business operations, nor am I involved in any way.

223
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,460
You're not nervous?

224
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,520
People live and die,

225
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,770
so there is nothing that makes a company everlasting.

226
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,360
Each person lives their own number of years of life given to live, enjoys their prime,

227
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,400
and then disappears for a while.

228
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,160
Going through ups and downs is inevitable.

229
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,490
That's what I mean.

230
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,840
Even in the case of our mothers' persistence,

231
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,800
nothing says that they'll hold up forever.

232
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,760
You never know how things may change after some time.

233
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,270
Until that time comes,

234
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,780
can't we just hang in there a bit longer?

235
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,570
After some time,

236
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,060
when they realize how unwavering we are,

237
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,230
both my mother and your mother

238
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,710
will eventually understand.

239
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,110
Your shirt is pretty today.

240
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,380
It's a color I like.

241
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,870
You like black?

242
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,290
I like blue-black.

243
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,450
It looks like black, but in a bright place,

244
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,380
it has a dark blue tinge to it.

245
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,910
Being black doesn't mean it's all dark and gloomy.

246
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:36,140
Rather, there are times when it's hiding a color that no one expects.

247
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:42,320
Like how parting with someone is not always sad and difficult.

248
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,210
Looks like you are well enough to come out to the culture center.

249
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,220
You should just tell him to go to Paris.

250
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,380
I heard he was living there until now.

251
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,900
His home and mother are here, so why would he?

252
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,640
If they are physically distant, their hearts will become distant as well.

253
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,780
I made it clear to Ha Yeong Eun

254
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,940
that I wouldn't accept her even if it kills me.

255
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,580
Why would you make that clear to my Yeong Eun?

256
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,060
Everything will be solved if you manage your son well.

257
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,590
Why? Does your son not listen to you?

258
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,810
Our Jae Gook is a kind and gentle kid.

259
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,470
I raised him with my whole heart.

260
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,390
As if I raised Yeong Eun with only half of my heart.

261
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,700
To be honest, it's true that our statuses

262
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,330
- do not suit each other. 
 - Excuse me?

263
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,380
Status?

264
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:12,120
Is this Yeong Eun? I'm with Yoon Jae Gook's mother right now,

265
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,700
and she's bringing up status in front of me.

266
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,360
 Am I to take it that if a family has a bit of money and lives in a rich neighborhood, they have status? 

267
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,760
 Hey, even though I may not seem like it, I am the wife of a vice principal! 

268
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,100
If I may point out, we are a household of educators!

269
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,740
Mom, I can't talk right now.

270
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,310
She said she made it clear to you that she wouldn't accept you over her dead body.

271
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,060
Even after hearing that, you didn't get turned off?

272
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,940
Mom...

273
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,600
- Let's just talk later. 
 - Give it to me.

274
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,090
Yes, hello, Mother. It's me, Yoon Jae Gook.

275
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,750
Mr. Yoon Jae Gook?

276
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,870
You're with our Yeong Eun right now?

277
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,610
 Look here, while your mother goes to the extent of comparing our statuses and whatnot, 

278
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,840
saying she will oppose this even if it kills her,

279
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,860
why do you hold onto and make it difficult for our Yeong Eun instead of listening to your mother?

280
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,020
- Give it back. 
 - No.

281
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,830
Please continue.

282
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,320
 Our Yeong Eun, 

283
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,120
without any connections and genuinely with her own abilities,

284
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,720
rose to that high position at The One.

285
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,530
She's skilled, beautiful, and flawless in every way.

286
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:29,250
How dare you compare status when you don't know anything?

287
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:35,490
I really hate people like your family who are rude,

288
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,260
acting high above everyone else because they're rich.

289
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,970
- Do you understand? 
 - Look here!

290
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,440
I don't approve either!

291
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,560
I won't approve of you even if it kills me,

292
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,280
so please just leave our Yeong Eun alone!

293
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,120
Understood?

294
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,810
Aigoo, status? Aigoo.

295
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:12,640
You dare show off a son from an extramarital relationship?

296
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,810
Take a look at yourself before bringing down someone else's household.

297
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,630
Would you still be able to say these things?

298
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,280
Mother! What's wrong? Are you hurt somewhere?

299
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,520
Let's eat.

300
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,690
   
   

301
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,010
I think her feelings are really hurt. Speak politely.

302
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,360
Why did you do that?

303
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,920
I am not the one who started it.

304
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,070
She was the one

305
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,080
who went at me without any common sense.

306
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,770
They are not people who lack common sense, Mother.

307
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,590
Are you saying that I'm in the wrong right now?

308
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,050
You may be noble, but I'm not.

309
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,180
I'm not even dignified,

310
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,460
and I don't have status like you or my brother.

311
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,280
Why are you being like this too? Don't you see that she is distressed?

312
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,410
Because you're my child.

313
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,860
That's why I did what I did.

314
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,260
Because you are my child.

315
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,670
That's why I said what I said.

316
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,480
Satisfied?

317
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,930
Exactly why did you do that?

318
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,010
I had a reason to, that's why. What's wrong with that?

319
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,940
Why are you being like this too, Mom?

320
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,250
I'm already having a tough time.

321
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,860
Raise with her whole heart?

322
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,110
Is she the only one who is whole-hearted? Am I half-hearted?

323
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,650
Every parent who has a child feels the same way.

324
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,260
If she knows that her son is precious,

325
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,590
she should also know that someone's child is also precious.

326
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,840
Even if they ran out eagerly and were hospitable, I would still disapprove.

327
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,440
This is my relationship and he is someone I'm dating.

328
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,260
Why are the mothers getting involved and acting like this?

329
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,500
Did I say that I was getting married?

330
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,740
That's why I'm like this even more!

331
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,770
You aren't even getting married yet you are spending time

332
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:12,920
being head over heels for a man like that.

333
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,700
I understand, Mother. I understand, so please stop now.

334
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,810
They're foul. Yoon Jae Gook is Yoon Jae Gook,

335
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,170
but that woman he calls a mother is foul as well.

336
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,830
I got it. So stop now.

337
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,790
Your father said that he has another woman.

338
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,290
Okay, I said I got it.

339
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,640
What are you talking about?

340
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,080
This is defamation!

341
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,570
I, Ha Taek Soo, have had my honor severely defamed!

342
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:43,180
Since I can't just let this go by, you need to apologize politely!

343
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,190
He is right.

344
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,920
It is true that he got scammed while trying to travel to Europe with you.

345
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,730
I am an upstanding victim.

346
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,850
You sure do like Europe.

347
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,650
Why are you suddenly into Europe?

348
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,290
You said you were the only one who's never been to Europe out of all your friends.

349
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,370
You...

350
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,990
Don't you ever feel pity for your daughter?

351
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,990
Mom...

352
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,810
When you get old, you won't have anything to do but go to the hospital.

353
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,480
By saving every penny,

354
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,130
we should take care of our own hospital bills.

355
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,310
How can you be so naive?

356
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,050
How can you have so little foresight?

357
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,080
Is it "Live today like there is no tomorrow!" or something?

358
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,890
Did I do this just for myself?

359
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:26,190
I saved up through gathering pocket money as well!

360
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,230
You need to realize one's real intentions.

361
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,380
All your life, all you've cared about is money, money, money!

362
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,720
That money, money, money...!

363
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,950
Maybe if you didn't cause money problems!

364
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:38,030
All my life, I've been struggling so much that being frugal is ingrained in me,

365
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,390
causing me to hear that my status is lacking from others.

366
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,450
Why do I have to live receiving this kind of disrespect?

367
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,300
Do you think I caused money problems because I wanted to?

368
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,600
It happened because I was a guarantor for the wrong person one time!

369
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,140
It's all old news now.

370
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,970
After unexpectedly having Yeong Eun at the age of 27,

371
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,490
I only had one dream for my entire life!

372
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:59,660
To have a home in Seoul that I could call my own, take some of the weight off of you,

373
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,340
and make it so that our Yeong Eun wouldn't have to transfer schools.

374
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,870
Do you think life was comfortable for me?

375
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,200
Teachers younger than me,

376
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,670
who had the chairman of the board as their connection or the vice principal as their relative,

377
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,720
became head teachers and vice principals before me.

378
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,740
To them I had to say "yes, sir" and greet them with a bow.

379
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,150
Not once did I say that I would quit.

380
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,800
Because I am the head of the household. Because I have a family that only looks at me.

381
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,290
I lived a hard life too, you know!

382
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,680
You don't even know!

383
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,040
You're so great! So amazing!

384
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,120
Aigoo, why are there so many show-offs today?

385
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:09,640
Mom, we all know.

386
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,520
The fact that you suffered and tried hard...

387
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,650
Sometimes, I hated it too.

388
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:23,520
I cut my life in half and dedicated one half to your father

389
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,480
and the other half to you.

390
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,240
I've been anxious, nervous,

391
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,430
and worried my entire life.

392
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,400
It is my life...

393
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,200
It is Kang Jeong Ja's life.

394
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,410
But without having lived for Kang Jeong Ja, not even once,

395
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,600
and becoming shriveled like this,

396
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,380
I...

397
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,810
feel so lonely.

398
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,880
You think...

399
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,330
I lived my own life?

400
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,070
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes, I'm fine.

401
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,960
You are now an expert with steamed eggs.

402
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,420
They say the ice will calm it down.

403
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,830
What are you going to do about my funeral?

404
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,750
What?

405
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,570
The same old yukgaejang that they serve at all funerals,

406
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:04,220
meatballs that have turned cold,

407
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,610
and dried up squid...

408
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,710
I don't want to end my life with them.

409
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:13,080
When you are done eating, gargle right away. You can't develop canker sores.

410
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,450
Might as well

411
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,970
make it a party for me while I'm alive.

412
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,150
Make it exciting and flashy.

413
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,510
Should I wear a dress?

414
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:26,720
If I wear it now, the fit would be amazing.

415
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:31,260
To drink 12 glasses, drink water diligently.

416
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,720
With my guests,

417
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,120
while having a lot of fun eating, drinking, and chatting...

418
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,660
Before leaving, thanks to all of you, I had a lot of fun as if I were on a picnic.

419
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,620
Please let me have my farewell like that.

420
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,300
Don't touch the dishes.

421
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,860
Don't touch the knife. If you get cut, it's easier to become infected.

422
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,720
Before it gets worse, hurry up and hold my funeral.

423
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,630
Huh?

424
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:07,460
Why do you only talk about leaving?

425
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,800
You didn't die yet!

426
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,580
You are breathing.

427
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,490
You are even talking.

428
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:17,390
You are even looking at me. You didn't die. You are alive!

429
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,730
But why do you keep...

430
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,660
Honey,

431
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:29,460
I want to leave while smiling.

432
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,720
Please let me do that.

433
00:29:52,510 --> 00:30:01,230
â«  The fuzzy world seen though eyeglasses  â«

434
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,550
â«  Seems just like me  â«

435
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:14,930
â«  The song I wrote all night  â«

436
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:18,200
â«  Seems just like a burned moth  â«

437
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:25,020
â«  Stay my tiny dreams  â«

438
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:31,830
â«  When the one star in my small room goes out  â«

439
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:37,610
You really can't?

440
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:45,610
â«  My close friend, you will come find me, right?  â«

441
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,880
I...

442
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:52,980
don't like her, Jae Gook.

443
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,030
â«  When the one star in my small room  â«

444
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,800
Can you...

445
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,250
just appease me?

446
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:06,820
â«  Stay my shiny dreams  â«

447
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:13,010
â«  My close friend, you will come find me, right?  â«

448
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:17,580
 Let's break up now. 

449
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,890
 Before we hurt each other more. 

450
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,890
 Before we get tired of each other 

451
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,530
 while fighting with each other. 

452
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,920
Oh.

453
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,040
Hello.

454
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,380
Why are you just standing and staring when a guest has arrived?

455
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,040
Pardon? Oh, yes.

456
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,780
What am I thinking? Please have a seat.

457
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,590
Would you like some coffee or tea?

458
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,830
No need. Come sit.

459
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,460
Okay.

460
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,270
How are things with Chi Sook lately?

461
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,810
Going well?

462
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:11,590
Well, I just came back from having brunch with her in front of the company.

463
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,810
Any progress?

464
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,990
It's going very smoothly.

465
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:20,180
Now that you mention it, I finally gifted her a poetry book today.

466
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,720
- Poetry? 
 - Yes! Poetry.

467
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,360
 What is it? 

468
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,980
   

469
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,360
 It is a poetry book just like you. 

470
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,720
 Am I frayed and tattered like this? 

471
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,720
 Hundred Thousand Billion Poems. 

472
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,490
 If you combine any four lines and read them, you can create 100 trillion poems. 

473
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,310
 The surprising uniqueness of being able to form 100 trillion poems. 

474
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,590
 It's definitely not tattered, 

475
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:59,150
 nor is it ugly. 

476
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:02,380
 It's very special. Yes. 

477
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,420
 Right. 

478
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,990
Are you the type of person who always chases rainbows?

479
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:14,540
Father, naturally, love is synonymous to writing poems.

480
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:18,900
Because it softens the heart, makes it resonate, and stirs up emotions.

481
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,010
What about your house? Is it your own or do you rent?

482
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:26,220
Since I paid off my mortgage two years ago, my house is completely mine.

483
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,960
And your health? How are your cholesterol levels?

484
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,040
My physical exam results came back last month,

485
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,040
and my blood vessels are basically first rate.

486
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,360
What do you like about Chi Sook?

487
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,640
Pardon?

488
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,120
What about her is the most beautiful?

489
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,970
Everything is beautiful.

490
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,060
Her making wrong guesses, apologizing immediately when she's wrong,

491
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:51,890
and having no idea how beautiful a person she is.

492
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,000
I adore it all.

493
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,850
Are you certain that she likes you?

494
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,440
It's probably true.

495
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,820
When I gifted her that poetry book, she couldn't help but smile.

496
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:10,170
Right about now, she's probably falling for the person I am.

497
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:19,280
Hey Yeong Eun, isn't a gift typically a sparkly or a just released product?

498
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,820
Or a super valuable limited edition

499
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,320
 or something like that? 

500
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,480
They're requesting that we change all of the silhouettes?

501
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,760
They're saying it's lacking the vibe that Parisians love.

502
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,010
Are you saying I have no emotion?

503
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:33,830
In other words, they're saying we lack taste.

504
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,020
- Hey, Ha Yeong Eun, youâ 
 - I'm busy so I'm hanging up.

505
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:45,350
How polite. Everyone ignores me anyway.

506
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,820
Hwang Chi Sook just gets ignored from all directions.

507
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,350
I gave you all the head managers' phone numbers, so we're all good, right?

508
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,840
Soo Ho.

509
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,130
- Did he decide to come back to work? 
 - So stop calling me and contact them yourself.

510
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,120
No! How can I do everything alone?

511
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,000
They're all your connections and your people.

512
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,330
Connections are also a skill, Assistant Manager Seo.

513
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,320
If you don't have any, start making them now.

514
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,460
Senior Manager.

515
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,400
Can you please come back to work?

516
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,880
I can't go on without you.

517
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,520
- Wow, this is so annoying. 
 - Assistant Manager Seo.

518
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,000
I don't have any intention to intrude into someone else's home.

519
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,260
As long as you come back, I'll be all right.

520
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,930
Assistant Manager Seo, listen carefully.

521
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,390
The truth is, I'm not that remarkable of a person.

522
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,130
Dressing well?

523
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:37,480
That's all thanks to my wife who picked and dressed me in clothes that didn't seem like they were from the last season.

524
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,590
And the fact that I was able to work well without worrying about what's happening at home?

525
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:44,500
That's because the mother of my child... is parenting Ji Min alone.

526
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,460
- Senior Manager. 
 - So don't get fooled by a married man.

527
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,990
Because everything is the effect of my wife.

528
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:55,600
Until my replacement is found, send me everything work related by e-mail.

529
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,790
Stop calling me.

530
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,600
Senior Manager! Senior Manager!

531
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,880
Senior Manager!

532
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,560
This is big!

533
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,700
The skirt's length is too short, so we might have to bring it down a bit.

534
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,700
Hold on a second.

535
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,040
Hello, this is Ha Yeong Eun.

536
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,510
Hey, Yeong Eun. What did I say?

537
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,360
You ignored my gut feeling! I told you Gwak Soo Ho had another woman!

538
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,680
 That human is cheating right now! 

539
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,520
Just wait! I'm going to Mi Sook right now.

540
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,170
Where are you?

541
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:36,150
Don't do anything. Meet with me first.

542
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,060
So where are you?

543
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,550
Mi Sook is getting betrayed right now, and you're saying to hide it?

544
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,590
Hey, that's disrespecting Mi Sook.

545
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:45,070
Do you know how much it hurts your pride when you're the only one who doesn't know

546
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,160
about your own business and you're the last one to find out?

547
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,080
- She's sick. 
 - That's what I mean!

548
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,430
He left his sick wife and cheated!

549
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,590
Mi Sook has the right to know too.

550
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:56,270
And what if that makes her get worse?

551
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,240
She is barely enduring with chemotherapy.

552
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,360
On top of that, if she gets shocked finding out that her man is cheating,

553
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,250
how will she hold up?

554
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,750
You never know!

555
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:08,820
She could get really mad and strengthen her will to live!

556
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,500
What is it?

557
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,790
If you have something to say, then say it.

558
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,370
I just missed you.

559
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,160
What's with you?

560
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,090
Do you know that that's the most absurd thing I've heard until now?

561
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,540
Why are you hugging Ji Min?

562
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,050
I guess she didn't nap at kindergarten.

563
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,460
She kept begging me to hug her.

564
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,810
You're tired. I'll go lay her down and come back.

565
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:49,260
I'm not tired at all.

566
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:53,630
I'm so happy that I can hug my baby.

567
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,270
Are you eating properly?

568
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:01,110
Hey, even though I dieted so much, I couldn't lose my age weight.

569
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,710
But now, I fit into everything I wore during my modeling days.

570
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,920
The fit is incredible, but nobody is calling me.

571
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,050
You're still holding on to the model thing?

572
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,560
Do you still feel bummed out about it?

573
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,090
I feel like I didn't get to do enough of anything.

574
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:16,780
I should have hugged Ji Min one more time.

575
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,950
I should have loved Soo Ho a lot more.

576
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:24,700
So I plan on doing everything I procrastinated on in one go and leaving cleanly.

577
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,940
Forget Soo Ho...

578
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,080
Anyway, why are you thinking about leaving, girl?

579
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,750
You should be thinking about holding on!

580
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,520
Letting go is also love.

581
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,850
Is there any melo more dramatic than

582
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:43,130
giving all that I can and separating well?

583
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,000
So girls,

584
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,010
when you are next to someone you like, express it out loud.

585
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:54,570
Don't hold back, okay?

586
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,770
Do you really plan on going all the way?

587
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,680
Probably.

588
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,960
Even though I don't really know what all the way is.

589
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,560
Even if you lose everything?

590
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:23,920
To be honest, I still don't get why I need my parents' approval

591
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,130
for my love or marriage.

592
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:33,730
It's my life, she's my woman, and it's my choice.

593
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:38,150
There are some things you can't see clearly from where you are, Jae Gook.

594
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:43,460
That's when you should listen to what the people close to you are saying.

595
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:47,030
All I want to do is to find my life partner,

596
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:49,940
and I found her.

597
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:54,430
The fact that your life partner is Ha Yeong Eun is a tragedy.

598
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,730
How do you know that, Noona?

599
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:03,500
You didn't even know that my brother was on his way to break up with Ha Yeong Eun back then.

600
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,250
That's why you followed him.

601
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,600
On that rainy road.

602
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:20,980
I thought it was a bit weird when I heard from the police that he was driving while intoxicated.

603
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:26,690
Because the brother that I knew was not the kind of person who would drink alone.

604
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,260
So I went to find the place where he drank the alcohol.

605
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,040
 It was a woman. 

606
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,490
I heard that my brother was with someone.

607
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,600
And I found out that that person was you.

608
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,150
 I remember them because they occasionally came by together. 

609
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:45,120
 The man drank some and then left. She followed him out right after. 

610
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,510
 They came in separate cars. 

611
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:52,030
 But it seemed like the woman drove to follow him. 

612
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,310
I realized that he drank

613
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:16,210
   

614
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:19,930
after his car had already left.

615
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,120
The rain was even pouring down scarily,

616
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:33,450
so I thought I had to stop him through any means.

617
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,760
Because it was dangerous.

618
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,430
Because I thought I shouldn't let him go in that state.

619
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:14,510
But... why did you pretend not to know until now?

620
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:22,260
Because... I knew that you sincerely loved him.

621
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:27,160
And you were the person that would have the hardest time living because of it.

622
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:32,140
But above all... because it was an accident.

623
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,830
You all worked hard.

624
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,110
Even though we worked hard,

625
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:20,440
the fact that there's nothing we can do if they say that the owner has changed and you guys need to leave

626
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,020
is a bit disappointing.

627
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,400
You sent an email to Lafayette, right?

628
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,900
They said they would take a look and reply back.

629
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,290
I will check it. Go and rest today.

630
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:30,230
Okay, see you tomorrow.

631
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,210
Let's work hard tomorrow too.

632
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,190
Thank you!

633
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:36,850
   

634
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,010
What is it?

635
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,840
Do you have a date with Cookie today?

636
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:48,230
I planned to meet up with him after work for a short while. Why?

637
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:53,020
Today, I'm going to show my Hoon what a passionate relationship is like.

638
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,180
Just like Mi Sook said, what's the use in saving it?

639
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,070
I plan to use it freely.

640
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:01,950
So send your Cookie home late today, okay?

641
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,450
Shall we quietly have a drink today?

642
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,550
   

643
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,580
Yes, it's me.

644
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,320
 Where are you? 

645
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,030
Drinking frequently is bad for your health.

646
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:07,650
And I am quite concerned about your health.

647
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,500
Are you sure that we are dating?

648
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,300
- Of course. 
 - Then why are you like this?

649
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,980
I thought I was going on a date, but you gave me a collection of poems.

650
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,070
I wanted to drink together, but you're giving me tea.

651
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:20,660
I guess we must meet at a bakery next time, so we can dip our bread into milk.

652
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:23,410
Oh, that isn't a bad idea...

653
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,960
Exactly why are you like this?

654
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,100
Do you even like me?

655
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,130
Of course.

656
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,700
Why would I spend time with a woman that I don't like?

657
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,860
Then why are you so lukewarm?

658
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:38,290
Can you say that a cup of tea and a poetry book are appropriate for a romance between an adult man and woman?

659
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,490
Because you are precious.

660
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,600
I don't know what kind of relationships

661
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,830
you've been in until now.

662
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:51,480
From now on, when you're dating me,

663
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,810
You are the most precious person to me,

664
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:56,810
Chi Sook.

665
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:31,790
   

666
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,190
   

667
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,900
Do you have a lot of work?

668
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,400
The people from Paris are saying to change the design.

669
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,260
Our opinions, their opinions...

670
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,130
There's still a lot of back and forth.

671
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,960
   

672
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,280
Aren't you going to answer it?

673
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,020
Yes, Mother.

674
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,000
Yes.

675
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,410
Yes.

676
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,520
I ate dinner already.

677
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,910
Yes.

678
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,590
You don't need to worry.

679
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,230
Yes, I understand.

680
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,690
Continuing our relationship will be like this.

681
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,680
You won't be able to answer

682
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,440
a phone call with your mother comfortably.

683
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,660
That doesn't mean we should give up on our path.

684
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:21,360
So the two of them got married.

685
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,010
And they live happily ever after, but...

686
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:26,000
It wasn't a happy ending.

687
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,440
It's like how a marriage is not the completion of love

688
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,190
nor the end result.

689
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,300
Just because you had your wedding vows,

690
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,980
it doesn't mean that your heart is bound.

691
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,200
So we can break up then.

692
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,300
During the holidays, we can't even go home.

693
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,920
We must avoid conversations about our mothers.

694
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,810
Even though we didn't do anything wrong,

695
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:46,330
we have to be sorry to each other

696
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:48,340
and work harder to treat the other better.

697
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:52,490
Pretending it's not, pretending we are fine.

698
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:54,560
Why do you keep finding excuses?

699
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,640
Why do you keep finding reasons to break up?

700
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,810
Because I love you.

701
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:01,570
But...

702
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:05,580
Holding on isn't the only way to love.

703
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,140
Letting go well is also love.

704
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:14,640
How truthfully and sincerely

705
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,000
we spend this time

706
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,620
is more important to me.

707
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:22,130
That moment...

708
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:25,880
It's enough that we were together.

709
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,430
Then, we won't regret it.

710
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,710
From the moment I met you until now,

711
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,850
I haven't had any regrets.

712
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:48,920
So after we try everything,

713
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,110
if it still doesn't work out,

714
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,700
say that we are breaking up then as the very last thing.

715
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,600
I will answer you then.

716
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:07,390
â«  Stay here with me for a bit and stay the night  â«

717
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:14,490
â«  Melt your tired heart  â«

718
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:21,290
â«  This night, tonight won't come again  â«

719
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:27,050
â«  Hurry and close your eyes  â«

720
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:35,750
â«  When spring's sunset comes  â«

721
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:39,160
â«  And colors the sky  â«

722
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:45,350
â«  Please smile that day  â«

723
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:52,510
â«  The flowers that we've waited for welcome us  â«

724
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:57,930
â«  So love spreads  â«

725
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:06,410
â«  You came to me today so my heart flutters  â«

726
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:13,660
â«  I cannot fall sleep easily  â«

727
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:17,850
â«  The moon still shines brightly in the dawn sky  â«

728
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:20,440
 Until now,  

729
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,260
 I've never acted like a baby towards you.  

730
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,350
 But... 

731
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,320
 I'm really sorry, 

732
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:36,970
  but can I do it just once? 

733
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:41,420
 Just once... 

734
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,120
 I will make an unreasonable demand to you. 

735
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:52,660
 Please accept... Ha Yeong Eun.  

736
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:56,150
What should I do, Soo Wan?

737
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:00,590
What should I do about your brother?

738
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:11,000
â«  Fall asleep peacefully  â«

739
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,670
   

740
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:20,620
It's a bit harsh of them to pressure us for the fabric test report.

741
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:25,010
What do they mean we need to reproduce the fabric that has been approved and is already in production?

742
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,800
The production alone cost us 500 million won.

743
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,830
We used all the factory lines to make ours.

744
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:31,970
If we say that we aren't using that fabric now,

745
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:34,440
that factory is losing out on this entire season.

746
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,070
If you were to convert that into money, 500 million won doesn't even equate.

747
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:40,430
There's no obvious defect, so for what reason can we say that we can't use their fabric?

748
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:42,930
If they are doing this knowing that we can't do it,

749
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:45,560
doesn't that mean that they want to overturn it?

750
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:50,520
Team Leader, they sent another modification request.

751
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:57,000
   

752
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,250
They weren't nitpicking our design. They were just asking for an athleisure look.

753
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:04,390
In the end, they want us to follow the trend that everyone is doing.

754
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:08,920
But we can't start making tennis skirts or track pants.

755
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,020
They're the ones in charge. Do we have a choice?

756
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,770
But we can't throw away our identity.

757
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:19,490
Taking their feedback into consideration, let's adjust it one more time while keeping our characteristics.

758
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:27,790
 Our company has two positions remaining. Do you have any thoughts of coming over? 

759
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:29,990
 When can you give me an answer by? 

760
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:33,240
 I think I need to discuss it with Sunbae Na Ri. 

761
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,880
Are you really not going to go with me?

762
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,960
You will be promoted from a manager position to a team leader position.

763
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,480
If we both leave at once, what about the pop-up with Lafayette right now?

764
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,650
You know how important this project is for Team Leader Ha and SonÃ³.

765
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:58,230
What is there to know? Does the company ask about our opinions and stay loyal?

766
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:03,090
No, it doesn't. Then why should the employees be like that?

767
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:07,170
They are accepting me on the condition that you join as well.

768
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:11,400
So please think about it carefully and give me an answer.

769
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,000
Or I have to look elsewhere...

770
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:24,380
It's hard to accommodate Lafayette's conditions?

771
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,950
This fabric was produced specifically to work with our design.

772
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:29,930
If we were to change the texture now, we need to adjust the design

773
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:32,660
and place another fabric order. We won't make it in time.

774
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,300
But why are you packing all of a sudden?

775
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,310
People shouldn't stay in one place for too long.

776
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:40,240
Stagnant water goes bad.

777
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,680
If it's heavy, it will sink.

778
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,980
Since it's been a while, I'm just lightly organizing my things.

779
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:48,230
So what are you going to do about Lafayette?

780
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:50,000
We will wait until the end of the week.

781
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,620
If we still can't compromise, we will look for another solution.

782
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,640
Okay then. Do what you can.

783
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,140
Do everything you want to do.

784
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,400
I will support you all the way.

785
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:05,330
They say that the colors don't match the trend.

786
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:09,080
The orchid pink or solar red that they are requesting doesn't suit us.

787
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,150
We can't change the color of the main pieces, so maybe two of the cotton dresses instead.

788
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:14,780
Tell them we will proceed with some neon color as the other color.

789
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,530
When the samples are out, check every single one.

790
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:18,820
- If there's a problem, report it to the team leader right away. 
 - Yes.

791
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:22,620
The length is so long that I would like it to be shorter.

792
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:26,570
Team Leader, they said to incorporate more of the European vibe.

793
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,190
I don't think they will like it because it's so lovely.

794
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:33,970
- Check it out. 
- Yes.

795
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,160
They aren't even replying anymore.

796
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,990
Don't wake her up.

797
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:53,470
Okay.

798
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:55,870
Na Ri, they still didn't respond?

799
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:58,610
They said that the representative is on a business trip.

800
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:19,470
I'm here, Madam.

801
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:24,190
What are you doing there?

802
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:33,350
You have to do some work with me today.

803
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,980
- Team Leader. 
 - What is it?

804
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,210
Are you looking for ideas?

805
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:47,680
As I keep watching it, I was hoping something would open up.

806
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,520
Having a stage like that, getting applause from buyers...

807
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,140
Sounds like a story from another nation.

808
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,610
Did they respond?

809
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:59,790
No, the fabric sample is here. They're asking us to decide.

810
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:02,210
Okay.

811
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,090
I just brought the samples for now.

812
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:10,650
If you give the final okay, then I will make that one and try to meet the quantity.

813
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,560
Looking at it from here and looking at it in the sunlight are different,

814
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,280
so keep that in mind.

815
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:22,780
Since it's for the S/S, isn't it better if the brightness value is higher?

816
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,180
Is this also black?

817
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,510
Yes, it's called Charleston Green.

818
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:29,220
When the sunlight is in front of you, it appears green.

819
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:32,590
But it is still a variety of black.

820
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:45,350
There isn't a more diverse color than black.

821
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:50,610
Let's go with our fabric as originally planned.

822
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:53,430
Send them an email that we can't adjust it anymore.

823
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:56,850
Are you sure? What are you going to do if they say they'll end the contract immediately?

824
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:59,980
What good is it doing what they tell us to do?

825
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:02,090
Without even incorporating one percent of our idea,

826
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:05,320
would that really be our clothing if we produce just as they tell us?

827
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,820
If they don't give a response by tomorrow,

828
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:11,980
tell them that we will proceed as last discussed.

829
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,590
Okay.

830
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:41,090
You came? I was planning to finish before you came.

831
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:43,530
What are you doing?

832
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:48,450
I should let Soo Wan go now.

833
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:49,960
Mother.

834
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,240
Shall we have a cup of tea?

835
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:05,260
I only lived looking at you and Soo Wan.

836
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:08,690
As a woman, seeing a husband's back turned towards me

837
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:13,920
was very insulting and embarrassing.

838
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,730
But I had hope that he would come back to me.

839
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:22,370
With that hope, I endured in this house.

840
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:27,520
So that the two of you wouldn't hear

841
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,580
things like you were raised by divorced or separated parents.

842
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:37,530
I wanted to raise my children without a flaw.

843
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:44,360
That might be the reason why I objected to Soo Wan and that woman even more.

844
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:49,540
To leave Yoo Jeong and go to another woman...

845
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:55,260
If you really want to go all the way with her, then go.

846
00:59:55,260 --> 01:00:00,590
I won't stop you any longer. I will give up.

847
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:03,070
- Mother... 
 - Instead...

848
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:05,860
Do it after I'm gone, when I'm not here.

849
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:10,440
In a world where I am gone, so that I can't see.

850
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,880
Do it just between the two of you.

851
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,050
Mother, how can you say that?

852
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:16,900
It's awful, right?

853
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,020
But I find her even more awful.

854
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:23,290
Seeing her not even flinch once after hearing these words...

855
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:27,150
I am afraid and I don't like her.

856
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:29,820
What do you mean by that?

857
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:33,500
Did you perhaps tell her this as well?

858
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:37,790
It seemed like it wouldn't work with any other method.

859
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:41,870
So I said that

860
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:45,600
I would die.

861
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:51,000
Or else, she wouldn't separate from you.

862
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:56,630
 If we didn't have much time left to spend together either, what would you like to do? 

863
01:00:56,630 --> 01:01:01,470
 After that, with smiling faces, 

864
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:03,440
 should we break up? 

865
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:11,800
Let's place your belongings in Soo Wan's room.

866
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:16,020
Come back home. Don't wander outside anymore.

867
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:20,200
Mother... that's an obsession.

868
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,220
It's because you are my son.

869
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:26,420
Yes, I know that. I am your son.

870
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:29,020
I've never denied it.

871
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,290
I respect and like you.

872
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:39,790
But that doesn't mean you can decide my life.

873
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:40,820
Jae Gook.

874
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:46,190
How could you say those words to her?

875
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:51,250
How could  you cause her pain... with those words?

876
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:54,600
- Jae Gook. 
- I said that I love her!

877
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:58,470
I said that I couldn't live without her.

878
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:03,400
How could you threaten her

879
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:07,350
with those words?

880
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:12,760
Because I need to protect you...

881
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:19,820
So did your love protect my brother?

882
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:29,800
Jae Gook, you... your words are a bit harsh.

883
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,110
How can you... to your mother?

884
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:33,910
Because you're my mom...

885
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:38,160
Because you are my mother, I am here.

886
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:43,610
If it were someone else, I wouldn't have seen them twice.

887

â«  When I feel out of breath while walking  â«

01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:58,240
Adding another thing to what I want to do.

898
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:03,240
Without caring about other people's perceptions,

899
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:07,630
hugging you tightly at my company.

900
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:13,020
 To him who responded with sadness,  

901
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,290
 I talked about happiness.  

902
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:18,690
â«  I miss you  â«

903

â«  Both the season of youth and the warm wind  â«

01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:25,550

â«  Don't mean anything  â«

906

 I hope our farewell

01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:38,700
 is different from others.

 Should we just go to Paris? 

918
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:40,030
 A place where there's just the two of us... 

919
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,860
 Shall we go? 

920
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:47,010
 Are you going back to Paris? 

921
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,030
 He said we should go to Paris together. 

922
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:50,790
 Should I go? Just like that? 

923
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:53,530
 Daughter, just know that your mother and I are going to court. 

924
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:55,250
 Did you get kicked out by Mom? 

925
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:57,590
 Great job! 

926
01:05:57,590 --> 01:05:59,550
 What's a man doing working in the kitchen? 

927
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:01,000
 What are you two doing? 

928
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,410
 We need to find our own path for survival. 

929
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:05,020
 You can do what you want, Team Leader Ha. As much as you want. 

930
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,270
 - The investment has been decided. 
 - We're receiving an investment? 

931
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:10,240
 - You signed off on it. 
 - I'll take all responsibility! I'll take all responsibility, so... 

932
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,440
 You decided after weighing all the factors, right? 

933
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,610
 Stop! 

934
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:15,590
 Jeon Mi Sook, please be a model for our show. 

935

 You will host this show for us, right? 

936
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:22,720
 I love you so, so much. 

937
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,970
 I have no choice but to resent Ha Yeong Eun. 

938
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:28,230
 I won't speak about Ha Yeong Eun with you anymore.
 

939
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:32,040
 - Jae Gook. 
 - Just give me one month's time 

940
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,450
