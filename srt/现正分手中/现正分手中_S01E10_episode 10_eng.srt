1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,500
   

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,130
   

3
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,570
   

4
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,970
   
   

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:32,980


6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,900
   

7
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,100
You are very pretty.

8
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,820
My daughter, her promising life...

9
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,380
have been put on hold for a decade.

10
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,800
My life has also been difficult from watching that.

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,520
That's why... your daughter should stop.

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,480
Is it my daughter's fault?

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,900
Can one hand make a clapping sound by itself?

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,310
You already dealt with my eldest,

15
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:16,160
so you should at the very least be sorry and not do this.

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,400
Who are you saying should be sorry?

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,630
It wouldn't be sufficient even if you bowed down in front of me right now and begged for forgiveness.

18
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,100
Do you know how long my child waited in the rain?

19
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,760
Because she met the wrong man, my child gave up her bright future

20
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,470
and for ten years, she... Do you know what she had to give up?

21
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:40,950
My child... died.

22
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,240
He went out after receiving your daughter's call and was not able to come back from that road.

23
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,450
Ten years, you say?  Are you heartbroken?

24
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,490
I can neither see

25
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,890
nor touch my child.

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,920
   

27
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,530
If she says she can't overcome it,

28
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,350
I understand that.

29
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,950
If she says she can't understand,

30
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,140
I understand that as well.

31
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,810
However...

32
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,600
to use them as reasons why we can't love,

33
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,040
I can't understand that.

34
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,300
He was two years old when I took him in as my own son.

35
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,640
That's why...

36
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,000
he is a child that makes my heart ache all the more.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,890
Please stop her.

38
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:03,330
I don't want to go through losing a child twice.

39
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,110
 You can't hold onto the setting sun. 

40
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,950
 But... 

41
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,990
I love you.

42
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,530
 Whatever we are allowed. 

43
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,740
I love you.

44
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,670
 However much time we have left. 

45
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,030
   

46
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,750
   

47
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,690
   

48
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,040
So this is the place where my Cookie wants to start his new life.

49
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,440
It's nice, right?

50
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,480
Yes, of course.

51
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,460
It has walls and a ceiling.

52
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,450
The door doesn't fit quite right, but it will be great for ventilation.

53
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,390
How should I promote it?

54
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,230
"The best photographer of the domestic fashion industry will take your ID photos." How's that?

55
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,090
You know, as the center of the domestic PR industry, you don't seem to have put in much thought.

56
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,390
At least you aren't completely irrational yet. That's a relief.

57
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,980
Hurry up and return to where you belong.

58
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,460
Hey, what's wrong with this place?

59
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,070
You're Mister J, you know.  Paris is waiting for you.

60
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,190
The person I like is here.

61
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,490
I want to work, love, and fight next to her.

62
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,940
Do it.  I'm telling you to do it.

63
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,680
But stay at your career level, okay?

64
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,730
Work to your ability. Don't waste your talents by scaling down.

65
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:56,430
Whether I'm scaling down or another road is opening up, no one knows.

66
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,400
Maybe you should change too.

67
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,030
Who knows? An unexpected road could open up.

68
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,830
- A change? 
 - In any case, I'm going to open right away,

69
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,010
so don't add anything to my calendar. Got it?

70
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,670
I couldn't just pass by,

71
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,870
so I stopped by on my way to work.

72
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,140
There were flowers that looked just like you.

73
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,170
You changed completely.

74
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,370
Do you like it?

75
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,600
 That's it, right there.  The big, bright eyes, 

76
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,390
 the straight nose bridge, and the soft lip line? 

77
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,890
 What, is she sleepy? 

78
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,180
I'll come get you when it's time for you to leave work.

79
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,550
Just wait, Chi Sook!

80
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,090
Got it.

81
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,260
How was it?  Did she fall for it?

82
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,470
She seemed a bit sleepy.

83
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,520
She was sleepy?

84
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,810
You need to make the big push while things are like this.

85
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,490
The back of my neck already feels pretty bare. I can't do any more.

86
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,110
You're going on a date later this evening, right?

87
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,310
For now, yes.  I told her that I'd be coming to get her.

88
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,310
There were countless five pyeong fabric stores like mine 
  (1 pyeong = 36 square feet) 

89
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,290
that ran their business in Dongdaemun.

90
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,570
As time went on, some people closed their doors because business was bad.

91
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,350
Others passed it on to another person.  However, I...

92
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,540
I grew it to become The One.

93
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:11,550
Alway changing the subject like this must be a family tradition.

94
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,460
It doesn't matter what the beginning was like.

95
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,490
It only matters how you make it into a success.

96
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,530
That means...?

97
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,790
Whether it'll end in two months or whether it'll continue...

98
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,130
report back to me after tonight's date.

99
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,150
Tonight?

100
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,240
Why would you drag it out?

101
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,300
You need to make me feel certain,

102
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,100
so that I can decide how to look at you.

103
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,030
Yes, I will do my best to bring you that certainty.

104
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,290
I'm confused.

105
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,830
Is kissing... like swimming?

106
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,040
Once you do it, your body remembers.

107
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,490
If you fall into water, you remember automatically.

108
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,800
In that sense, it seems like you've fallen for CEO Seok.

109
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,650
I haven't yet.

110
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,430
I thought you were going on a date tonight.

111
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,240
His style completely changed.

112
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,320
Seeing him put in the effort even though he knows that the relationship will end,

113
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,370
it seemed like I was looking at myself.

114
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,040
Try dating him sincerely.  CEO Seok is a good person.

115
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,530
You know that my relationships were always just unrequited love that eventually ended.

116
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,770
If I get dumped after showing interest,

117
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,280
I wouldn't have regrets since I would have been on a few dates with them.

118
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,450
But if the relationship with a person who likes me ends too,

119
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,880
I think that'll hurt a lot.

120
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,120
Rather than that happening, keeping the relationship strictly business is better

121
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,630
since at least that good person will remain.

122
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,620
Don't ever run away in the middle of a relationship, okay?

123
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,210
It's not that it hurts because love fell apart,

124
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,970
but because a person turned his back on you.

125
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,690
Words of advice from experience.

126
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,390
Should we have tteokbokki*? ( *Spicy rice cake )

127
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,560
I have a meeting with a domestic fabric maker. I have a lot of things to prepare too.

128
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,000
- Aren't you having lunch? 
 - I have plans.

129
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,790
Don't turn your back on me first either!

130
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,640
   

131
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,250
Not even one person showed up?

132
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,000
Do Hoon was right.

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,960
I don't think people come to studios to get their pictures taken these days.

134
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,030
I see that it hasn't bothered you much though.

135
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,980
That's why I'm changing my methods.

136
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,040
I won't limit the number of photos, and I'll take as many pictures as needed until we get the best one.

137
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,200
The price will stay at ₩5,000  (US$5).  How's that?

138
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,760
People will show up, right?

139
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,130
You really aren't made for a business life.

140
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,120
It'll just be chaotic with no profits.

141
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,380
I won't do any editing though.

142
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,410
I take back what I said. It won't even be chaotic.

143
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,860
People don't even take pictures on their phones without using an app these days.

144
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,440
What do you think people look at when they see their photos?

145
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,560
Instead of how pretty they looked that day,

146
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,350
they'll remember what day it was.

147
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,040
They'll remember what they talked about and why they laughed.

148
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,050
All photos are memories.

149
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,490
I want to sincerely capture that.

150
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,670
That's true.

151
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:22,000
The things that photos don't capture - that day's smell, air, happiness -

152
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,270
you end up remembering all of that.

153
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,060
And if that creates another memory, that will be great as well.

154
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,780
I'll promote this a lot to those around me.

155
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,070
Trimming the hanging threads isn't our job.

156
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,080
Do you perhaps believe that if you work hard,

157
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,310
the company will recognize it later on and share the glory like a fairy tale?

158
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,860
But that doesn't happen in real life.

159
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,320
Which is why I'm working myself down to the bones.

160
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,260
I get thirsty too.

161
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,390
I only hold it in since I have no time to drink.

162
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,030
No one's forcing you. It's your choice.

163
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,290
As for me, I'm doing just enough to get by for my own sake.

164
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,060
- Is that such a bad thing? 
 - That kind of talk...

165
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,870
you can say it outside of the workplace after handing in your resignation letter.

166
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:12,420
There are countless people who eat seaweed rolls that are close to expiring from convenience stores

167
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,490
as they write their resumes because they want your position.

168
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,960
Everyone has their own worries and sufferings.

169
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,740
The idea that your own efforts are commendable and tear-jerking

170
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,010
while a life without needing to write resumes is a comfortable one

171
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,820
- is a strong prejudice. 
 - Is it less embarrassing to make excuses?

172
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,280
What?

173
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,120
I'm sure it's hard.

174
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,060
You were born, but it just so happened that you were born into a rich family.

175
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,470
But how terrible! You wore luxury brand items in all of the colors offered,

176
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:42,920
yet you don't even know where to begin to start making that one piece of clothing.

177
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,460
Your words are a bit extreme.

178
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,730
You act all cool as if you don't care about others' approval.

179
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,850
- You're lazy and you make excuses. 
 - Sunbae Jeong So Yeong!

180
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,680
Be honest. Aren't you just afraid that people will see the real you?

181
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,890
Honestly, no matter what I do, you'll just criticize me.

182
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,710
The fact that I am coming to the warehouse today was already posted on the Blind.

183
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:07,600
Will the precious master be able to endure well?

184
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,760
Damned if I do, damned if I don't.

185
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,620
Why do I have to knowingly let myself be trampled?

186
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,640
You can play the victim card all you want.

187
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,920
At this moment, you're just my junior.

188
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,020
So you just work quietly.

189
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,830
Hey, Jeong So Yeong.

190
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,120
- I told you I'm "Sunbae"  (senior)  to you. 
 - Forget it.

191
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,620
When it's just us two, you're just going to be Jeong So Yeong, okay?

192
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,440
- Mom, you do it! 
 - You do it. You're supposed to do it.

193
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,060
- You do it, Mom. 
 - You can't watch cartoons until you're done.

194
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,540
What are you doing?

195
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,790
- Auntie. 
 - Don't look at her.

196
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,640
Put on your stockings, tie your hair, put on your jacket,

197
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,530
zip it up, then get it checked by me.

198
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,850
- If you don't do it well, you'll have to restart. 
 - I won't!

199
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,220
Then, get up. Get up!

200
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,120
- Mi Sook! 
 - Yeong Eun, leave.

201
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,670
Jeon Mi Sook.

202
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,420
I'm going to count to 100 then come out.

203
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,000
If you don't finish by then,

204
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,690
you won't be able to watch cartoons for 10 nights. Understand?

205
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,210
- Mom! 
 - It's okay, Ji Min. Don't cry.

206
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,030
Oh, don't cry. It's okay.

207
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,750
I need to feed my kid dinner. Just get to the point.

208
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,110
Are you really quitting?

209
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:04,230
I was a bastard. I was crazy.

210
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,670
It's too late, but I'm going to live with the right mindset at least from now.

211
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,830
Are you really not coming back?

212
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,600
I already told you.

213
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,850
I need to be with my wife.

214
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,980
Then what am I supposed to do?

215
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,910
We're near my house.

216
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,020
They want me to handle Lafayette all by myself.

217
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,000
How can I do all of that by myself? I need you.

218
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,330
You know that I'm still in the beginners class for French.

219
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,730
If the CEO asks me to speak but I can't, imagine what will happen!

220
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,230
I'm a contract worker! What am I supposed to do?

221
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,180
Is that why you kept coming for me?

222
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,050
I still need you.

223
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:51,500
I told you to pack up for the hospital, but why are you going after your daughter like that?

224
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,960
If I'm not there, she'll have to do it all by herself anyway.

225
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,850
I need to teach her while I'm here.

226
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,140
Mi Sook.

227
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,960
Yeong Eun.

228
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,520
Here and there, I can't help but feel that this is unfair. I think I'll go crazy.

229
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,380
What did I do wrong?

230
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,290
Why me?

231
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,080
What's Ji Min supposed to do? Why is it me of all people?

232
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,550
She can't even put on a sock. What's she supposed to do?

233
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,920
Why is this happening to me?

234
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,000
Then why are you doing this?

235
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,060
Why are you doing this to a kid who doesn't know anything?

236
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,860
I came to my senses all of a sudden.

237
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,220
How much longer can I just sit lamenting?

238
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,130
There's no time for that. I have so much to do.

239
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,700
There are so many things that need my touch.

240
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,240
Those who are left behind

241
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,440
have to live with only the memories of their passed one.

242
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,920
Don't make Ji Min remember you as a scary, angry mom.

243
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,910
My body

244
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,110
speaks to me everyday with aches, Yeong Eun.

245
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,610
It tells me to hurry.

246
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,990
It tells me there's not much time left.

247
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,800
That's why my heart feels so busy.

248
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,070
But why is there so much to do?

249
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,500
Oh, yeah.

250
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,610
I need to take pictures before I lose more weight from chemo.

251
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,760
- Pictures? 
 - The only pictures I have of myself after having Ji Min are all selfies.

252
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,560
Ji Min's dad is the type of person who will just make my ID picture bigger and use it as my funeral picture.

253
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,150
We have to use that picture for three days.

254
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:36,400
Hey, I don't want to end my life on an embarrassing note.

255
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,970
- Mi Sook. 
 - I want my funeral picture

256
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,270
to be deadly pretty.

257
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,500
Even better if it's one where I'm smiling brightly.

258
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,190
Is there a restaurant here?

259
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:22,160
There is no way you're asking me to walk up to that high point at this late hour, right?

260
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,220
The car can only come up to here.

261
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,110
Try them on. These are limited edition.

262
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,640
As the Vision PR CEO, I was able to specially get these.

263
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,360
I can tie them myself.

264
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,450
My pleasure.

265
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:01,500
♫  Sometimes a bit more than perfect  ♫

266
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,430
♫  I like you who are childish  ♫

267
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:10,340
All right, let's go.

268
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,930
- Really? 
 - Yes.

269
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,680
- You haven't been there? 
 - No, I haven't.

270
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,540
I came here during school field trips and whatnot.

271
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,920
♫  Oh darling, we're falling  ♫

272
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:35,720
♫  It might be love, in love  ♫

273
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,090
Cable car?

274
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,340
It's nice to walk like this, right?

275
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,060
 Do I look like I'm enjoying this? 

276
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,380
I thought really hard about where would be great since this is our first date.

277
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,350
  We're not compatible. Not compatible at all! 

278
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,770
We're almost there. Let's go.

279
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,210
♫  Maybe it's love  ♫

280
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,010
Isn't this too high up?

281
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:18,710
You know, there are cable cars and buses,

282
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:23,210
but instead of a very easy way, we took the really hard way.

283
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,280
I wanted to.

284
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,620
Why? What's the reason?

285
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,100
I wanted to walk with you slowly, for a long time.

286
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,090
Because I'm in

287
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,570
an unrequited love right now.

288
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,110
What is this? We...

289
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,160
We agreed to be a short-term couple by contract.

290
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,340
You can keep it strictly business,

291
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,470
but I just want to continue my unrequited love.

292
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,610
If you want to dump me, you can whenever.

293
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:59,000
But I will never dump you first.

294
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,770
♫  Lean on me for a bit and close your eyes  ♫

295
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:10,300
♫  Don't worry about anything  ♫

296
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,110
Give me the lock.

297
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:19,670
♫  Don't look back on the days that have passed  ♫
    

298
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:24,710
♫  Let them go now  ♫

299
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,410
I threw it! Did you see?

300
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:36,040
♫  Stay here with me for a bit and stay the night  ♫

301
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:41,490
♫  Melt your tired heart  ♫

302
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,830
Take note of where I hung it.

303
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,990
When you want to dump me, unlock it and throw it away.

304
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,020
♫  Hurry and close your eyes  ♫

305
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,430
  My heart rate is not in its right mind right now. 

306
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:59,480
  It's because I walked too much. That's why. 

307
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,500
  That's all. 

308
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,440
♫  When spring's sunset comes  ♫

309
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,880
♫  And colors the sky  ♫

310
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,800
♫  Please smile that day  ♫

311
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:21,280

312
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,390
    
 ♫  So love spreads  ♫

313
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,600
It's you, Mom?

314
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,480
Hurry and unlock the door.

315
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,670
You should've called me.

316
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,580
But what are you doing here at this hour without advance notice?

317
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,300
I wanted to have a drink with my daughter and sleep with her.

318
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,740
What about Father?

319
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,080
Is he a kid? Is he afraid of a burglar or ghosts?

320
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,620
Wow, my mother drinks well.

321
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,590
In my younger days, I used to drink by the bottle.

322
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,420
Living with your father, I pretended to be modest.

323
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,500
Because you were the vice principal's wife?

324
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,830
I have one set of eyes,

325
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,030
but there are hundreds of eyes staring at me.

326
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:26,520
Who knows which one of them are looking at me critically?

327
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,660
I've lived without even throwing away a wrapper on the street.

328
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,260
Since you've suffered a lot, you must take a shot.

329
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,490
I didn't do it because I liked it.

330
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,200
It was because I had no choice.

331
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,460
Out of all times, you came to us right then that...

332
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,360
Is that my fault?

333
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:53,710
Yes... I was blinded by love.

334
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,380
As I lived my life,

335
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,720
I grew mad at my deceased mother.

336
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,510
She should have stopped me just a bit more.

337
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:15,350
She should have shaved my head so I would have no choice but to give up.

338
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:20,010
Then I would have gone to work

339
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,980
and found out that there's another world out there.

340
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,000
I would have lived differently...

341
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,650
Yeong Eun,

342
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,010
you shouldn't go down this road.

343
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,710
Don't go.

344
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,110
Mom...

345
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,560
She said he died.

346
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,360
I... opened a photography studio.

347
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,650
I even started a promotional event.

348
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,150
It's also an experience to run a business.

349
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,470
Consider it as studying and do it just for a while, then go work for our company.

350
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,900
"Would I be able to do something like this here?"

351
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,410
"Can I act like nothing is wrong when strangers stare?"

352
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,620
But it was better than I thought.

353
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,000
Today, I waited for people all day long.

354
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,870
Don't make it hard on yourself and hold onto Hyung either.

355
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,080
Please let him go now.

356
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,550
I can't do that because he's my child.

357
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:49,110
As a mother, I can't tear my child out of my embrace.

358
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,550
She won't accept you.

359
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:02,390
Even if I were her, I wouldn't.

360
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,250
It's the two of us who love each other.

361
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,890
No matter what other people say, I won't care.

362
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,170
Are your parents "other people"?

363
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,930
Can you live having turned your back on your parents?

364
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,870
And even if you do...

365
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,560
There's nothing which benefits you.

366
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,750
You'll be sorry forever for the sin of cutting ties with your parents.

367
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:29,350
And that man... will feel more sorry for seeing you feel sorry.

368
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,700
I didn't do anything wrong.

369
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,680
So why must I be sorry?

370
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,000
Turning her back against us because she doesn't approve of us is her choice.

371
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,970
Yeong Eun...

372
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,310
That time 10 years ago,

373
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,850
do you know what was the hardest for me?

374
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:51,810
Being ghosted? Getting dumped?

375
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,890
No, Mom.

376
00:25:53,890 --> 00:26:00,380
To me... having to end my feelings when my feelings weren't over.

377
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,430
I still... liked him so much.

378
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:11,790
But to know that I can't see him anymore... that made it crazy hard.

379
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,880
But you want me to do that again?

380
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,700
You think you won't be able to right now, right?

381
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,500
You think it's going to be great like this everyday, right?

382
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,080
No... when life gets hard, a man?

383
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,690
You'll want to tear your eyes out.

384
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,890
Love?

385
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,650
There is no such thing. You just live.

386
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:42,400
Thinking that my place is here... you just give up and live.

387
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,500
Then I will break up with him at that time.

388
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,650
When his and my love withers away.

389
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:55,960
When it doesn't really hurt to break up, I want to break up then.

390
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,080
- Yeong Eun... 
 - Whether I change or he says that we should stop.

391
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:09,160
If it's not one of those, I can't comprehend any other reason.

392
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,810
And then another 10 years?

393
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,590
How can I live... huh?

394
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,360
I...

395
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,640
wish you wouldn't live like I did.

396
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,530
If you go against your parents and live doing what they told you not to do,

397
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,710
you can't complain even if it gets difficult.

398
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,880
Seeing you getting thinner and thinner

399
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,350
makes me upset.

400
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,560
Don't do anything you will regret.

401
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:07,110
It will be harder to take it back later.

402
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,670
Just...

403
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,520
go through the hardship now.

404
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,510
   

405
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:42,880
We also try to use domestic options for fabrics like polyester and suede,

406
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,370
but there are many instances we can't due to quality.

407
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:49,690
Brands show us the imported samples and tell us to copy exactly what we see.

408
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,710
Do they just tell us to do it? While providing only 1/3 of the cost

409
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,080
and asking us to meet the deadline ASAP, they can't complain about quality.

410
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,420
Is it possible to develop a new texture or a new print?

411
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,260
In terms of technical skills, we are the best!

412
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,010
There are so many textile factories in Daegu.

413
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,900
There are many that have closed.

414
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,660
Eighty percent of domestic brands use imported goods.

415
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,530
There's no place for domestic fabric to stand. There is no place.

416
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,650
There is a proposal that I would like to offer.

417
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,990
   

418
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,080
The factory's response is good.

419
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,040
But will Chief Go approve?

420
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,150
Of course, he will say no.

421
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:33,870
But still, we have to do the best we can do.

422
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,370
I am getting tired already.

423
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:39,480
- Everyone, eat lunch. 
 - Yes!

424
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:44,910
   
   

425
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,470
   

426
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,010
For lunch, we can just order anything.

427
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:08,540
If you leave your store vacant like this, will you get any business?

428
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,320
Since we have coffee, hurry back soon.

429
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,210
Yes.

430
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,840
Yoon Jae Gook will be here soon.

431
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,690
Maybe in  around 10-15 minutes?

432
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:29,620
You will have to wait about that long.

433
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,270
You are quite selfish.

434
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:37,790
How small my loved one has become, how pathetic he has become...

435
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:41,690
Not caring as long as it's good for you...

436
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:46,090
That isn't love. That's greed.

437
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:50,070
Once a fiancée? So? What about it?

438
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:55,280
I am dating Yoon Jae Gook right now, and you are not his fiancée.

439
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,000
Don't cross the line.

440
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,180
This kind of meddling is uncomfortable and unpleasant.

441
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,190
It's because it seems like you don't know.

442
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,400
What are you talking about now?

443
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,200
Leaving his suitor for a woman he met on his way to and from his travel destination...

444
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,800
Do you think his mother approved?

445
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,910
Noona, stop and leave, okay?

446
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,720
Since he couldn't tell you that,

447
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,010
he drank each time you called him when he couldn't even drink.

448
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,820
   

449
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,860
I told you to leave, Noona.

450
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,610
Because I couldn't stop him in the end from leaving that day,

451
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,730
I live with regret my whole life.

452
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,610
So this time, I am going to do my best.

453
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,600
Don't cross the line?

454
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,760
You are the one that crossed the line.

455
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:56,090
What's your reason for going this far? Why exactly are you doing this?

456
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:59,190
For her to lose exactly like I did.

457
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:04,240
What it feels like to lose someone you love regardless of how you feel!

458
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,180
So she can feel that and be hurt.

459
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:15,010
It seems that you don't know anything.

460
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,050
Ten years ago, Hyung had already

461
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,120
broken up with Ha Yeong Eun.

462
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,550
That day, he

463
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,800
went there to break up with her.

464
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:39,210
 Jae Gook, I don't think I can do it.  

465
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:42,710
 What do you mean by you can't? 

466
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,860
 Right now, I... am on my way to break up with that person.  

467
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:52,440
 Jae Gook, don't be a coward like me.  

468
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,210
   

469
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:34,790
I know that these words won't help much, but still forget it.

470
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:40,920
She's doing that on purpose to hurt you.

471
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:46,420
I know. I know, but it still hurts.

472
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:51,020
If it was like this 10 years ago as well...

473
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:57,520
Then persuading your mother will actually be impossible.

474
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:03,240
The same situation can end in many different ways.

475
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,410
And... that's entirely up to us.

476
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,210
Yes.

477
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:16,780
So I... want to live really well.

478
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,460
Do you perhaps have a scheduled customer?

479
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,380
I thought that we couldn't do it if we didn't make a reservation.

480
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,780
Because of you, I'm thankful.

481
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,360
Why are you already thanking me?

482
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,590
You are always underestimating my skills.

483
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,740
You have something else?

484
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,200
By the time the makeup is almost complete,

485
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,320
some outfit samples of the 2022 new spring collection will arrive.

486
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,380
Real killer items.

487
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,590
Except for work, I'm quite talented.

488
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:52,870
For instance, I personally invited the makeup artist who was the first domestic beauty content creator

489
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,550
and responsible for making K-beauty a thing.

490
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,070
She's here.

491
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:02,450
- Hello, Director. 
 - Hello! It's been a while.

492
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,310
Please take special care of my friend.

493
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,940
Of course.

494
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,620
Hello.

495
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,760
You must have something great going on.

496
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,690
We want to take a picture.

497
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,590
You said that you wanted to take a picture before you started chemotherapy.

498
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:20,070
Let's do that. Because today will be your most beautiful day.

499
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,490
Let's take it now.

500
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,980
Please make her very pretty.

501
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,640
We are going to look at it for years to come.

502
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,490
Yes, of course.

503
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:31,020
- We will get started. 
 - Yes.

504
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:45,910
Hey, it seems like I am getting bridal makeup done seeing you guys waiting there like that.

505
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,390
Who knew that you would wear the wedding dress first?

506
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,590
I was the representative runner for my class.

507
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,350
I'm good at crossing the finish line first.

508
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,060
That day really was the prime for Jeon Mi Sook. It's belated, but I'll acknowledge it now.

509
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:59,390
Where did that Jeon Mi Sook go?

510
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,410
Seeing that I can't even recognize myself...

511
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,120
Not much is needed for you to be at your prime.

512
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,980
If you're having good days, those days are your prime days.

513
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,380
If today is a good day, today is also your prime.

514
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,390
Since this is the first customer of your event, please take extra care when you shoot.

515
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:15,620
I'll take care of it.

516
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,360
I will get the photoshoot started.

517
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,430
H-Here? Ah, so embarrassing...

518
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,000
We will smile a bit more.

519
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,640
Also, look this way.

520
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,110
Ah, okay.

521
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,370
You are so fast. Please wait a minute...

522
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,010
That won't work.

523
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,960
Why, why? What is this?

524
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,870
♫  I swore to myself I wouldn't be honest this time  ♫

525
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,280
Leave your body to the rhythm of the music.

526
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,610
Look at me, look at me.

527
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,320
- Okay. 
- Got it, got it.

528
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,310
Like this?

529
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,210
Act cool.

530
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,030
♫  And kiss me cuz I don't know how to shut my dirty mouth  ♫

531
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,960
I think this color will look pretty too.

532
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,940
Ah, looks good on you, looks good.

533
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,970
Do you like it?

534
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,580
♫  My dirty mouth, yeah  ♫

535
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,960
♫  I say too much when I'm drunk  ♫

536
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,480
Okay. 
♫  Oh and here I go again. Here I go again!  ♫

537
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,830
♫  You caught me with my inhibitions down  ♫

538
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:17,940
Go outside and enjoy yourself. 
 ♫  And now you're hearing all the secrets from my dirty mouth  ♫

539
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,060
♫  I'm gonna need you to come wash it out  ♫

540
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,500
♫  And kiss me cuz I don't know how to shut my dirty mouth  ♫

541
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,100
♫  Yeah  ♫

542
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,570
Ah, Yeong Eun, I'm feeling very good.

543
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:37,810
Hey, Hwang Chi Sook, how is it? Can you feel the aura of a former model?

544
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:41,280
You are totally pretty. Very pretty.

545
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,060
These came out very well.

546
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:52,700
This cold-hearted woman. Why is she so pretty like a flower?

547
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,460
You are right.

548
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,190
She's like a flower.

549
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,410
- You guys should also take pictures with her. 
 - Us too?

550
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,570
Regardless of the number of takes, it's just 5,000 won until you like it.

551
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,880
I will start the shoot.

552
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,100
What are you doing again? Let's try it, let's try it!

553
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,820
How should we do it so that we look like Miss Korea?

554
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,380
 In the pictures, we are mostly laughing. 

555
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,520
 Were we laughing because we were happy? 

556
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,950
 Or did we laugh because we were in front of the camera? 

557
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,050
 But one thing is certain. 

558
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:46,860
 In that moment, we were laughing and we were happy.  

559
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:54,100
 That those memories will allow us to live our remaining days. 

560
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,960
Why is it my fault that Yeong Eun met him?

561
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,630
What is the most important thing that a woman must do in the house?

562
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,590
Raising a child is a woman's duty.

563
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:06,590
If you did things correctly, why would these things happen?

564
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,740
What did you do?

565
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,760
I dedicated my entire life to education whether it snowed or rained.

566
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,420
I'm not embarrassed at all when it comes to fulfilling my role as a head of household.

567
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,910
Not embarrassed at all? And you didn't do anything else?

568
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,800
Anything else? What thing?

569
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,860
You see, I'm a person who can live without the law.

570
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,000
And you took upon the role as the head of the household by yourself?

571
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,660
Then who did it? Have you even earned 10 won before?

572
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,400
To make you a lead teacher,

573
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,020
I am the one who went to the principal's house to make kimchi.

574
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,690
To make you the head of teachers,

575
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:39,530
I made all of the wedding food when his daughter got married.

576
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:44,340
Vice principal? They said that the chairman's dog disappeared while the door was opened.

577
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,000
I'm the one who went around for three days and nights to find it!

578
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,330
Just because you helped with making some bundles of kimchi, you want to teach me?

579
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:54,950
- Bragging about nothing... 
 - Brag? Brag?!

580
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,200
I should just keep my mouth shut.

581
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,460
 I work at Jeju Island. 

582
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,020
 - Are you originally from Jeju? 
 - No, I'm not. 

583
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,240
 Just for work. 

584
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,550
 I specialize in Chinese food. 

585
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,920
Mi Sook, it's me.

586
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,530
Yes, you are doing well, right?

587
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,020
   

588
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,150
Mi Sook had such a fun time.

589
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:29,790
Ever since she was in school, her dream was to become a model, but she gave up when she got married.

590
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:33,070
She sent a storm of text messages saying "Having Mr. J photograph me at this age is nonsense."

591
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:37,440
Did you reply that I normally don't take pictures of anyone?

592
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,970
Usually in a moment like this, one shows humility.

593
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,160
If you have skills and humility on top of that, it's not attractive.

594
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,400
Will you be done after that?

595
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,390
Yes, I'll be done after I put this away.

596
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,590
The lighting must be heavy.

597
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:14,160
- Your face is red. 
 - Hey.

598
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,450
I'm hungry.  Let's hurry up and go eat.

599
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,770
If we did this much, are we done?

600
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,990
I think so.

601
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,100
What are you doing here?

602
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,220
Mom.

603
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,960
Are you dating my child to make her do these kinds of things?

604
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,180
Come in for now, Mother.

605
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,800
Who are you calling mother?  Who says I'm your mother?

606
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,020
Mom, why are you being like this?

607
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:43,980
Mom, let's go out.  Talk to me.

608
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,180
   

609
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,890
You're Yoon Jae Gook, right?

610
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:48,980
Yes.

611
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,060
And you're Soo Wan's little brother?

612
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,950
Mom.

613
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,340
Then what are you doing right now?

614
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,110
Do you think this makes sense?

615
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,930
Why?  Because you're not full brothers?

616
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:05,860
Is that why you think it's okay?

617
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,850
Mom!

618
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,150
I heard you're a child from an extramarital affair.

619
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,530
Yes.

620
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:22,810
As for me, I have no desire to have a son-in-law who is born of an extramarital affair and calls me mother.

621
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,860
That's not what I raised my daughter for.

622
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,390
What are you saying, Mom?  Why are you being like this?

623
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,730
Am I wrong?

624
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,120
I heard that you're a son brought in from outside the marriage.

625
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,050
Yes.  You're right.

626
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:37,190
Then how dare you think you could have my daughter?

627
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,390
I'm sorry.  I'll apologize instead, Jae Gook.

628
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,620
She came to see me.  It's fine.

629
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:46,760
Mom, leave now.  Stop doing this here, and let's leave now.

630
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,390
Please speak.

631
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,720
Even though I wasn't able to raise her lavishly,

632
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,500
I raised her with a lot of care.

633
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,020
We couldn't even help pay for her college tuition

634
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,870
because her father lost money by cosigning for the wrong person.

635
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,070
But while she worked three, four part-time jobs

636
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:04,030
and took care of everything herself,

637
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:07,760
all I could do was massage her legs throughout the night.

638
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,910
It killed me to see her like that.

639
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:13,760
I didn't give her a penny to help with her living expenses when she was studying overseas.

640
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,840
But when she would bring back shoes and bags purchased for me,

641
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,540
I felt like those were my daughter's tears of blood,

642
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,470
so it devastated me.

643
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,640
Mom, stop it.  Please!

644
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,200
But still, seeing her bearing her life well

645
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,000
is admirable and beautiful.

646
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,740
My daughter, who is too precious to look at for the fear of wearing her out...

647
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,150
who are you to shake her up?

648
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:41,750
Who are you to do this to my daughter's life?

649
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,560
Why are you tearing it apart?

650
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,820
Please go.  You can talk to me!

651
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:50,620
Don't date my child.

652
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,210
Let's not see each other ever again.

653
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:56,360
Do you understand?

654
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,360
Do you understand?

655
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:15,330
You did well.  You did well, Jeong Ja.

656
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:18,300
You have to do that for your daughter.

657
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,560
That way Yeong Eun can survive.

658
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,520
Mom.

659
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,990
Mom, why are you like this?

660
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:31,860
How could you say those things?

661
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,950
Because I'm your mom.

662
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:36,410
Because it will make you end it.

663
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,470
Mom!

664
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:42,160
- I'm divorcing your dad. 
 - What?

665
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,830
I'm putting an end to being Ha Taek Soo's wife.

666
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:48,180
But I'll never stop being your mom until I die.

667
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,090
I need to do my job as your mom.

668
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,740
You can't go on this path.

669
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,720
Make sure you understand that.

670
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:57,270
Taxi!

671
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,130
Get in!  Do you want me to go back to the photography studio?

672
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:07,820
If you don't understand what I'm saying,

673
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:11,390
I have no choice but to make him understand.

674
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:19,710
Jae Gook, I'm sorry.  I'm going home first.

675
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,130
Hurry up and get in!

676
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:23,330
I'll call you.

677
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:59,670
   

678
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:12,600
She wanted to wear it to sleep so that she could show Mom.

679
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:24,160
You're wearing it so prettily, my daughter.

680
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:40,760
Aigoo, how did you put them on so nicely with these hands?

681
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:45,230
I should show you cartoons a hundred times.

682
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:00,340
My daughter, I'm sorry.

683
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:07,110
Thank you, my baby.

684
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,860
Thank you.

685
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:28,330
   

686
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:45,530
You called me out here... at this time of day.

687
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:49,330
I've been thinking until this time of day.

688
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:50,960
Okay.

689
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,820
I...

690
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,100
am an expert at unrequited love.

691
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,460
What about it?

692
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,960
Being self-conscious and making an effort

693
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,320
while getting excited all by myself and then getting disappointed all alone...

694
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,860
Whether I'm in that kind of love or someone else is loving me that way...

695
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,790
I don't like it.

696
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:19,360
Okay, so?

697
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,630
Let's check.

698
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:23,690
Check what?

699
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:26,330
Platonic love...

700
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:28,120
I don't want it.

701
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:40,570
 If my heart doesn't race, then it isn't love. 

702
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,760
♫  I think I am falling  ♫

703
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,100
♫  It's my first feeling  ♫

704
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:55,140
♫  You make me lovely, lovely smile  ♫

705
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,520
♫  Oh darling, we're falling  ♫

706
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:05,320
♫  It might be love, in love  ♫

707
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,290
♫  Awkward feeling  ♫

708
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:13,210
♫  The heart which is lost and confused is yours  ♫

709
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:18,300
Wow, what are the intention and meaning

710
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,230
of the strong action you just took?

711
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:21,990
Life is short.

712
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:23,900
What's there to worry about?

713
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,550
You just have to go for it.

714
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:28,190
Then you won't have regrets.

715
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,300
You're amazing.

716
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:39,680
Wow, wow, wow!

717
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:47,820
Wow!

718
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,610
   

719
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,340
   

720
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,320
   

721
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,050
 Am I wrong? 

722
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:08,010
 I heard that you're a son brought in from outside the marriage. 

723
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,020
   

724
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:24,050
 I'm sorry.  I'll apologize instead, Jae Gook. 

725
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:39,470
   

726
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:43,480
The fabric factory will accept Team Leader Ha's proposal

727
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,710
to pay the fabric development fee in advance.

728
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,550
I did hear this correctly, right?

729
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:51,150
We can't ask them to make it for us no matter what when we can't even promise the quantity we will purchase.

730
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,250
Why wouldn't we purchase the fabric if it's good?

731
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,950
When buying imported products, we can't even begin to bargain,

732
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:59,390
but when buying domestic products, we decide that the price should be below a certain amount.

733
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,810
So how can they utilize good thread and raise the quality?

734
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:04,280
But what about our loss when the quality still ends up subpar?

735
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,090
I believe that's something we have to take on.

736
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:07,820
Why don't you go do charity work instead?

737
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:08,780
And the reason?

738
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,910
This season, the next, and the one after that.

739
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:15,730
If we keep buying imported goods for a high price, then the price of clothes will continue to rise.

740
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:17,240
We will fall behind due to direct purchases from overseas.

741
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,920
You also added the condition that the materials team

742
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,230
will constantly communicate with the factory and quality check?

743
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:24,740
Because the competitive edge is quality.

744
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,150
Did you hear that?

745
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:27,830
Pardon?

746
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:30,680
- Ah, yes. 
 - CEO.

747
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,030
Until when will you blame the situation and look for reasons why things can't be done?

748
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:36,630
Chief Go, while selling fabric with me all those years,

749
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:38,990
you've seen how well domestic products are made.

750
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:40,310
Have you already forgotten?

751
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:41,430
Of course I know.

752
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:43,470
Go to Paris with our own.

753
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,950
That's what makes it K-fashion!

754
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:48,960
I understand.

755
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,910
You want us to design with the possibility that the fabric might change, right?

756
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,240
- Right. 
 - You heard her, right?

757
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,910
Yes.

758
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:02,260
   

759
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,260
What's going on? You have two cups today.

760
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,830
Who is it for? The team leader?

761
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:11,800
For my mentor. An iced Americano.

762
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,030
Don't hold it in.

763
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:15,320
What's going on between you two?

764
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,250
Did you guys become fond of each other after fighting?

765
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,350
Must be nice.

766
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:20,800
It's not like that!

767
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,460
Are you waiting for someone's call?

768
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:26,120
Oh, no.

769
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,800
 Mom, that's so unnecessary! 

770
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,350
Gosh, seriously?

771
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,850
What is it?

772
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:35,940
   

773
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,230
Divorce papers.

774
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:38,580
What papers?

775
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:41,450
Being a divorced teacher might ruin your reputation,

776
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:42,930
so I waited until you retired.

777
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:45,530
Since my mission is over, let's split up.

778
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:49,150
- Why? 
 - It would be too pitiful

779
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:51,900
to end my life as your caregiver.

780
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,430
I filled out my part.

781
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:57,360
Fill out your portion and leave the papers on the dining table.

782
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,540
Why are you going into that room?

783
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,190
What did you hear?

784
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:05,500
We're splitting up, so there's no reason for us to be using the same room anymore!

785
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:13,140
I think getting 1++ Hanwoo beef was too much.

786
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,770
What is too much?

787
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,320
Even if I have to sell our house, I'm going to buy you everything you want to eat.

788
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:21,200
Nonsense. Where will Ji Min live then?

789
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,430
It's all done.

790
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:32,420
After chemo, I won't be able to eat well because I will feel nauseous and throw up.

791
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:34,830
I need to eat a lot before that so I can recover quickly.

792
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:38,770
I need to fast six hours before, so let's eat quickly.

793
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,240
Stop taking care of me. You should eat.

794
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,380
All right, I am eating.

795
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:53,530
Oh right. Make sure you take a look at Ji Min's assignment notebook and sign it early in the evening.

796
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,640
You always postpone it saying you will in the morning and then forget about it.

797
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,390
And make sure you check her meal schedule since she is allergic to egg yolk.

798
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:01,810
Next Tuesday, one of the side dishes is steamed egg.

799
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:03,370
Next Thursday's snack is castella cake.

800
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:08,440
Also the field trip next month—

801
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,540
Are you not coming back?

802
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,350
You're only there for one night.

803
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:15,910
Why are you talking about next week and next month?

804
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:19,360
Did I do that?

805
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:30,020
Honey, I am going to get my treatment diligently.

806
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,540
I'm going to receive it with all my energy.

807
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,260
I'm going to do it for you and Ji Min.

808
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:40,350
So... don't worry too much.

809
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:43,010
Okay.

810
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:45,630
Let's eat.

811
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:56,510
   

812
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,650
Shall we start now?

813
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:02,350
You can make a heart

814
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:04,180
or do whatever you want.

815
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,140
Okay.

816
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:08,340
One, two, three.

817
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,330
It's very fun, right?

818
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,390
Good.

819
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:23,540
Oh, good. One, two, three.

820
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:29,760
   

821
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,240
Come back again!

822
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,500
- Thank you! 
 - Get home safely.

823
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,630
You're here.

824
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:54,690
Did you wait a long time?

825
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:58,850
Maybe because I started off well with my first customer yesterday,

826
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:01,600
I had a lot of customers today.

827
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:04,840
And there was a family that came for family photos—

828
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:09,990
Yoon Jae Gook, why are you acting so nonchalant?

829
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:15,580
Why didn't you call me?

830
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,760
After hearing that from my mom,

831
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,560
why aren't you saying anything?

832
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,210
You should say something.

833
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:25,720
"Why is your mother like that?"

834
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,640
"How can she say something like that?"

835
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:31,470
Whether you call, come find me, or get angry, you should have done something.

836
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:33,290
Why aren't you doing anything?

837
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:35,780
Why are you staying still?

838
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,940
She didn't make up any of it.

839
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,970
Yoon Jae Gook.

840
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:45,020
It's okay. I've heard it many times.

841
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,620
There were people who said it with their mouths

842
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:51,000
and some who said it with their eyes.

843
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,890
A child born from a father's affair... it's true.

844
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,930
It's not your fault, so why are you staying quiet?

845
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:08,000
 She is mad at me. 

846
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,320
Why would you let them hurt you with their words and eyes?

847
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,450
You did nothing wrong, so why are you letting them hurt you?

848
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:17,810
 She's saying something nobody has said to me before. 

849
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:20,050
Is it because of me?

850
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:24,480
If that's why you're holding it in, let's just stop.

851
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,810
If you're already going to get hurt without saying anything,

852
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,520
let's give up.

853
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,360
♫  Somehow sound sadder  ♫

854
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:42,450
♫  So I don't even listen to music  ♫

855
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:50,850
♫  When I feel out of breath while walking  ♫

856
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:54,160
Even when opening a photography studio, how can you be this thoughtless?

857
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,500
Why would you pick an alleyway where a single car can't even fit?

858
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,490
What kind of a place doesn't have a parking lot these days?

859
00:57:58,490 --> 00:57:59,990
Will people even come?

860
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:02,080
Why are you so foolish?

861
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,590
Why are you so calm?

862
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:08,040
 There is no end to her anger. 

863
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:13,800
 I think I met the real one. 

864
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:19,080
 I think I met 

865
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,650
 my real love. 

866
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,090
I love you.

867
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,960
If I don't like something, I'm going to get angry.

868
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,790
I said I love you.

869
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:40,600
Even if it's hard for you, I'm going to get angry.

870
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:45,760
I still love you.

871
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,990
If you keep doing this,

872
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,750
I really won't let it slide.

873
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:58,870
I love you, Ha Yeong Eun.

874
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,900
Until the end, what I feel for you

875
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:12,510
will be love.

876
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:19,010
 If you still insist on carrying on with Jae Gook, 

877
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:23,510
 I won't be here on this earth. 

878
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,480
 What do you... 

879
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,400
 If you're sure you can live with him 

880
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,570
 blaming himself all throughout his life, then go ahead. 

881
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:39,350
 They're not empty words. 

882
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:43,650
 It's for my child. There's nothing a mother can't do. 

883
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:45,840
 So give me an answer. 

884
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,920
 What will you do? 

885
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:53,660
For me...

886
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,070
For me too, you will be

887
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,800
my love to the end.

888
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:07,350
♫  The longing hurts more than breaking up  ♫

889
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:12,010
♫  It is just a day to endure  ♫

♫  Survive like this  ♫

894
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:40,360
♫  I couldn't let you go  ♫

895
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:44,480
♫  And I couldn't erase it  ♫

896
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:51,340
♫  One side of my chest just hurts  ♫

902
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:17,920
 What happened all of a sudden? 

903
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,890
 A foreign company is paying attention to one of the leading domestic fashion companies. 

904
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,200
 What are you talking about? Me? 

905
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,400
 If we didn't have much time left to spend together either, what would you like to do? 

906
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,660
 Since nothing lasts forever. 

907
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:30,250
 What are you going to do about my funeral? 

908
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:33,950
 Might as well make it a party for me while I'm alive. 

909
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:37,650
 As long as you come back, I'll be all right. 

910
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:39,730
 - This is big! 
 - When can you give me an answer by? 

911
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,240
 Are you really not going to go with me? 

912
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:44,030
 You know how important this project is for Team Leader Ha and Sonó. 

913
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:46,020
 It's hard to accommodate Lafayette's conditions? 

914
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,860
 Do everything you want to do, Ha Yeong Eun. 

915
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:50,130
 I will support you all the way. 

916
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:51,900
 Do you have a date with Cookie today? 

917
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:56,620
 I'm going to show my Hoon what a passionate relationship is like. 

918
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,820
 Do you really plan on going all the way? 

919
01:01:58,820 --> 01:01:59,940
 Probably. 

920
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:02,960
 Even if you lose everything? 

921
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:06,930
 I made it clear to Ha Yeong Eun that I wouldn't accept her even if it kills me. 

922
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:09,160
 Why would you make that clear to my Yeong Eun? 

923
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,420
 - Jae Gook... 
 - How could you say those words to her? 

924
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:12,750
 How could you use those words to... 

925
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,060
 You really can't? 

926
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,360
 Yoon Jae Gook. 

927
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,260
 I'm sorry. 

928
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:21,930
