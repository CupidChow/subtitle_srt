1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:06,090
   

2
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,110
   

3
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,640
   

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,930
   
   

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:32,930
 Timing and subtitles brought to you by 
 Are You The One Team @ Viki 

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,820
   

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,080
   

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,630
This is Olivier's official offer.

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,020
He wants to take you, Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun, to Paris.

10
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,210
 Ten years ago, I loved someone, 

11
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,050
 so I let go of my dream. 

12
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,120
This time, he's taken office as DPHP's Head Director,

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,560
and it appears that he's looking for talented people to work with.

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,520
It seems like your buyers show left a big impression on him.

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,330
 And ten years later... 

16
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,590
They would like you to take charge of the designer brand Duchamps.

17
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,660
As long as you accept, you will be provided with

18
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,380
an apartment, a vehicle, and sales incentives.

19
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,990
How should I respond on your behalf?

20
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,550
 Now, that dream is asking me again, 

21
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,260
 "How will you decide this time?" 

22
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,990
 If perhaps we are given a coincidence-like fate once again, 

23
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,660
 I won't make an excuse then. 

24
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,550
 I will insist that it is fate. 

25
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,070
 Okay. 

26
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,900
 When that happens, 

27
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,540
 make sure you do that. 

28
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:03,140
 What should I grab and what should I let go? 

29
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:09,750
 How do I know when I must grab or when I must let go? 

30
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,310
 Does an acceptable time exist? 

31
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,100
   

32
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,850
   

33
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,850
   
   

34
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,860
   

35
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,840
   

36
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,260
Renoir and Maison Mihabelle are opening on the third floor in zone B,

37
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,630
where domestic women's clothing shops have been removed.

38
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,960
We are currently in negotiations regarding the rate of commission.

39
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,010
What is the current sales status for women's business  attire for this quarter?

40
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,040
There has been a 12 percent decrease from last year.

41
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,690
The only brand exhibiting an upward trend is Sonó.

42
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,990
   

43
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,200
Has Sonó responded?

44
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,270
They said that they would apply the same conditions as a popular foreign brand contract

45
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,740
and lower the commission to 20 percent.

46
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,200
Wow, I've never had the upper hand over a department store before.

47
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,520
While they're at it, it would have been great if they moved our store in front of the up escalator.

48
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,860
They said that they will.

49
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:54,330
The pressure for sales will be as large as the spot is nice.

50
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,830
If you don't prefer it, you don't have to go.

51
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,750
Are we only allies when things go well?

52
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,080
Someone who breaks a contract once will do it a second or third time.

53
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,560
I respect Team Leader Ha's opinion one hundred percent.

54
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,490
Why are you being like this? Maintain your character!

55
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,400
Team Leader Ha is a completely, absolutely treasured existence to The One.

56
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,860
I especially respect her.

57
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,120
So, Yeong Eun, what do you want to do?

58
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,260
Do you think it would be right to stay at The Hills or leave?

59
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,300
I think it would be best to stay.

60
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,570
It's expected that they would make judgments based on sales.

61
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,830
Our burden for sales will definitely increase,

62
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,870
but these conditions and this spot

63
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,380
will set a good precedent for other domestic brands.

64
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,770
As expected, a generous heart.

65
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,080
Even after enduring that humiliation from Vice President Shin Yoo Jeong,

66
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,770
you retain a detached state of mind to consider the company's profits and pride.

67
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,860
You are so cool, Team Leader Ha.

68
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,320
Wow, I really can't get used to this.

69
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,170
 Did someone from Paris say that they want to take Yeong Eun? 

70
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,640
 What's wrong? Are you in a difficult position to answer? 

71
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,660
 Opening up about this to her CEO before Team Leader Ha herself 

72
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,780
 feels like some kind of, how should I say it... betrayal. 

73
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,980
 So it is a recruiting proposal. 

74
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,900
 Who is it? Olivier? 

75
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,600
 I'm sorry. 

76
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,860
Well then, we'll stay.

77
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,810
Let's go with that, CEO.

78
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,700
If you have confidence that you can keep your pride until the end, go for it.

79
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,790
What is the next item on the agenda?

80
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,450
- Awesome! 
 - Isn't the space in front of the escalator killer?

81
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,730
It looks like The Hills raised the white flag in the end.

82
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,660
Since we went face to face with our clothes as opposed to lobbying or whatnot,

83
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,660
this is our own achievement, right?

84
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,430
It is, it is! It one hundred percent is!

85
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,290
I feel very proud that I am a Sonó designer.

86
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,050
- Thank you, Team Leader!
 - Thank you.

87
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,800
You're so cool, Noona.

88
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,830
   

89
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,800
 Another call came from Olivier today. 

90
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,000
 I'll respond saying that you will consider it until the end of this week 

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,600
 then give a response. 

92
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,190
 As you know, Duchamps is a brand at the top of haute couture. 

93
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,090
 You will be able to experience something different 

94
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,140
 from the pret-a-porter collections you have been doing until now. 

95
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,830
Team Leader! We should get a soft start on the image map for next season, right?

96
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,360
I have some already done.

97
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,740
I'll include them as an attachment and send it to you.

98
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,890
Can I give an idea as well?

99
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,430
Let's do that. Everyone work to your heart's desire.

100
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,100
Okay!

101
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,450
Yes. Good.  Turn your head slightly.

102
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,610
Yes, good!

103
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,540
You came? Could you wait for just a moment?

104
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,480
Please stand in the line behind me.

105
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,770
You will have to wait a while since there are many customers with appointments.

106
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,740
Your legs must hurt. Please sit here while you wait.

107
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,280
Oh, are you an employee here?

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,820
Yes.

109
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,140
Ah, I see.

110
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,850
Yes, good.

111
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,520
   

112
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,710
 I want to take pictures of people. 

113
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,580
 Being too close to, bumping into, and bothering each other. 

114
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,050
 It felt nice. I wanted to keep doing it. 

115
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,960
Yes, good! Good.

116
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,310
I'm sorry the lunch is poor. I have more appointments later.

117
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,270
Are you sure you put up the studio for sale?

118
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,280
I saw earlier that you're all booked for tomorrow and the day after.

119
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,950
I'm in the middle of putting it off.

120
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:28,820
It's like homework that I have to do but really don't want to do.

121
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,650
I don't know how they read my mind,

122
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,680
but some people came saying that they're sad too,

123
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,940
that they will take a photo while they're here,

124
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,480
and that they would bring their family next time.

125
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,360
Thanks to that, I'm feeling relieved.

126
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,230
What if you lose your opportunity to work in Paris while doing that?

127
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,650
Then it can't be helped. I'll just stay here longer.

128
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,900
But what brings you here without a call?

129
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,700
Did something happen?

130
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,360
The Hills said that they would move us to the best spot.

131
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,000
Wow!

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,840
To be honest, it's nice.

133
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,800
When they told us to close up our store,

134
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,110
it felt so hopeless that I felt like I had sunken underground.

135
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,000
But now I feel like I pulled through, that I made it...

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,950
That's great.

137
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:27,150
 But... can I continue to be all right without you? 

138
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,910
How are the contract conditions from the people in Paris?

139
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,700
They aren't bad.

140
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,170
From their perspective, she is definitely an unknown designer.

141
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,660
I'm sorry, that happens to be their perspective.

142
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,200
So what did they say they would do for her?

143
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,390
Full control over design, control over personnel, profit shares,

144
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,280
and direct planning and participating in Paris fashion shows for two seasons.

145
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,450
To be honest, this is an offer that would be difficult for any designer to decline.

146
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,400
Since you're doing it anyway, take care of each of those conditions one by one.

147
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,900
That kid, Yeong Eun, is like a daughter to me.

148
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,330
These are already good conditions, but go for something that would benefit her more.

149
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:21,170
Instead of two seasons, make them promise something like a few full years.

150
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:26,140
For the contract, be very meticulous and detailed while taking care of it.

151
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,840
Yes, Father. I will take care of it well.

152
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,130
All right. That's all then.

153
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,300
I'll trust you.

154
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,710
Okay.

155
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,920
 Your dad and that man are meeting alone. 

156
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,930
CEO Seok?

157
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,620
Director Hwang.

158
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,310
Why are you coming from there?

159
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,490
I had something urgent to report to CEO Hwang only.

160
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:18,070
Urgent and only for him... What is it?

161
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,640
I told you that it was urgent and for him only,

162
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,460
so it's not something I can recklessly disclose.

163
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,740
Of course, he wouldn't be able to say anything.

164
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,490
Since that "urgent, for him only" probably contains some kind of deal.

165
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,960
They must have had some business to attend to as CEOs.

166
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,480
I think they were talking about you though.

167
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,200
That's because I'm the common denominator between the two of them.

168
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,870
And he was put in charge of marketing for not only men's clothing line but also the rest of The One?

169
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,840
That's because, on top of everything else, he's competent.

170
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:55,440
That's why. Aren't you getting the feeling that he approached you for business reasons?

171
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,170
What are you talking about?

172
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,870
The reason why I like him is because he's not the kind of person that you're describing. Got it?

173
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,150
CEO Hwang must really like him.

174
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,000
He even said that he would give him a 15% increase on his contractual fees.

175
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,930
You wrote that novel of yours in detail!

176
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,260
I acknowledge your hard work!

177
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,910
Confirm it.

178
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,310
What is wrong with you?

179
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,130
Why are you so confident?

180
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,010
Because I genuinely love you.

181
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,920
Wow, I was so nervous!

182
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,800
You were the most wonderful, even among the professional models.

183
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,990
Really?

184
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,650
 Say "Mom, you're so cool!" 

185
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,170
She was so pretty that I kept filming her without realizing it.

186
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:55,940
I get giddy from just looking at my daughter because of how much I adore her.

187
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:02,030
After living my whole life alone, there were two of us after meeting my husband, then we became three...

188
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:05,010
Whether I was pretty or ugly,

189
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,890
they took my side and kept me from being lonely.

190
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:13,060
If not family, who would do that for me?

191
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,080
That's true.

192
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:20,920
Assistant Manager Seo, do you have any plans to start a family?

193
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,970
I'm not sure.

194
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,100
I haven't met a good person like the senior manager yet.

195
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,290
You've been working with him for a long time, right?

196
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,770
Yes, ever since I was hired.

197
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,070
- What do you think of him, Assistant Manager Seo? 
 - Pardon?

198
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,570
I was just wondering about what he's like from the perspective of someone working with him.

199
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,160
I see.

200
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,580
He's someone I'm thankful for.

201
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,970
In the beginning, I made a lot of mistakes and was criticized by clients.

202
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,080
"That's all right. It happens."

203
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,370
He comforted me and cheered me on.

204
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,890
So when the senior manager is around, I somehow feel safer,

205
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,540
and I lean on him.

206
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,090
While working, that's how I feel.

207
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:29,460
Our Soo Ho is a pretty good man, I'll admit.

208
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,380
Am I taking too much of your time for giving something as small as one container of kimchi?

209
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,520
Not at all! Today was pretty relaxed because a large show has finished.

210
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,140
What do you usually do when you have free time?

211
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,570
I go to the bookstore to look at magazines and go to popular places.

212
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,670
These days I also go to the department store often.

213
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,280
I can learn just from seeing what's displayed.

214
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,580
I'm sorry for taking away the time that you would be using to study.

215
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,510
These are photos from the fashion show.

216
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,920
Thank you.

217
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,460
Me too. I'll enjoy eating the kimchi.

218
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,650
   

219
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,840
   

220
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,420
   

221
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,100
 When one spoonful of rice is difficult to swallow, 

222
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,990
 I can put it in water then swallow it. 

223
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,750
 But... 

224
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:52,550
 the sorrow of nearly 40 years that has become thick like overcooked rice 

225
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:57,600
 can't be swallowed no matter how much water is added. 

226
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,550
 The sorrow that's like an upset stomach that feels 

227
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:06,010
 tight as a fist and won't go away 

228
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,020
 becomes grief and resentment. 

229
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,420
 I'm scared that the only thing remaining 

230
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,300
 will be hatred. 

231
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,300
I'm sorry.

232
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,630
You've been getting on my nerves and now this?

233
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,950
Get out! Get out!

234
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,800
Seriously!

235
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,950
Do you hate me that much?

236
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,220
You hated everything?

237
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,440
But I...

238
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,010
I loved you!

239
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,660
Shut up!

240
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,820
- So Yeong, take him with you. 
 - Okay.

241
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,620
You worked hard!

242
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,070
Team Leader, these are some images I've picked out.

243
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,620
Okay, and you've spoken with the visual merchandising department regarding The Hills store?

244
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,270
Yes. They said that they would get an interior plan together after seeing the scale and location of the store.

245
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,200
Tomorrow, I will be going directly to The Hills to work.

246
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay.

247
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,290
Are you not going home, Team Leader?

248
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,190
I will a little later.

249
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,790
It's really nice working with you.

250
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,370
Thank you for making it so that I'm able to retain my pride.

251
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,510
We all did it together.

252
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:57,990
As for me, I will help more and more for next season and the one after that.

253
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,510
- All right, let's do that. 
 - Okay.

254
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,910
Then, see you tomorrow.

255
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,600
Pick it up tomorrow around the afternoon.

256
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,850
Yes, have good evening.

257
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,010
  
  

258
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,990
   

259
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,380
 Hey! We're in the middle of communal living! 

260
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,570
 Knock before entering the bathroom. Knock, knock! 

261
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,190
 Why do grandmas and grandpas wake up this early? 

262
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,220
 No matter how many times I tell them that I open at 10, 

263
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,170
 they tell me to take photos of them starting at 8. 

264
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,650
 Whether it's their daughter's house or their son's house, 

265
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,610
 they say they have to go somewhere. 

266
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,450
 Are you fulfilling your long-held wish? 

267
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,120
 Were you hurt because you haven't been taking identification photos? 

268
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,070
 Since I also want to return to my elegant, natural state, 

269
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,450
 wrap it up and buy your plane tickets.  

270
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:44,210
 I'll pack a ton of seaweed and kimchi for you guys. 

271
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,020
 You guys? Who are you referring to? 

272
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,690
 Weren't you going side by side with Team Leader Ha? 

273
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,330
 What are you talking about? 

274
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,910
 You haven't heard yet? 

275
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,520
 Olivier sent a recruiting offer to her saying come to Paris. 

276
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,250
 I guess you haven't heard yet. 

277
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,870
 Aside from The Hills, do you have anything else to say? 

278
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,590
 No, nothing really yet... 

279
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,140
 "Nothing really yet," you say. 

280
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:26,340
 Once you decide when you're leaving, you'll tell me first, right? 

281
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,260
   

282
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,790
Is this Korean Air?

283
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,720
I would like to book a plane ticket to Paris.

284
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,380
They are proposing a contract length of one year.

285
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,820
For that time, 2022 F/W, 2023 Resort &amp; Cruise,

286
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,720
and 2023 S/S will be assigned to you.

287
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,020
Depending on your performance with those three collections, you will be able to negotiate your salary again.

288
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,230
A contract extension will also be decided based on your performance.

289
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,220
Performance?

290
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:20,110
At this age, I must prepare for the shows as if I'm studying for an exam.

291
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:24,850
The work we do always comes with performance and sales evaluations.

292
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,940
If you have any conditions to add or demands to make,

293
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,310
let's think it over and discuss it together.

294
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,610
I will negotiate it as needed.

295
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:36,370
I should think this over, right?

296
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,750
It is a very good opportunity.

297
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,770
Is it really a very good opportunity?

298
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:47,030
Of course as someone who watched how you led Sonó by your side,

299
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,900
I can't help but think that opportunities are made by people.

300
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,200
To that extent, Team Leader Ha, you really led Sonó well.

301
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,270
I was just lucky.

302
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,680
I fully understand your attachment to Sonó.

303
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,660
But nevertheless,

304
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,230
I wish you would grab this opportunity.

305
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:11,290
For yourself and for Jae Gook.

306
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,600
The French Photographic Arts Society has suggested that Jae Gook

307
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,820
do an exhibition at the Pompidou Centre.

308
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,230
An exhibition?

309
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:26,420
This invitation is only for those who have won grand prize at international photography contests.

310
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,960
He has so much to prepare that even if he stays up all night starting from now, it wouldn't be enough,

311
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,400
but he only keeps taking identification photos.

312
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,670
The fashion industry is consumed so quickly.

313
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,650
What's hot right now will change quickly with the trends.

314
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,590
There are many skilled photographers

315
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,270
who switched to wedding photography and general product advertisements.

316
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,960
Isn't the final dream of all photographers

317
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,350
to eventually exhibit their own work?

318
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,970
Jae Gook is precious.

319
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,670
I don't want to make him lose his opportunity.

320
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:06,090
Go with him.

321
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:15,330
♫  Lean on me for a bit and close your eyes  ♫

322
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:21,060
♫  Don't worry about anything  ♫

323
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:28,850
♫  Don't look back on the days that have passed  ♫

324
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:32,450
 When does he have to leave by? 

325
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:37,280
 Before fall comes. No matter what. 

326
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,960
Before fall comes...

327
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:47,730
Then... that means he has to leave soon.

328
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:53,060
♫  Melt your tired heart  ♫

329
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:59,790
   
   

330
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:05,030
♫  Hurry and close your eyes  ♫

331
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,360
♫  Fall asleep peacefully  ♫

332
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,620
   

333
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,250
- Oh my god! 
 - What?

334
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,460
It's from Vision PR so it's trustworthy information.

335
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,870
On top of that, it's Duchamps, a luxury brand with 130 years of tradition.

336
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:35,160
Where? Duchamps? The store where they sell pants for over 2,000,000 won?

337
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,780
Paris is finally recognizing our Noonim Yeong Eun.

338
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,390
It's Team Leader Ha. Not Noonim Yeong Eun.

339
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,500
Then, are we all going together?

340
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,090
But... seeing how quiet it's been until now...

341
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,960
She still hasn't decided.

342
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,260
Why would she not be able to decide?

343
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,220
When would another opportunity like this come around?

344
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,600
Maybe it's because I treated her so well.

345
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,990
Sonó just recently got raised to the top after all these years.

346
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,060
Wouldn't she feel uneasy to ditch it and leave just like this?

347
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,150
Even still, she won't not go,

348
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,930
and she will definitely take Manager Nam with her.

349
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,820
If she's the creative director, she will have control over human resources too.

350
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,710
Well, I did work with her for a long time.

351
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,420
What about you, Jeong So Yeong?

352
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,490
Well... if Team Leader would take me.

353
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,130
It must be nice to be so young.

354
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:25,860
If you go and get 3-4 years of work experience, your portfolio will just upgrade on its own.

355
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,990
- That too but I do want to keep learning from Team Leader Ha. 
 - Cheesy!

356
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:35,020
- Okay, then let's say that we're going. 
 - We? We!

357
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,770
How dare they after all I've done for them.

358
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,850
What the heck!

359
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,160
What are you all doing now?

360
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,100
Shouldn't you be working? Shouldn't you?

361
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,790
Work! Work!

362
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,820
Gosh, seriously.

363
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,600
Why are you so surprised?

364
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,910
I'm a director. I'm even the CEO's daughter.

365
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:57,960
They told me not to say anything because a rumor will spread around.

366
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,760
Vision PR is in charge of all marketing down to men's clothing?

367
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,420
Yes.

368
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,240
And the contractual fees have increased by 15 percent?

369
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,700
Yes.

370
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,310
Has it been signed?

371
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:16,960
Yes, it likely has since CEO Hwang is taking care of it himself.

372
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,630
Really?

373
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:25,720
So my father and CEO Seok are in the middle of planning something together?

374
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,790
Is that what you mean?

375
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,380
When the customers come down the escalator,

376
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,360
they will naturally look this way.

377
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,030
Then how about we put a colorful display right here?

378
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,340
Okay, and I think it would be good to adjust the lighting too.

379
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,690
I'll consult with the department store about whether or not we can add point lighting in the center.

380
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,350
Yes, I'll leave that to you.

381
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,810
Yes, understood.

382
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:56,620
Team Leader Ha? It would be good to take down this fake wall, correct?

383
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,150
Yes.

384
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,540
- Just a moment. 
 - Ah, yes.

385
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,040
Yes, this is Ha Yeong Eun.

386
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:21,220
I am Jae Gook's mother.

387
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,120
Yes, please speak.

388
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,170
If you have time, would you like to have tea with me?

389
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,650
Since you're a busy person, I'll make the time.

390
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,260
 What time would work for you? 

391
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,900
   

392
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,080
I apologize, but may I call you back?

393
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,840
I understand, call me again when you have the time.

394
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,400
Yes, I will.

395
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,160
Mi Sook, is something wrong?

396
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:53,290
You're crying? Why? Are you in a lot of pain again?

397
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,610
It's not me, but Chi Sook.

398
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,620
Huh? Chi Sook?

399
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,340
Yeong Eun, you have to come and help stop her tears.

400
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,420
She's been crying for 30 minutes!

401
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,440
Did you fight with CEO Seok?

402
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,790
Is she someone who would fight?

403
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:18,380
She's like this because she got upset about something on her own.

404
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,290
In the end, he was the same.

405
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:25,840
That person also met me for my dad's money.

406
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,050
He's not that kind of person.

407
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,210
No, who would say such a thing?

408
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,900
I verified it all.

409
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,700
With the intention of getting our company's marketing,

410
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,840
he dated me.

411
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,080
But why are you crying?

412
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,440
It wouldn't be enough to rip out all his hair.

413
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,680
Did you check with CEO Seok yourself?

414
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,670
It would be confirmed once I hear it from his mouth.

415
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:53,530
I really liked him!

416
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:57,330
How can I break up?

417
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,800
She's sincere.

418
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,630
First, calm down.

419
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:09,610
Since Ji Min and Soo Ho will come soon, let's go to my house.

420
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,100
Leave her alone. It's fine.

421
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,790
Ji Min and Soo Ho went shopping.

422
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,710
They will eat dinner before coming back.

423
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,990
- The two of them? 
 - With Assistant Manager Seo.

424
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,740
 Assistant Manager Seo, what brings you... here? 

425
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,700
 Your wife asked it of me. 

426
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,490
 The aches are strong today. 
   

427
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,130
 Assistant Manager Seo happened to say she was going to the department store today, 

428
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,990
 and the time happened to be right. 

429
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,940
 Would you be able to dress the child properly? 

430
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,570
 For girl's clothes, 

431
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,730
 a woman has to see it to know if it fits or suits her. 

432
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,150
 Ji Min, come with me to try on clothes. 

433
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:00,350
 Dad, I'm going to go with Auntie. 

434
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,000
 Okay. 

435
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,120
 If you feel sorry, buy Assistant Manager Seo a meal or something. 

436
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,730
 Something I need? 

437
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,830
 What would I need? 

438
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,030
 There's nothing. 

439
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:19,070
 Don't go somewhere like the food court because of money, 

440
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,390
 and go somewhere nice, okay? 

441
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,160
 I'm hanging up. 

442
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,560
Mi Sook.

443
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,160
Hey! You stay still!

444
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,680
These assholes! I'm going to show them what betrayal really tastes like!

445
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,200
Forget it! Don't go overboard!

446
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,090
I asked Assistant Manager Seo to do that.

447
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,890
- Mi Sook. 
 - Jeon Mi Sook.

448
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:49,270
That's right, I'm in the middle of breaking up right now.

449
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,530
Sure, I honestly do feel a bit of rage!

450
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:59,050
If I didn't happen to be sick, the two of them... I would just—

451
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,320
That's what I'd think one second, then afterwards...

452
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,830
I'm so grateful that she's not a weird lady.

453
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,560
My heart goes back and forth,

454
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,390
like this and like that.

455
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,980
But I am not breaking up with Soo Ho.

456
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,040
My lingering attachment,

457
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,720
my hope,

458
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,830
desires...

459
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,610
those are the kinds of things I'm breaking up with.

460
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,820
This girl, seriously!

461
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:45,710
And if that doesn't work?

462
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,400
If you keep hesitating, what should you do?

463
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,340
That's when you should really part, no?

464
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,540
When you keep getting greedy.

465
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,020
When you've gotten greedy so you anxiously wish for a bit more,

466
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,680
a bit more...

467
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,140
I can't live! Seriously, this girl!

468
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,480
   

469
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,420
Yes, good!

470
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,100
I'll take one more.

471
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,710
Yes, all done.

472
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,640
Good work.

473
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,600
Is this lunch or dinner?

474
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,630
What to do? You haven't eaten until now.

475
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,040
It's all right to eat now.

476
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,380
Lock the door for a bit and eat immediately.

477
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,670
- You have to think of your body too. 
 - Okay.

478
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,530
Come pick it up tomorrow evening.

479
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,330
Have a good one.

480
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,860
   

481
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,980
Welcome.

482
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,820
Thank you for coming.

483
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,890
What brings you here without any notice?

484
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:53,110
What happened here?

485
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,730
How did your dazzling appearance

486
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:59,260
change into a face full of distress?

487
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,150
My expectations,

488
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,850
my hope, ambition...

489
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,380
- I came to let them go. 
 - Pardon?

490
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,480
I finished verifying the facts.

491
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,460
Don't even think of lying, and look me straight in the eyes.

492
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:38,210
Why do you keep bringing Assistant Manager Seo into our family?

493
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,770
What's with the kimchi all of a sudden?

494
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,480
And what about Ji Min's clothes?

495
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,720
Huh?

496
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:52,240
You go out to the veranda to take calls from clients.

497
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,690
You go in the bathroom to take calls.

498
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,230
Every time you did that,

499
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,880
you smiled really brightly.

500
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,040
Mi Sook.

501
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,130
Assistant Manager Seo...

502
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,490
Seeing her up close, she seems like a good person.

503
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,820
But still, don't make me feel too jealous.

504
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,070
Mi Sook.

505
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,590
But, Soo Ho,

506
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,720
while you're with me,

507
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,710
love only me, okay?

508
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,220
I'm sorry.

509
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,700
I'm sorry.

510
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,540
I'm sorry.

511
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,930
What is he doing that he didn't even turn on the lights?

512
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,360
He hasn't even eaten yet.

513
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,810
I see that you're going to do whatever you want since we're splitting up.

514
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,750
Staying out overnight is also grounds for divorce.

515
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,010
Just know that.

516
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,590
   

517
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,350
 I'm sorry. I didn't know. 

518
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,280
 I didn't know. 

519
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,550
What did you just say?

520
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,050
I asked why you approached me in the beginning.

521
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,690
I did?

522
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,240
That's not true.

523
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,350
Just like now, you barged into my office suddenly,

524
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,350
looking for Seok Do Hoon.

525
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:27,410
- Don't you remember?
 - It's true that it's not me that you liked,

526
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,920
but my father's money though.

527
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,500
It's true, isn't it?

528
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,380
Director Hwang, why are you saying these offensive things?

529
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,960
How far were you going to go if I kept letting myself be deceived?

530
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,390
After being put in charge of all of The One's marketing including men's clothing

531
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,380
and taking everything else that you could take,

532
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,500
were you going to dump me then?

533
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,870
- Director Hwang! 
 - It's true though!

534
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:50,360
You met me and came to the company often to get closer to my dad.

535
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,210
Are you happy that you got the marketing rights?

536
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,200
Yes.

537
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,360
I did get the marketing rights.

538
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:03,070
But one hundred percent I earned it with my abilities.

539
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,810
If it weren't for me, you'd have no chance.

540
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:08,720
If I got the marketing rights because of you, I wouldn't even accept them!

541
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,780
That would bring extreme shame to even my employees at Vision PR

542
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,840
who have pride in their work!

543
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,110
It's true that I liked you.

544
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:28,040
And it's also true that I became close to CEO Hwang through you.

545
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,090
Do you think my work became easier because of that?

546
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,780
No, it didn't.

547
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,030
It became more difficult and challenging.

548
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:39,580
Because I would have to work harder and better to not hear these kinds of words.

549
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,580
Other than that,

550
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:46,120
there has never been even one moment...

551
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,750
when I connected you to my work.

552
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,990
I don't want to hear any more of these offensive things.

553
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:05,640
   

554
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,440
So please leave.

555
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,750
   

556
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,930
   

557
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,930
I'm not going to Paris.

558
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,570
The contract length is one year.

559
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:19,410
The decision to extend the contract will depend on  the results of each season.

560
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:28,170
You know that Olivier just wants the Ha Yeong Eun who is hot at the moment.

561
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:32,650
This is a field where trends change overnight.

562
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:36,000
How long will I be able to stay hot?

563
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,620
One year to two years... then to three years.

564
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,830
Couldn't you try to make that happen?

565
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:51,470
A house, car, atelier... Nothing's free.

566
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:55,950
I have to return everything I receive by making a profit.

567
00:41:55,950 --> 00:42:00,610
And if it doesn't work, then I'll have to look for cheaper fabric

568
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:06,020
and my words will command to make something profitable.

569
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,910
Is that success?

570
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:13,040
If I go to Paris, does it mean I've succeeded?

571
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,150
But I still wanted to go.

572
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,370
Should I just go?

573
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:26,010
What's a year?  What's one season?

574
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,180
But the thing is...

575
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:32,300
To think of my clothes like that...

576
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:36,090
That's not right.

577
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,080
 When is the moment when you have to let go of love? 

578
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,680
But still, I keep hesitating.

579
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,370
I keep looking for reasons to go.

580
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,070
That's why you aren't able to go.

581
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,450
You...

582
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,160
could lose the opportunity.

583
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,460
♫  Because it's you, I hold your hand because it's you  ♫

584
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:15,760
♫  Even if I run away for a long time again  ♫

585
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,580
♫  We'll always be together  ♫

586
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,320
 At a time that's neither too late 

587
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,170
 nor too early 

588
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:27,400
 I am letting go of your hand 

589
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,810
 for you who are heading towards the future. 

590
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:35,500
I'm not letting you go.

591
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:42,990
I'm letting go of my greed and lingering attachment.

592
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:50,900
♫  If our time can last forever  ♫

593
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:56,940
♫  I will do anything  ♫

594
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,950
You did well.

595
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:02,280
Before I get more anxious,

596
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,680
before I waver more,

597
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,220
it's right to let him go.

598
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,160
This is the right thing, Yeong Eun.

599
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:18,170
♫  To be with you forever  ♫

600
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:26,600
♫  Like my unchanging heart, forevermore  ♫

601
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:42,730
The fried dumplings were so warm.

602
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,420
I was just going to quickly give that to you and leave.

603
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,830
No need to keep asking me to sleep over.

604
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:49,770
You're going to just leave after coming to your daughter's house this late at night?

605
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,350
It's late, so just go to sleep.

606
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:54,490
Fine.  You must be tired also, so go to sleep.

607
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:56,140
Okay.

608
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:11,100
I let Dad sleep here.

609
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,890
 Why does he leave his perfectly good home and go out all the time? 

610
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:15,040
Is he a child?

611
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,550
Mom, don't say anything more to him either.

612
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,420
   
   

613
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,490
He read all the letters I wrote.

614
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:33,510
He left a note saying that he was sorry.

615
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:36,900
Okay, go to sleep and don't worry.

616
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:05,910
Hey, dude.  She's someone you love,

617
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:08,190
but you aren't thinking about persuading her?

618
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:11,050
Instead, you're giving up so fast.

619
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:12,850
Because I love her.

620
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:15,570
They are

621
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,830
intending to capitalize on the flashy public interest from the buyers show.

622
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,660
It's true that's how this started.

623
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:27,020
But if you think about it, it's also an opportunity.

624
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,470
I've seen it too many times in Paris.

625
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,760
Seducing people using a luxury brand name

626
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,060
and using them for one or as long as two seasons until they suck out all the sweet flavor and then

627
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,760
"I think you don't fit us anymore."

628
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:44,710
They fire them at once.

629
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:48,980
Well, there are some people who did go

630
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:52,630
and meet a bad ending.

631
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:54,880
But Team Leader Ha is very talented so...

632
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,500
They think they are the best.

633
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,660
They flat out ignore you and curse right in front of you.

634
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:05,000
If a female Asian designer wants to survive there,

635
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,770
she has to be not only cut-throat but also sly.

636
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:12,980
I can't make her stay by my side

637
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,060
if she has to go through that.

638
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:26,840
Will you be all right?

639
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,030
No.

640
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:35,070
Understanding that so well is driving me crazy.

641
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:40,620
To the point that I can't insist,

642
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:46,050
I understand the situation so clearly that it is driving me crazy.

643
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,860
Despite that, Hyung,

644
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:58,400
just once...

645
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:04,050
I want to grab her just once.

646
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:09,560
If I don't, I'll go crazy.

647
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:23,160
Jeez.

648
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,920
Is it love that's hard

649
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,830
or breaking up that's hard?

650
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,780
 I understand how you two feel 

651
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:03,140
  and that I am the villain in your love. 

652
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,660
 You may be sad now, 

653
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,650
 but after ten or twenty years, 

654
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,850
 you will be glad I did this. 

655
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:12,300
 That time will come. 

656
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,720
 I lived longer, so what I say will be right. 

657
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,950
 For setting aside your feelings after understanding my words, 

658
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,760
 I thank you. 

659
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:27,410
 Please don't thank me. 

660
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:30,370
 It's not because of you. 

661
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:36,910
 Jae Gook and I did not love for someone else's sake, 

662
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:42,610
 nor do we plan to set aside our feelings because of someone. 

663
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:48,990
 Jae Gook will go to Paris. 

664
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 That's the correct choice for him. 

665
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,930
 And I 

666
00:49:56,930 --> 00:50:00,310
 will also make the correct choice for me. 

667
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,640
 A choice that will 

668
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,450
 allow me to love and protect 

669
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:10,200
 the work that I love 

670
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:13,510
 and the people I love until the end. 

671
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:21,420
♫  At first, I was calmer than I thought I would be  ♫

672
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:27,000
♫  The longing hurts more than breaking up  ♫

673
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,420
 What do you think is at the end of that road? 

674
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,520
 It's probably me there. 

675
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,980
 No matter what path you take, 

676
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:41,810
 at the end of it, I'll always be there. 

677
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:51,740
♫  Even still, I, who am truly like a fool  ♫

678
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:57,210
♫  Survive like this  ♫

679
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:00,800
♫  I couldn't let you go  ♫

680
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,770
♫  And I couldn't erase it  ♫

681
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:11,640
♫  One side of my chest just hurts  ♫

682
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,900
♫  Turning away again  ♫

683
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:20,300
♫  My departing footsteps are heavy  ♫

684
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:42,350
 I appreciate DPHP's offer, 

685
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:47,250
 but I will remain in my position as Sonó's designer. 

686
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,840
 This is my official position. 

687
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:57,500
Noona Yeong Eun always defies common sense.

688
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,220
Because she's riding a roller coaster, she's out of her mind.

689
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:03,410
I thought we were really going to Paris this time.

690
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:06,470
Then with that mindset shall we get ready for the next season?

691
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,300
Is that okay?

692
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:12,380
With that, the team leader position has gotten further away.

693
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,460
Didn't know my position was at risk.

694
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,290
I had a splendid dream.

695
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:20,870
Make pretty and good clothing and come up.

696
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:23,400
I'll give it to you anytime.

697
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:28,370
   

698
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:31,950
 Team Leader Ha, the CEO is summoning you. 

699
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,420
You called for me.

700
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:49,630
You decided not to go to Paris?

701
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:52,290
What is the reason you can't go to such a great place?

702
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:55,320
It's not that I can't.  It's that I won't.

703
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,440
So, why?

704
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,090
I didn't know until now.

705
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:03,530
I didn't think much about my team leader position. I thought "well, that's that."

706
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:08,090
But then when I actually tried to leave it behind,

707
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:11,700
I couldn't imagine myself without Sonó.

708
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:16,470
The moment I thought of separating, I realized something new.

709
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:18,960
It's not that Sonó is here because of me.

710
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,070
Thanks to Sonó, I am here.

711
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:25,120
Yeong Eun, you... I know you've worked hard.

712
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,970
You have struggled covering for your friend's lack of skill and doing your own work.

713
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:30,290
It must have been hard.

714
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:34,020
Honestly, at first I thought it was for money.

715
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,700
I thought for the sake of your own job security,

716
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,780
you cleaned up after Chi Sook's messes

717
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:42,090
while only being concerned about moving up in the company.

718
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:44,080
Is that so?

719
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:49,160
Every season, you never wasted a day and just made clothes.

720
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:54,430
When I saw you treat Chi Sook sincerely as a friend, I thought I wasted my life

721
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:57,540
because I don't know how to read people at all.

722
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,170
I was ashamed.

723
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,330
With this incident, I realized something too.

724
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,430
Sonó is Ha Yeong Eun's.

725
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:14,980
So take Sonó and become independent.

726
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,010
CEO.

727
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:22,440
You made it and protected its value.

728
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,200
Become independent and develop it however you wish.

729
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:30,080
Your sincerity won over me.

730
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:37,310
 Breaking news! Team Leader Ha is not going to Paris. 

731
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,360
 CEO Hwang suggested she become independent with Sonó. 

732
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,800
What?

733
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:43,160
Did something happen?

734
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,890
- She's not going to Paris. 
 - Did you see this?

735
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,560
   
   

736
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,610
    
   

737
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:52,400
I heard Team Leader Ha won't go.

738
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,460
What is it?  What is it that you're like that?

739
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:03,510
I'll make it a separate corporation, so lead it like a personal brand.

740
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:07,220
Is it going to be The One's licensed brand?

741
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,220
We'll split the sales profits 50-50.

742
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,970
What do you think?  Do you want to try it?

743
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,800
I'm very thankful for the offer,

744
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,160
but, honestly, it's something I never thought about.

745
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,550
Do I have to give you my answer now?

746
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:26,410
Take your time thinking about it and put together a business plan.

747
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,970
Yes, it's Ha Yeong Eun.

748
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:05,370
You remember, right? I'm Kim Seo Hyeon, editor-in-chief of Nouvelle Vague.

749
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,160
 I called as soon as I heard the news. 

750
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,800
You refused an offer from Olivier?

751
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:15,000
 Now I really want to know who Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun is. 

752
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,470
I want to do the interview I requested last time.

753
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:21,140
Of course, I will send you the questions again.

754
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:25,110
As you wished, we will do it at Sonó's office.

755
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:28,320
I decided to do the Nouvelle Vague interview.

756
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:30,950
Awesome.

757
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:34,920
Then, will the Nouvelle Vague interview be done at our office?

758
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:42,640
What are you doing?  You must hurry and fill it with our clothing.

759
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,970
It will be a six-page article in Nouvelle Vague.

760
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:46,690
Yes!

761
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,660
Sketches! I'll bring the sketches.

762
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,200
So?

763
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,950
 I wondered if I could ask you to take photos during the interview. 

764
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,690
Why are you making such a request?

765
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:06,710
Is it not possible?

766
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:09,470
 I meant you don't have to ask me. 

767
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:11,520
Just tell me the time and the place.

768
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,030
I will be there promptly.

769
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:17,610
If it isn't me, who would take your picture?

770
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:19,100
 Isn't that so? 

771
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:25,400
The date is tomorrow and the place is our Sonó's office.

772
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,050
Okay, I got it.

773
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,020
Then, see you tomorrow.

774
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,330
Just as you brought Sonó to popularity, I ask the same for the men's clothing line.

775
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:18,140
Yes, we will probably proceed differently than we have until now.

776
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:22,680
From what we've analyzed, it looks like you are planning to market to people in their late 30's.

777
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:27,120
Once they settle on a brand, there's a high chance of them becoming long-term customers.

778
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,720
Instead of excessive online advertisements and celebrity models,

779
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,290
we plan to use an algorithm to choose five items that customers prefer

780
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:36,100
and have them try them on.

781
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:39,340
Afterwards, they will choose products they want and return the rest.

782
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,860
An experiential marketing strategy is what we plan to use actively.

783
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,790
Okay.

784
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:48,830
Is there anything specific you'd like to add, Director Hwang?

785
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:50,330
- There isn't. 
 - Yes.

786
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:52,550
Okay, then we'll finish here.

787
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:55,210
- You've all worked hard. 
 - You've worked hard.

788
00:58:55,210 --> 00:59:01,960
Regarding marketing, what are your thoughts on using an online algorithm?

789
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,030
I think I'll have to look at the data first.

790
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,350
- You've worked hard today. 
  - As have you.

791
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:28,030
Do you really have nothing to say?

792
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:30,600
No, I don't.

793
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,200
Do misunderstandings happen for no reason?

794
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,700
Wouldn't the person who acted suspiciously also be at fault?

795
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:42,390
If there's trust, even if the person acted suspiciously, one would not doubt him.

796
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,660
Then well...

797
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:53,190
If you have nothing to say, there's no reason to meet anymore.

798
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:01,680
Are you saying we should break up?

799
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,390
Isn't that what you were saying?

800
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:15,180
I understand.

801
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,990
Well then.

802
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,410
- Shall we start? 
 - Yes.

803
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:55,350
Shall we start with a simple question?

804
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:58,560
I heard that you came up with the name Sonó yourself.

805
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,050
What does it mean?

806
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:06,990
I didn't come up with it.

807
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:13,350
A no name photographer in Paris came up with it for me.

808
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,700
Sonó means echo, a resounding sound.

809
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:24,210
Sonó was started because of that no name photographer

810
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:28,190
who wrote that he hopes that the echo will extend far and wide.

811
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:31,700
I'm most curious as to why you refused Olivier's offer.

812
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:35,700
Isn't it an offer any designer would hope for?

813
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:40,150
If it was the me from ten years ago, I probably would have wanted it.

814
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:46,020
Because with Paris, the birthplace of fashion, the name alone gives the feeling that you've succeeded.

815
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:51,370
But to me now, success isn't that kind of thing.

816
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:55,710
What do you think success is, Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun?

817
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:58,880
Going to multiple places myself to choose the fabric,

818
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,220
creating the spec sheet with my own hands,

819
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,930
staying up all night,

820
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:08,490
and seeing the pile of eraser dust on the desk when the morning comes.

821
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:14,010
Although it might be slow and tedious,

822
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:18,200
breaking the stereotypes, preconceptions, and prejudices surrounding domestic brands

823
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:23,310
one by one while remaining in my position.

824
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:26,330
Doing the work that I love

825
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:30,820
and reaching far away around the world by doing that.

826
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:36,770
That's what success means to me.

827
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:42,150
If the photographer who gave the name Sonó hears this, he would be very happy.

828
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:47,090
Do you want to say something to him through this interview?

829
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:53,230
Thank you. 
  (Informal speech) 

830
01:02:58,210 --> 01:03:00,590
Thank you. 
  (Formal speech) 

831
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:32,010
Congratulations on getting to hold an exhibition.

832
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:37,910
Congratulations on getting to do what you wanted to do.

833
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:47,670
Soon, it will get cooler and autumn will come, right?

834
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:53,190
A new season will also start.

835
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:59,460
Before autumn comes, go to Paris.

836
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:09,350
 A relationship that started in the spring passes the hot summer 

837
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:12,560
 and closes out a season. 

838
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,950
I was thoroughly...

839
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:21,030
warm and happy.

840
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:25,230
And I loved you.

841
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:30,170
Me too.

842
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:34,780
 The next season of our lives that will begin in autumn, 

843
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:37,030
 I wish it happiness.  

844
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:43,700
To be honest, I bought a plane ticket.

845
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,230
When is it?

846
01:04:52,990 --> 01:05:01,970
 Timing and subtitles brought to you by 
 Are You The One Team @ Viki 

847
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:08,390
   
   

848
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:14,570
One is mine, and the other is yours.

849
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:17,010
Jae Gook.

850
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:22,210
The decision of Designer Ha Yeong Eun and the decision of Sonó's Team Leader Ha...

851
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:26,970
I understand. I acknowledge it.

852
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:28,750
I respect it.

853
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:32,020
I will accept everything.

854
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:36,980
But putting all that aside,

855
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:41,060
just this one thing.

856
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:49,890
My brother, my mother, being a designer, being a photographer... forget all that.

857
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:52,440
They all don't matter.

858
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,010
The man, Yoon Jae Gook,

859
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:00,930
will ask the woman, Ha Yeong Eun,

860
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,250
this one thing just once more

861
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:09,960
for the last time.

862
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:16,980
Will you come with me?

863
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:26,690
Let's go together, Yeong Eun.

864
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:30,940
♫  You come and find me with a smile  ♫

865
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:34,890
   
   

866
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:38,560
♫  I'm intoxicated with your fragrance  ♫

867
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:45,960
♫  It's soaking into me  ♫

868
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:53,890
♫  You who wrap around me  ♫

869
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:59,720
♫  I'll always be with you  ♫

870
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:08,260
♫  Your hair flying in the wind  ♫

871
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:15,010
♫  It's enough to make me surrender  ♫

872
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:22,950
♫  Embrace me when the wind is cold  ♫

873
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:26,330
♫  Be my umbrella on a rainy day  ♫

874
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:29,410
   

875
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:33,540
 Dad, how did you let them go every year? 

876
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,090
 Wasn't it hard? 

877
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:37,820
 I'm about to finish the preparations to leave.  

878
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:38,830
 Are you okay? 

879
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:41,390
 Are you okay with living without seeing J? 

880
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:42,680
 He asked me to go with him. 

881
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:45,180
 But I couldn't immediately say no. 

882
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:49,930
 Why aren't you asking me? You didn't ask me what I was going to do. 

883
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,420
 I thought I should at least tell you that. 

884
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:57,420
 I don't want to send you off.  

885
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:05,900
♫  If I look back at so many seasons  ♫
