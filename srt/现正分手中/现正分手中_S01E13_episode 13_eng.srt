1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:06,150
   

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,200
   

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,020
   

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,160
   
   

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:32,970
 Timing and subtitles brought to you by 
 Are You The One Team @ Viki 

6
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,220
   

7
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,090
Oh? Where is my car key?

8
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,150
I am sure I put it in my pockets...

9
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,610
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone.

10
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,920
 Sorry! 

11
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,330
Why is Cookie saying that he's sorry?

12
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,140
What happened?

13
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,570
So we can go to work together.

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,890
 After that, with smiling faces, 

15
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,730
 should we break up? 

16
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,950
 Don't be distressed by yesterday's memories. 

17
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,000
 Don't have a hard time about tomorrow's worry. 

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 I'm sorry. 

19
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,130
 I'm sorry. 

20
00:01:50,130 --> 00:02:00,120
 Today, the two of us will just laugh, enjoy, and love. 

21
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,510
 After loving her as much as I can 

22
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,530
 for one month, 

23
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,840
 I'll break up with her. 

24
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,610
 It's written as "farewell" 

25
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,130
 but let's read it as "love." 

26
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,120
♫  It's my first feeling  ♫

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,380
♫  You make me lovely, lovely smile  ♫

28
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,970
The weather is so nice.

29
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,530
I know, right? It's a good day for a kiss.

30
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,590
No?

31
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,060
♫  Awkward feeling  ♫

32
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:47,220
♫  The heart which is lost and confused is yours  ♫

33
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,150
Are you busy today? Let's eat lunch together.

34
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,580
I will look at my schedule first.

35
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,030
♫  “You are my starry night”  ♫

36
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,880
   

37
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,920
   

38
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,940
You are late, right? Should I increase the speed?

39
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,860
Drive safely. 
    

40
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,890
There was no need for you to rush over like this without stopping.

41
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,610
Anyway, thank you.

42
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,830
What do you mean thank you?

43
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,950
Even if I go to work early, there is nothing to do anyway.

44
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,580
Oh? You are doing that again.

45
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,560
Since you came out in such a hurry, did you leave your responsibilities as the director of The One on the shoe rack?

46
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,150
I wore it as my innerwear.

47
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,250
Because today is the day to send the products, there's nothing special to do.

48
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,720
Ah, yes.

49
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,980
- I am the one who is thankful. 
 - What do you mean?

50
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,520
For helping us advance to Lafayette and allowing our products to be sold to countries far and wide.

51
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,710
It was the fantastic collaboration between you and Team Leader Ha.

52
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,370
Should I say that I just set the stage for you?

53
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,460
Of course, it was very superb.

54
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:03,200
My father has been doing "tsk tsk tsk" less often.

55
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,320
A real big congratulations for that.

56
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,390
It's a first for me.

57
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,290
That someone would recognize me and love me

58
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,770
without caring about my father's backing or my qualifications.

59
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,960
Because you are someone that I can't help but like, Miss Chi Sook!

60
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,380
Arrived. Have a good day.

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,420
- I will contact you. 
 - Okay.

62
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,010
Senior Manager!

63
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,820
You haven't had coffee yet, right?

64
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,860
The latte that you like.

65
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,200
- Assistant Manager Seo. 
 - It's just coffee.

66
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,600
Let's be comfortable like before.

67
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,990
We were good together.

68
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,040
Those little punks.

69
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,900
Hello, this is Ha Yeong Eun.

70
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,460
Yes.

71
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,780
Yes, thank you.

72
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,320
Yes.

73
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,340
They asked to make sure you call them back.

74
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,850
Calls asking for you have been flooding in since the morning.

75
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,520
Yes.

76
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,220
Thank you for the suggestion. Yes.

77
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,420
Hello, this is Ha Yeong Eun.

78
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,460
At this rate, our team leader might be going to a different company.

79
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,980
For our Team Leader Ha, Olivier was like...

80
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,420
He did a seal clap like this for her.

81
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,510
It's reasonable that multiple places want to recruit her.

82
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,700
Fashion is Paris. It's better to pack up in advance, right?

83
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,650
One second... did anyone say that they will take you?

84
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,220
Excuse me, sunbaes... if I didn't run around with those wires that day,

85
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,050
Olivier wouldn't have been able to connect.

86
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,930
When they said that the circuitry was unstable,

87
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,180
I fixed it in one shot with the skills I gained from my gaming days.

88
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,040
You know, right?

89
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,320
You must know.

90
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,590
Really, again? Are you going to keep speaking informally to me?

91
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,080
Where do you think she will go?

92
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,140
If she's going to leave anyway, I hope it'll be to somewhere at least at the level of Olivier.

93
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,650
Manager, you are going to follow her, right?

94
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,860
Of course! What about you?

95
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,140
If you and the Team Leader all leave, that position is mine...

96
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,310
- I'm torn. 
 - What should I do with you?

97
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,790
I'm going. You are going too, right?

98
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,550
If Team Leader Ha says "let's go," then of course I will.

99
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,520
There's one important thing. Does anyone know how to speak French?

100
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,490
Bonjour. 
  ("Hello" in French.) 

101
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,470
 You only know how to say that! 

102
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,140
- Yeah! 
 - So what? It's fine.

103
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,390
What is it?

104
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:50,370
- An expression of my heart to our company's treasure. 
 - What?

105
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,270
Having lived this long, there is one thing that I've learned.

106
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,000
Life is a series of temptations,

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,910
but you must never follow others blindly.

108
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,000
Just in case, by chance, if your heart wavers or you consider changing jobs

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,720
because other places are asking you to go to them since you held one successful show,

110
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,360
I'm asking you to not be swayed.

111
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,890
It's a plea from a sunbae.

112
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,360
Of course, I know very well that you aren't someone who would do that.

113
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,420
- I will drink it well. 
 - Ah yes, of course,  of course.

114
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,190
That's why I'm giving it to you.

115
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,890
- Ah, it was so good. 
 - Ah, I'm so full.

116
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,930
Then, today too... fighting! Fighting.

117
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,000
What is he doing here again?

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,830
I guess he heard the rumors.

119
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,380
That's why he should have treated us better before.

120
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,710
Yes, this is Sonó design office. Yes.

121
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,200
Nam Na Ri, you checked for the color differences on the fabric that's being re-ordered, right?

122
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,960
- Yes. 
 - I understand.

123
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,700
Team Leader. Team Leader, Team Leader!

124
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,960
- What are we going to do? 
 - What?

125
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,600
Ah, what happened now? Who was it?

126
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,080
- Nouvelle Vague. 
- What about Nouvelle Vague?

127
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,350
They want to interview our team leader!

128
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,700
- What? 
 - What? Are you serious?

129
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,210
Yes! They just called!

130
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,380
Isn't that awesome?

131
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,170
Are you sure? Are you sure it was Nouvelle Vague?

132
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,300
- What's going on? What is it this time? 
 - This is fantastic news!

133
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,900
I'm Nouvelle Vague's editor-in-chief, Kim Seo Hyun.

134
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,520
It's nice to meet you. I'm Ha Yeong Eun.

135
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,130
Congratulations. I heard that Lafayette responded positively.

136
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,520
Thank you.

137
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,060
Although it isn't the first time that a domestic brand has advanced into Lafayette,

138
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,720
I think Sonó is the first one that Olivier personally ordered from.

139
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,590
- Is that so? 
 - That's why I wanted to meet with you.

140
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:46,170
I wanted to interview you as the up-and-coming designer for our next month's issue.

141
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,120
It's a six page article.

142
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,320
For a domestic designer, you will be the first.

143
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,930
Of course, she has to do it!

144
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,170
- Then our clothes must get displayed next to the interview, right? 
 - Amazing!

145
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,240
It costs several million won to display one photo in a magazine like that!

146
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,870
To have our product be displayed on the cover...

147
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,420
- is that too much to wish for? 
 - Even if they say they can do it, we can't.

148
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,860
We would need to pay at least 100 or 200 million won for the cover.

149
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,610
Plus, I'm sure they have a year's worth of covers lined up already.

150
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,100
Then when they interview our Team Leader, can she wear our clothes?

151
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,790
- That would be so great! 
 - It would be amazing, right?

152
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,240
Even if magazines are out of season, since people will share the interview

153
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,330
from the online magazine on social media anyway,

154
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,690
it will have a huge promotional effect, right?

155
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,270
Wait a minute... on that note, my design will be displayed first.

156
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,950
Ah, there's no such thing. Let's play rock, paper, scissors.

157
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,880
You didn't do anything. You stay out of it.

158
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,960
- Then what should I do? 
 - Okay, rock, paper, scissors!

159
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,920
- Ah, what is this? 
 - You're out!

160
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,590
If it's not too burdensome and if the company asks us to do it, we will.

161
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,890
I don't think it'll be bad for Sonó either.

162
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,360
Why are you only mentioning this now?

163
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,920
Why?

164
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,560
I ate two cookies. What do I do about the carbs?

165
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,890
Am I swollen? Am I swollen?

166
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,590
Then I'll tell them to send us the questionnaire.

167
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,360
I approve for now.

168
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,020
There are no other requests?

169
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,640
They don't need an interview with the director?

170
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,610
If they do, I approve that too.

171
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,600
Tighten up.

172
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:26,210
Vice President Shin, when was it that I asked you to renew the contract with Sonó?

173
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,520
There's already another brand slated to enter in place of Sonó.

174
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,040
We can't break the promise now.

175
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,940
Promise.

176
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,540
If the circumstances or your feelings change, what breaks are promises.

177
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,100
- Senior Vice President. 
 - Look here, Vice President Shin.

178
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,600
Can you not do it or do you not want to?

179
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,710
If you care for the department store,

180
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,370
retain profits, not your pride.

181
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,800
That's what you have to do right now.

182
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,600
 Don't retract the termination letter. 

183
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,260
 We, Sonó, will not sell at The Hills. 

184
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,800
 It's not that The Hills is firing us, but we are cutting off The Hills. 

185
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,680
So Yeong, is this everything?

186
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,700
- Yes, I checked. 
 - Seon Joo, confirm it.

187
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,210
- Okay. 
 - Here.

188
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,770
So Yeong, make Chi Hyeong be in charge of the boxes exclusively.

189
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,070
He seemed to have so much energy when I saw him during the show.

190
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,160
Why am I always the only one who does the physical stuff?

191
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,450
I'm better with my head than body too.

192
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,610
She's the one with the strength.

193
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,880
Come on, let's get work done.

194
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,820
We have to prepare for the next season soon.

195
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,570
Time goes really fast, right?

196
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,160
Yeah, when I...

197
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,560
 If you type the word "person" (사람) quickly, 

198
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,730
 it becomes the word "life." (삶) 

199
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,960
 How did it go? 

200
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,510
 What is it? Did it not go well? 

201
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,630
 That little bastard. I told him to treat you well. 

202
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,900
 Two months. 

203
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:18,210
 He'd like to start a pop-up store at Galeries Lafayette for two months. 

204
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,650
 For me, a woman who bought my picture, that no one else glanced at, 

205
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,110
 changed my life.   
    

206
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,200
 Because of that, when I was about to give up on photography, 

207
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,210
 I didn't end up doing that. 

208
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:45,320
 The concept is urban secret garden.  

209
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,730
 For the highlight, special effects should go in, right?  

210
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,380
 Extravagantly without holding back.  

211
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,750
 That's because you're the only man in the world whom I can whine to.  

212
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,500
 As much as you want.  

213
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,440
 Perhaps meeting people 

214
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,930
 and loving them 

215
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,010
 is writing out your life. 

216
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,360
 2021 Work Order 

217
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,260
   

218
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,360
A meal?

219
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,740
Thinking about it, I don't think I've  ever properly bought you a meal.

220
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,090
I'm not that kind of person under any circumstance.

221
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,930
Let's do that. Where should we go?

222
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,410
We were going to make it?

223
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,450
I thought it would lack sincerity to show thanks

224
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,630
by taking you to a restaurant that we can go to at any time.

225
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,340
Do you know how to cook?

226
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,980
What's there that isn't found on the internet?

227
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,350
Hold it a bit higher.

228
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,070
A bit closer.

229
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,420
Is it onions next? Onions...

230
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,900
Move back now.

231
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,200
- You can come closer yourself. 
 - For about one minute.

232
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,260
A bit closer. A bit closer.

233
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,130
After heating up the pan.

234
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,760
Go back. Hurry. About 0.3 centimeters...

235
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,090
You are doing this on purpose, right? Why don't you hold it yourself, read it, and cook?

236
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,960
- What are you even saying right now? 
 - Why did I  smile saying that?

237
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,080
One millimeter makes a huge difference in clothing.

238
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,410
Isn't it wrong to just say "fry all these ingredients well"?

239
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,850
People who are meant to understand it will understand it.

240
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,290
I will do the dishes.

241
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,990
Of course.

242
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,270
You know, we could have made a simple dish like pasta.

243
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,310
A homemade meal is the hardest.

244
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,430
It was so that you can eat a homemade meal.

245
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,430
I opened the refrigerator earlier. There was just water, beer,

246
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,880
and containers of side dishes that I don't even know when you last opened them.

247
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,050
Oh, it's boiling. Open the lid.

248
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,890
Put in the sliced tofu.

249
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,430
Draw a half circle as you pour the sesame oil.

250
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,600
- Half circle. 
 - Not a full circle, but a half circle.

251
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,300
I understand.

252
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,350
I think you drew a full circle.

253
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,470
Quite a bit came out.

254
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,430
You will fix the recipe?

255
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,630
No, I was asking if there is something I can use to fix the recipe.

256
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,350
Oh, something to use?

257
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,400
There isn't.

258
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,350
It looks so good.

259
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,780
It looks good, right?

260
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,620
I'm hungry.

261
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,600
- You are hungry, right? 
 - Yes.

262
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,820
The soybean paste soup also looks good.

263
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,860
It'll be ridiculously amazing.

264
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,880
 Oh no, there's big trouble. 

265
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,050
 Leave this to me 

266
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,180
 and go over there to get that ready. 

267
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,920
 Okay, I got it. 

268
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,030
 Then, should I get started? 

269
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,630
 This dress is really pretty.  

270
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,780
 Thank you. 

271
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,100
 I, I, I will...  

272
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,220
 The pain will get worse and worse.  

273
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,060
 The cancer cells have spread to the nerves around the pancreas. 

274
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,150
 So the upper abdomen here will hurt a lot. 

275
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,350
Mom, take your medicine.

276
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,200
Gosh, why are you taking care of my medicine?

277
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,960
Dad does this as well.

278
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,160
You don't need to do this.

279
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,460
Ji Min, just watch the cartoon. I will do it.

280
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,560
The pain will subside.

281
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,870
It's okay. Watch the cartoon.

282
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,980
It's okay. Watch the cartoon.

283
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,250
It's been a while since I ate a solid homemade meal.

284
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,730
Does it suit your taste?

285
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,990
It's totally my style.

286
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,920
You can do it alone next time, right?

287
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:49,110
Since you practiced it once, make it at least once or twice a week and eat.

288
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,000
I will remember it well.

289
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,820
♫  The fuzzy world seen though eyeglasses  ♫

290
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,830
Wait a minute.

291
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,630
Yes, it's Yoon Jae Gook.

292
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,150
Yes, I will do that.

293
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,570
Yes.

294
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,030
Who is it? What are you going to do?

295
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,080
It's the real estate agent.

296
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:28,260
I was to use it only for two months while it stayed vacant.

297
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,120
But?

298
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,930
It seems that there is someone who wants to move in.

299
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:41,480
I'll have to move out next month.

300
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,990
But you will continue it until next month.

301
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,130
Yes.

302
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:02,430
♫  When the one star in my small room goes out  ♫

303
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:08,110
♫  Stay my shiny dreams  ♫

304
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,870
- Isn't it a bit spicy? 
 - It's not spicy at all.

305
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,960
It's delicious.

306
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,510
Should I try the soup first?

307
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,790
This one is the most delicious.

308
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,160
It's totally delicious.

309
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,430
You made it and you say it's delicious.

310
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,390
- It's delicious. 
- How do you cook so well?

311
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,500
- If you don't have anything else to do later on, you should open up a restaurant. 
 - Should I?

312
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,680
- I think it would be great. 
 - Then should I really open one?

313
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,210
Yes!

314
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,170
It looks delicious.

315
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,590
Let's see.

316
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,450
What about my meal?

317
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,360
We are strangers now. Why should I make food for another man?

318
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,550
You're pulling a power move over mere rice?

319
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,370
Mere rice? Then you make it and eat it.

320
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,160
I'll do it. I'll do it! You're so cheap. I will make it.

321
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,640
If I wash the rice and set it, the cooker will do everything. Aigoo...

322
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,200
Go ahead.

323
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,730
Aigoo...

324
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,080
You sure are being noisy for making rice.

325
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,230
Will you be able to eat before your seventieth birthday?

326
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,840
Yeah.

327
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,520
Let's go somewhere great and eat.

328
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,550
Try reserving at a nice place.

329
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,420
Call all of our classmates.

330
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,050
Yes, okay.

331
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,140
Where are all my socks? I don't have any to wear.

332
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,860
You were a teacher all your life,

333
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,230
so how can you forget everything that you learned last time?

334
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,800
We... are in the middle of a divorce.

335
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,200
Why are you asking another woman where your socks are?

336
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,480
Really? Are you going to be this unfair to me?

337
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,870
You were the one who said I had no rights to this house

338
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,430
because I didn't even earn 10 won.

339
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,410
Considering all of the times you mentioned how you earned money as your power move,

340
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,070
I didn't even get started!

341
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,340
What am I supposed to wear right now?

342
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,130
Should I let you borrow it? If so, it's 2,000 won.

343
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,080
One, two, three.

344
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,880
I heard that you are going to another brand.

345
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,000
Since they are removing Sonó, what can I do?

346
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,950
There was an opening at a foreign brand.

347
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,620
Thank you for everything.

348
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,330
Gosh, I can't believe they are removing a brand that's entering a Paris department store.

349
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,930
I'm so upset.

350
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,260
You are saddened too, right?

351
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,650
It's already been decided.

352
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,450
I don't want to hold on unnecessarily.

353
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:50,050
All right, I'll do my best until the shop is removed.

354
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,560
Okay, thank you.

355
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,150
Shall we look at it?

356
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:58,530
Pin it up here so it looks more casual.

357
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,800
- Yes, that much. 
 - Is that okay?

358
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,010
- Is this as tight as it can go around the waist in the back? 
 - Ah, the back? I'll pin it a bit more.

359
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,600
Yes, please pin it a little more.

360
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,850
Congratulations, Ha Yeong Eun.

361
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,320
I thought you were very reckless.

362
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,190
It was clearly an impossible task, yet you jumped into it.

363
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:25,180
Selling our clothes and getting our name out in foreign countries...

364
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,020
That's not why I did it.

365
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,980
We wanted to shatter the idea of it being impossible,

366
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,240
and we wanted to show the people who said it was impossible

367
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,830
that their fixed idea was wrong.

368
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,740
Do you think that you've succeeded?

369
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,300
Somewhat.

370
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:47,040
This outcome may not last long.

371
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,280
But still, you called me back.

372
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,360
We didn't have to voluntarily pay an increased commission

373
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,400
or come with our heads already bowed.

374
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,110
The Hills reached out to us first

375
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:02,170
and that is enough as a result of my risk taking.

376
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,190
If the outcome isn't good during the next season,

377
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,300
contract renewal will be brought up again.

378
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:13,450
Please take anything related to contract renewal officially to our business team.

379
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:23,730
Ha Yeong Eun, can you let Jae Gook go?

380
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,490
You said that you loved him.

381
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:31,990
If you love him, can you let him go?

382
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:43,960
The thing about love is that there isn't just one aspect.

383
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:51,280
And I believe that holding onto someone isn't the only way to continue to love.

384
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,700
Oh, Mi Sook.

385
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,290
 Ha Yeong Eun, are you busy today? 

386
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:19,140
I'm on my way back after checking the display at The Hills. Why?

387
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:25,150
My lovely friend, you should take the afternoon off and have fun with me.

388
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,790
Right now?

389
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,350
Jeon Mi Sook, you are too much.

390
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,310
You guys always play best friends without me,

391
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,680
so why did you call me first this time?

392
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,490
Chi Sook is getting bitter. You should start quickly.

393
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:49,380
Why are you making so much kimchi?

394
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,660
I can't make kimchi this fall.

395
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,910
I also made pickles, so don't forget them on your way out.

396
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,550
But you guys, would it actually be a little scary

397
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,020
to see my kimchi and pickles staring back at you

398
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,810
whenever you open the refrigerator after I'm gone?

399
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:13,160
- She says those words like it's nothing. 
 - Yup.

400
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,900
I have no regrets.

401
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,900
I washed winter blankets and left them to dry in the sun.

402
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,780
I made one container of kimchi for each of you. 
    

403
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:28,280
I received a lot of love while being alive, and I am loving back a lot as I leave.

404
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,350
With all  that, I think I lived an okay life, don't you?

405
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,640
It's Mi Sook's kimchi. What's the use in talking?

406
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,400
How great will it be this time?

407
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,370
Take a bite. See how it tastes.

408
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:43,390
How is it? Is it so delicious where you can't say anything?

409
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,840
Should I try it?

410
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,640
How is it? It's bland, isn't it?

411
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,830
I must've bought the wrong salted shrimp.

412
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,910
I kept adding it, but it's still bland.

413
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:03,000
No, no. It's not bland at all.

414
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,830
The doctor said that I might lose my taste due to hormonal changes.

415
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,480
No, it tastes good.

416
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,250
It tastes perfectly fine.

417
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,820
But who are you giving that to?

418
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,240
Just someone.

419
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,710
Do it quickly! Are you going to work all night?

420
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,990
How many heads of cabbage are you planning on using?

421
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:33,660
Yeah, she's happier because she's going to her grandmother's house instead of going to Taekwondo.

422
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,640
Don't worry about her and have fun with your friends since it has been a while.

423
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,250
Ji Min, say good night to Mom.

424
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,780
Mom, good night!

425
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,650
Okay, good night.

426
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,960
Cheers.

427
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,990
Man, spending time like this

428
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,390
makes it feel like we are on a field trip.

429
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:01,180
Your first love, our PE teacher, must be in his sixties by now.

430
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,720
Hey, he told me he would wait for me to graduate,

431
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,070
but then sent me a wedding invitation a month after.

432
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,150
It was a total betrayal.

433
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,820
That was my life's first breakup.

434
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,020
Life is all about farewells.

435
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,580
Living day by day is saying farewells day by day.

436
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,200
Ah, the dress shirt! What should I do?

437
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,390
Hey, should you be worrying about dress shirts right now?

438
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:31,760
If he doesn't have any, tell him go around naked! The  living will live on somehow.

439
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,550
Don't even worry about your husband.

440
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,870
I know... Those who are living must live.

441
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,730
But is she prettier than I am?

442
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,440
Who?

443
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,910
Assistant Manager Seo. Seo Min Gyeong.

444
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,370
Ah, Assistant Manager Seo?

445
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,150
Hey, what's pretty about her?

446
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,720
She's just a fox in hiding.

447
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,950
You knew about it?

448
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,660
Mi Sook...

449
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,870
Aigoo, forget it.

450
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,590
I'm fine.

451
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:21,660
I'm fine, so both of you... don't say anything.

452
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,580
Wow, really!

453
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:30,680
Hey! What do you mean by "don't say anything"?

454
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,690
I held it in thinking of you.

455
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:35,690
If it were up to me, I would rip him apart and it wouldn't satisfy enough.

456
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:40,040
How are you like this even though you already knew about it?

457
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,630
Are you Buddha? Are you a bodhisattva?

458
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:46,530
Soo Ho just turned 36.

459
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:49,290
His future is still promising.

460
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:52,920
Should I ask him to live just thinking of me after I'm gone?

461
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:59,880
Ah, you're right. It is upsetting.

462
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:03,420
But it's also a relief.

463
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,400
Because it's someone that I know.

464
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,040
Because she seems like a good person.

465
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,140
Hey, there's no need to look at me like that.

466
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,520
Those who are living must live. What can I do?

467
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,420
Hey, talk about yourself.

468
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:23,130
Tell me about your dating life. Is it going well?

469
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,080
Ah, seriously... I'm so upset.

470
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,430
What do you mean by that, Cookie?

471
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:59,310
Saying that you won't extend your contract with our Vision PR, what kind of unannounced farewell is this?

472
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,460
You said that I could terminate whenever I wanted,

473
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,040
so don't hold me legally responsible.

474
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,680
Why? Did someone ask to sign a contract with you?

475
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,030
Who is it? Where is it?

476
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,340
I got an offer from Paris.

477
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,800
What kind of offer?

478
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,510
The photography association there wants to hold an exhibition.

479
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:20,220
An exhibition? Really? Wow!

480
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,380
You are finally doing the exhibition that you wanted, huh?

481
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,320
So when are you starting the project?

482
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,330
No, when are you coming back after you are done?

483
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,540
Hey man, did you perhaps...?

484
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,070
I've decided to break up with that person.

485
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,950
Are you okay?

486
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,110
I'm not okay.

487
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,540
I'm saying so many farewells, Mi Sook.

488
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,820
My mother, my father,

489
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,040
and that person too.

490
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,410
It's okay.

491
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:20,030
I can endure everything.

492
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,320
But, Mi Sook,

493
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,020
how can I part ways with you?

494
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,150
How can I let you go?

495
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,160
How can I...

496
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,300
let you go alone?

497
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,720
Ah, you wench...

498
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,170
But I am also really afraid...

499
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:14,120
Yeong Eun, I am very, very afraid...

500
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:07,110
 I wouldn't have known if we didn't break up. 

501
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:12,330
 How precious these moments are. 

502
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:19,990
 How limited our time is. 

503
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,220
Aren't you going around a lot?

504
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,260
Since it's morning rush hour, there's probably a lot of traffic.

505
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,690
What if you are late?

506
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:39,230
- Then I'll just be late. 
 - What?

507
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,950
What are you doing today?

508
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,310
I'm planning to arrange my Paris schedule.

509
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,280
You are going to Paris?

510
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,040
Paris, Marseille, Nice, Alsace.

511
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,780
I got an offer to work on a project while traveling around the major cities.

512
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,550
You are going to all those places?

513
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,020
Just hearing about it makes me envious.

514
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,070
What about you?

515
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:18,190
Today, Nouvelle Vague said that they would send their questionnaire.

516
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:23,740
I'll be adjusting them and putting my house up for sale... Well, about that much.

517
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,810
Are you moving?

518
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
I'm planning to do so.

519
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:36,240
You can hang out with me in the evening, right?

520
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,430
I should set aside that time.

521
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,940
 As if nothing happened... 

522
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,200
 As if we are okay... 

523
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,850
 I am going out to face 

524
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,470
 a breakup. 

525
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,860
   

526
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,970
   

527
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,280
Team Leader.

528
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,030
Did you get the Nouvelle Vague questionnaire?

529
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,180
Yes.

530
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:22,780
Daebak! Is Sonó's name finally going into the Nouvelle Vague?

531
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:26,680
I'm so deeply moved, Team Leader.

532
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,660
But what's wrong?

533
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,580
Did something go wrong?

534
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:41,500
I will not participate in this interview.

535
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,370
I think you already know the reason.

536
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,970
I can't say ... What part did you not like about it?

537
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:54,700
"How did you feel when you were acknowledged by the world's trendsetter, Olivier?"

538
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,980
That is a general question that people want to know about.

539
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,500
"What do you think is the reason you were acknowledged by Olivier?"

540
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,050
It's a question that the subscribers would be curious about.

541
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:06,850
"Did you have Olivier in mind when advancing into Paris?"

542
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,130
Was that not it?

543
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,670
"Are you expecting a recruitment offer from Olivier?"

544
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,260
As would everyone.

545
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:16,430
There aren't any questions about Sonó.

546
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:20,370
You want to question me about how great a person Olivier is

547
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:24,750
and how much of an honor it was that he nodded once in approval.

548
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:30,290
I'm saying that I don't want to hop on a bandwagon to praise Olivier.

549
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,700
Even if I ask about Sonó,

550
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,800
what subscriber would be interested in that?

551
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,910
Nouvelle Vague only covers luxury brands, and that's our career.

552
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:43,410
And Sonó is like an innerwear that helps show off the luxury brand?

553
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:49,550
Or would you want to pay 6 million won per page, a total of 36 million won?

554
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:53,390
I am aware that you must be excited from the success of the buyers show.

555
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:56,920
But a chance that you may or may not have ever again in your life...

556
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,250
Are you just going to let it go?

557
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,420
What opportunity?

558
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:04,860
It's written in Korean on a magazine that Koreans read,

559
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,410
but we're throwing English words around since it's used globally

560
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:11,530
and standing as a side-kick to advertise another country's luxury brand. Is that an opportunity?

561
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:15,490
That's still the place for domestic brands right now.

562
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,820
Just because our place is in the back,

563
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,020
it doesn't mean our value is also in the back.

564
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:25,680
I don't want to bow down to be published in a magazine that doesn't recognize that.

565
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,620
Please excuse that I am leaving first.

566
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,110
What kind of person is Ha Yeong Eun?

567
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,850
A person that I envy?

568
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:55,120
There is a woman that you envy?

569
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,290
For a very long time.

570
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,080
But then again, I acknowledge her this time.

571
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,770
So you're saying that Shin Yoo Jeong acknowledges her...

572
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,440
I'm getting more and more curious.

573
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,840
   

574
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,740
Since the work I needed to do today was finished so quickly, I'm going to leave work right now.

575
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,150
What should I do?

576
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,840
I still have one more appointment.

577
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,650
Do it. I'll wait.

578
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,010
Hello, I made an appointment yesterday.

579
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,370
You said that you wanted to take a passport photo, right?

580
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,890
You can check your look before we start.

581
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,870
Turn your head just a little. 
    

582
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,930
Yes, good! One, two!

583
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:58,590
Lower your chin a bit. Yes, good.

584
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,790
 Your call could not be connected... 

585
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:06,690
What is this girl thinking?

586
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:10,590
You turned it down? Why?

587
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,600
 It's a global fashion magazine! 

588
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,140
 Other people spend their lives dreaming of this, so what are you doing? 

589
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,500
 Hey! Ha Yeong Eun! 

590
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:26,370
Yes, good. One, two, good!

591
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,680
One, two... yes, good.

592
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,780
 Mr. J, we hope to receive a call from you once you have reserved your plane ticket. (in French) 

593
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,650
 We are waiting for your response ASAP. (in French) 

594
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,180
 Hello? 

595
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,010
Hello, Assistant Manager Seo. This is Ji Min's mom.

596
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,250
Hello, madam.

597
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,550
You worked so hard taking care of Ji Min that day,

598
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:13,330
but I feel like I didn't thank you properly.

599
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,630
No need to thank me. It wasn't difficult at all.

600
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,790
Do you happen to buy and eat kimchi?

601
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:24,770
I made too much kimchi this time.

602
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:27,440
If it's all right with you, I was going to ask if you would share it with me.

603
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,990
Kimchi?

604
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:36,620
Then please send some through the senior manager.

605
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:40,700
Since he's someone who really doesn't like doing that kind of thing...

606
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,400
If it's not too much of a hassle, would you like to come over for a bit?

607
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,740
I would also like to have a cup of tea with you.

608
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,610
Okay.

609
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,810
   

610
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,420
My wife did?

611
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,580
Since she's giving it with good intentions, I couldn't say no.

612
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,450
I said that I would go.

613
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:20,080
She didn't say anything else?

614
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,050
Nothing else.

615
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,900
Since the pictures taken at the show have come out,

616
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,430
I'll deliver those at the same time.

617
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,650
Rejecting her would be stranger.

618
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,990
Don't talk about anything else.

619
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,030
Don't worry too much, Senior Manager.

620
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:51,050
The only employee who would ignore the director's message is you.

621
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:54,200
If you weren't my friend, I would just–

622
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,620
What the heck?

623
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,090
Why out of nowhere?

624
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:07,020
   
 Noona, how are you? 

625
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:11,790
 Noona, I can't forget you. 

626
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,830
Why are you telling me about your situation? Screw off.

627
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:20,820
   

628
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,330
CEO Seok, what are you doing?

629
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:30,720
 We want to appoint you as the honorary chairman. 

630
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,090
 What? Is that true? 

631
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:36,570
 Yes, ma'am. The board of directors... 

632
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:39,950
Goodness, either watch the drama or listen to music!

633
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:42,290
Just pick one. It's too loud!

634
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:47,020
It's the washing machine calling for you saying that your socks are done.

635
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,480
It's been over seven years since we bought that washing machine,

636
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,870
and you're only hearing it now?

637
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:55,950
I'm looking forward to seeing how that laundry turned out.

638
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:59,780
Turn out? All you have to do is put in water and detergent.

639
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:04,470
You didn't tell me I had to separate them first!

640
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:07,950
Do you study while mixing Korean and English books?

641
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,650
 Say something! 

642
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:14,510
 Being honorary chairman 

643
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:17,400
 and giving up all of your stocks... 

644
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,850
Since you're a smart teacher, figure it out on your own.

645
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:24,130
Is this a purple pattern or a white pattern?

646
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,710
Please tell me that at least.

647
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:28,420
Then will you give me this house?

648
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:32,370
Don't then! Don't tell me! Don't tell me!

649
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,560
Is it fun for you to punish me like this?

650
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,860
If this is punishment, have I been living while being punished for 40 years?

651
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:42,390
 I understand, but this isn't it. 

652
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:44,270
It's not a punishment.

653
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:46,640
This is your life from now on.

654
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,500
 I am your wife. 

655
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,370
What?

656
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:56,250
 Your inheritance is my inheritance. 

657
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:57,700
 My opinion... 

658
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,730
   

659
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:05,370
Noona! Noona!

660
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,070
Noona...

661
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,700
Have you not realized that I have been rejecting you?

662
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,970
I want to clear up your misunderstanding.

663
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:19,130
So soon? Why didn't you start next year?

664
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:21,090
From now on, that will never happen again.

665
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:24,710
My heart is so weak that I couldn't overlook a person with nowhere to go.

666
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:26,610
I'm not even curious anymore.

667
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:30,660
Noona, let's start again.

668
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,730
I heard that you have no work. Is that why you came?

669
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:36,230
I don't participate in worldly love like that.

670
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,550
How could love be that way?

671
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:40,590
How could something else get between us?

672
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:43,420
Are you shooting a movie alone? If you're done, I'm leaving.

673
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,590
Give me a chance.

674
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:49,010
I'll treat your wounded soul.

675
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:51,610
It's all healed. I have a man.

676
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,430
There's no way...

677
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,430
There's no way, you say?

678
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:57,130
Who are you?

679
00:46:58,110 --> 00:46:59,700
My boyfriend.

680
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,550
Since you've seen him yourself, I don't need to explain anymore, do I?

681
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:06,630
- Let's go, CEO Seok. 
 - Okay.

682
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:13,140
 He is a CEO? 

683
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:19,290
Tomorrow?

684
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:23,250
I've never had a chance to take photos of scenery like this.

685
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,160
I see...

686
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:29,720
But don't your legs hurt?

687
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,190
It seems like we have walked quite a lot.

688
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,090
When going home or to work,

689
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:39,630
I always passed by this road.

690
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:45,130
But... I think this is the first time I've tried walking it.

691
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:51,310
In the spring, I think of what will be trendy in the coming fall

692
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:53,780
and what I should make.

693
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:59,720
In the fall, I wonder if spring will come early next year, and what colors I should choose.

694
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:05,760
Doing that, I never once got to live through the actual seasons for myself.

695
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:16,410
I guess this season smells like this.

696
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:22,720
I'm glad that I have today as a memory.

697
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:30,070
On this day next year and the year after,

698
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:33,680
or on this day any year after, if I ever walk on a road like this,

699
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,960
I'll think of this.

700
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:44,450
Of today, of us.

701
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:10,050
Is Jae Gook late today?

702
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:13,650
He likely will be. He said he was going to the suburbs to take photos.

703
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,930
Is that right?

704
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,560
Wow, your cooking is just–

705
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,000
Does it suit your taste?

706
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,000
It must be nice to be Jae Gook.

707
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,950
Before leaving for Paris, he gets to eat his mother's cooking to his heart's content.

708
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:35,010
He's going... to Paris?

709
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,230
You didn't know?

710
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,460
Have a good shoot tomorrow.

711
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,480
I'm sorry that I can't leave for work with you.

712
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,190
If you have a shoot tomorrow, there must be a lot to prepare.

713
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,540
Hurry and go home.

714
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,990
After I watch you go inside first.

715
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,520
Let's go together tomorrow.

716
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,810
I want to be with you.

717
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:40,160
♫  Lean on me for a bit and close your eyes  ♫

718
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:45,290
♫  Don't worry about anything  ♫

719
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:54,130
♫  Don't look back on the days that have passed  ♫

720
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:58,880
♫  Let them go now  ♫

721
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:08,110
♫  Let's talk each night like we did today  ♫

722
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:10,590
- This is pretty. 
 - It is, right?

723
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:12,280
I think the background scenery is really pretty.

724
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,810
You take pictures well.

725
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:17,900
You took this well.

726
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:22,670
♫  When we are together, there are more things to laugh about  ♫

727
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:26,060
 I asked to break up first, 

728
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:31,710
 but I keep losing confidence. 

729
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:34,210
   

730
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,290
 It's not the end, Yeong Eun.  

731
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:48,150
 Even though they are not beside you, their memory remains. 

732
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,430
 Nobody can stay 

733
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,980
 by your side forever, Yeong Eun. 

734
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:05,030
♫  Fall asleep peacefully  ♫

735
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:17,420
   

736
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:20,930
   

737
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:23,650
I'm sorry. 
    

738
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,440
 The person you are trying to reach is not available. Your call has been forward to an automated voice message system. 

739
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,940
 Please leave a message after the tone. 

740
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:41,640
This is your first time drinking with me, right?

741
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,920
Yes, it is.

742
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,680
Since I have something to say, I asked to have a drink with you.

743
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:52,010
It is a secret as well.

744
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:54,000
If you mean, a secret...

745
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,360
Chi Sook also must not know about it.

746
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,720
After seeing you change Chi Sook,

747
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,470
I saw you in a different light.

748
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:05,560
Thank you.

749
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:12,580
So I'm planning to offer you a partnership with The One.

750
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:16,190
You had the capacity to hold a successful buyers show and advance Sonó to Paris.

751
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:19,970
I would like you to take over promotions for not just Sonó but also the men's clothing line

752
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:27,080
and all of the other brands under The One.

753
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,520
Are you sure?

754
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:33,140
Since marketing is your specialty, I will entrust it to you.

755
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:37,950
How about a 15% increase from our current contractual fees?

756
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:44,090
You are offering such a steep raise. Thank you.

757
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:46,400
- Here! 
 - Okay.

758
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:52,770
By the way, is it going well with Chi Sook?

759
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:57,180
I believe that she opened her heart fully to me.

760
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,800
Last time, I didn't have a car.

761
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:04,670
She personally came to my house and drove me to work.

762
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:07,470
I will support you from the back, so do your best.

763
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,460
Thank you!

764
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,950
Yes, come in.

765
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:12,990
The meal is coming in.

766
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:14,600
Yes, thank you.

767
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,020
I will pour you a cup.

768
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:24,530
Ah, yes.

769
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,900
You've worked hard.

770
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,860
   
   

771
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,370
Senior Manager, I think you need to come see this.

772
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,930
What is it?

773
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:03,390
An email just came from DPHP.

774
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,330
I'm sorry.

775
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:10,640
   
   

776
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:15,140
It's okay. Take the call.

777
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:19,830
Ah, yes. Then I will just check my company email.

778
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,630
   

779
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:29,800
 This is the email that came from Olivier just now.  

780
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,460
 It's regarding the recruitment of Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun.  

781
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,430
Recruitment?

782
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:41,620
 It seems that Olivier wants to officially recruit Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun, 

783
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:45,420
 and he is asking Vision PR to help with the process.  

784
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:49,690
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

785
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:51,320
This is so out of the blue, out of nowhere.

786
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,660
I'm saying that I'm the only man who truly loves you.

787
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:58,440
Other men? They just love your background.

788
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,740
 It's not "I love you," 

789
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:03,680
but "I love money."

790
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,430
Crazy guy. What are you talking about all of a sudden?

791
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:08,310
You aren't going to tell me directly?

792
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:10,390
How is your schedule tomorrow?

793
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:12,530
It's been a while, so I want to be alone with you.

794
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:14,550
This little...!

795
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,550
I will pour you a glass.

796
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:20,750
What do you mean by recruitment? Recruit whom?

797
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:22,480
Who is it?

798
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,080
Ah, you see, this is regarding my business affairs.

799
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:31,530
Does it perhaps involve our company as well?

800
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:34,560
Did someone ask you to poach someone from our company?

801
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,320
Who is it?

802
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,040
No... that's not it.

803
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,080
Is it Yeong Eun?!

804
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:57,170
Another day is passing.

805
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,190
When are you going to Paris?

806
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,850
Perhaps... soon.

807
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,160
A gift.

808
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,080
   

809
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,460
So you can use a new bag from now on.

810
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:51,440
It's a really good one.

811
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,170
I scrapped even my soul for it.

812
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,610
This isn't a farewell gift.

813
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:01,920
It's a gift to congratulate you on your new start.

814
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:07,570
I wish the best for the work you have in Paris.

815
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:12,390
You really... don't want to go with me?

816
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:21,790
I thought good-byes... hurt endlessly.

817
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:27,140
But during the last couple of days, I was very happy multiple times.

818
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:32,590
Perhaps breaking up might be a time given

819
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:37,170
to realize how much you love one another.

820
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:41,240
If perhaps we are given

821
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,490
a coincidence-like fate once again,

822
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,540
I won't make an excuse then.

823
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:55,400
I will insist that it is fate.

824
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,750
Okay.

825
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:01,590
When that happens,

826
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:05,170
make sure you do that.

850
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:02,620
 To be honest, I bought a plane ticket.  

851
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:05,440
 - When is it? 
- Jae Gook will go to Paris.  

852
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,450
 That's the correct choice for him. 

853
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:11,330
 Just once... I want to grab her just once. 

854
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:14,050
 If I don't, I'll go crazy. 

855
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:17,220
 This is Olivier's official offer. 

856
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:20,140
 I heard that you came up with the name Sonó yourself. 

857
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:21,590
 I didn't come up with it. 

858
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:24,170
 A no name photographer in Paris came up with it for me. 

859
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:28,340
 Sonó was started because of that no name photographer. 

860
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:29,830
 I will ask you once more.
