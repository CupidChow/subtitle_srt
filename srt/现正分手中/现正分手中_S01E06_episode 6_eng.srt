1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,980
   

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,200
   

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,940
   

4
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,200
   
   

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000


6
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,060
   

7
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,230
  You should change your background now. 

8
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,060
   

9
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,060
Like you said, the road I took a picture of 10 years ago

10
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,780
was vague and vast.

11
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,380
It was a road that left me confused.

12
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,280
But this road I'm on now is clear.

13
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,840
Where I should go. What's awaiting me at the end.

14
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,880
You were the one...

15
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,070
who took that picture?

16
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,910
   

17
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,770
  There was a time 

18
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,220
  when the uphill road felt like it would never end. 

19
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,420
  The days when I was on the brink of death due to exhaustion 

20
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,480
 and barely hanging on because of the fact that one should live. 

21
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,470
 Someone who understood without an explanation. 

22
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,880
♫  I've been doing well for a while  ♫

23
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,510
 Comfort given 

24
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,100
  by a stranger. 

25
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,750
 Good! Okay! 

26
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,390
 I'm not my brother. 

27
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,810
 And even if you make the same choices, the results might be different. 

28
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,230
  That person was saying Soo Wan was his older brother. 

29
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,890
 But I was asking myself, "What should I do with him?" 

30
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:03,770
♫  Both the season of youth and the warm wind  ♫

31
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:09,150
♫  Don't mean anything  ♫

32
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,840
♫  Because you're not here  ♫

33
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,780
♫  To clear my head  ♫

34
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,200
 I don't know how long it'll take, 

35
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,670
 but at least while we're breaking up, 

36
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,790
  let's love. 

37
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,730
♫  Without being aware, I'm here in front of your house  ♫

38
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,360
 Dad. 

39
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,750
 But do you two know each other? 

40
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,800
 - No. 
 - Yes. 

41
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,730
 - Excuse me. 
 - He asked. 

42
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:44,150
♫  The longing hurts more than breaking up  ♫

43
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,810
♫  It is just a day to endure  ♫

44
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,180
♫  The more time passes, the more it intensifies  ♫

45
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,720
♫  Love leaves. Why does only the farewell remain?  ♫

46
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,390
  The one who helped me endure these past 10 years. 

47
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,460
 The one who was by my side. 

48
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,770
  The one whom I was unaware of for 10 years. 

49
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,410
 All of the comfort received... 

50
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,930
 At each of those moments when I received comfort, the one who had been with me... 

51
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,640
It was you, Yoon Jae Gook?

52
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,190
♫  I couldn't let you go  ♫

53
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,160
♫  And I couldn't erase it  ♫

54
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,460
♫  One side of my chest just hurts  ♫

55
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,490
   

56
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:33,060
♫  Turning away again  ♫

57
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,460
♫  My departing footsteps are heavy  ♫ 
    

58
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,610
   

59
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,080
   

60
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,760
Are we playing spot the difference?

61
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,850
Even the hemline is the same. Only the length of the back split is different.

62
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,410
If we're doing this, what's the point of having two brands?

63
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,090
It must be a coincidence.

64
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,460
People tend to have the same ideas.

65
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,250
We need to ask for soundproof walls.

66
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,850
They must have heard our discussions while walking in and out.

67
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,420
Or it was leaked by the development office.

68
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,920
Even the fabric is the same.

69
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,950
We haven't even shared the design yet.

70
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,370
What on earth happened?

71
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,030
You did this, right?

72
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,330
What are you saying?

73
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,400
I saw something really interesting yesterday.

74
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,140
I was wondering why you stayed behind to work until it was so late.

75
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,040
Can you tell me in a way I can understand?

76
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,350
I get that you were trying to be transferred to a successful team.

77
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,430
But you shouldn't do that, don't you think?

78
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,690
Are you suspecting me right now?

79
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,220
I'm certain it's you.

80
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,850
It's not me. And what are you saying about my effort?

81
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,420
Why are you looking down on my effort? Who gave you the right?

82
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,940
Me? I'm the CEO's son.

83
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,650
Out of 80 applicants, I was the one who was hired.

84
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,480
From the application review to the three rounds of interviews,

85
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,050
I worked and worked so hard just to get to here.

86
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,840
What effort did you put in to get this job?

87
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,290
One word from the CEO.

88
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,470
That doesn't give you a right to doubt someone so rashly.

89
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,380
But you did something that deserves my suspicion.

90
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:13,710
I've never done anything that would sow doubt in the mind of someone like you.

91
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,400
Don't doubt me so rashly.

92
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,500
What are you going to do? I need to go report an update.

93
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,330
One of them is a copy, and I'm saying it isn't mine.

94
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,160
I know that you would never steal another's work even if there was a knife to your neck.

95
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,980
But what can I do?

96
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,910
Clair Marie is also my responsibility.

97
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,420
There is no way I can report that you two had the same idea.

98
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,910
What are you doing?

99
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,990
Clair Marie handed it in first. It's right to take their side.

100
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,660
- I won't acknowledge this. 
 - And if you don't?

101
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,470
We need to look at the CCTV footage.

102
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,420
What if it was really a spec sheet leak?

103
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,740
You won't be the only one receiving disciplinary action. I will too for bad management.

104
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,360
Responsibility must be taken if needed. That applies to you, too.

105
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,100
Even if it was leaked, you're responsible, too.

106
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,390
That means you weren't able to manage your team well.

107
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,040
Plus, you said you were confident.

108
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,660
You must have a lot of reference materials piled up over the 10 years.

109
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,930
Just choose one that sold well, make some alterations, and use that.

110
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,990
I can't do that.

111
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,800
Then what will we do?

112
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,840
Do you want to delay the season because of your stubbornness?

113
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,020
Will you form an investigation committee when we don't even have evidence

114
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,060
and give up on the S/S season because everyone is busy being questioned?

115
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,870
Bitch.

116
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,490
W-W-What did you say? I-I-I'm a—

117
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,100
Hey! I'm your boss!

118
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,110
That's right, you are my boss! So act like one!

119
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,830
You told me to win, but you're playing it like this? You're really a bitch.

120
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,970
You're pathetic.

121
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,020
O-O-Oh my. Hey!

122
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,420
Wow, seriously?

123
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,590
Wow, Team Leader Ha is really too sensitive.

124
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:54,290
Honestly, don't all creators have similar thoughts about trends and patterns?

125
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,290
Why is she this upset over a similar design that happened by chance?

126
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,160
Shut your mouth, In Na.

127
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,000
I've known Yeong Eun for 20 years.

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,750
I know for a fact that she would never do that.

129
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,010
Although I'm going to let it slide this time, if you pull something like this again...

130
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,440
I'll really become a bitch!

131
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,300
Got it?

132
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,640
Director. Director!

133
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,010
Make sure to provide a lot of promotion and marketing efforts.

134
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,410
Yes, sir.

135
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,430
I'm so busy preparing for the season. Why did you call me?

136
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,690
Spent the whole time together yesterday?

137
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,960
Who spent time with whom?

138
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,050
Secretary Kim said that you went to the exhibition and ate dinner together.

139
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,710
Ah. Yes, well.

140
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,640
But are you sure our families were close before?

141
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,780
What do you mean?

142
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,720
Well, you can't even distinguish between him and his brother.

143
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,610
That was only because I saw him occasionally when he was a child!

144
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,960
Anyway, if the company is going to grow, it needs distribution channels.

145
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,150
Make sure you meet him often and gradually get to know him better. Understand?

146
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,100
Why aren't you answering?

147
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,210
Yes, I understand.

148
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,570
Ah, you've answered.

149
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,840
What's the matter?

150
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,600
Oh, there's something you left at my place yesterday.

151
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,240
I think this is your scarf, Director Hwang.

152
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,570
Oh, that?

153
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,640
You can just keep it.

154
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,450
What? Your scarf?

155
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,760
What does that mean?

156
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,800
Well, I guess that we've taken a step further in our relationship?

157
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,590
And by a step, you mean?

158
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,650
That's all I mean.

159
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,200
You did me a favor yesterday,

160
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,120
and it's just a gift, so keep it.

161
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,760
A gift. To me?

162
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:05,050
♫  You and I, feels so right  ♫

163
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:09,000
♫  Heart on fire, feels so right  ♫

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,450
♫  When we're together they don't stand a chance  ♫

165
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,860
♫  The world is in our hands  ♫

166
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,410
♫  We light up like a trance (come pull me closer to you)  ♫

167
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,540
♫  And when we take the wheel we never crash  ♫

168
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,040
♫  We ride out like a flash  ♫

169
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,210
♫  Cause what we have is natural  ♫

170
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,690
♫  When we're together  ♫

171
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,890
♫  You and I, feels so right  ♫

172
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,500
♫  When we're together, hearts on fire  ♫

173
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,400
♫  Cause we got something natural  ♫

174
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,030
♫  You and I, feels so right  ♫

175
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,500
♫  Heart on fire  ♫

176
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,280
How did you find an artist from the UK?

177
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,080
You're the only one who doesn't acknowledge it, but I'm very capable.

178
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,970
I'll stop here with the paint and get started with the lettering now.

179
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,030
Okay! Sounds good.

180
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,290
Last year, when we opened the personal exhibit, the response was really good.

181
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,460
If we do a live show in Hongdae this time, I'm sure that many people will show up.

182
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,870
Oh, wow. This is a really good shot.

183
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,130
This is for the event brochure, so let's go with the intense shots.

184
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,390
- What's with this? 
 - It's nice, right?

185
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,840
Let's keep our distance.

186
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,790
It's a gift.

187
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:34,010
I mean, if someone is thankful, she can buy a meal next time or give a gift card.

188
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,920
But she discreetly left this behind.

189
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,220
That means she's sharing with me.

190
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,100
She's being so forward and boldly not hiding her feelings.

191
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,720
What do you think this is?

192
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,420
She must like you.

193
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,740
Right? That's the only conclusion you can make.

194
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,250
Who gave it to you?

195
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,440
There's someone. I got really close to her yesterday.

196
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,320
I guess I should earn a lot of money and move out.

197
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,300
You're so hard to understand.

198
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,570
- How so? 
 - It's not like you don't have money saved.

199
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,400
You say you want to earn more, yet you don't want to work for profitable fashion shows.

200
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,160
You don't even want to do photo shoots. Yet you jump at these opportunities.

201
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,130
What's the reason?

202
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,040
It's fun.

203
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,920
And there is something else fun today.

204
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,170
The fabric for Clair Marie was changed to tweed this morning.

205
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,110
I heard on my way here.

206
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,270
Isn't it fun since it changes so quickly?

207
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,560
Make sure you change your concept in good spirits.

208
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,960
  Na Ri, I think the gabardine and the tweed will both work,  

209
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,100
  but the gabardine has a heavy color,  

210
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,460
 so let's go with the tweed. 

211
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:35,720
  Ma'am, Ji Min did not bring her assignment notebook today. 

212
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,110
   

213
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,300
  I told you to sign Ji Min's assignment notebook and put it in her bag. 

214
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,100
It's not like she has just one or two notebooks. I put them all in.

215
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,920
Why do you always leave the socks like this? How many times have I told you?

216
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,470
Is it that hard to turn the socks inside out and put them in the washer?

217
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,530
"Is it that hard to turn the socks inside out and put them in the washer?"

218
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,530
I'm the one working, yet you told me to drop off the kid and throw the trash away.

219
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,180
What were you doing in that time?

220
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,320
I need to go into a meeting. Bye.

221
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,860
I'm sorry I didn't pick you up even though I told you I would.

222
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,450
- Did you wait for long? 
 - No.

223
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,920
Oh, one minute, Assistant Manager Seo.

224
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,610
Were you able to handle the brainstorming for The FallM?

225
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:33,030
I've been blaming myself for not being as competent as you are.

226
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,230
Should we go somewhere over the weekend?

227
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,220
Ideas usually come up when you relax.

228
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,030
Will things be okay back home?

229
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,150
Why are you bringing up my home at work?

230
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,220
Where should we go?

231
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,000
   
   

232
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,250
  I cried so much after the CT scan revealed that I'm at the last stage of pancreatic cancer. 

233
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,940
  Additional tests showed gastrointestinal tuberculosis, and I was able to recover completely. 

234
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,220
  My aunt was told by the university hospital she had a malignant tumor, but it later turned out to be a cyst. 

235
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,900
  The university hospital told me it was a malignant tumor, but it was a cyst when they opened me up for surgery. 

236
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,850
  The really flustering fact was that it wasn't cancer. 

237
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,390
  The problem was a mass in my small intestines. 

238
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,460
  Please make sure you get a PET-CT scan in addition to blood work. 

239
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,900
  You need to go to at least three hospitals. 

240
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,350
The design got leaked, but it's so quiet.

241
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,770
It's not even the first time it has happened. We have always just let it blow over and moved on.

242
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,700
Gosh, who leaked it?

243
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,820
Seon Joo, you really left right after I left, right?

244
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,920
Why are you being like this? I really left right after.

245
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,960
  Are you really going to let the atmosphere be like this? 

246
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,560
  You should come clean and aim for brighter days. 

247
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,720
What's with the atmosphere?

248
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,120
I know you're all upset, but it's more upsetting

249
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,460
if teamwork falls apart in addition to the leaked design.

250
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,310
I don't believe that anyone from our team would've done it.

251
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,760
Things already turned out this way.

252
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,220
What we can do is finish what we meant to do.

253
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,070
- Might as well do it brilliantly. 
 - Yes.

254
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,820
We don't have much time. We need to choose a new design.

255
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,270
I'll look into what fabrics we can secure.

256
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,500
Let's all stay strong.

257
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,750
Among the fabrics that were ordered and canceled by other companies,

258
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,470
are there any that we can use? I'd prefer a seven-gauge.

259
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,420
Everyone is using checkered fabric, so some of that is left.

260
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,610
We aren't planning on using checkered fabric.

261
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,020
There is a place that will get you what you need

262
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,210
if you also take what's left in their stock.

263
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,880
But the production department will not allow it.

264
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,280
What do we have left?

265
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,190
Jersey.

266
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:23,040
   

267
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,530
You should confess before the matter gets bigger.

268
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:33,140
What did you do yesterday at Team Leader Ha's desk?

269
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,600
- Why do I have to tell you that? 
 - Want me to reveal the CCTV footage?

270
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,590
If you're confident, then do it. But what if it wasn't me?

271
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,740
How are you going to take responsibility for misunderstanding me?

272
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,910
Why aren't you answering?

273
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,290
I guess the cameras didn't capture exactly what I was doing.

274
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:55,100
Is it fun making others suffer just because of your ambition?

275
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:01,020
Is it fun making someone a fool because of your doubt?

276
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,440
What are you doing here?

277
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,650
It would have been nice to know in advance.

278
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,160
Then I could have put more effort into my appearance before coming.

279
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,440
You already look great.

280
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,740
The scarf is so fancy that it catches my eye.

281
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,010
Then my gaze goes up, which is great.

282
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,980
I should have gifted it sooner.

283
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,230
Should we watch a movie together tonight?

284
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:06,080
As a token of gratitude for the scarf, I would like to give you something in return, so I'll buy the tickets.

285
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,500
It's too early to be thankful. My request has just started.

286
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,160
- What do you mean? 
 - Cookie's ruthlessly cold heart.

287
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,670
I'd like to know what would make it melt.

288
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,510
- You said you were dumped. 
 - I didn't agree to it.

289
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,950
- Then, what's with this? 
 - A sign of friendship.

290
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,310
When you said we took a step...

291
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,780
I meant that we took a step towards knowing the truth about each other.

292
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,950
Hey, Noona Sook.

293
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,440
Oh my, Pete! Oh, my god! It's been a while!

294
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,780
- Who's this? 
 - I heard you broke up with Jimmy.

295
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,370
The truth is that I was the one who dumped him. Tell people that if they ask.

296
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,310
But who's this? Your boyfriend?

297
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,540
No, just a friend.

298
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,180
Say hello. This is Vision PR's CEO Seok Do Hoon.

299
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,050
This is Pete, a rising model. He's a freelancer right now.

300
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,630
Yes, hello.

301
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,370
Nice to meet you. I'm Pete Park.

302
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,050
You have good style. Please contact me when you can.

303
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,650
What does this mean?

304
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,090
Well, it means I'd like to talk deeply with him separately.

305
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,120
  Oh, my! He's so straightforward. 

306
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,320
I'm sorry! I haven't been in the dating game for so long that I didn't catch on.

307
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,980
I should be going because of work.

308
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,990
I hope the two of you are able to share a deep talk.

309
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,400
You guys look good together.

310
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,260
We'll talk later.

311
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,720
- No. 
 - What?

312
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,900
You're making the wrong assumption.

313
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,150
That man is straight.

314
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,760
There's no way. He said women weren't his type.

315
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,860
Is that not so, CEO Seok?

316
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,600
Then this scarf was also because...?

317
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,750
Yes, well.

318
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,880
No... where...

319
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,050
CEO Seok!

320
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:14,270
Please tell me at which point I misunderstood and caused you to feel disappointed.

321
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:19,000
Why do you always judge and make your own assumptions about me as you want?

322
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,680
I apologize if I offended you.

323
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,530
I'm not offended by your misunderstanding.

324
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,290
I'm not prejudiced against it either.

325
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,230
Then why are you being like this?

326
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,820
Because my heart hurts.

327
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,430
You've never made the point

328
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:35,890
to look at me or get to know me.

329
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:39,100
But the fact that I had a different thought

330
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,940
makes me angry.

331
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,200
A different thought?

332
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,520
Never mind.

333
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,870
I'll get going.

334
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,700
So frustrating. Just tell me!

335
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:16,590
I am a man who has feelings

336
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,960
and a heart!

337
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,250
A man?

338
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,160
This artist was born in Korea,

339
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,580
but worked in Bristol and got famous.

340
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,590
You're a fashion photographer but also take pictures like these?

341
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,900
Look.

342
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,410
"I have nothing to lose."

343
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,340
I have nothing to lose.

344
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,030
"Guts over fear."

345
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,120
Guts over fear.

346
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,500
"Prends ces ailes cassées et apprends à voler." 
  (in French) 

347
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,730
Take these broken wings and learn how to fly.

348
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:05,030
The moment that these words are written upon an empty wall,

349
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,270
they start to have meaning.

350
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,370
It's similar to us.

351
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,600
Even though it may seem like a piece of clothing that will be discarded after a season,

352
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,410
we always try hard to create new meaning.

353
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:22,070
The same goes for humans.

354
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,620
Although it seems like we are just passing by,

355
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,900
to someone,

356
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,860
we may leave behind something special.

357
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,920
Because of that person,

358
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,420
your life can change as well.

359
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,460
For me,

360
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,570
a woman who bought my picture,

361
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,260
that no one else glanced at, changed my life.

362
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,690
Because of that, when I was about to give up on photography,

363
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,400
I didn't end up doing that.

364
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,280
Thanks to that picture,

365
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,860
I was able to hang on whenever things got hard.

366
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,790
Because of me.

367
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:03,910
That is how discerning my eyes are.

368
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,690
By the way, isn't charging 20 euros for a picture by an obscure artist too much?

369
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,010
I had to skip my meals to buy it.

370
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,820
Oh, it was 15 euros, but my friend charged 20 without knowing.

371
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,230
- Excuse me. 
 - It's too late for a refund.

372
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,970
Hold on.

373
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,380
   

374
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,160
What is it?

375
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,790
   

376
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,730
   

377
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,150
   

378
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:12,050
   
 (Take these broken wings and learn how to fly.) 

379
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,600
They took everyone from Lamong.

380
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,170
It is easier to work with the same people.

381
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,240
    
 This is why connections are so important.

382
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,540
Clair Marie is receiving a lot of support. 
    

383
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,220
- I'd love to go to Clair Marie. 
 - So Yeong isn't on here.

384
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,380
Hey, Ahn Seon Joo. What's going on here?

385
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,730
Am I the only one who doesn't understand?

386
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,370
- Let's work well. 
 - Yes.

387
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,090
What on earth happened?

388
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,330
Did the spec sheet walk out on its own or what?

389
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,370
I have no words even if they say they had the same idea.

390
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:54,200
This is just so dumbfounding, really.

391
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,710
I can't believe it.

392
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,550
It's unfair, but what can we do?

393
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,310
There's no way to prove it.

394
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,210
Let's just work.

395
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,080
Ahn Seon Joo, what's wrong?

396
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,060
- Hey, what are you doing? 
 - Let go.

397
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,770
- You should at least explain why you're acting like this! 
 - It was me.

398
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,770
What do you mean it was—

399
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,620
Yes, it was me! I did it.

400
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,640
I wanted to go to a successful team,

401
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,600
so I sent them the design!

402
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,550
You! You...!

403
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,690
Team Leader.

404
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,750
You! Is this really how you're going to do your job?

405
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,980
Everyone, leave.

406
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,700
What's the matter?

407
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,440
What brought you all the way to our workspace?

408
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,410
You took our factory and our fabric.

409
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,810
Fine, I will understand that since you have to win against the competition.

410
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,610
You shouldn't play with people though.

411
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,940
I can't even make offers?

412
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,310
All I did was present a possibility, and Ahn Seon Joo was the one who took it.

413
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,970
That's not an offer. You used her.

414
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,980
You weren't going to take her anyway.

415
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,820
Do you hire anyone who sends in a resume?

416
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,420
Ahn Seon Joo's skills were lacking.

417
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,250
Are you that insecure?

418
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,770
You don't have much confidence to win against me?

419
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,900
- What? 
 - Although you took everything,

420
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,830
you're still insecure and anxious.

421
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,020
No matter how you think about it, you don't have the confidence to win against me.

422
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,440
Excuse me, Team Leader Ha!

423
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,910
Don't just design clothes. You need to design your heart, too.

424
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,870
Greed, insecurity, playing both sides, and betrayal.

425
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:07,950
Hey. With those things, will you be able to produce pretty and well-made clothes

426
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,870
when what is in your heart will come out through your hands?

427
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,280
Will you stop speaking so rashly?

428
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,780
Bother my team again

429
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,140
and I'll file a civil case against you no matter how many years it takes

430
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,270
so that you won't be able to make clothes ever again.

431
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,970
What are you doing? If you called me out here, you should talk.

432
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,360
Well, I was curious.

433
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,400
Just what did you do at Team Leader Ha's desk?

434
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,570
Team Leader's sketchbook.

435
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,830
  Would you like to use this as reference material? 

436
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,570
 When I was your age, I drew these for my graduation project. 

437
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,550
The team leader told me

438
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:10,250
that I could take a look at it whenever I had artist's block.

439
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,430
So, when I'm alone, I want to look at it to study.

440
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:15,150
Why would you look at it by yourself late at night?

441
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,490
I don't want to get caught.

442
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:21,940
I lack a lot of skills and don't have great ideas.

443
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,270
I'm not naturally talented, so I take more time than others,

444
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:28,340
which means people will think I don't have the skills and I won't be recognized.

445
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,420
But isn't it better to be honest than to be misunderstood like this?

446
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,220
Misunderstandings will clear up one day,

447
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,410
but lacking in skills becomes a judgment against me.

448
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,390
One by one, those all stack up and become my future.

449
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:46,490
Although for you, as the CEO's son, how skilled you are or what others say

450
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,190
will not matter at all.

451
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,580
- It's the team leader. 
 - Fabric sample room?

452
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:11,080
Ahn Seon Joo, she wants you to come too.

453
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,010
It's jersey.

454
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,850
What are you going to do with this?

455
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,390
A collab.

456
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,050
A collab? With who?

457
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,990
With them.

458
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,970
   

459
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,690
With jersey?

460
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,600
It's worn for comfort as innerwear. Wouldn't it be too ordinary?

461
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,810
You can say it's ordinary, but I would say it has a lot of potential.

462
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:46,700
Coco Chanel made outerwear using jersey which was previously only used for innerwear.

463
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,120
What about the main design?

464
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,170
We'll go with the shirt dress that So Yeong designed.

465
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:02,830
Among the designs that didn't get sent to Clair Marie, this is the one I like most.

466
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,630
How do you all feel about it?

467
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,900
I like it.

468
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,790
I don't think it's a bad idea either.

469
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:12,120
What about you, Seon Joo? Why aren't you saying anything?

470
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,600
You don't want to work anymore?

471
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,950
No, that's not it.

472
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:20,150
It's just that... I don't think I should be at Sonó any longer.

473
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:23,600
Even if you leave, you should apologize properly before you do.

474
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,270
I'm sorry.

475
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,860
Not to me, but to your coworkers.

476
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,630
Your seniors and juniors... You knew how we all wanted to do well.

477
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,460
How excited we were.

478
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,770
So see exactly what your greed caused

479
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,080
and properly apologize.

480
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,900
Don't just apologize with words. Show us with your results.

481
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,910
Design diligently and finish the season properly.

482
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,220
Then officially apologize to everyone.

483
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,050
I'm not giving you a chance. I'm telling you to apologize.

484
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:58,540
Whether your apology is accepted or not is up to your coworkers.

485
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,340
Why aren't you saying anything?

486
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,720
Team Leader is asking you what you think about So Yeong's design.

487
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,660
I like it too.

488
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,950
It's unanimous, Team Leader.

489
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,110
All right, we'll divide up the work now and start recruiting influencers.

490
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:27,490
Na Ri, contact Im Soo Ah. Seon Joo can contact Park Ha Mi.

491
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,930
I'll contact Ahn Hae Rang as well.

492
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,930
And who else is popular nowadays?

493
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,990
I know someone too.

494
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,000
    
   

495
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,800
   

496
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,060
What's with these looks?

497
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,730
You don't believe me?

498
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,570
Excuse me, I'm pretty popular in that field.

499
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:57,340
I don't know if you're popular or not, but I know Hye Rin will never do it.

500
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,550
Let's start with recruiting the influencers we mentioned before.

501
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,160
Okay.

502
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,840
Can you really recruit Hye Rin?

503
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,860
Why do you ask?

504
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,210
If you do, I'll overlook how you've wronged me.

505
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:24,670
As you requested, the CT, MRI, PET-CT,

506
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,440
and the blood work were all done.

507
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,090
You see this on the screen?

508
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,660
It is correct that it is pancreatic cancer.

509
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:42,980
There's no possibility of the device being faulty or it being a misdiagnosis?

510
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,760
No, there isn't.

511
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,790
You should get hospitalized as soon as possible and get treatment.

512
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,470
I'm going to go crazy.

513
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,770
   

514
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,880
   
   
   

515
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,950
I love you!

516
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:06,030
Look here please!

517
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,320
Thank you.

518
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,830
   
   

519
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,670
Hi, Hye Rin.

520
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,940
All right, Secretary Choi.

521
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,540
Yes, good work.

522
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,430
The food will come out soon. Drink a bit slower.

523
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,950
How refreshing.

524
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,280
Did the estimates come out to be a lot?

525
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,780
The hood of the car needs to be straightened out, the bumper needs to be replaced,

526
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,070
and oh, the engine oil needs changing.

527
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,850
You should've asked them for a discount.

528
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,340
I'll take care of it.

529
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:50,320
But you're drinking that beer well for someone who crashed her car.

530
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,530
Why? It's fun.

531
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:56,700
Got just the two of us hanging out like this.

532
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,520
Your positivity is no joke.

533
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,800
But why did you call me instead of Yeong Eun?

534
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,520
Did you two fight?

535
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,980
Yeong Eun is busy.

536
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,200
You took their fabric, factory, and design.

537
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,620
Would she have any sanity right now?

538
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,370
Wow, did she tattletale about all of that?

539
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:18,620
And what else? What else did I do?

540
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,060
Hey, did she even tell you how she cursed me out?

541
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,490
That's why

542
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:27,170
you should treat her better.

543
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,400
She's the only friend you have.

544
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,930
Why is she my only friend? I have two including you.

545
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:43,260
Yes, you have two for now.

546
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,240
What's with you?

547
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,880
Soo Ho, did you do something wrong?

548
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,780
Me? No.

549
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,650
I'm innocent in every way.

550
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,970
But she showed up here unconscious, which she's never done before.

551
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,990
She started drinking a lot since early in the evening.

552
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,040
It must be one of those days.

553
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,400
 Can you just tell her to come home before Ji Min goes to preschool? 

554
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,790
What's the matter with her?

555
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,530
You haven't heard anything?

556
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,980
She was drinking happily after crashing her car.

557
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,550
She said she doesn't want to see her kid or her husband.

558
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:43,280
She didn't want to go home and wouldn't let me go saying "let's have one more glass."

559
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,790
What on earth is the matter?

560
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,240
There must be a woman.

561
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,760
Soo Ho wouldn't do that.

562
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,540
Ha Yeong Eun, you don't know men at all. Hey, men are...

563
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,320
  I am a man who has feelings 

564
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,640
 and a heart! 

565
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,780
Anyway, you didn't watch "The World of the Married"?

566
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,280
He cheated on his wife, but in front of her,

567
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,210
he said, "Loving isn't a sin!"

568
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,680
That's how men are.

569
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,430
Yeong Eun, you have alcohol, right?

570
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,730
Let's go for a second round.

571
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,010
   

572
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,880
   

573
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:00,520
Sorry for bothering you so late.

574
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:05,060
If I'm going to report the fraud, I need to send the bank transfer statement

575
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,280
and the text messages sent between me and the travel agency.

576
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,550
But I don't know how to do these types of things.

577
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:16,740
I would ask my daughter, but I'd have to tell her how much money I lost.

578
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,700
I don't want to make her worry for nothing.

579
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:24,010
- I see. Well, if you want to take a screenshot, 
 - Yes.

580
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,020
- you have to click here. 
 - This?

581
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,790
- Yes. Click that. 
 - This?

582
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,070
Yes, that's right.

583
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,190
What's this confirm thing?

584
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,220
You have to click that for it to save.

585
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,920
There you go.

586
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,260
Oh, it worked.

587
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,210
You're a photographer?

588
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,920
Pardon? Ah, yes.

589
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,470
Where's your photo studio?

590
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,080
I don't have one yet.

591
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,360
I just take photos wherever people call for me.

592
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,190
A freelancer?

593
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,590
Yes.

594
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,450
That's a temporary position.

595
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,270
Ah, well I guess.

596
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,250
Are you free on the Monday after next?

597
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,320
Do the police need testimony?

598
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,550
Do you want to try a part-time job?

599
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,640
Pardon?

600
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,050
There is a photographer we use during a sports event,

601
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,290
but there's a special event being held that day.

602
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,780
I was thinking about recommending you.

603
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:27,430
I have a right to some opinion on that matter since I'm the school's vice principal.

604
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,250
 Do you have time tomorrow? 

605
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,850
 - Do you want a part-time gig? 
 - A what? 

606
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:35,690
 I'm a designer at The One. 

607
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,790
Ah, but we won't be able to pay you much. You know how school budgets are.

608
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,700
Yes, I understand. Let me know when you know the time.

609
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,770
Will you really?

610
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,080
Okay, okay.

611
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,470
Oh, thanks for this.

612
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,710
And, if you slide it like this, it'll also take a screenshot.

613
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,720
Oh, really?

614
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,450
He has a woman. I have a hunch.

615
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,230
Find out about your husband.

616
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:09,360
Hey. I wouldn't have worries in my life if he had the skills to do something like that.

617
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:20,120
How come you won't even ask?

618
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,620
About what?

619
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:25,370
I took everything. Your factory, fabric, and design.

620
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:28,070
You haven't even asked me why.

621
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,940
Why are you doing it?

622
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,940
Mr. J.

623
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,320
You like him, right?

624
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:39,630
Ever since Busan, you've had something going on with him.

625
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:43,220
How could you not tell me anything and pretend like there is nothing?

626
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:47,290
What if I told you? What would that change?

627
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:50,170
Well, nothing would change since I like him.

628
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:54,900
But, if we're friends, shouldn't you have told me?

629
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,590
Anyway, forget it.

630
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:01,380
I didn't know then, so I let it go.

631
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,190
But I know now, so don't interfere anymore.

632
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,910
Look at this nonsense. Hey.

633
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:10,820
Liking him is her own personal matter. Who are you to order her around?

634
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,610
She already has a lot on her mind.

635
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,660
You should try to understand my feelings like that.

636
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,210
Why would she have a lot on her mind?

637
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:26,120
What's this? What's with the mood?

638
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,890
What is it?

639
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:30,670
Oh, am I the only one who doesn't know again?

640
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:35,380
What is it? What is it, you wenches?

641
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,290
Yoon Jae Gook...

642
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:41,020
is Soo Wan's younger brother.

643
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,420
Soo Wan? Who's that?

644
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,090
Oh my.

645
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,660
Then... Cookie's older brother who died 10 years ago is...

646
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,560
Yeong Eun.

647
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,180
Your fate is something else.

648
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,030
Seriously.

649
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,150
Hey, what is there to contemplate?

650
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,700
Nothing's impossible.

651
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,070
If you want to sleep with him, do it.

652
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:19,230
And you, don't call dibs.

653
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:23,310
You wenches.

654
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:29,490
Life is disgustingly short.

655
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,080
Are you asleep?

656
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:12,830
Should I

657
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:18,010
really just do it?

658
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,240
Even if Soo Wan is...

659
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:27,130
So what if he's Soo Wan brother? Who cares?

660
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,820
Should I just be like that?

661
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,190
   

662
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:04,700
  You should change your background now. 

663
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:13,990
   

664
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:16,010
   

665
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,620
   

666
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,100
Were you asleep?

667
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:40,230
I just... wanted to hear your voice, so I called.

668
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,590
I shouldn't have called. Rest well.

669
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:57,920
Can we meet right now?

670
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,230
I...

671
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,670
miss you right now.

672
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:31,190
♫  Forget all the painful days  ♫

673
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:37,990
♫  Just stay there just the way you are  ♫

674
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:45,050
♫  Looking at you from a distance, I pray every day  ♫

675
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:51,020
♫  I only hope to look at you without anyone knowing  ♫

676
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:54,330
- Why are you smiling so much? 
 - Because I'm happy.

677
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,360
Because you called for me.

678
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:02,350
  Our relationship, which started 10 years ago... 

679
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:05,770
  Let's say we're in the middle of breaking up right now. 

680
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,920
All right, let's say that.

681
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:17,920
Let's break up.

682
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:23,170
I know

683
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,000
where this road leads now.

684
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,660
 But at least while we're breaking up, 

685
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,250
 let's love. 

686
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:44,830
Good moments will pass by so quickly.

687
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:50,180
You might grow tired of me.

688
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:53,630
You might get annoyed by me.

689
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:58,630
You might regret this choice, but...

690
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,040
Let's please do it.

691
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,770
Even if it's that, let's try it.

692
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:08,470
You and I,

693
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,770
even if it's that, let's try it.

694
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,880
Alright. Let's do it.

695
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:24,960
♫  I'm sure one day you will embrace me  ♫

696
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:32,070
♫  Please don't go farther away  ♫

697
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,900
Team Leader Ha! Stop it right now. Stop!

698
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,490
What are you doing with the factory that screwed us over with copies?

699
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:08,790
Are you all in your right minds?

700
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:12,110
The only factory that can make the deadline and guarantee quality

701
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:13,990
is Chief Choi's factory.

702
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:17,340
It was the reasonable choice out of the possibilities.

703
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:18,880
What if another issue occurs?

704
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,900
Are you planning on ruining the S/S season?

705
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,650
This won't do. You know you can't work with a factory that the production department disapproved.

706
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:27,830
I won't approve it. Never!

707
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:30,020
Chief, it is one of the factories you personally selected.

708
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,040
When did I ever—

709
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:35,570
Do that?

710
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:39,130
- That day, you made and gave me the list yourself. 
 - I did?

711
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,520
But it was one of the blacklisted factories?

712
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,140
Why did you include it on the list then?

713
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,440
I did?

714
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,480
 How much longer will this take? 

715
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,270
 Seven minutes? No, five minutes. 

716
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:51,150
   

717
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:54,490
There's no problem, right, Chief?

718
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:57,410
What? Ah, yes, of course.

719
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:00,200
There's no problem at all.

720
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,580
This too.

721
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:10,810
Space! Space it out properly!

722
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:12,400
Yes, sir.

723
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,980
Sir, the artists need to have their own pin light.

724
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:18,940
Camera #1. Okay.

725
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,030
Assistant Manager Seo, what about the models?

726
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:23,970
- I told them to be finished in 15 minutes. I'll check. 
 - Yes.

727
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:25,800
Seon Joo, bring a bigger one.

728
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,320
- Let's check the order. 
 - Her order changed.

729
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,540
Hye Rin will be...

730
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,950
The third one.

731
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:42,140
   

732
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:46,630
Hye Rin! We meet again at Sonó like this.

733
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,210
Why? You must not be that happy to see me.

734
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:52,890
Oh, there's no way.

735
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:57,660
I'm just curious about the amazing turning point

736
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,950
where you changed your mind.

737
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,160
 - You came because you needed me? 
 - Yes. 

738
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,720
  - I have my conditions. 
 - Of course. 

739
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,640
  I knew you wouldn't just agree. 

740
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,580
  From now on, pick up my calls within three rings. 

741
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:13,440
 If I tell you to come out, you need to come out within 30 minutes, 

742
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,560
 no matter where it is or what time it is. 

743
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,380
  For how long? Would a week suffice? 

744
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,760
 A hundred days. That's the number of nights 

745
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,770
 I felt embarrassed after you dumped me. 

746
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:25,980
  You'll get too used to me again. 

747
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,350
 Six months then? 

748
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:30,300
 A hundred days then. Okay? 

749
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:34,350
One, two, three.

750
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:37,530
- He's not picking up? 
 - Yes, Hye Rin?

751
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:38,690
You're a bit late.

752
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,330
I came  directly instead.

753
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:43,430
I did two things at once. Cut me some slack.

754
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,780
- What are you doing after? 
 - Eating dinner with my team.

755
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,770
Let's have dinner.

756
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,450
Okay.

757
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:54,060
- You're not doing this side? 
 - I will.

758
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,410
This is Clair Marie's lookbook draft.

759
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:01,390
If you select a few photos, we'll edit and use them as the homepage banner.

760
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,910
How's it going with Sonó?

761
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:05,420
There will be a live broadcast online today.

762
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,460
For now, it'll be posted on Hye Rin's social media,

763
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:10,550
and we are planning on receiving 70 pre-orders on a first-come, first-served basis.

764
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:13,990
As expected, Team Leader Ha knows how to run a business.

765
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:15,940
It'll start soon.

766
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,690
   

767
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:34,700
   

768
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:38,080
   

769
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,550
   
   

770
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:51,010
Coloring the streets with art and words.

771
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:55,770
Introducing the graffiti artist, A Flow.

772
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:59,630
   

773
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,910
 Because it's a dress without a particular characteristic or signature, it can become anything. 

774
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,520
 It'll be easy to layer up. 

775
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,450
  If we add a coat, it becomes innerwear. 

776
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:51,700
 If we unbutton it and wear something on the inside, it becomes outerwear. 

777
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,420
  They will spray it directly on our clothes, right? 

778
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:56,540
  Yes. It'll become a one of a kind artwork. 

779
00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:01,550
  On top of that, the background pictures on stage will be Mr. J's work? 

780
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:03,690
  Clair Marie might get a little jealous. 

781
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:06,140
  They should feel a little pain. 

782
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:27,090
   
   

783
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,070
Should we turn it off?

784
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,980
Just let it be.

785
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:45,760
Aren't those your photographs?

786
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,630
How are they? Are they acceptable, Noona?

787
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:52,240
These are the pictures you took for the exhibit.

788
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:57,580
I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to present it earlier for promotional purposes.

789
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,900
Ha Yeong Eun convinced you to?

790
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,600
I was the one who brought it up.

791
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,310
Jae Gook, what exactly are you planning to do?

792
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:06,780
How far do you think you'll be able to go?

793
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,670
I don't think that far ahead.

794
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:13,670
Right now, we're just going to think about what we can do at the moment.

795
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,370
   
   

796
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:37,870
The lights look great right now.

797
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:39,790
We have a lot of viewers.

798
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,620
Good.

799
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,470
   
   

800
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:12,160
Manager Nam, how's the situation?

801
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:16,690
No way! Within 2 seconds, 70 pieces have been sold out!

802
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:18,990
Preorders are at 20,000! 20,000!

803
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:21,630
The store managers are all for it, too!

804
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:25,290
The number of viewers is surpassing 70,000!

805
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:27,720
This kind of scale means this is a total success!

806
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,650
This is a total success!

807
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:33,840
Congratulations!

808
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,030
You've worked hard.

809
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,320
Thank you.

810
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,410
Good work.

811
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,330
Wow!

812
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:51,040
   
 (Take these broken wings and learn how to fly.) 

813
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,830
   

814
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:03,220
  This is going to make everyone miserable. 

815
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:07,440
   
 Your feelings for that woman are just a momentary phase. 

816
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,160
  It's just an impulsive feeling that will disappear soon. 

817
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,350
  - Yoo Jeong. 
 - Your family and your mother's expectations. 

818
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:14,990
  The gazes of those around you. 

819
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:19,520
  Can you just throw all of that away for a two-month long passion? 

820
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:26,550
  I can't just sit here 

821
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:30,020
  and watch that woman ruin you. 

822
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:33,680
  That's... my love. 

823
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:54,420
  Thank you. It's thanks to you. 

824
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,510
 I miss you. 

825
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,080
 I miss you too. 

826
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:18,560
Cheers!

827
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,210
Good work, all!

828
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:23,200
Cheers.

829
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:28,670
I'll get it.

830
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:30,980
Sounds good.

831
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:34,630
Alright, one more! To Sonó and the Vision PR family!

832
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:37,950
Thank you! You're all the best! Cheers!

833
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:42,530
Cheers!

834
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:45,160
Cheers to you!

835
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:50,740
   

836
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:56,940
   

837
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:05,050


838
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:10,330
   

839
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:16,060
♫  I've been doing well for a while  ♫

840
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:23,880
♫  I haven't been upset at all  ♫

841
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,900
♫  The songs you and I used to listen to  ♫

842
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:32,320
   Have you been well?  
 ♫  Somehow sound sadder  ♫

843
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:38,490
♫  So I don't even listen to music  ♫

844
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:46,620
♫  Both the season of youth and the warm wind  ♫

845
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:52,010
♫  Don't mean anything  ♫

846
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:55,610
♫  Because you're not here  ♫

847
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:59,590
♫  To clear my head  ♫

848
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:06,650
♫  When I keep aimlessly wandering the streets  ♫

849
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:15,220
♫  Without being aware, I'm here in front of your house  ♫

850
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:23,390
♫  Should I call you  ♫

851
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:31,420
♫  After looking for your name with trembling hands  ♫

852
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:34,820
♫  I put the phone back down repeatedly  ♫

853
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:37,910
   

854
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:39,260
 Tell me about yourself. 

855
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:43,220
 I heard you told your mom you were seeing someone. What kind of person is she? 

856
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:46,070
 A good person. She's also a person that I really like. 

857
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:47,890
   
 Of all the times, why now? 

858
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:52,290
  I've been close family friends with Jae Gook for a long time. 

859
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:54,690
 Oh, with Soo Wan too. 

860
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:58,770
 He's Jae Gook's older brother. He died in a car accident ten years ago. 

861
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:01,500
 It poured that day. 

862
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,590
 He went out to meet someone. 

863
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:04,990
  Who is Shin Yoo Jeong? 

864
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:08,350
 How do you two know each other? 

865
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:11,640
 Since when did you start liking me? 

866
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,020
  Oh, again. 

867
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,190
 Who is this guy? 

868
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:18,960
 I think Father's got a hunch. 

869
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,990
 What are you going to do about Yoon Jae Gook? 

870
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:25,990
   - What do you mean? 
 - I got a call from Soo Wan. 

871
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:28,990
 Up to what point is it okay to love, 

872
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:33,260
 and at what point does it become not okay? 

873
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:38,050
♫  It is just a day to endure  ♫

874
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:41,280
♫  The more time passes, the more it intensifies  ♫

875
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,800
♫  Love leaves. Why does only the farewell remain?  ♫
