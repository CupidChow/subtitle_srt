1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:06,310
   

2
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,160
   

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,820
   

4
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,240
   
   

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:33,020


6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,280
   

7
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,760
   

8
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,280
 Designers design four times a year. 

9
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,400
   
   

10
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,950
- We're finished. 
- Come this way.

11
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,390
 Everyone wants a classic that will be remembered for eternity, 

12
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,970
 but trends are momentary. 

13
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,930
It's time to get ready!

14
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,960
- So Yeong, get ready. 
 - Okay!

15
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,120
 In the end, there is only one thing that will never change: the fact that nothing is eternal. 

16
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:10,920
Welcome to the first ever K Fashion Week in Busan!

17
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:24,250
Let's all celebrate this grand opening of a new beginning tonight!

18
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,010
Are you ready?

19
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,630
 We should grab onto this moment and enjoy it. 

20
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:46,910
 Because this too is momentary and will never come back. 

21
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,910
Can you tell me your name? 
  (in French) 

22
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,930
What for? 
  (in French) 

23
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,080
I don't know what to call you when we meet again. 
  (in French) 

24
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,000
That won't happen. 
  (in French) 

25
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,660
After Fashion Week, neither you nor I will be here. 
  (in French) 

26
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,200
Have a safe trip back to Paris. 
  (in French) 

27
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,010
   

28
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:13,510
   

29
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,520
   

30
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,050
   

31
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,910
Wow. There are so many models at this airport.

32
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,170
It's crowded.

33
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,690
There's a Dior, Chanel, and Givenchy show in Korea. Is this for real?

34
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,520
Of course! Korea is the hottest market in Asia now.

35
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,010
Who would have expected a K-pop song to top the Billboard chart?

36
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,940
- Sunbae-nim  (senior) . 
 - It's nice to see you!

37
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,810
But I didn't know that even Olivier is having a show here.

38
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,940
My point exactly. He is snobby and used to say, "If you want to see my show, come to Paris."

39
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,880
Now, now. K-pop, K-beauty, K-drama.

40
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,190
Everything becomes hot when the letter "K" is added these days.

41
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,350
Fashion is no exception.

42
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,450
Also, money is necessary if he wants to keep being a snob.

43
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:26,760
Which means he can no longer ignore the Asian Market.

44
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,910
Anyway, it's so nice to not have to take long distance flights.

45
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,200
Ah, in order to land deals with popular celebrities,

46
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,990
we must land a sponsorship with Olivier in any way possible.

47
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,600
- Fighting, Sunbae. 
 - Okay.

48
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,230
Work hard.

49
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,910
- We're leaving then. 
 - Okay, take it easy.

50
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,730
Is there any new information? Like what he needs or stuff like that?

51
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,830
At the moment...  (in French)  
    

52
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,470
It's too difficult, right, CEO?

53
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,990
Thankfully we have something called a translator.

54
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,370
Let's see... He is overflowing with money and celebrities,

55
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,840
so I thought he had everything, but that's not true.

56
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,580
Mr. J. He couldn't get Mr. J.

57
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,510
They sent out love calls but were turned down each time.

58
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,250
- Mr. J? 
 - You know, the photographer.

59
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,610
The one with a lot of nicknames. Even Hermès, Dior, and Chanel are lining up to work with him.

60
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,030
Oh, the Japanese guy whose real name Juniwara?

61
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:34,470
I heard he was Chinese. Ah, nowadays, he goes by "Cookie."

62
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,040
Cookie?

63
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,980
What a cute nickname.

64
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,470
 Mr. J, this is Sebastian from Olivier's Atelier.  
  (in French) 

65
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,470
   
 Mr. de Saint Sauveur heard you rejected the contract 
 (in French) 

66
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,990
 to work as an exclusive photographer for Dior and Chanel.   
  (in French) 

67
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,370
 Mr. de Saint Sauveur is in Busan right now—  
  (in French) 

68
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,700
 This is Olivier's Atelier...  
  (in French) 

69
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,500
 Hello, this is Olivier de Saint Sauveur's Atelier.  
  (in French) 

70
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,310
 Can you please call us back at this number? This is Sebastian.  
  (in French) 

71
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,200
- Any word from J? 
 - No, not yet.  (In French) 

72
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,690
I'll call again. 
  (in French) 

73
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,810
Persuade him no matter what. 
  (in French) 

74
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,510
I know that he rejected everyone else, but I am Olivier de Saint Sauveur.  (in French) 

75
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,990
I don't get rejected. 
  (in French) 

76
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,460
My creations need of his colors, his shots, and his contrast between coldness and warmth.  (in French) 

77
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,420
I absolutely need his eye for things. 
  (in French) 

78
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,510
You told me to wait 30 minutes earlier.

79
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,930
Is it delayed again?

80
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,570
 What's up with the meeting with Olivier? 

81
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,890
He's got meetings with about five other companies besides us.

82
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,330
And there are so many other people trying to get a meeting with him.

83
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,270
I've been waiting for about three hours now.

84
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:17,530
That sounds like a lot. Right, Director Hwang has arrived too.

85
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,680
   
 The number you are trying to call is currently unavailable. 

86
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,350
 Please leave— 

87
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,240
How's the photo book?

88
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,410
I just got them from the print shop. I'll head over right away.

89
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,720
Call me when you get here.

90
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,790
Team Leader, Olivier hasn't come down yet.

91
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,380
- How many teams are in front of us?
 - Two teams.

92
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,570
Viace is in front of us.

93
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,980
You must be hungry. Go eat first. I'll be here.

94
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,340
I ate a lot at brunch. Team Leader, you go eat.

95
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,400
I can eat after the interview.

96
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,520
You haven't eaten anything since morning.

97
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,980
I'll call you as soon as Viace's interview starts. Be on your way.

98
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,420
As long as Olivier has decided to break into the  Asian market,

99
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,100
he will definitely need us since Sonó is a recognized domestic brand.

100
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,720
I'm going to focus on that appeal.

101
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,800
 Don't say much. Just bring the results. 

102
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,000
You know that I used to sell fabric in Dongdaemun. What would I know?

103
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,690
I'll keep you updated.

104
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,510
 What is Chi Sook up to that I still haven't heard from her? 

105
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,530
The Olivier show is tomorrow.

106
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,340
She has a lot of materials to look over for the meeting right after.

107
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,000
My secretary made a reservation at a restaurant for tonight at 7:00. 
    

108
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,920
 Make sure Chi Sook shows up on time. 
   

109
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,890
 Team Leader Ha, this bastard is so full of love that he has another woman besides me. 

110
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,830
Make sure you prepare enough compensation today for...

111
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:20,100
It's a meeting organized carefully by two families, so tell her to act properly and not embarrass me.

112
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,420
Yes, I understand.

113
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,240
   

114
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,050
Director Hwang, you absolutely cannot. Don't do anything.

115
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,250
I'll be there within 15 minutes.

116
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,460
I'm sorry. I'll come another time.

117
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,500
Oh, nice to see you!

118
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:50,860
This rude bastard always makes me call first and come look for him.

119
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,480
   

120
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,680
How dare he?

121
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,500
I generously let him stay in my room ahead of my arrival,

122
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,690
and he dares to use the sheets with some other wench?!

123
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,040
And he brazenly uploaded photos to his social media!

124
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,280
Who are you?

125
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,260
Can you tell Jimmy to come out?

126
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,120
- Oppa, come out here! 
 - I'll be right out. Stop nagging me!

127
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,310
- Hurry up! 
 - How are you never satisfied?!

128
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,830
My legs are still shaking...

129
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,560
Team Leader.

130
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,670
Jimmy, as The One's casual menswear model,

131
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:51,500
you've breached the contract pertaining to maintaining dignity in your private life.

132
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,810
I'm sorry, it was a mistake. I mean it, please trust me!

133
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,870
You're aware that the penalty fee is three times what you got paid, aren't you?

134
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,030
Really, nothing happened. Also, I don't know that woman.

135
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,650
Hey, do you know me? You don't, so why are you here?

136
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,790
How about we head out?

137
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,370
Mind your own business. Who are you to tell me what to do?

138
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,500
Not the girlfriend, but Jimmy.

139
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,980
Can't we make her leave instead?

140
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,710
Bastard!

141
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,630
Noona!

142
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,560
Let's not draw blood if we don't have to.

143
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,080
Don't make this worse than it is and keep it quiet.

144
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,790
I can kill him and bury him though, right?

145
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,540
It'll be quiet since no one will find out.

146
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,290
Do you want to stay here or follow me out?

147
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,010
 The doors are closing. 

148
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,990
 The doors are opening. 

149
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,220
 The doors are closing. 

150
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,490
Hold on, wait for me!

151
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,910
It's a misunderstanding, Noona.

152
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,810
Nothing happened.

153
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,740
I met her by chance at a club last night,

154
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,270
but it just happened that she had nowhere to spend the night.

155
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,460
Should I have just left her out on the street when the night gets freezing by the ocean?

156
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,550
Seriously, that's not right!

157
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,630
We just slept next to each other, that's all.

158
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,500
One-night stand? No, just one night!

159
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,380
It's true. Please trust me.

160
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,150
Noona. Noona!

161
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,820
Noona, please believe me this once!

162
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,150
I did reserve the one with an ocean view.

163
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,450
I did, but a hoobae  (junior)  I know couldn't get a room.

164
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,960
He didn't realize it would be so hard to book a room since he's so new to this business.

165
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,660
- So? 
 - So as a sunbae  (senior) ,

166
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,120
I willingly gave him my room.

167
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,240
Why did you do that? The night gets freezing by the ocean!

168
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,590
We have your room though.

169
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,290
- I won't see you out. 
  - Hey!

170
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,210
I hear everyone who is fashionable from overseas are all here.

171
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,540
I'm the CEO of Vision PR, the backbone of Korea's fashion promotion agency.

172
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,070
You're the only one who doesn't acknowledge it, but I'm a bit of a celeb.

173
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,470
What does that have to do with my room?

174
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,880
This K fashion week is the first of its kind in Asia taking place in Busan.

175
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,740
I need to stay at the center of it all in order to see what clothes, bags, and shoes people are wearing

176
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,110
to identify the latest trends.

177
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,180
I saw there's only one trend when it comes to hotels.

178
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,250
Love and war.

179
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,950
What?

180
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,870
What?

181
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,920
Do you have something more to say to me?

182
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,640
Delete the picture of Jimmy you uploaded to your social media.

183
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,830
Along with all the photos of him on your phone.

184
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,620
Ridiculous...

185
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,790
It's my phone and my memories.

186
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,260
Th-then I'll sue you.

187
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,950
It's not like he's a married man.

188
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,690
Who cares about the law when our hearts and eyes clicked?

189
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,850
Go ahead and sue me!

190
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:07,550
 A model being seen on social media because of women trouble is damaging to the company's image, too. 

191
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,380
 We have the rights to his privacy and portrait, 

192
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,240
 so we can hold you responsible for publicizing his private life. 

193
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,470
What do you want to do?

194
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,000
Wow, this is so annoying.

195
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,620
Happy now?

196
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,830
It's an addendum to the contract.

197
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,770
If you repeat what happened today, you'll pay three times your penalty fee

198
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:52,810
and any damages made to The One's image.

199
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:57,400
If you agree, we'll just close out today's incident as a misunderstanding.

200
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,380
Thank you.

201
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,920
Love is too commonplace and taken too lightly!

202
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,650
There is no sincerity in it and I'm appalled by that fact.

203
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,000
There's no reason for you to get upset when you're not the one going through it.

204
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,440
Still, at least that man is making an effort going back and forth between two women.

205
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,240
What are you doing? Are you not going to get married?

206
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,010
Before you know it, you'll have turned 40.

207
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,710
You're not in a place to worry when you're already 40.

208
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:24,170
I'm just waiting for fate to strike like lightning.

209
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,330
And I don't believe in marriage.

210
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,790
Does it make you look cool saying that?

211
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,770
Just be honest and say you don't want any responsibilities.

212
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,260
That's right. I don't want any responsibility.

213
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,440
Wow. You're overly honest.

214
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,330
How can you be responsible for someone else?

215
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,930
I just want to keep living this life of freedom and independence.

216
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,610
So basically you want to keep flirting and having fun with women.

217
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,610
If I keep my safe distance, I won't get my hopes up or get disappointed.

218
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:55,670
So that's why you're traveling from country to country choosing to only work on whatever you want?

219
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,310
Mr. Cookie?

220
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,380
You think you're some flying global dandelion or something?

221
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,480
I'm just being faithful to this moment and the present.

222
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,540
Whether it's work or dating.

223
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,300
So meet someone who's passionate and cherish any fate that comes your way.

224
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,140
In that sense, let's share the room.

225
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,320
Where's your room?

226
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,250
Hold on! Hyung! 
  (*Hyung is a way to address a close male friend who is older) 

227
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,700
It was just a simple one-night stand.

228
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,610
Because of alcohol. You know how that can happen with physical attraction.

229
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,380
There's no need to be backward and keep thinking about it.

230
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,000
What about Jimmy?

231
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,110
I made sure he understands.

232
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:53,750
It won't get out, so you don't need to worry about your father.

233
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,390
I see.

234
00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:00,140
Oh, get yourself a new bag. You've had yours for too long.

235
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,050
CEO Hwang's dinner reservation is at 7:00.

236
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,320
I made an appointment at the salon, so don't be late.

237
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,700
Bastard...

238
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,630
Why was he in such a hurry that he didn't even make a single excuse and left like that?

239
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,580
Go where?

240
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,930
It's the hottest restaurant among couples these days.

241
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,350
Why would I want to go there with you?

242
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,240
Thanks to you, I saved money on a hotel room.

243
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,600
I'll buy you a generous meal, so come on time.

244
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,180
I couldn't sleep lately because of work. I'm dying.

245
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,590
So why are you going out?

246
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,550
There are tons of shows lined up.

247
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,670
I need to make connections in advance to get clothing sponsored.

248
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,760
The main show starts tomorrow. Get some sleep first.

249
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,410
Hey, there's nothing in this life you can put off till tomorrow.

250
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:32,230
I might miss out on a connection if I don't try, so I need to at least go.

251
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,320
It's at 7:00. It's an expensive place, so dress up.

252
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,520
How is it?

253
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,430
- You should add a bit more. 
 - Alright.

254
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:01,890
- You should place it more carefully. 
 - Okay.

255
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:11,050
Wow, you did so well!

256
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,480
Please get up for me.

257
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:20,340
Alright, today's best dish on the menu goes to Mrs. Min again!

258
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,240
Food needs to have some style, too.

259
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,480
Such an elegant garnish really helps to increase the food's quality.

260
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,230
So let's try again and wrap up nicely.

261
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,480
That lady always gets first place, so why is she still learning?

262
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,430
Is she trying to open a store?

263
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:42,220
Well, she looks like she's the wife of a rich family.

264
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,270
Why would a precious lady study something that requires her hands to wash dishes?

265
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,750
What a strange hobby.

266
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,800
They say her late husband was a doctor and that she volunteers a lot at nursing homes.

267
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:59,540
I've always found people who are good at all things a bit intimidating.

268
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,810
- Ah, Do Hoon. 
  - Yes, Mother? 

269
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,240
Apparently, her unmarried son lives in France.

270
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,830
Son?

271
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,460
I told Jae Gook the location.

272
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,800
Yes, of course. Who do you take me for?

273
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,220
Yes, he'll go there for sure.

274
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,760
   

275
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,380
♫  I got it  ♫

276
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,600
♫  Pop that bottle, it's over  ♫

277
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,520
♫  It's the end October  ♫

278
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,730
♫  Champagne on the shoulder  ♫

279
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,940
♫  This is my exposure  ♫

280
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,200
♫  Pop that bottle, it's over  ♫

281
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,910
♫  It's the end October  ♫

282
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,720
What do you mean?

283
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,990
It's a really ridiculous situation.

284
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:54,450
 He kept giving these excuses like he wasn't feeling well and has bad jet lag. 

285
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,010
Then he suddenly said he'll postpone all of his meeting to tomorrow.

286
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,230
Isn't this just too rude, Team Leader?

287
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,410
Alright.

288
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:06,320
 Just confirm the meeting time for tomorrow once more before you go. 

289
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,190
Good work.

290
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:15,240
Yes, this is The One's Ha Yeong Eun.

291
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,960
Hwang Chi Sook isn't at the salon yet?

292
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh, I apologize. I'll check on it right away and let you know.

293
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,710
   

294
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,240
- Where are you? 
  - Ha Yeong Eun. 

295
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,280
That bastard Jimmy hasn't called once.

296
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,030
He even left the necktie that I bought for him in Milan.

297
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,290
He hasn't even come back to get it.

298
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,970
I told you the reservation is at 7:00.

299
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,980
Just stay where you are for now. I'm coming right now.

300
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,570
I told you to keep it cordial and send her away, but you just had to fight it out?

301
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,580
And to top that, you lost?

302
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,880
Wow, Hwang Chi Sook, there's no trace of the old you.

303
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,180
I paid for my pride in one installment too.

304
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,980
Aren't you generous?

305
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,680
I invested so much money at the salon to keep from getting old.

306
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,550
My skin might look tight, but my bones are properly old.

307
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,990
Gosh, that wench! Is it because she's young?

308
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,410
She was so strong and tough, too.

309
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:25,030
It'll take too long to get your hair done, but we should make it on time if we just fix your makeup.

310
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,780
She was so confident.

311
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,880
She said that I was just a brand name bag to Jimmy.

312
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,460
She said he pitied me for not realizing it, so he just went along with it.

313
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,530
He was the CEO's hometown senior and a great doctor while he was alive.

314
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,020
Because he's the son of someone like that, his mom is probably expecting a lot from you

315
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,350
in terms of your personality and family reputation.

316
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,650
If you're sure you can handle the consequence of not showing up, complain away.

317
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:55,010
You know, Yeong Eun, even though I got him by spending tons of money,

318
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,650
I thought he was sincere enough to cover at least the amount of interest.

319
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:03,260
Let's lament about your lack of judgment skills later.

320
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,920
Since you've already suffered like this,

321
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,770
how about you let go of playing with such dangerous emotions

322
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,950
and start living in a safe and healthy manner?

323
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,650
What's the big deal about men?

324
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:23,720
Hey, how do you know if I was playing with Jimmy or if I was sincere?

325
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,590
Men? That's right, I'm hungry for a man!

326
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,900
Are you not?

327
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,230
You were the one with your phone off yesterday, doing who knows what.

328
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,820
Don't act so classy.

329
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,910
Just because you keep quiet, you think you're any different?

330
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,360
I am different.

331
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:16,010
Although you believe in such false hope like love and men, I don't.

332
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,680
Having one experience is enough.

333
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,600
You terrible thing.

334
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,160
How come you've never once been a friend to me?

335
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,740
And you never say, "I'm sorry."

336
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,510
Yet here I am thankful that it was water and won't leave a stain.

337
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,220
That's the kind of relationship you and I have.

338
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,090
Wanting friendship would be too greedy.

339
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:38,220
You value my father's trust over friendship.

340
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,670
Unlike someone, I have no choice since I don't have money for investment.

341
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,650
Even though I haven't eaten anything all day because I don't have five minutes to eat some bread, I have to keep going.

342
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,900
You don't see that I'm miserable enough die, huh?

343
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,750
Still, I'm always grateful to you.

344
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,330
Since I get paid so well.

345
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,740
If you get some fresh air, you'll get a bit sober.

346
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,610
No, I can't go. No, I'm not going.

347
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:08,790
   
   

348
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,500
   

349
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,850
How can I go anywhere in this state?

350
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:21,220
He'll hear immediately, "Your daughter showed up drunk and all bruised up."

351
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,990
He'd be delighted to hear it.

352
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,010
At least we can make up an excuse for it later.

353
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,190
But, if you don't show up, that's all your fault.

354
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,160
Then you go.

355
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,690
You can go instead of me and be Hwang Chi Sook.

356
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,230
Tell the CEO yourself.

357
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,750
If he orders it, I'll do it.

358
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,570
Do that then.

359
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,690
Do it?

360
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,150
He's just going to blame you

361
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,540
- for not taking care of me well. Is that okay? 
 - Director Hwang!

362
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,940
So, let's just keep this between us and quietly move on, okay?

363
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,570
This morning, I was rejected by a man who only cared about my money,

364
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:07,830
and tonight, I have to meet a man who only cares about my father's money.

365
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,790
That's something I just can't do.

366
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,520
We're going to start setting up for the event.

367
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:28,650
   

368
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:37,360
   

369
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,020
Gosh, this person, really.

370
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,110
   

371
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,460
Wow.

372
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,270
♫  Break it to the top  ♫ 
 ♫  While I am messing with the numbers  ♫

373
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:02,150
♫  Though I'm drowning, I can't stop it  ♫ 
 ♫  'Cause I just can't kick the habit   ♫

374
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:06,050
♫  But I never get enough  ♫ 
 ♫  Though you know I got a lot  ♫

375
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:10,760
♫  No I never get enough  ♫ 
 ♫  'Cause it's all I got  ♫

376
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,340
♫  Come on, girl. Come to the bed  ♫

377
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,020
♫  Make it, make it wild, wild  ♫ 
 ♫  Make it wild, wild, wild  ♫

378
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:22,130
♫  Make it wild, wild, wild  ♫ 
 ♫  Make it wild  ♫

379
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:26,020
♫  Make it wild, wild, wild  ♫ 
 ♫  Make it wild  ♫

380
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,510
♫  Make it wild, wild, wild  ♫ 
 ♫  Make it wild  ♫

381
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:33,120
I checked with the restaurant and he arrived, Mother. 
  (Close friends call each other's parents like their own) 

382
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,900
I'm sorry I had to make that request of you when you're so busy.

383
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:40,310
I can't just sit back and do nothing as his mom when he keeps getting older,

384
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,670
so I made that shameless request.

385
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,160
Oh, I'm glad you did.

386
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,150
But, Mother, who is he meeting with?

387
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,620
I'm sorry I'm late.

388
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,200
   

389
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,000
Are you Hwang Chi Sook?

390
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,550
Let's say so for now.

391
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,720
I'm Yoon Jae Gook.

392
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,070
To be honest, there are some problems going on at work right now.

393
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,710
I know it's rude of me, but I'll have to...

394
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,110
"I'll have to" what?

395
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,750
Since you went through the trouble of making a reservation

396
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,130
and it looks like there is some effort put into this,

397
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,370
I'll have dinner before we call it a night.

398
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,170
 Blood transfusion is an important medical technique that saves people, 

399
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,710
 - but there could be some serious side effects. 
- Here.

400
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:13,250
 Therefore, we need to be sure to follow safety protocols. 

401
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,710
 But after covering the issue, acute— 

402
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,360
How is it?

403
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,600
I didn't even swallow yet.

404
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,770
Stop going to classes. It'll be better to buy it

405
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,770
if this is what it tastes like after all those classes.

406
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,160
Still, eat plenty. You never know when you'll get to again.

407
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,930
Are you going to die or something?

408
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:42,240
About Yeong Eun... let's get her married.

409
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,470
 But when it— 

410
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,000
Is there someone?

411
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,600
I asked some of the women I take classes with,

412
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,020
and there seems to be someone

413
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,340
from a good household, and the mother seems nice, too.

414
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,150
He works for a foreign company,

415
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:04,180
so he seems to be pretty capable, too.

416
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:08,170
It also sounds like he's got a good personality.

417
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,910
Really?

418
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:18,910
Na Ri, did you check which brands asked Olivier for a collaboration?

419
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,690
Tell me.

420
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,180
And the hangers?

421
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,750
Once we convince Olivier, we have to go immediately into the next season,

422
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,630
so whatever looks good to you in person, order the samples right away.

423
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:35,160
Check the quality carefully for any issues with the dye work.

424
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,220
Okay.

425
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,350
   

426
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,700
I'm sorry. I'm on a business trip

427
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,880
and if I didn't have to be at this dinner,

428
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,250
I would have still been working.

429
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,950
 In the morning, she drags a man out from a hotel room, 

430
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:07,450
 and at night, she works during her blind date? 

431
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,600
Are you a designer?

432
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,690
I'm a freelance photographer.

433
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,070
I shoot fashion pictorials.

434
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,590
We might have met already

435
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:27,930
since photographers and designers cross paths during this period.

436
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:32,720
I don't attach any significance to an unimpactful meeting.

437
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,500
Unimpactful?

438
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,920
Well, yes.

439
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,950
You must not have such a great eye for a designer.

440
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:49,880
I don't usually forget a face once I see it.

441
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,620
I didn't come here because I wanted to.

442
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,780
I came because I had to,

443
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,810
but I don't think I'll be seeing you again.

444
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:03,410
- Good-bye.
 - We still have the dessert.

445
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,330
I don't like sweet things.

446
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,320
Then how about hot tea?

447
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,270
Tea only stays hot for a second.

448
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,900
You sound sorry about that.

449
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,900
Then, please excuse me for leaving first.

450
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,930
 Team Leader, what do I do? 

451
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,710
What's wrong?

452
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,800
 I think the files were switched when it went to print. 

453
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,020
Tell So Yeong to email the original file

454
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,390
 so we can print it from here. 

455
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,630
- Did you find the original file? 
 - It's not here.

456
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,920
I checked the team leader's and the manager's desks,

457
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,420
but it's not anywhere!

458
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,110
- Let's shoot them here. 
 - Pardon?

459
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:21,090
Olivier thankfully postponed all the meetings to tomorrow.

460
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:25,320
We have extra time and the samples are all here, so we can shoot tomorrow.

461
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,810
- Then I'll try to gather some models. 
 - What about the photographer?

462
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:32,150
All the photographers who worked with us on the shoot are involved with the shows,

463
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,510
 so they won't be available. 

464
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,130
 What should we do? 

465
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:42,690
 I'm a freelance photographer. I shoot fashion pictorials. 

466
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,480
Hold on a sec.

467
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,850
Who are you looking for?

468
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,610
Do you have time tomorrow?

469
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,390
- Do you want a part-time gig? 
 - A what?

470
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,840
You said you shoot fashion pictorials.

471
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,750
I'll give you an opportunity to experience it.

472
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,630
   

473
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,060
I'm a designer at The One.

474
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,980
I see. So?

475
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:08,420
It's not public yet, but we're getting ready for a collaboration with Olivier.

476
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,050
I think it'll be a great opportunity for you.

477
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,730
I'm not sure.

478
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:18,860
I usually choose whether I want to work or not on my own.

479
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,950
It will give you pride to have worked with professionals like us.

480
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,620
That's for me to decide.

481
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,690
Having various experiences under your belt

482
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:34,430
will come in handy when you sign with

483
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,610
magazines and agencies later.

484
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:39,090
 So I should do it? 

485
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,550
 That's right. You're all we've got. 

486
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,870
There's not much to go off of to trust him for this job.

487
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,140
His camera cover looked old.

488
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,860
It means he's used it a lot.

489
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,350
I'm sure he's not a novice.

490
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,300
Models?

491
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,980
I used all of my connections.

492
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,160
 Are you Hwang Chi Sook? 

493
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,980
 Let's say so for now. 

494
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,670
This is interesting.

495
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,790
♫  When we're together they don't stand a chance  ♫

496
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:01,080
♫  The world is in our hands  ♫

497
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,700
♫  We light up like a trance (come pull me closer to you)  ♫

498
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,930
♫  And when we take the wheel we never crash  ♫

499
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,310
♫  We ride out like a flash  ♫

500
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,410
♫  Cause what we have is natural  ♫

501
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,930
♫  When we're together  ♫

502
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:20,340
- Kim Sung Hee's first outfit is this one?
- Yes, we decided on this order.

503
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,580
- What about Park Ji Hye's? 
 - The colors were too similar earlier so...

504
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,450
- Oh, so we decided on this? 
 - This one is good.

505
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:29,450
- Seon Joo, check the models' hair and makeup. 
 - Yes.

506
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,690
- And all of these? 
- They're ready.

507
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,390
Jae Gook, if you have a spare tie, can I borrow one?

508
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,400
The Olivier show is today.

509
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,040
Something that stands out, if possible.

510
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,000
Cookie.

511
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,930
Cookie.

512
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,110
♫  You and I, feels so right  ♫

513
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,710
♫  Feels so right  ♫

514
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:09,370
♫  I can't wait any longer  ♫

515
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,480
♫  And when we take the wheel we never crash  ♫

516
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,900
♫  We ride out like a flash  ♫

517
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,120
♫  Cause what we have is natural  ♫

518
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,750
♫  When we're together  ♫

519
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,780
We have to end it in the morning, so we'll keep the number of cuts to a minimum.

520
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,850
I'll take care of it on my own.

521
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:52,520
If you capture in raw instead of jpeg, you will be able to capture the detail well.

522
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,270
Ah, you don't need to do the post-processing.

523
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,730
And the photoshoot concept is posted on the moodboard.

524
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:59,770
So, tight frames focusing on the clothes.

525
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:02,090
I will take care of it.

526
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:06,340
We will start the shoot!

527
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,690
Call everyone out.

528
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,990
Please set up the lights first.

529
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,640
Okay, you two are good where you're standing.

530
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,090
And Ji Hye and Sung Hee take center.

531
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,750
The person at the very left, can you move back a little?

532
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,770
This is my spot.

533
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,000
Okay, let's start!

534
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,900
Stand a bit closer to each other. That's good now.

535
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,830
Okay.

536
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,120
Nam Na Ri, I am Director Hwang Chi Sook here.

537
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,650
What?

538
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,460
You must have recruited using Director Hwang's name.

539
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,110
After all, all of the staff hiring were signed off by the Director anyway.

540
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,960
Yes, I will do that.

541
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,190
Good.

542
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,260
I think you can use your hands. Bigger.

543
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,460
Wow, his form is totally professional.

544
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,340
Right now.

545
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:07,380
Ha Yeong Eun, I saw your photo on social media.

546
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:13,000
Lucky you. Someone is wiping the floor

547
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,450
while someone else is enjoying coffee by the ocean.

548
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:19,080
Yes, I am depressed.

549
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,580
I'm afraid it might be menopause.

550
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:24,710
It's about time. They say that it comes earlier these days.

551
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:29,820
I know. I hoped to look younger than my age once I got older, but unwelcomed menopause came instead.

552
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:35,930
Hey... looking at your photo, you became more beautiful in a few days' time.

553
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,630
Something happened, right?

554
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:40,560
Who is he? Is he handsome?

555
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,900
Just... for my skin that stretches if I let my guard down for a moment

556
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,420
and my body that tries to become lazy,

557
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,330
it's the motivation to maintain the right amount of tension.

558
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:55,600
"Hold on," "stay alert," and "you are still okay." Self-persuasion.

559
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,490
Sly self-comfort.

560
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:59,130
A smart pragmatist.

561
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,910
In the end, you don't have a man who will scratch your back when you wake up from your sleep?

562
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:04,590
Because of that, I'm free.

563
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:06,390
I'm jealous.

564
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:08,120
Acknowledged.

565
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,930
We're done.

566
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:22,640
Wow. He's not just good.

567
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:27,490
He's better than Mr. J. Where did you find him?

568
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,900
We will start the post-processing.

569
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,150
We don't have time for that. Just print it out first.

570
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:45,510
They're my photos. I can't give them to you until I give the okay.

571
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,120
I have a meeting with an important client.

572
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,960
It will just take 10 minutes.

573
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:16,980
♫  I close my eyes and feel it  ♫

574
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:23,620
♫  The song just for me  ♫

575
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:31,970
♫  Carrying your breath  ♫

576
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,590
♫  It's the sound of the wind  ♫

577
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,680
It's all done.

578
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,080
♫  With the sunshine shining on you  ♫

579
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:52,860
♫  Watching you is enough for me  ♫

580
00:46:52,860 --> 00:47:00,870
♫  Embrace me when the wind is cold  ♫

581
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:05,780
♫  Be my umbrella on a rainy day  ♫

582
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,980
Are we finished, Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun?

583
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:13,050
Yes, let's wrap it up now.

584
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,360
You take better photos than I thought.

585
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,340
Did you hire me without even having that much trust?

586
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:23,840
I trusted my good eye, but you were beyond my expectations.

587
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,940
That's a compliment, right?

588
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:29,850
It's a compliment.

589
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:34,600
I really like your photos.

590
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:47,340
♫  If I look back at so many seasons  ♫

591
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:50,100
♫  I was covered with tears  ♫

592
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,700
    
 ♫  At the end of my day  ♫

593
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:57,220
♫  You were always there  ♫

594
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:01,260
♫  Even with the word love  ♫

595
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:08,550
♫  I can't completely fill my heart  ♫

596
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:16,000
♫  Stay with me as always  ♫

597
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:20,750
You worked hard.

598
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:35,750
 Ladies and gentlemen, the 2021 Olivier de Saint Sauveur's 

599
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:39,080
 F/W buyer show will now begin. 

600
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,640
They're unreleased pieces, so the security is very strict.

601
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,280
If they're leaked, they'll be copied right away.

602
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,590
Why did you bring me to a buyer's only show?

603
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:11,870
An artist's greatest asset is their good eye. It's good to see a lot.

604
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:15,830
It's even better if you can find out what the buyers get and what will be trending next season.

605
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:19,730
I am very meticulous like this, you punk.

606
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:22,360
But you're not such an innocent person.

607
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,600
You sensible jerk.

608
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,640
It's my bribe. It's 50,000 won per unit. Domestic gongjindan*  (*Herbal tonic) .

609
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,360
It's expensive. You eat it.

610
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,590
I want to be with you all night.

611
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:39,670
- I'm sorry. 
- Olivier is so well-off

612
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:42,250
that I said I would just give him my business card, but he still won't meet me.

613
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:47,520
So this hyung is going to give you an Olivier afterparty ticket.

614
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,490
I'm not going.

615
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:52,830
If he finds out Mister Cookie is my brother, he will be totally surprised.

616
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:57,340
Wow... someone says she will hire me, and someone else says he will make me his brother.

617
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:59,970
You are employed? Where?

618
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,960
Do you know Hwang Chi Sook from The One?

619
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,900
Yes, I know her. She's one of our clients.

620
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,670
Ah, right! Did the blind date go well?

621
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,360
Are you joking? I held it in because it was only once.

622
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,730
If it's twice, I really won't see your face.

623
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:14,580
I did it because it was only a one-time thing.

624
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:18,620
If I didn't, I wouldn't be able to face your mother. Let's go.

625
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:28,190
   
   

626
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,000
Can I get a champagne?

627
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:39,960
After you look over there, you might be into our latest special.

628
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,550
So make sure to let me know when you're ready, okay?

629
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:44,550
Alright.

630
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,110
We've loved the show so far.

631
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:52,970
We're very glad to hear that.

632
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,800
Nice to meet you.

633
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,530
Nice to meet you.

634
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:05,760
We have a lot of talented artists.

635
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:11,710
I hope we get a chance to show off Olivier's amazing designs

636
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:15,840
through collaborations with our Asian stars.

637
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,690
This is our collection.

638
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,770
What's this?

639
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:07,320
Olivier already signed with Viace.

640
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,280
The pictorial was an excuse to buy time trying to evade giving a difficult answer.

641
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,760
You said we were the number one choice.

642
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,310
You said he wanted the pictorial!

643
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:17,330
We worked so hard on the shoot!

644
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:18,750
How could this happen?

645
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,260
So what were you planning to do that you took pictures of undisclosed designs?

646
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,100
- To upload them online so he'd be ruined. 
 - Na Ri.

647
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,040
I'm sure he'll understand once the designs are copied over the weekend

648
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,020
what it means when all efforts were made in vain.

649
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,890
I understand how you feel. I get it, but you're a designer.

650
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:39,480
Don't you know what copies mean to a designer?

651
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,180
A year's worth of effort becomes nothing in one moment.

652
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:46,110
How could you, a designer of all people, think about doing such a thing?

653
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:48,610
- But Team Leader. 
 - Delete them yourself.

654
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:51,640
- Team Leader. 
 - Do you know why a luxury brand is a luxury brand?

655
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:56,920
That designer's pride and self-respect about their own designs.

656
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,830
Let's not make ourselves look bad.

657
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:14,550
   

658
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:18,780
Where are you going?

659
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,780
To meet with Olivier.

660
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,280
I should at least show him what he missed out on.

661
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,300
 Hwang Chi Sook? 

662
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,230
 Huh? He smiled? 

663
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,680
 Why? What does it mean? 

664
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,830
Are you okay?

665
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:49,010
Yes. You must have been surprised.

666
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,390
I'm fine.

667
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:05,320
   

668
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:13,850
Where in the world did Cookie disappear to?

669
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:16,930
Seok Do Hoon?

670
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,450
♫  Oh, you're keeping me up  ♫

671
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:23,740
Hey Cookie, long time no see.

672
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,990
♫  Oh, you're keeping me up  ♫

673
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,720
♫  You're keeping me up  ♫

674
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,210
♫  Oh, you're keeping me up  ♫

675
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:30,830
♫  You're keeping me up  ♫

676
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:32,520
♫  Oh, you're keeping me up  ♫

677
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,140
♫  You're keeping me up  ♫

678
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:36,310
Hi.

679
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:39,430
♫  Oh, you're keeping me up  ♫

680
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:41,160
♫  You're keeping me up  ♫

686
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:54,070
♫  You're keeping me up  ♫

687
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,340
Listen, I'm sorry. I already signed.
  (in French) 

688
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:11,670
But you haven't seen our designs yet. 
  (in French) 

689
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:16,930
All I'm asking is that you at least take a look. 
  (in French) 

690
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,400
Regrettably, the deal with Viace is done, 
  (in French) 

691
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,680
and we've already opened the champagne and made a toast. 
  (in French) 

692
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:29,830
From the design to production, it was all done in Korea without OEM. 
  (in French) 

693
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:35,200
You won't find such quality anywhere else. Honestly. 
  (in French) 

694
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:40,340
Miss Ha, what do you think clothes mean? 
  (in French) 

695
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:45,160
My youth. The passion I poured out. 
  (in French) 

696
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,460
And fashion? 
  (in French) 

697
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:50,920
It doesn't last forever, but we hope it does. 
  (in French) 

698
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,210
And design? 
  (in French) 

699
00:57:53,210 --> 00:58:00,020
My dream that still remains. One that I don't want to throw away. 
  (in French) 

700
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:04,880
No, it's money. 
  (in French) 

701
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,900
Without money, we can't make it, buy it, or enjoy it. 
  (in French) 

702
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,520
It's cruel, but that's reality. 
  (in French) 

703
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,690
Money makes the world go round. 
  (in French) 

704
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:18,340
The game was over when Viace offered three times the amount. 
  (in French) 

705
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:25,170
Still, your designs aren't bad. 
  (in French) 

706
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:33,440
Mr. J! 
  (in French) 

707
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,800
Mr. J, you're here! 
  (in French) 

708
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,670
I knew you would come! 
  (in French) 

709
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:39,710
Should we have a talk then? 
  (in French) 

710
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:43,130
I think the talk's over already. 
  (in French) 

711
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:45,300
What? When? 
  (in French) 

712
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,020
Just now. 
  (in French) 

713
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:54,890
Sorry. 
  (in French) 

714
00:58:54,890 --> 00:59:01,660
I was sure that Olivier de Saint Sauveur would appreciate my photos, 
  (in French) 

715
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:05,360
but I was too presumptuous. 
  (in French) 

716
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,180
Wait, wait! These were your photos? 
  (in French) 

717
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,540
Let's leave now.

718
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:13,820
I'll buy you a drink for being rejected by a retailer without an eye for style.

719
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:17,000
Is that okay?

720
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,200
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! 
  (in French) 

721
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,420
Hold on, Mr. J! 
  (in French) 

722
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,720
Oh, my God!

723
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,380
I didn't know they were your photos! 
  (in French) 

724
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,510
Oh, my God! 
  (in French) 

725
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,980
You're Mr. J?

726
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:39,530
I told you we should introduce ourselves.

727
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,020
 Can you tell me your name? 
 (in French) 

728
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:49,140
 I don't know what to call you when we meet again. 
 (in French) 

729
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:53,940
 I don't attach any significance to an unimpactful meeting. 

730
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,410
Why did you act like you didn't know me?

731
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:59,170
Why do I have to act like I know you?

732
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:04,970
Hwang Chi Sook.

733
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,960
Cookie?

734
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,640
The show's over.

735
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,080
I'm going back to Seoul tomorrow.

736
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,620
Then we can meet in Seoul.

737
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:31,150
I'm not Hwang Chi Sook.

738
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:34,970
I know, Ha Yeong Eun.

739
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:43,030
♫  I close my eyes and feel it  ♫

740
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:50,010
♫  The song just for me  ♫

741
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:58,740
♫  Carrying your breath  ♫

742
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:04,080
♫  It's the sound of the wind  ♫

743
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:09,010
♫  On top of my lap  ♫

744
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:12,490
♫  With the sunshine shining on you  ♫

745
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:19,480
♫  Watching you is enough for me  ♫

746
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,970
♫  Embrace me when the wind is cold  ♫

747
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:26,720
   

748
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,920
 I guess he liked you a lot. 

749
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,550
 It's not hard to like me. 

750
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:31,850
 I'm free until Friday. 

751
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:33,190
 - Who is it? 
 - What? 

752
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:35,680
 Although this may be baffling, shall I introduce you? 

753
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,850
 This is Yoon Jae Gook, the son of your father's acquaintance. 

754
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:42,280
 No, no... it wasn't this face. 

755
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,640
 At the 30th founding anniversary, make sure Chi Sook plays her designated role. 

756
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,100
 This is Director Hwang Chi Sook. 

757
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,830
 - Oh, this is crazy! 
 - Do you always leave after saying what you came to say? 

758
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,540
 I want to prevent further useless misunderstandings. 

759
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:54,300
 Why are you getting so ahead of yourself? I didn't ask you out or propose to you. 

760
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,690
 - Which way are you going?
 - Why? 

761
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:57,000
 So I can go in the opposite direction. 

762
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,500
 We definitely put the order in with the factory. 

763
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,310
 Team Leader Ha, how will you handle this? 

764
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:02,660
 So how are we expected to promote this if we don't even have Olivier? 

765
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,590
 Senior Manager, you already sent the full invitation list to The One, right? 

766
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:05,850
 The fitting starts tomorrow. 

767
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:07,740
 I'll try to convince her again. 

768
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,420
 This is so fitting for a domestic brand. 

769
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:12,260
 It's 15 minutes before the event starts. Is the main celeb even coming? 

770
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,380
 Shin Yoo Jeong! 

771
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,900
 I'm Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun of The One. 

772
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,440

 What happened with the photographer? 

774
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:22,380
 Whose photo is this? 

775
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,160
 It's an unknown artist's work. 

776
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,450
 The exposure is a mess, and the composition isn't good either.

01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:29,040
 - Yoon Jae Gook. 
 - I decided to take on this photo shoot. 

778
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,290
 - By any chance, do you know someone named Yoon Soo Wan? 
 - I had forgotten. 

779
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:37,410
 Or I thought I had forgotten that name, but the name came to me again.
