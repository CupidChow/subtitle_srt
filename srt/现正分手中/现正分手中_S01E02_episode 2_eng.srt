 Timing and subtitles brought to you by 
 Are You The One Team @ Viki

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,990
   

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,450
♫  I know it's real, taking over  ♫

8
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,760
♫  Under the surface, something in nervous, you're getting closer  ♫

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,650
♫  I know it's real, just taking over  ♫

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,770
 If we attach a price value to all of the clothes made during a year, 

11
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,780
 it comes out to about 42 trillion won (US$35.6 billion). 

12
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,190
 The start of 42 trillion won traces back to when the desire is recognized. 

13
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,330
Wearing bold styles by using neon colors like chartreuse or leather on leather

14
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,190
shows people's mentality of wanting to break out of harsh reality.

15
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,930
So Yeong, you can take care of the basic T-shirts, and you can take care of the dress.

16
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,380
Secure the fabric from the handmade department. I'll go set up everything.

17
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,070
 During a year, the clothes launched from my fingertips 

18
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,610
 average to about 200,000 pieces. 

19
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,170
I think the shoulders are a bit too wide.

20
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,120
- The collar aren't symmetric. 
 - I'll fix it.

21
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,750
Let's just use the pockets as decoration.

22
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,590
- There is one I left on the hanger, so check that. 
 - Okay.

23
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,740
 But what I'm designing aren't clothes. 

24
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,210
 I design the needs of 200,000 people. 

25
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,430
 "Once you wear this, you will stand out." 

26
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,860
 "You will look pretty." 

27
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:08,780
 That kind of self-persuasion, self-hypnosis, or self-comfort. 

28
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,920
 One outfit makes fantasy into reality. 

29
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,930
 So if you want to become happy, possess it. 

30
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:25,470
   

31
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,230
♫  Cause what we have is natural  ♫

32
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,710
   

33
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,200
   

34
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,850
  We will arrive at Gimpo International Airport shortly. 

35
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,660
  Please put on your seat belt and make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright position. 

36
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,490
  Please raise the window shades and make sure all carry-on luggage is 
   

37
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,450
 stowed underneath the seat in front of you or in the overhead bins. Thank you. 

38
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,490
  Ladies and gentlemen. 

39
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,220
   

40
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,590
  Mr. J, Mr. Olivier de Saint Sauveur wanted to say there was a misunderstanding.   
  (in French) 

41
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,410
 He'd like to speak with you again.  
  (in French) 

42
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,790
 Mr. J, this is Kath—  
  (in English) 

43
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,450
 We'd appreciate it if you could join us. 
  (in English)  

44
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,230
 Please call me back.  
  (in English) 

45
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,750
  Ms. Ha Yeong Eun, I'm here? 

46
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,030
All right, let's begin this emergency meeting.

47
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,710
Here are the sales rankings from 1st to 13th place from the top 3 department stores.

48
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,480
In the young casual zone, Ether is third place like last month.

49
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,950
In the career zone, Lamong went up from fifth to fourth place.

50
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,460
And Sonó lost its first place for the first time.

51
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,950
   
   

52
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,590
 There is no one to rival domestic women's wear mega-brand Sonó, yet we lost first place for the first time. 

53
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,010
 So it's quite a big deal. 

54
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,670
   

55
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,690
 You should just tell them that shop managers made a big deal 

56
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,510
 about how there weren't enough of this season's ethnic blouse. 

57
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,750
 So we definitely put the order in with the factory. 

58
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,490
 Director Hwang forgot to pay for it and went to Busan, so the clothes weren't made. 

59
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,740
 Once you finish the business trip report, put it on my desk. 

60
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,950
 It's not that we didn't sell it, it's that there was nothing to sell. 

61
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,670
 This has the date and all. 

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,580
 Sales meetings happen monthly, but because of what happened within a week, they're calling an emergency. 

63
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,310
 They just have something else they want to say. 

64
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,170
Team Leader Ha, how will you handle this?

65
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,700
It's just been a week.

66
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,070
The difference between us and the first place spot is only 0.8%.

67
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,950
Does 0.8% not count as a decrease?

68
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,020
This is why you lost out on the deal with Olivier. It's because of your complacent attitude!

69
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,150
That's why you should've waited until I got there.

70
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,410
It happened without your knowledge, Director Hwang?

71
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,830
Team Leader Ha, are you unaware of your own position?

72
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,870
We put you in that spot so you could work hard.

73
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,260
Who said you could do whatever you want?

74
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,960
We couldn't pay what they wanted.

75
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,000
The royalty proposed by Viace was 3 times The One's.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,730
If we wanted to outdo that, we'd have to at least double it.

77
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,510
That would be 6 times the original royalty we proposed.

78
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,690
Chief, can you handle that?

79
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,750
So you're saying you didn't lose it, you let go of it?

80
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,680
They also asked for control over business decisions and the rights to the design.

81
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,990
That means they'd also be in charge of distributing profits.

82
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,220
That just means we would be collaborating while volunteering our skills and gaining nothing.

83
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,790
- Do we have any reason to do it? 
 - Listen, Team Leader Ha!

84
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,150
"I'm sorry." "It's because I'm incompetent."  Just one word from you would have ended this.

85
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,890
How dare you talk back!

86
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,190
All I did was present you with the evidence for my decision.

87
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,890
Since you're so smart and you like evidence, let's hear it.

88
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,700
The 30th founding anniversary event is in two days.

89
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,100
It just so happens that Lucia is also hosting a large show at the same time as us.

90
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,280
All of the domestic brands already complain about how they have no place in the fashion industry.

91
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,990
So how are we expected to promote this if we don't even have Olivier?

92
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,410
   

93
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,480
Celebrities and influencers are those who hold true power over the fashion industry.

94
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,510
   
   

95
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,260
These days, people place value depending on who is wearing it rather than what is worn. 
    

96
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,620
So Yeong, were you able to confirm the recruit?

97
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,900
Yes, thank you.

98
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,720
Yes, it's all done.

99
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,180
Okay.

100
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,140
Okay, you check their height, weight, and size.

101
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,040
As soon as I'm done checking, I'll create their outfits.

102
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,530
One outfit is worth 10 million won. Make sure they hashtag The One.

103
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,190
Is it guaranteed that dressing them will have the marketing effect that we intend?

104
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,090
These are influencers who have amassed over 300,000 followers on average.

105
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,590
Even if there are overlapping followers,

106
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,250
we can still expect to have advertised to over 1,600,000 people overall.

107
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,050
Are you saying we're going to proceed with this event with those small fry?

108
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,170
We need at least one big shot like Olivier to—

109
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,690
The wannabe icon for women, Hye Rin.

110
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,620
She's the main celebrity for this event.

111
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,890
I heard Lucia gives invitation letters inside their new wallets.

112
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,020
This is so fitting for a domestic brand. How senseless of them.

113
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,700
But, still, this is their main clothing line.

114
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,810
They're giving you priority, too.

115
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,190
Who said it's the main?

116
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,020
I have to wear it for it to become the main.

117
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,950
Whatever. Just tell them to resend 20 sets from their new season with 20 pairs of matching shoes and 10 purses.

118
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,180
Well, if you take all of those, what will the others wear?

119
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,100
Make sure nobody will wear any of the clothes' other colors.

120
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,590
I absolutely hate those who wear the same style as me in different colors.

121
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,900
Anything else you'd like to tell me?

122
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,480
We'll end it here.

123
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,450
Team Leader Ha, I need to speak with you.

124
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,360
This is why you shouldn't be so good at everything.

125
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,030
He favors you because you're good, but he also feels threatened because you're good.

126
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,870
That is the duality of a group owner.

127
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,670
Signing off on payments is always a hassle.

128
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,090
They already did it well on their own, but they insist on the facade of process.

129
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,920
You already know when to speak up and when to hide,

130
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,680
so why did you do it?

131
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,630
To overturn the situation or not,

132
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,070
you needed to have Chi Sook handle it.

133
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,490
Chi Sook has her own tasks to do, and so do you.

134
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,120
I did not think that far.

135
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,880
At the 30th founding anniversary, make sure Chi Sook plays her designated role.

136
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,180
I'll make sure it happens flawlessly.

137
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,690
Director Hwang is entering.

138
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,980
Is it time for one-on-one talks already? What is there to discuss alre—

139
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,620
He didn't say he didn't like you the other day.

140
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,940
Did you make plans to meet him again?

141
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,780
Well, I'll handle whom I spend the rest of my life wi—

142
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,110
It doesn't seem like you don't have feelings for him, so keep it up.

143
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,470
 I'm not Hwang Chi Sook. 

144
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,740
 I know, Ha Yeong Eun. 

145
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,430
  Then, why'd you act like you didn't know? 

146
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,550
  I felt like I had to. 

147
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,280
 Then it seems we have already introduced each other. 

148
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,600
 Do you also remember our parting words? 

149
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,040
 I'm going to Seoul tomorrow. 

150
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,020
  I'll be going up to Seoul on Monday. 

151
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,520
  Hope you have a nice vacation. 

152
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,570
  I arrive in the morning. 

153
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,400
  - I didn't ask. 
 - I'll be at Sate Hotel. 

154
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,730
  I didn't ask for that either. 

155
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,690
  I don't have anything else scheduled, so I'll be very free. 

156
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,610
  I have roaming enabled, so my number is the same, too. 

157
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,160
 Aren't you going to tell me your room number? 

158
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,550
  Ah, that's too much. 

159
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,720
That man... I guess he liked you a lot.

160
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,870
It's not hard to like me.

161
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,990
That must be nice. Thanks to you, the problem just got bigger.

162
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,700
It seems like the CEO is going to check on this himself. What are you going to do?

163
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,720
Do you expect me to tell the truth right now or start a long distance relationship?

164
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,530
That is for people who are full of energy.

165
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,970
We are not talking about Seoul to Ilsan. He's from Paris!

166
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,450
Oh my god. Would I ever even hold his hand?

167
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,430
I'm going to take that as you've given me permission to settle that matter on my end.

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,050
Why don't you use that brain for your work?

169
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,750
Well, it's because something that should have already ended in Busan is still in progress.

170
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,630
It's not like you.

171
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,920
Why don't you ask him yourself?

172
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,510
The secretary's office should have his number.

173
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,720
They said it's waterproof, but it smudges whenever I yawn.

174
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,460
Forget that.

175
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,970
I'm working out-of-office.

176
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,490
   

177
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,640
 I'm free until Friday. 

178
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,470
- Who is it? 
- What?

179
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,660
   

180
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,260
Hello?

181
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,720
- Did you borrow from loan sharks? 
- Just recruiting inquiries for next season.

182
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,920
Wow, imagine not having to go around asking for work. I'm jealous.

183
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,860
Honestly, when you first said you wanted to get into photography,

184
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,360
who knew it would've turned out like this?

185
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,590
The golden age is temporary.

186
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,190
Make lots of money while people seek you out.

187
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,640
I'm not sure if it's a good thing that many people seek me.

188
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,220
It's good to be known, but that means my work will become more common.

189
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,630
There is always someone who will recognize good artwork.

190
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,800
 You take better photos than I thought. 

191
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,540
 I really like your photos. 

192
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,120
- Yes, Senior Manager? 
 -   What should we do? Hye Rin is saying she'll go to Lucia. 

193
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,250
What? She already received her pay, so what are you talking about?

194
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,450
Are you able to reach Hye Rin's manager right now?

195
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,880
I'll be right there.

196
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,390
- This isn't the direction of the hotel. 
 - This is an emergency. I have to go to the company first.

197
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,600
I told you I'm busy. I have to meet someone!

198
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,970
That's why we're going to the person you have to meet right now.

199
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,480
You're The One's director, so put some pressure on them to do a good job.

200
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,280
Can't you just take care of those difficult matters yourself?

201
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,310
- I'll just get off over there. 
 - Please stop the car.

202
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,740
- CEO Seok Do Hoon? 
 - Yes, Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun?

203
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,520
Just wait here. I'll get this settled right away and then drop you off.

204
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,220
Yes, did Manager Kim arrive? Okay!

205
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,960
I've already explained that we've already gotten our pay and talks are finalized.

206
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,490
But she is throwing a fit saying how can she dare to wear a domestic brand

207
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,940
when all those who are less popular than her are going to Lucia.

208
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,480
I feel like I'm going to die, too.

209
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,830
Senior Manager, you already sent the full invitation list to The One, right?

210
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,920
The fitting starts tomorrow.

211
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,940
Okay, on top of pay, we'll also prepare gift cards.

212
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,390
She can be the last one at the photo wall.

213
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,950
She'll also ride the best possible limousine.

214
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,680
We'll also post additional bodyguards.

215
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,620
Yes, well I'll try to convince her again,

216
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,260
but you know what Hye Rin is like.

217
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,760
The headline copy for the press coverage will be

218
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,860
"She shows conviction by choosing to wear a domestic brand while everyone goes to Lucia. Thoughtful Celebrity Hye Rin!"

219
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,200
That's what the title will be.

220
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,130
Rather than being a part of the crowd by going to Lucia,

221
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,850
I think this will be way more impressive.

222
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,660
I think Hye Rin will like that.

223
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,210
We have 17 hours until the fitting starts. Please.

224
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,520
I ask this of you.

225
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,930
Alright, please see him out now.

226
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,020
This way, please.

227
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,400
Did I go overboard with the gift cards?

228
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,820
Gosh, my blood sugar level is dropping.

229
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,130
I'm saying I've come to see CEO Seok Do Hoon.

230
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,240
You're seeing him right now.

231
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,680
Vision PR's CEO Seok Do Hoon.

232
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,760
Yes, that's me. For your information, I'm the only Seok Do Hoon at Vision PR.

233
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,690
Yeong Eun, what did this person just say?

234
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,420
Director Hwang, you must be mistaken.

235
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,310
This is CEO Seok Do Hoon.

236
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,880
Stop messing with me.

237
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,600
Me? I'm messing with you?

238
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,450
No, no... it wasn't this face.

239
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,180
Seok Do Hoon isn't of this quality.

240
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,470
Team Leader Ha, must my existence bear such injustice just because I messed up on recruiting a celebrity?

241
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,910
I'm really so upset.

242
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,430
I think Director Hwang is just mistaken. Director.

243
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:46,120
Hold on. Seok Do Hoon isn't supposed to... have this kind of face.

244
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,830
No, but why? I'm fine with it. Why?

245
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,750
Director.

246
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,720
Oh! That's it.

247
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,570
That high nose bridge.

248
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,330
That side profile.

249
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,220
It was just like that.

250
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,350
We can take our time talking while we drink coffee.

251
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,480
Is there Americano?

252
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,510
Is this fate?

253
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,360
It seems that fated people can't help but meet again.

254
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,650
I guess that's true.

255
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,080
We meet again like this.

256
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,150
How are you going to handle this?

257
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,790
Ah, I'll make sure everything goes back to how it should be.

258
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,200
Seems like you're in a difficult situation.

259
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,680
Not yet.

260
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,110
By the way, aren't you supposed to be in Paris right now? How are you here?

261
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,620
I'm here for personal work.

262
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,150
Oh, work. What kind of work do you do?

263
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,640
Photography.

264
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,050
- Photos. 
 - Oh, you're a photographer! I love photos too.

265
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,720
When you just look at them, photos of beautiful nature really are healing.

266
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,370
- I do fashion photography. 
 - Of course, if you take photos, it better be of fashion!

267
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,270
About recruiting Hye Rin, please take care of it without a problem.

268
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,160
We aren't done talking though, Team Leader Ha.

269
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,730
She's saying we're not done talking yet.

270
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,210
Yes, she is. I guess we need to settle things.

271
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,120
Although this may be baffling, shall I introduce you?

272
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,840
This is Yoon Jae Gook, the son of your father's acquaintance.

273
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,550
This is Director Hwang Chi Sook.

274
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,990
Hey, my dad knows many of his acquaintances' sons.

275
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:57,190
He knows someone whose son is in Paris... Oh, my!

276
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,510
Oh, this is crazy!

277
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,980
So this is how you want go about this.

278
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,540
A lighting attack to resolve things.

279
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,240
I have a lot of things to do.

280
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,580
Yes, Nam Na Ri?

281
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:19,290
Since the situation is resolved, just proceed as before.

282
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,190
See you tomorrow.

283
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,830
Yes? Hello. 
  (in French) 

284
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,400
Yes, Mother?

285
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,020
Hello, this is Seok Do Hoon.

286
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,010
Do you always leave after saying what you came to say?

287
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,310
I want to prevent further useless misunderstandings.

288
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,000
But I haven't said anything yet.

289
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,720
Why are you getting so ahead of yourself?

290
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,300
I didn't ask you out or propose to you.

291
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,490
I haven't asked anything of you yet.

292
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,080
- Which way are you going?
 - Why?

293
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,670
So I can go in the opposite direction.

294
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,530
   

295
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,420
You should have come home right away.

296
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,080
I have hotel reservations.

297
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,650
Did your blind date go well?

298
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,610
Since you can't judge a person from just one meeting,

299
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,300
you should make some time to meet her again even if you're busy.

300
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,000
I told you to stop making such arrangements for me.

301
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,350
I don't have anyone by my side.

302
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,190
Less than three years after your father died, your older brother died too.

303
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,420
I'd just like to see you have a family, at least.

304
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,840
You should have been like this to Hyung too.

305
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,960
If you allowed him to live with the woman he loved, he might still be alive.

306
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,200
I'll be there on the day of the anniversary.

307
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,760
He must be your son.

308
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,830
Ah, yes.

309
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,580
Is he the son who lives in France?

310
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,410
 So there is one! I thought all of them were taken, 

311
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:42,990
 but there is still a worthy bachelor left! 

312
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,480
 Where are you? Paris? Seoul? 

313
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,990
  
  

314
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,220
   

315
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,750
   

316
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,240
   

317
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,930
   
   

318
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,690
  I've arrived today. You're doing well, right? 

319
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,480
He lives in France apparently.

320
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,480
It's so lucky.

321
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,890
Someone would've taken him away if he lived here still.

322
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,630
If he couldn't find anyone there either, doesn't that mean there is something really wrong with him?

323
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:24,000
What about you? Are you just so well-off with no problems that you're like this?

324
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,420
It looks great. It suits you well!

325
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,370
Your daughter made a good choice for you.

326
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,920
My daughter works at a fashion company. She's the team leader for design.

327
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,690
No wonder, she has a great eye.

328
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,370
It's not just her good eye. She's smart and great at what she does.

329
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,820
I don't envy any other household's children.

330
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,150
Would you like me to wrap this up for you?

331
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,570
It's a hassle to try on multiple sets.

332
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,120
Are you going  to buy an outfit worth millions of won just to wear it once?

333
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,170
Think of how hard she'll have to work, will you?

334
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,830
What do you mean just for a day?

335
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,260
I'll wear this when I meet Yeong Eun's future husband,

336
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,360
at her kid's first birthday, and even on your 70th birthday.

337
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,000
- What would you like to do? 
 - We'll buy it.

338
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,060
Hey, it's too expensive!

339
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,350
What does it matter? This is for Dad's retirement ceremony.

340
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,830
I'm his only daughter. Am I not allowed to do this?

341
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,950
Your daughter can at least afford this, Mom.

342
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,230
Oh, you're so lucky.

343
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,530
I'll pay for it in interest-free, three monthly installments.

344
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,640
I'm in the red next month, too.

345
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,780
What can I do?

346
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,680
Fulfilling my parents' expectations of a well-off daughter is also one of my roles.

347
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,580
Oh, why is there so much I have to pay for?

348
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,800
The money coming in is tiny. The money going out is terrifying.

349
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,660
Your dad must have raised his shoulders sky-high.

350
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,200
Anyway, it's so great of you to pay off all of your father's debt.

351
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,650
There's still some house loans left.

352
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,920
The bank still owns the porch and the bathroom.

353
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,210
There's not much time left until your dad's retirement ceremony, right?

354
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,950
I'll be the family breadwinner soon.

355
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,980
So I have to hang in there no matter what.

356
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,020
I need to make sure nothing goes wrong with the event in two days, too.

357
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,550
My promotion depends on it.

358
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,460
Hey, your groans at this hour of the night are embarrassing.

359
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,300
You age more as you get lazier.

360
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:40,180
Then how diligently am I living right now?

361
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,800
Hey, let's hang up. I need to take care of myself if I'm to last.

362
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,370
You lead such an exhausting life.

363
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,020
What can I do?

364
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,000
It's a vicious world where if a designer gets old or gains weight,

365
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,820
they immediately say you have lost your touch.

366
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,690
I praise your ability to be so hard working,

367
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:59,490
but leave some room in your heart, okay?

368
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,610
You never know. A worthwhile man might fill it up.

369
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,490
Oh, quit it. Even without a man, my life is

370
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:27,490
full of cellulite that starts invading if I let down my guard for a moment.

371
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,680
-   I'm hanging up.   
 - Okay, bye.

372
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,980
Let's hang in there. Beauty is a skill, after all.

373
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,950
I need to hang in there.

374
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,690
Delivery!

375
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,810
Be swift and safe.

376
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,970
Alright, got it.

377
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,680
   

378
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,510
The clothes for Hye Rin have departed.

379
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,360
Have you prepared the picture of the main piece to upload on social media along with the caption?

380
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,050
- As soon as the show ends, it'll be posted. 
 - What about the home page renewal?

381
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,510
   
   

382
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,820
   
   

383
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,570
- Did you check all of the articles? 
 - I'm checking on my phone and desktop.

384
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,950
Sunbae, here is the relevant information I prepared for you and schedules of article releases. 
    

385
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,910
Alright, has everyone checked the main article?

386
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,900
Yes.

387
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,580
Can you send me a close up of Hye Rin's face?

388
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,030
- Ah, Assistant Manager Seo. 
 - Yes?

389
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,490
- Did you check EYEsurfer? 
 - I'm wrapping up right now.

390
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,110
We'll send our report as soon as we're done clipping.

391
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,400
Alright, make sure it's known that our main celeb is Hye Rin.

392
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,520
Center the close up of her face in the report.

393
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,910
Yes, sir.

394
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,410
- Okay. 
 - Delivery!

395
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,650
Are these relief supplies? How come they're in boxes?

396
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:49,170
She wants us to repackage these and send them again.

397
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,170
Delivery!

398
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,190
- They call this good taste? 
 - CEO.

399
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:02,270
I'll send over the other clothes we had on hold.

400
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,690
Geez, really?

401
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:07,050
Delivery.

402
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:10,640
Take them all back and tell them to bring the rest of what's on their hangers as is.

403
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,630
Delivery.

404
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,990
You've become slow now.

405
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,530
We're going to bring Hye Rin over here for now.

406
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,160
You can bring the clothes here.

407
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,720
But I think that's all I can do.

408
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,250
Nam Na Ri, go to Vision PR and do the fittings yourself.

409
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,850
- Yes. Let's go. 
 - Yes.

410
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,500
   

411
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,570
   
   

412
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,410
   

413
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,420
   

414
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,860
   

415
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,630
At The One's 30th founding anniversary event,

416
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,810
you're going to wear another country's brand?

417
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,420
I'll wear our clothes on the inside.

418
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,100
It'll just be the jacket and the purse.

419
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,590
This is just an accessory. Just being stylish.

420
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,030
It seems you want to look good since Hye Rin is coming...

421
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:06,800
No, no. Mr. Paris. I looked into his family a little bit.

422
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,020
His mom's side is really wealthy from running a solid distribution business.

423
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,820
His dad used to be a highly esteemed doctor.

424
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,450
Please put them in some water so they won't wilt.

425
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,000
Yes, Ma'am.

426
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:35,190
Hey, I sent the clothes for you to wear tomorrow to your room.

427
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,060
Did Do Hoon tell you I was here?

428
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,470
It's not just a memorial service. It's the 10th anniversary one.

429
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,760
We need to make sure it's grand and proper.

430
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,590
 Make sure to dress formally. 

431
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,250
I can dress myself.

432
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:51,030
 I've already matched the tie and shirt, so you can wear everything as is. 

433
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,220
Goodbye, then.

434
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,970
Yoon Jae Gook is a free-spirited, true Parisian.

435
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:14,530
He's a wealthy intellectual who also posses sensibility.

436
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,890
He's a rare gem.

437
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,020
Now I see why the CEO was so insistent  about it.

438
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,760
Won't we have a lot of pictures taken tomorrow?

439
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,950
So I need to help protect Yoon Jae Gook's family image.

440
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,460
How about this then?

441
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,820
It's by a skilled designer only a few know about.

442
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,420
Is it from Paris? New York? It's not Milan, is it?

443
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,890
The color looks rich. Who's the designer?

444
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:47,350
It's me. It's Sonó Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun's 2021 S/S Collection.

445
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,390
The main host tomorrow is you.

446
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:52,940
Make sure you memorize all the details of the new items.

447
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,820
Let's get it together, okay?

448
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,670
Your mistake becomes mine.

449
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:01,190
I'm pretty desperate, got it?

450
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,490
All of these are so boring.

451
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:18,130
Please contact Jeong Yoon Gi for me.

452
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,830
Well, these people here know about the outfits' concepts better than all.

453
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,420
You can trust them to do well.

454
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,930
I'm saying it because I don't think they can do that.

455
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:29,430
I have a therapy appointment for 5 PM, so make sure we end by 4:30.

456
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,120
That's just unrealistic.

457
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,330
Jeong Yoon Gi's schedule is already fully booked.

458
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,620
And he's not someone who can just come

459
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,790
when I ask him to come.

460
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,600
Oh, so it can't be done?

461
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,820
Then, I can't wear it.

462
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,030
Hey, Hye Rin.

463
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,090
I'm a pro at this, too.

464
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,430
I'm valued for my good eye,

465
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,970
so I can't just wear anything.

466
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,400
I thought you promised yesterday that it would all be neatly settled.

467
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,790
Team Leader Ha, the preparations for tomorrow's event are going well, right?

468
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,230
Yes, the fitting is going on right now.

469
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,090
The higher ups have already been informed that Hye Rin will be there. Make sure it happens no matter what.

470
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,860
She's trying to change the design.

471
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,160
It's not something I can't fix on my end.

472
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,000
She's still there, right? Just keep her there for now.

473
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,210
I've got no energy. My blood sugar level is dropping.

474
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,000
You said we'd eat lunch together, yet you're eating the appetizer first by yourself?

475
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,330
Ah, lunch, right. I'm sorry.

476
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,650
We can't eat together. You're fine with eating alone, right?

477
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:42,330
What about the matter from yesterday? Did it get resolved well?

478
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,370
Nope. It looks like it's about to start now.

479
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,430
The sleeves should go up to here. And this, to here.

480
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,250
Did you write it down?

481
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,010
Classic is the concept Sonó is aiming for right now.

482
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,690
Then, put it on a mannequin.

483
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,650
I wear things in my own style.

484
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,820
It would be difficult make alterations as it would change our design.

485
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,770
Does putting designer on your business card make you a designer?

486
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:21,470
Honestly, who wears domestic brands like these nowadays?

487
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:25,220
If it wasn't for the contracts that my company signed, I would never wear them either.

488
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,440
It's embarrassing.

489
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,940
It's embarrassing?

490
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,890
What makes you so great?

491
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:42,760
If I wasn't so great, why would you guys be here doing this?

492
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,880
- What? 
 - If you don't want to alter it, then don't.

493
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,330
I just won't wear it then.

494
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:58,440
We've done QC seven, eight times just to make that one jacket,

495
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,990
and thrown away yards of fabric to adjust the location of the pocket by 1 mm.

496
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,270
There's a whole lot of time, effort, and people

497
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:07,170
that went into making those clothes that you threw down.

498
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:10,430
Doesn't everyone put in at least that much effort to earn a living?

499
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:14,280
Why are you whining about that to me?

500
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,300
Manager Nam.

501
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,650
Team Leader.

502
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:22,630
Stop and apologize.

503
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,730
- Team Leader. 
 - Apologize.

504
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,560
I'm sorry.

505
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:41,460
I accept your apology, so now tell me you'll fix it.

506
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,470
I didn't pay for my 1,000,000 followers, you know?

507
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,530
I'm not abusing my power or making a scene.

508
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:51,480
I'm just taking responsibility for my job and doing my best, too.

509
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,290
I'm sorry.

510
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,860
I won't be able to continue with the fitting anymore because I have another appointment.

511
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,960
You can send a picture when the design has been adjusted.

512
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,460
I'll decide whether I'll wear it or not after I take a look.

513
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,560
There will be no alterations to the design.

514
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,200
Then, I won't do it either.

515
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,320
I'll talk to CEO Seok about getting a jewelry sponsorship with Cartier.

516
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,940
One of the three limited edition pieces in Korea.

517
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,800
Let's compromise here.

518
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,390
Did I hear that correctly?

519
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,320
Tell me so.

520
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,650
She said it's a Cartier limited edition.

521
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,990
Only three exist in Korea.

522
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,960
Oh, I'm drained of energy.

523
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,720
It's okay. You can do it.

524
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,620
Without the alteration I want, there will not be a compromise.

525
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:47,070
Send the picture by tonight, or else I won't wear it.

526
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,140
Hye Rin, if you leave like this, we can't help but feel hurt.

527
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:01,250
Let's talk reasonably and rationally. Okay, Hye Rin?

528
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:13,750
I'm sorry. The way she acted just... crushed my pride.

529
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:21,500
For our collection, we've made 32 sets... so a total of 64 pieces, right?

530
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,440
Na Ri, you've been running around since last year trying to get the fabric.

531
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,620
Seon Joo and So Yeong, you were turned down by fairs and shop managers.

532
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,830
You stayed up every night for two months to alter and alter again.

533
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:40,710
But no matter how well we made these clothes,

534
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,270
there is no meaning if they are piled up unsold at stores.

535
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,240
I didn't bow my head to Hye Rin because I wanted to dress her in these clothes.

536
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:55,880
It's because by dressing her, hundreds of thousands of people

537
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,610
can recognize your hard work and skills.

538
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,210
If people wear our clothes and realize,

539
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:09,440
"Ah, this is great. They made it so well. It's pretty."

540
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,750
Then that's good enough.

541
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,180
That's our pride.

542
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,450
Hye Rin asked for alterations, but we won't do that.

543
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:24,030
So even though it's late, we will look into recruiting other celebrities.

544
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,170
- So Yeong, bring your phone and follow me. 
 - Okay.

545
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,450
Hello?

546
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,870
Team Leader Cho Seok, do you remember me?

547
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,870
I'm Manager Nam Na Ri from The One.

548
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,930
- Yes, yes, yes.
 - I'd like to speak to Lee Hye In.

549
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,870
- You're not free? I see. 
 - I was wondering what Tae In's schedule is like tomorrow?

550
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:46,450
We were caught up in a situation.

551
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:49,000
The One, yes.

552
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,840
Oh, the true celebrity is you, La Ra.

553
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,120
You can't even call that an event without you.

554
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:02,270
You're not a fill-in. There was a mistake in the logistics. Cartier's limited edition?

555
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:07,860
You'll consider it if we gift you that precious one of the three that exist in Korea?

556
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,310
Oh, she's not falling for it.

557
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,850
Hi, I was wondering about Yeo Ji Yoon's schedule.

558
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,660
It's Ha Yeong Eun. How have you been?

559
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:27,260
Oh, you're in New York.

560
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,830
It's Ha Yeong Eun from The One. Do you remember me?

561
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,090
Yoo Na?

562
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:41,330
Oh, the number must've changed. I'm sorry.

563
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,870
   

564
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:57,040
   

565
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,740
What should we do? Everyone's saying they don't have time.

566
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,670
Get Shin Yoo Jeong's contact information.

567
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,210
I know that it's highly not likely,

568
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:12,830
but at least I can try to beg her to do a good deed for the sake of domestic brands.

569
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:17,820
Who knows? My sincerity might bring good luck.

570
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,540
Okay.

571
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,770
You've worked really hard. You can go home and finish preparing for the event tomorrow.

572
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:26,120
   

573
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,630
   

574
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:33,960
Alright, we're going to delete all of our social media promotional posts on Hye Rin.

575
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,710
Yes, Senior Manager Gwak?

576
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:39,000
Why would you put up psychedelic lights? Is it  a cabaret?

577
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,890
Tomorrow's a club. A club!

578
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,930
Okay, I'm going to check the scene out.

579
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:49,110
Delete Hye Rin from everything.

580
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,280
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

581
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,460
No, I don't have a scheduled appointment with Shin Yoo Jeong.

582
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:58,460
If it's hard to talk to her directly, could you relay a message?

583
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,520
Please do me this favor.

584
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,630
What are you living so diligently for?

585
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:09,220
What are you doing here?

586
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:13,460
I had a lunch meeting, but I got stood up.

587
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,050
You're always leading a diverse and hard-working life whenever I see you, Ha Yeong Eun.

588
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:30,000
It's not that I'm hard-working. Rather there's nothing else I can do.

589
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,220
   

590
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,910
Whose photo is this?

591
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:43,780
It's an unknown artist's work.

592
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,860
The exposure is a mess, and the composition isn't good either.

593
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,830
You can immediately tell that the photographer is an amateur.

594
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,360
There is lens flare from the streetlights.

595
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,040
So it makes you feel like you're actually seeing it with your own eyes, and not through a lens.

596
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,140
I don't know anything about exposure or composition.

597
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:08,280
But I just wonder, who is at the end of this path?

598
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:12,250
How cold were these rain showers?

599
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:16,150
That's what I think of, and it resonates with my heart.

600
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,840
He's a professional then.

601
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,820
Since he was able to touch someone.

602
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,800
   

603
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,630
 Come look! Come look! 
 (in French) 

604
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,890
 They're photos of Paris. 
 (in French) 

605
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,420
 How much? 
 (in French) 

606
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,850
 20 euros. 
 (in French) 

607
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:28,930
 Hey, Ha Yeong Eun, how could you do this? 

608
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,130
 This is what I'm wearing to the Chanel show tomorrow! 

609
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,330
 What if the CEO finds out about this? 

610
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:36,880
 We're not there to mingle with celebrities tomorrow. 

611
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,160
 You're there as the junior of the design team, to assist your seniors and learn directly. 

612
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,610
 You can do that for me instead. 

613
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:48,170
 - Chi Sook. 
 - This is why my dad paid for your overseas tuition. 

614
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:52,940
 Otherwise, how would you have been able to study fashion abroad in Paris for three years? 

615
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:57,200
 That was the money I received to help you study, and I already did more than enough in return. 

616
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,780
 I never slept more than three hours because I was doing all your homework. 

617
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,660
 You must be quite skilled then. 

618
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,710
 So just keep doing well, okay, Yeong Eun? 

619
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,890
I'm afraid that I'll go back to that time

620
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:39,900
and end up in a hopeless situation again. That's why.

621
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,170
Although a callus takes a long time to form,

622
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,730
you can get scratched in an instant.

623
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,850
That's why I'm charging forward with all my strength.

624
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:52,390
But doesn't it get hard when you try your best yet no one acknowledges it?

625
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:56,920
Everyone says that only the designers who create their own brands are amazing,

626
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,850
but those of us who create under a company name have 12 fairs in a year.

627
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,880
- We've never made the same clothes twice. 
 - I know.

628
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,030
I take photos for countless fashion shows and magazine covers in a year.

629
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,680
If a superior orders for clothes that sold well in the summer

630
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,060
to be sold again in the winter with longer sleeves, it'd be profitable.

631
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,560
But then they shouldn't be designers.

632
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,630
Oh, of course. Creators have their own pride, after all.

633
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,110
It's a job losing its popularity,

634
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:24,480
and although people may not know that people like me exist, it's fine.

635
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,420
What is there to prove to others?

636
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,810
I can just prove my worth to myself.

637
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:31,230
You were cool in Busan,

638
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,160
and you're cool here, too.

639
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,540
Yes, Na Ri? No updates on Shin Yoo Jeong yet?

640
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,470
Alright.

641
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:52,830
Let's not waste our time feeding useless hope. Let's go.

642
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:56,550
I need to go back to the office and confirm some things for the event.

643
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:59,220
Can you help me?

644
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,340
It's a precious set.

645
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,870
Oh! It'll drag on the floor.

646
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:11,970
This is not what I expected when I decided to come all the way to Korea.

647
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:15,220
I started getting frozen shoulder after holding my phone for too long.

648
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,560
And you said that you don't have much going on, and that you're free.

649
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,190
I meant that I'm only available for Ha Yeong Eun.

650
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,500
If I had heard that a long time ago, my heart would've fluttered.

651
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:27,990
Why not now?

652
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,850
Because you were my boss's blind date.

653
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:33,390
Me at this age, with a man whom my superior chose for his son-in-law?

654
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,890
Our industry is tiny, so rumors would spread like wildfire.

655
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:37,660
I'd have to leave my job.

656
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:40,260
Because of the rumors, there wouldn't be anywhere to go.

657
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,700
I don't want to go through any of that.

658
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,520
In your reasons for not wanting to, I'm not included, right?

659
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:52,820
My hormones did react.

660
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:57,560
But a movie ending that's been spoiled is no fun.

661
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,660
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.

662
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:26,560
Can't you be honest with me just once?

663
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:33,200
If not now, there'll be no reason for us to see each other again.

664
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:21,200
It's a shame you're Yoon Jae Gook out of all people.

665
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:26,020
That's as far as I can go in response.

666
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:48,520
Will you come to Paris in the spring for fashion week?

667
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,650
If I'm not fired and have endured until then?

668
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,960
Then I guess you can't get fired.

669
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,370
Have a safe trip.

670
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:00,670
My number will be the same.

671
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:07,420
♫   No one knew, even I didn't know   ♫

672
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:12,860
♫  It was growing  ♫

673
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,620
♫  The love  ♫

674
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:26,460
♫  Which will fill my heart is you  ♫

675
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:30,590
 It seemed as though you liked this photo, so I'm sharing it with you. 

676
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:34,820
♫   Please hold my hand   ♫

677
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,090
♫   Please don't leave me alone   ♫

678
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:39,560
 - Hey, how's it going? 
 - Hey, did the photoshoot just end?   (in French) 

679
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,010
 Yes.  
  (in French) 

680
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,230
 It was just sold for 20 euros.  
  (in French) 

681
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:49,870
 Here's your 20 euros.  
  (in French) 

682
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:52,380
 Someone bought that? Who?  
  (in French) 

683
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,420
 Some girl.  
  (in French) 

684
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:09,990
Noona, it's me.

685
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,620
Can I ask you for a favor?

686
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,690
   

687
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,250
   

688
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,980
   
   

689
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:30,650
   
   

690
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,980
   

691
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:40,750
Oh, Team Leader.

692
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,310
It's 15 minutes before the event starts.

693
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:47,550
Is the main celeb even coming?

694
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:52,610
- Shin Yoo Jeong! 
 - Get the camera.

695
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,960
♫  Oh, you're keeping me up  ♫

696
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,690
♫  You're keeping me up  ♫

697
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:00,980
♫  Oh, you're keeping me up  ♫

698
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,710
♫  You're keeping me up  ♫

699
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:04,880
♫  Oh, you're keeping me up  ♫

700
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,650
♫  You're keeping me up  ♫

701
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,780
♫  Oh, you're keeping me up  ♫

702
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,350
♫  You're keeping me up  ♫

703
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:12,460
Hello.

704
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,310
I'm Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun of The One.

705
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:20,260
I'm Shin Yoo Jeong.

706
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,260
Oh my, nice to meet you. I'm Hwang Chi Sook.

707
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,000
Hey, are you joking right now?

708
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,890
Did you guys just turn me down?

709
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:46,930
Let's get this straight. We're the ones that got turned down.

710
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:50,290
You contacted me this morning saying you weren't going to attend.

711
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:52,780
Then how was Shin Yoo Jeong able to attend on such short notice?

712
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:55,930
Clearly, you were two-timing me!

713
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:59,970
Two-timing? No. Shin Yoo Jeong just has high standards.

714
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,920
She recognized The One's worth, so knowing she was a fill-in,

715
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,750
willingly and very, very happily, she came all the way over here.

716
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:09,240
So why don't you just give it a rest tonight?

717
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,160
Yes!

718
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:16,060
What are you doing?

719
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,430
Director! The models are all finished preparing.

720
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,090
- Okay, let's go in. 
 - Okay.

721
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:22,610
Okay.

722
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:32,540
Goo Seon Yeong, please get ready.

723
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,990
Oh, this?

724
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,290
   

725
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:04,690
 I don't usually attend events like that. 

726
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:07,020
 Why? Because it's a domestic brand? 

727
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,370
 You shouldn't be biased like that. 

728
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:12,230
 The quality and pride of Korean brands are as good as luxury brands. 

729
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:17,860
 And all the designers work fiercely to create their own pieces. 

730
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,070
 Is your friend a designer there? 

731
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:22,190
 What? 

732
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:23,950
 Where? 

733
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:25,330
 The One. 

734
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:26,680
   

735
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,950
 I'm Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun of The One. 

736
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:05,550
   

737
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:30,320
   
   

738
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:35,400
   
   

739
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,820
 Did you send me knowing who she is? 

740
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:41,670
How did you catch on so quickly?

741
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:49,960
You don't know who Ha Yeong Eun is, do you?

742
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,690
What?

743
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,980
   

744
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,860
- Good job. 
 - You too.

745
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,450
I compliment myself, too.

746
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:13,920
Celeb recruitment was a huge struggle all the way until the end.

747
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,920
You should ask for a promotion or just quit.

748
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,530
You're capable and have more than enough experience.

749
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,020
Surely there's some place else you could go.

750
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,470
She's not going anywhere.

751
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:28,610
It's much better to stay.

752
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:31,440
This is on the house. The expiration date is tomorrow.

753
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,380
- Sunbae, long time no see. 
 - Long time no see.

754
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,260
Thank you.

755
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:36,760
That darn sales graph.

756
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,210
Putting your life on the line for just a decimal place

757
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:42,570
was awful so I left the industry, but it's not much different here.

758
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:45,000
Because now, my life is tied to the accounting ledger instead.

759
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,700
You heard it, right? This is why I have to endure.

760
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:51,500
It's better to work where I've established myself with my own skills and hard work.

761
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,790
At least find a man.

762
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:55,600
I found one.

763
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,780
There she goes again.

764
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:03,580
It really made my heart flutter.

765
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:11,220
Those looks, manners, and his physique hidden under his shirt.

766
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,850
You've managed to see under his shirt already?

767
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:16,620
Were you able to check all his organs too? They're all in place?

768
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:20,760
If you had slept with him, I would've had to go mourn after your death from overworking your heart.

769
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,580
I want to sleep with him.

770
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:25,160
You crazy girl.

771
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,820
When he grabbed me,

772
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,500
do you know what I heard?

773
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,550
The sound of my knees cracking.

774
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:37,570
Stop the botox and move onto cartilage injections now. We're at that age.

775
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:39,920
It really scared me.

776
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,510
This is what aging means! You know what?

777
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:45,960
While I'm still a day younger,

778
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,820
I'd like to be touched by someone who really, truly loves me

779
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,880
and touch and hug him back. That's what I'd like to do.

780
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:57,820
That way, I think I'll be less sorry towards my body.

781
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:03,080
So I'm going to sleep with that man.

782
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,350
I'm going to sleep with him no matter what.

783
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:12,300
I'm a bit jealous though.

784
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,960
The fact that you still get excited over a man and make such a fuss over it.

785
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,850
That's dangerous of you to say, for someone who has a husband.

786
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:21,820
A husband is not a man; he's family.

787
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,730
Your spouse is not someone whom you get excited over.

788
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:25,580
He's someone who makes you feel lonely even though he's there.

789
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:30,290
So enjoy it to the fullest while you can.

790
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:48,510
 Team Leader, today was amazing! 

791
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:50,130
 The responses regarding Shin Yoo Jeong are on fire! 

792
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:51,540
  Time to become the director and executive next! 

793
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,520
  - Team Leader, please treat us to something! 
 - Wow, no way! 

794
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,710
 Congratulations! 

795
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:12,380
  Rather than a man, having tangible, material things is more exciting to me. 

796
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:14,120
  You're so materialistic. 

797
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:20,080
  Those who say money can't buy happiness are usually those without money. 

798
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,560
 How cruel of you. 

799
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,120
 Men and love... 

800
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:28,910
 To me, those are just our hormones playing pranks. 

801
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,560
  That breaks my heart. 

802
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,720
  Hey, I really don't have many years left. 

803
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:39,150
  During that time, I need to get promoted to prolong my lifespan. 

804
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:43,550
  During my 20s, I had no job. 

805
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:45,720
 During my 30s, I had no house. 

806
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,310
  I'm nearly at my forties, yet I have no future. 

807
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,030
  Life is such a joke. 

808
00:56:54,340 --> 00:57:01,160
  The fatigue from life overtakes my pheromones. 

809
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:05,390
  So I'm unable to feel excitement. 

810
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:15,620
   
   

811
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:24,610
Manager Nam, the samples of the main outfit in other colors are here, right?

812
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:27,710
While the reactions to Shin Yoo Jeong are big, we need to deliver the photo books to the stores.

813
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:30,280
So we need to work quickly today.

814
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:34,630
But, Team Leader, what happened with the photographer?

815
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:36,610
What do you mean?

816
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:49,490
Mr. Yoon Jae Gook, what are you doing here?

817
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:52,890
Why? Is something wrong?

818
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,770
No, not really.

819
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:59,990
I decided to take on this photo shoot.

820
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:17,940
By any chance,

821
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:22,140
do you know someone

822
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:27,370
named Yoon Soo Wan?

823
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,150
   

824
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,440
 I had forgotten. 

825
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:57,130
 Or I thought I had forgotten that name, 

826
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:02,790
 but the name came to me again. 

827
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,530
I do.

828
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,180
How do you know him?

829
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:15,210
  My once burning youth. 

830
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,880
  But a name that met its end. 

831
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:25,220
  A name I need to let go, 

832
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:29,450
  yet I could not let go. 

833
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:31,530
 So I... 

834
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:36,080
I am in the process of breaking up right now

835
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,170
with that person.

836
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:32,390
   

837
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:34,310
 Can I ask how you know him? 

838
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:37,140
 Can I ask why I need to answer that? 

839
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:39,330
 That Mr. Paris is J? 

840
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:41,140
 An interview? 

841
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,970
 She's that Ha Yeong Eun. 

842
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:46,450
 Why did I return? 

843
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:48,380
 He knows Soo Wan. 

844
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,600
  What? How does he know him? 

845
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,080
 What did I want to ask? 

846
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,710
  He's a photographer who only works with high-end brands. 

847
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:57,270
  - It'll be the day after tomorrow at 3 PM. 
 - You don't seem too into it. 

848
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:58,710
  You don't have to go this far. 

849
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:00,220
 By "future" you mean... 

850
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:01,770
 Copies always exist, but... 

851
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:03,140
 Ha Yeong Eun! Ha Yeong Eun! 

852
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:05,350
 I'll find out how it happened. 

853
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:06,870
 I'm sorry. 

854
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:10,180
  - Wrap it up. 
 - If we get caught that you went on the blind date instead of me at Busan... 

855
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:12,750
  - Yeong Eun! 
 - I'm not the only one who will be called forward. 

856
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:15,510
 Show Jae Gook in. 

857
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:17,570
 It was hard to build up my reputation, so I'll have to protect it. 

858
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:19,710
 Why are you suddenly getting into it? 

859
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:23,490
 I'm a little interested. There is something I need to find out. 

860
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:26,390
  Was the time you spent with me an uncomfortable misunderstanding? 

861
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:28,790
  - It was just a happening. 
 - Was it just a happening between you and Yoon Soo Wan as well? 

862
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:33,010
  Aren't you curious about the relationship between me and Yoon Soo Wan? 

863
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,400
