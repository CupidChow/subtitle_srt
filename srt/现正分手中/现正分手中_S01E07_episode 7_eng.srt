1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:06,140
   

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,160
   

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,510
   

4
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,030
   
   

5
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:32,970


6
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,040
   

7
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,450
We made a bet with Jae Gook at the ski resort back then.

8
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,420
- Really? Soo Wan did that? 
  - Yes.

9
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,170
They were fighting over who was going to go down first, and Jae Gook fell over badly.

10
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,830
That's right. I remember now.

11
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,770
Thankfully, he only scuffed his knee, but we took him to the hospital.

12
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,120
Soo Wan really liked Jae Gook.

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,110
He really adored his little brother.

14
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,200
He would go wait outside ahead of time if Jae Gook was coming home,

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,510
and he always let Jae Gook eat whatever was tasty and good first.

16
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,530
He acted like he was the only one in the world with a little brother.

17
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,780
By the way, tell me about you.

18
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,330
I heard you told your mom you were seeing someone.

19
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,230
Yes.

20
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,330
What kind of person is she?

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,410
A good person. And she's also a person that I really like.

22
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,300
That makes me more curious.

23
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,110
What does she do?

24
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,940
When are you going introduce her to your mom?

25
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,870
- Cheers. 
 - Hurray!

26
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,930
Good work!

27
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,920
Great job!

28
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,950
I'll enjoy this!

29
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,270
   
 Good work! 

30
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,460
   

31
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,210
Noona, what exactly are you trying to do?

32
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,600
I'm worried about your mother.

33
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,350
There's no mother who forgets her child.

34
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,490
I understand what you are saying, but it doesn't change anything.

35
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,250
So don't ever do this kind of thing again.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,270
Then why were you unable to answer?

37
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,470
In front of your mother, you didn't say anything.

38
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:02,200
 Of all the times, why now? 

39
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,060
   

40
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,220
 Have you been well? 

41
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,110
 This call that's obviously the wrong number, 

42
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,760
 was it really just a simple coincidence? 

43
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,680
 A greeting from the seasons past 

44
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,420
 that has no warmth or meaning... 

45
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,050
   
   

46
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,440
 Now, that's all it means... 

47
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,070
   

48
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,880
   

49
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,990
   

50
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,630
It makes me proud. It's so gratifying.

51
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,900
That's a little over the top when you've only sold 70 pieces.

52
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,240
Oh my, don't you know?

53
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,420
We're getting bombarded with requests to expand the number of pre-orders,

54
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,830
so we put in an order for 30,000 pieces.

55
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,290
Why wouldn't I feel pride?

56
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,510
Making such a big deal over a piece of jersey.

57
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,710
People would think it was the season's sold-out piece.

58
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,520
It just might be! Not like it would be our first time.

59
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,010
But are the rumors true?

60
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,770
A lot of people are saying Team Leader Ha got a kickback from the factory.

61
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,600
I am just worried in case it is true.

62
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,560
That little...

63
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,980
I'm not surprised.

64
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,890
We work in a field where people gossip about how two people who only brushed past each other slept together.

65
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,360
But develop some imagination for a change.

66
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,700
How can you spread the same gossip for decades? It's boring.

67
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,090
It would be stranger if nothing happened

68
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,900
because you insisted on working with the factory that was guilty of copying.

69
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,810
In the time that you used to wonder about what happened overnight to the team next door,

70
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,530
if you had concentrated on your design instead,

71
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,000
a newly launched brand wouldn't have been outshone by us.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,210
It's really a shame.

73
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,520
- Are you all done? 
 - Yes. 
 - Let's go.

74
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,440
A real shame...

75
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,620
Seriously...

76
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,090
Are you happy that you won?

77
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,610
Yes.

78
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,150
What are you going to do about Yoon Jae Gook?

79
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,360
What do you mean?

80
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,170
Hey, why do men and women love?

81
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,040
For themselves. To be happy. That's why.

82
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,900
So?

83
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,270
But you'll keep being reminded of whose brother he is,

84
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,750
and he's going to keep thinking about whose woman you were.

85
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,070
How can you ignore all that and only care about how happy you two are?

86
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,060
Do you think you can do that?

87
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,480
We have to order additional fabric for our pre-orders.

88
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,870
Can you sign-off on this first?

89
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,600
Hey!

90
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,660
 Director, it is time for your meeting. 

91
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,440
I understand.

92
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:36,310
Listen to me. If you go on like this, you are really going to get hurt.

93
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,220
Please bring up how we would like to add a link on our social media account

94
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,590
and hold a sponsored shopping spree event with the influencer.

95
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,980
Hey! I'm the director!

96
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,410
Who are you bossing around?

97
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,990
She got me again.

98
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,240
I'm sorry for suddenly making such a request.

99
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,740
I wanted to gift the jersey dresses to my acquaintances,

100
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,420
but I couldn't get a hold of any.

101
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,910
Luckily, we had some extras on hand.

102
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,850
Thank you for making our label known to your acquaintances.

103
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,290
You are a friend of Jae Gook after all.

104
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,660
Our families have been very close for a long time.

105
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,600
Ah, I see.

106
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,670
Oh, with Soo Wan too.

107
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,080
He's Jae Gook's older brother.

108
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,990
He died in a car accident ten years ago.

109
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,230
It happened because of the rain.

110
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,710
It poured that day.

111
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,830
He went out to meet someone,

112
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,580
and he ended up getting into an accident.

113
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,380
What's the reason you're telling me that?

114
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,510
Because he's Jae Gook's brother.

115
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,760
   

116
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,600
Is she busy?

117
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,770
   

118
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,840
What do you plan to do with Jae Gook?

119
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,660
Strange. My question isn't that hard to answer.

120
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,510
Jae Gook couldn't give an answer either.

121
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,990
He said he was seeing someone, so his mother has high expectations.

122
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,020
But whom he's dating, what her name is,

123
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,200
what she does...

124
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,930
he couldn't tell her a single thing.

125
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,940
Why do you think he's being evasive?

126
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,720
What's your point?

127
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,720
I'm asking whether you think it's right to be in this relationship.

128
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,310
   

129
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,890
It's not right. Not right.

130
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:53,320
The clothes worn in the third episode don't match the location and the atmosphere at all.

131
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,380
Anyway, as a result, the brand name was searched 22% more compared to the previous week,

132
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,950
and the jacket worn in episode seven has sold out.

133
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,110
If you look at the graph on the next page, you'll see the comparison between before and after the sponsorship.

134
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,550
Why don't you explain the rest?

135
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,900
Yes. We are planning in the future to expose the brand in two more episodes.

136
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,180
It will be shown consecutively in episodes 15 and 16 during the last week.

137
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,320
The female protagonist will also share on her social media

138
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,900
so we are planning on carrying out everything as discussed.

139
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,930
That's all.

140
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,370
Is that it?

141
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,170
Is there something else that you would like to say, Director?

142
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,860
No, nothing in particular.

143
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,670
Then we will end our product placement report here.

144
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,720
See you next time.

145
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,990
Have a good day.

146
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,460
What's wrong with him?

147
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,540
Why is he avoiding me all of a sudden?

148
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,390
Is he feeling bashful all of a sudden?

149
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,980
Or is he shy after all this time?

150
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,660
 Because my heart hurts. 

151
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:13,000
 Why do you always judge and make your own assumptions about me as you want? 

152
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,900
Because of the misunderstanding! But still?

153
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,980
And he doesn't even want to see my face anymore? Why?

154
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,800
 Are you busy? 

155
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,910
 Yes. 

156
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,450
What is this? Why is it so short?

157
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:40,310
 Please figure out Mr. J's studio and staff needs as soon as possible. 

158
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,960
 Okay. 

159
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,200
 And please emphasize on the promotional materials that he has an exclusive contract with The One. 

160
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,000
 Okay. 

161
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,810
Ah, damn it.

162
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,940
 When will you return the Sonó products that you rented last month? 

163
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,610
Let me see if you can respond to this with one word.

164
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,890
   

165
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,980
I knew it.

166
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,850
Hello, Hwang Chi Sook speaking.

167
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,730
This is Gwak Soo Ho. I'm calling about the rented products you were inquiring about.

168
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,730
We will also gather products rented from Lamong and return them together this week.

169
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,260
Do whatever you want!

170
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,350
Do whatever you want?

171
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,490
She was acting so crazy that it shook my mental state for a bit.

172
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,300
I will return to my original self now.

173
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,330
The sharp, cool-headed, rational me.

174
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,920
Do whatever you want? Okay!

175
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,770
In that regard, how about you go play outside?

176
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,590
I'm not playing.

177
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,890
There is something I have to think about so I'm concentrating.

178
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,210
You have both fame and money!

179
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,780
Your life is a path of flowers, your love life is promising, and it looks like you're going to be a filial son.

180
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,520
So what's the problem?

181
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,660
You're probably wrong about me being filial.

182
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,250
Why?

183
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,390
What is this silence? Oh.

184
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,510
Your mom won't be satisfied because she doesn't have the right background? Is that it?

185
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,090
Maybe.

186
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,260
Hey! What's wrong with Team Leader Ha?

187
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,510
She's smart, competent, and sensible.

188
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,090
Sonó has been at the top for the past 10 years!

189
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,500
Honestly, she's the one pulling Sonó along. Those guts and vigor!

190
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,880
To be honest, I think she's a lot better than a global dandelion like you who lives as you desire.

191
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,290
My mom probably won't see those qualities.

192
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,090
So why not?

193
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,810
- Because of Hyung.  (older brother)  
 - Me?

194
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,430
What did I do?

195
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,180
Hyung Soo Wan.

196
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,990
Why are you mentioning Soo Wan all of a sudden?

197
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,580
She's that person.

198
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,460
The person  Soo Wan said he was going to marry ten years ago.

199
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,230
Oh, right.

200
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,990
What the heck.

201
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,040
Okay, well.

202
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,740
You can't change how someone feels. No one can stop that.

203
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,170
But, Jae Gook, I just...

204
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,500
I don't think I can cheer you on.

205
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,180
I like her, and she likes me.

206
00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:00,400
Do we really need other people's permission, support, or acknowledgment?

207
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,350
You were in Paris ten years ago.

208
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,080
At that time, I was the one who was next to Soo Wan.

209
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,480
He couldn't eat or sleep. But what happened?

210
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,890
- It's because he gave up. 
 - No. He couldn't just be happy by himself!

211
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,540
I couldn't just be happy by myself,

212
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,590
so I've been living quietly until now.

213
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,100
That's why I stayed back in Paris.

214
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,580
I didn't even use my real name when I was working.

215
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,820
Just in case my name or existence might be bothersome.

216
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,470
Jae Gook.

217
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:36,290
Hyung, since I was born,

218
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:40,290
I've never made a choice for my sake.

219
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,880
But the only choice I made for myself,

220
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,420
just for my happiness, is Ha Yeong Eun.

221
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,680
But you still can't cheer me on?

222
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,780
What about Mother? What will you tell Mother?

223
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,560
The truth.

224
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:06,010
I'm contemplating when to tell her, since I'm not the only one involved.

225
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,480
Is Team Leader Ha as determined as you are?

226
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:13,320
If not, you shouldn't tell your mother just because you want to.

227
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,750
Team Leader Ha might end up suffering much harsher consequences.

228
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,650
Think about it carefully. This is Korea.

229
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,670
   

230
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,350
Who is Shin Yoo Jeong?

231
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,480
- Noona Yoo Jeong? 
 - How do you two know each other?

232
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,960
Why are you suddenly asking about that?

233
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,400
Because she asked me if I was going to keep seeing you.

234
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,250
Why do I have to be asked something like that by Shin Yoo Jeong?

235
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:55,970
How close are you two that she's asking if our relationship is right?

236
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,760
She was my brother's fiancée.

237
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,950
What do you...

238
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:14,760
No way... Even while he was seeing me in Paris?

239
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,300
Yes.

240
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,830
He was still engaged then.

241
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,270
The wedding date was also set.

242
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,320
I see...

243
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,040
"I see"? That's it?

244
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,290
Then what should I say instead? Do you want me to curse?

245
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,380
If you want to, feel free.

246
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,340
Yoon Soo Wan turned out to be a jerk!

247
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,790
Dating two women at once? Isn't that the worst?

248
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,730
- I agree. 
 - I got stabbed hard in the back. That bastard.

249
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:05,180
- I also agree. 
 - I'm a fool for being head over heels for that kind of a jerk for two months.

250
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,040
What's going on? Why aren't you agreeing?

251
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,880
You were young, in love, and trusted him.

252
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,790
You're too biased.

253
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:29,570
Who's going to say anything? It's up to me. I'm siding with my woman.

254
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,710
Are you really okay?

255
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:42,950
It's about your brother but also about me.

256
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:53,170
It's about us. You and me.

257
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:58,990
♫  Seems just like a burned moth  ♫

258
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,780
♫  Stay my tiny dreams  ♫

259
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,410
♫  When the one star in my small room goes out  ♫

260
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:14,060
That's it. Just do this.

261
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:18,990
You just leave everything to me and lean on me.

262
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:26,830
♫  My close friend, you will come find me, right?  ♫

263
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,080
   

264
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,160
Really...

265
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,100
Chief Go, oh my.

266
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,830
Have you seen the daily sales status report?

267
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,460
The main season hasn't even started yet.

268
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,790
Sonó is talking about how there are 20,000 or 30,000 pre-orders for a jersey

269
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:09,440
while Clair Marie is not getting any hype after receiving all the support it could get.

270
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,470
We're all trying our best.

271
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,640
Trying your best is a given.

272
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,720
You need to prove it with sales.

273
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,900
Because you're only trying your best but not doing well, I feel shamed to face the CEO.

274
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,120
Oh, CEO...

275
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,580
Chief.

276
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,030
What?

277
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,930
There's something I would like to tell you in private.

278
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,400
Go ahead.

279
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,190
I saw Clair Marie's performance report.

280
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,970
We supported it so much. How disappointing.

281
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,000
Father, can you please not talk about work when we're eating?

282
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,730
How are things going with Jae Gook?

283
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,530
Well...

284
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,990
He wasn't really my style.

285
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,530
Style is what you look for when you're young.

286
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,020
You have to look at the family for marriage.

287
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,290
Just know that the adults will meet each other soon.

288
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,790
What's taking Chi Hyeong so long?

289
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,900
We agreed to eat lunch, so he should show up on time. What is he doing that he's—

290
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,130
Chi Hyeong is working out of the office.

291
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:12,460
He's doing well. You are the one who needs to do well.

292
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,770
I'll be going down to the sample room after eating.

293
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,460
I have to, too?

294
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,010
   
   

295
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,480
Thank you for working together with us for Sonó's opening show.

296
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,980
This is the jersey dress that you wore that day.

297
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,540
Since you say it's a famous artist's work, I'll keep it.

298
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,940
Look at this customer service that comes to your door for your satisfaction.

299
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,490
Won't you give out a bonus? Something like subtracting two days?

300
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,390
What time did you go home last night?

301
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,360
I must've been totally asleep.

302
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,350
I didn't even hear you leaving.

303
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,600
She asked me to take her home after the get-together, so I did.

304
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,360
She was totally drunk and asleep.

305
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,470
I just drank a cup of water and left.

306
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,030
I didn't ask for any explanation.

307
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,650
Still, I'm giving you the facts so that there won't be any misunderstandings.

308
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,270
Last night was an extension of work.

309
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,150
What are you doing, Oppa?

310
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:15,220
I don't want anyone to misunderstand that my loyalty to Sonó is faltering due to personal matters.

311
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,190
What personal matters?

312
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:23,150
That we dated, broke up, and are back together now?

313
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,930
That's also an extension of work.

314
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,590
Then I will be on my way.

315
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,090
Let's have lunch together.

316
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,310
You're a freelancer so you're not aware of the time, right?

317
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:39,270
I'm an employee and this is work hour.

318
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,150
Let's go together.

319
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,730
   

320
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,050
Hello, Mother.

321
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,600
I was the only granny at my get-together.

322
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,240
Their daughters-in-law got them botox and massages.

323
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,160
 But I didn't say anything so that I wouldn't embarrass you. 

324
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,700
We really don't have any spare money to do those things.

325
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,730
That's why it's tough when there's only a single income.

326
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,640
My son is the only one who ends up suffering.

327
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,260
I'm hanging up.

328
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,830
The maturity date is just around the corner, so if you cancel now, there will be a huge loss.

329
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,220
You'll only get 30% of the interest right now.

330
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,550
- But it's possible to cancel, isn't it? 
 - Yes, it's possible.

331
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,240
This one and...

332
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,310
this and this.

333
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,250
All of these please.

334
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,300
Aren't you getting off?

335
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,960
What about a movie after work today?

336
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,770
I'm busy. I have to check the tone difference of fabric,

337
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,320
check if the samples came out correctly, and confirm materials.

338
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,290
It's never-ending work.

339
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,680
How about tomorrow?

340
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,200
You have to empty your head the busier you are.

341
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,530
Recharge for some inspiration.

342
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,910
If we're going to the movies, let's watch an action movie.

343
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,080
One where everything blows up.

344
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,950
Look.

345
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,170
What would be good?

346
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,590
- How about this one? 
 - I don't really like that one.

347
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,350
Then this one?

348
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,340
Oh, Team Leader Ha, here you are.

349
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,850
How are you together?

350
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,290
Sorry? We are—

351
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,970
I came to check for materials a little while ago.

352
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,480
Is that so?

353
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,170
Thank you for helping. I'll let you get back to work.

354
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,130
I saw the draft for Clair Marie. It's good!

355
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,530
Thank you.

356
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:01,430
Try to make it blow up like how Sonó did, Mr. J.

357
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,420
No, was it Cookie?

358
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,430
I'll do my best.

359
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,710
I... have a meeting in thirty minutes.

360
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,280
If you're going to look around, hurry.

361
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,980
We should both be careful around the CEO.

362
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,220
- For what reason? 
 - Director Hwang Chi Sook.

363
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,960
- Then I can't do this? 
 - Of course not.

364
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,760
- And this is impossible? 
 - Of course.

365
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,400
But anything is allowed if he can't see?

366
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,170
Probably?

367
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:38,190
 As you get older, you lose muscles as well as collagen. 

368
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,420
 In your twenties, the collagen was full like this. 

369
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,240
 Where the leg rests, we've added some rotating rollers. 

370
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,000
 So leg massage functions have been added. 

371
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,380
Aren't you going to give me food?

372
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,610
Look in the rice pot and heat up the soybean paste stew.

373
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:03,570
Finish them completely so there won't be any food waste.

374
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,260
Where is the ramyeon?

375
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,640
Where is the ramyeon?

376
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,490
Hey!

377
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,150
What is all that?

378
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,840
 As you can see, it has a diagonal rotating... 

379
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,130
₩3,600,000... You didn't buy that, did you?

380
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,860
My mom is sore everywhere.

381
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,060
Did you buy that?

382
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:38,100
 It is made with 100% Italian leather. 

383
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,170
- Are you kidding me? 
 - You get a discount if you pay in full.

384
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,400
You have money to buy a massage chair for Mother-in-law and a bag for yourself,

385
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,330
yet you treated my mom like that?

386
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,160
She called you too?

387
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,000
I heard that you cut her off saying we don't have money.

388
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,160
Yes, from now on I don't have any money to spend on your mother.

389
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,380
Jeon Mi Sook!

390
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:03,210
When I try to buy a winter coat, she takes it saying some daughter-in-law bought a mink coat for her mother-in-law.

391
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,770
When I try to travel to Southeast Asia,

392
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:10,700
she takes the money saying someone had a 70th birthday party in Hawaii.

393
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,350
I did all I can.

394
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,520
Hey, you're a daughter-in-law. It's a given that—

395
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,280
What's a given?

396
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,510
Who can guarantee that it's a given I'll wake up tomorrow?

397
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,920
Still, you shouldn't treat my mom like that.

398
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,120
Do you know how much trouble she went through for me?

399
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,190
You're the person that she sacrificed for, so why do I have to pay for it?

400
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:34,580
I've been wronged for having to give for all these years,

401
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,210
so I'm going to live for myself.

402
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,140
 What are you doing? 

403
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,730
  Getting ready for some aromatherapy. I'm going to take a bath. 

404
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,770
 I'm on my way. 

405
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:10,680
♫   I miss you again   ♫

406
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,400
  You're really thinking of coming over? 

407
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,470
 You can expect me to arrive in 30 minutes. 

408
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,560
♫  My steps again  ♫

409
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:24,290
♫  Are following your back  ♫

410
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:31,620
♫  The air I feel while going home  ♫

411
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,870
♫  After I touch it and blow it out  ♫

412
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,020
Is he already here?

413
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:44,420
♫  I feel as warm as if you're covering me  ♫

414
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,910
♫  I think I am falling  ♫

415
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,010
♫  It's my first feeling  ♫

416
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,530
 You can't come. 

417
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,040
 You said anything is allowed out of his view. 

418
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,900
 Mi Sook is here. 

419
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,740
♫  Oh darling, we're falling  ♫

420
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:04,770
♫   It might be love, in love   ♫

421
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:08,990
♫   Awkward feeling   ♫

422
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,800
Hey, didn't you just leave?

423
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,400
You came back really early.

424
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
You told me instant food is the enemy of the middle-aged.

425
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,460
It's a miraculous cure for stress too.

426
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,560
Oh, good.

427
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,420
- I got stressed just now. 
- Hey!

428
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,280
It's just a single portion!

429
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,980
It's delicious.

430
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,940
I must be crazy.

431
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,920
Tell me. What's going on?

432
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,470
I told you it's stress from menopause.

433
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:56,540
- You expect me to believe that? 
 - Just entertain me.

434
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:02,070
There's something going on with Soo Ho, right?

435
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,880
What is it? You can tell me.

436
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,560
Wait just for a while.

437
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:11,350
When my thoughts get sorted out, I'll tell you then.

438
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,600
No matter what it is, I'll help you.

439
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,790
If we lack physical strength, I'll at least curse him out with you.

440
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,460
Don't forget that I'm here for you.

441
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,710
Oh hey, you're quite dependable.

442
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,510
You're going to beat him up with me, right?

443
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,120
Hey, you must've spent a good amount of money.

444
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,960
I closed my installment savings.

445
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,920
You still have your house deeds, right?

446
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,220
Yeong Eun, I honestly thought that I'd die if I didn't have my installment savings.

447
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,670
But I'm still fine after closing them.

448
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:46,880
Just how much of my life was trapped inside of that account?

449
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,710
What's more flabbergasting is that I'm the one who willingly did that to myself.

450
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,020
So do you feel better now?

451
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,930
I feel empty.

452
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:01,490
It is done now, and it wasn't even a big deal.

453
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,940
Mi Sook,

454
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,040
I got a call from Soo Wan.

455
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,750
What? Was it an accidental call?

456
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,570
Probably.

457
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,820
But...

458
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,040
I heard he had a fiancée.

459
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,450
What did you just say?

460
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,230
That bastard was two-timing me.

461
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,240
How did Team Leader Ha know?

462
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,690
I told her.

463
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,480
Wow, what an honest man you are.

464
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,000
The fact that you directly exposed his two-timing just like that...

465
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,390
You're so upright, aren't you?

466
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:50,330
- Was I too honest? 
 - What did Team Leader Ha say?

467
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,510
Then, another sigh.

468
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,060
No sentences besides expressions?

469
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,280
"I see."

470
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,350
What? That's it?

471
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,990
She was even cool about cursing him out.

472
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,010
Just a few words like, "He was a bastard." That was about it.

473
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:10,710
Oh, she was cool. I see...

474
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,220
What's your analysis?

475
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:19,000
All right, "oh" and "sigh."

476
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,820
They are initial reactions of shock and fluster to finding out about something she didn't know.

477
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,710
Then the few curses she said coolly after that...

478
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,720
Were you upset after you found out he had a fiancée?

479
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,970
Was I upset?

480
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,000
Do you think she was upset?

481
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,890
If she had been upset, she would've been angry,

482
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:44,170
been resentful, or treated him like complete trash.

483
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,840
She didn't really though.

484
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,270
She was entirely calm and said, "That bastard." That's it.

485
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,560
Really?

486
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,490
If that's the case, then...

487
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,370
Strangely enough,

488
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:02,460
I felt calm.

489
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,040
Calm?

490
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,920
When I heard about Soo Wan doing that,

491
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,360
at first, I felt numb.

492
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,050
But when I thought about it,

493
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:16,990
I was more okay than I expected.

494
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,180
I'm proud of you.

495
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,570
You've grown a bit.

496
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,600
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

497
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,230
When troubles in life keep popping up,

498
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:38,880
you get rid of the useless things in life without a regret,

499
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:48,000
and you realize how precious and special the things that remain with you are.

500
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,230
Isn't that what life is about?

501
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,830
Is that so?

502
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,720
Cheers.

503
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,020
Yes, that's exactly it.

504
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:05,360
It probably means that the past no longer influences the present.

505
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,110
So she feels composed, calm, and cool.

506
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:12,360
Don't you think those emotions come from that stage of realization?

507
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:40,120
  I'm here. Open the door for a quick second. 

508
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,520
Why'd you come so suddenly without saying anything?

509
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,910
  What's this? 

510
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,490
So you can have a drink with your friend.

511
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,810
Well, that's an excuse.

512
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,360
I wanted to see you even if it's like this.

513
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,870
Do you want to come in?

514
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:20,090
Thank you for the offer, but next time.

515
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,630
You should have fun with your friend today.

516
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,920
Alright, you should get going. Drive safely.

517
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,030
I'll see you tomorrow evening.

518
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:51,910
- What? Did someone come by? 
 - Yeah, well.

519
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,730
What's this?

520
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,130
He left these for us to drink since you're here.

521
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:01,900
My gosh, you lovebirds.

522
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,320
Wow. Cheese and Shine Muscat wine.

523
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,430
This won't do. Let's pop this open.

524
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,860
All right.

525
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,210
   
 Thanks to your help, it got settled well. 

526
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,430
  I'll buy you a meal sometime. 

527
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,980
  You can call for me whenever. 

528
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,850
Why are you so surprised like it's the first time you've seen me?

529
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,880
Gosh, this person!

530
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,360
You should've let your presence be known!

531
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,390
Whose text are you smiling at this late at night?

532
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,880
Oh, it's school guidelines.

533
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,580
I need to let them know before the meeting tomorrow.

534
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:50,770
Move aside! You know how valuable our heart is at this age.

535
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:53,860
How could you just scare me out of nowhere?

536
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,370
You should take this!

537
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,150
- Good morning. 
 - Yes.

538
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,800
Hey, if someone greets you, isn't it good manners to look at them?

539
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,690
I'm busy. Just get to the point.

540
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,740
- Why don't you care? 
 - About what?

541
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,110
Hye Rin and me. How could you not say anything about it all day yesterday or today?

542
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,390
I don't care, nor am I curious.

543
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:35,300
That's why I'm asking. Why don't you care? I'm even the CEO's son.

544
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,500
You're the CEO's son. So what?

545
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,500
You're so strict about your work life.

546
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,320
Hey, look.

547
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,480
If we share our personal lives with each other, we'll become close.

548
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,450
If you're connected to someone like me,

549
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,270
your work life will become easier.

550
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:53,920
Having an uncertain hope that the connection would get me somewhere,

551
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,240
I'd have to make an effort to look good to you and

552
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,920
be anxious about whether or not I did something to your liking.

553
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,890
And if you change your mind and turn your back on me,

554
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,560
then I become completely lost.

555
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,660
Instead of that, I'm better off drawing another spec sheet.

556
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:10,420
Jeong So Yeong, did you just put a spec sheet above me?

557
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,480
Okay. That was a fresh one.

558
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,730
I'm not Jeong So Yeong to you. I'm your senior.

559
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,540
- Yes, so according to you, So Yeong— 
 - Sunbae-nim  (senior) .

560
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:25,180
Yes, Sunbae-nim.

561
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:28,990
Hurry along. We need to send this to the development team.

562
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,610
Yes, Sunbae-nim.

563
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:45,250
What are you doing here so early...

564
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:50,480
What brings you by so early, Director Hwang?

565
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,850
There's a man.

566
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,040
And?

567
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,680
And to every text I send,

568
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,770
he only replies with a single word, "Yes."

569
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:03,650
What do you think it means?

570
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,490
Who is it this time?

571
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,160
You don't need to know.

572
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,930
Singer, actor, model.

573
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,350
You can't date a younger idol, got it?

574
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:17,150
If his fans find out, our forum will explode.

575
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,500
Unless you want to shut down Clair Marie as soon as it launches.

576
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,580
Don't worry. He's not in that line of work.

577
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,620
He's not younger, and he's definitely not an idol.

578
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:30,980
Really? Are you sure there's nothing I have to sort out for you?

579
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,520
All you have to sort out is Yoon Jae Gook.

580
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,510
Do you know how obvious you two looked in the sample room yesterday?

581
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:40,870
I think Father's got a hunch.

582
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,400
You know how quick my dad is.

583
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:49,400
Even to those who aren't that quick, one glance and they could tell you two looked like a couple.

584
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,780
Wench, you're so fearless at the workplace...

585
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:58,160
Anyway, tell me. What do you think it means?

586
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,090
Go and ask. Directly to his face.

587
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:05,040
Instead of using your head and making wrong assumptions. Got it?

588
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,910
 Are you in the office? 

589
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,840
 Yes. 

590
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,620
 And you must be busy? 

591
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,590
 Yes. 

592
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,000
 I have something to say, but you probably can't come out though? 

593
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,270
 No. 

594
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:35,580
 That's why I came over. I arrive in a minute. 

595
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,630
If someone looks for me, tell her I'm not here...

596
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,140
It's because you barged in so suddenly that I—

597
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,210
It's flustering, isn't it? Same for me, too!

598
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,620
What? What is?

599
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:56,220
No matter what I ask, the replies are always the one word "yes."

600
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,300
Why exactly are you doing this to me?

601
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,330
I thought about it all night, but I really can't figure it out.

602
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,300
So answer me.

603
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,290
You don't know why?

604
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,990
I don't.

605
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,780
I'm drawing a line.

606
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,800
W-Why?

607
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,590
I didn't like getting bothered,

608
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,990
getting excited,

609
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:28,170
and getting disappointed all alone.

610
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:30,560
So why did you?

611
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,240
Why do you think?

612
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:40,000
 Hold on. Getting bothered, excited, and disappointed all alone? 

613
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,760
 That's... 

614
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:46,240
 what I do when I fall in love... 

615
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:06,820
Good.

616
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:09,020
Let's smile a little more.

617
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,090
Hurray!

618
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,620
Let's move the lights in closer.

619
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,690
- Also, please go in closer with the reflector. 
 - Okay.

620
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:25,310
Okay. Good.

621
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:28,640
Oh, it's raining!

622
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,120
Let's continue after the rain stops.

623
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,010
Bring more tarp!

624
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,980
Cover this first.

625
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,300
The neck line is too wide.

626
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,700
Let's decrease it by 1/4.

627
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,050
Sixteen.

628
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,870
Here you go.

629
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,080
Wrong one.

630
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,310
What? You want me to go get it again?

631
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,660
Let's do velcro here.

632
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,360
Adding eight rivets around the canton is staying as is?

633
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,570
- Get the alteration done by tomorrow morning. 
 - Okay.

634
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:27,330
Hello? This is Ha Yeong Eun speaking.

635
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:30,820
 Team Leader Ha, the CEO wants to see you. 

636
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:49,000
Did... you get bribed by the factory?

637
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,150
No, I didn't.

638
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,660
I've had one rule ever since I started selling fabric.

639
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,930
To employees who want a raise or want their transportation expenses paid for,

640
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,130
I just give it to them if they are performing well enough.

641
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:17,140
But people who take money from the register out of my sight

642
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,040
can never set foot in my store ever again.

643
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,170
It's not that I lost a lot of money

644
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:27,640
but deceiving me cannot be calculated with money.

645
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:32,750
I never deceived you in any way.

646
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:37,820
I know. With whose money

647
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:41,110
you finished that tough education in Paris

648
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:46,220
and thanks to whom you are where you are.

649
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,500
You can't be eyeing

650
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,590
something you shouldn't.

651
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,120
Don't you think so?

652
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:01,960
 I think Father's got a hunch. 

653
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,780
♫  When you look deeply into my heart  ♫

654
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,960
I think we need to move locations.

655
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,580
- If we don't, we won't be able to finish today. 
 - Okay.

656
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:23,680
♫  There is one small hole  ♫

657
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:29,650
♫  No one knew, even I didn't know  ♫

658
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:34,970
♫  It was growing  ♫

659
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,810
Okay, good.

660
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:42,910
Smile.

661
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:46,800
♫  Which will fill my heart is you  ♫

662
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,140
Let's raise your hands one more time.

663
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:57,190
♫  Please hold my hand  ♫

664
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:00,780
♫  Please don't leave me alone  ♫

665
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:04,240
Let's hold the balloons now.

666
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:11,790
♫  Until the night passes  ♫

667
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:18,980
♫  Hug me tightly  ♫

668
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:32,460
♫  Please hold my hand  ♫

669
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:36,100
I barely made it in time.

670
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,330
Why aren't you answering your phone?

671
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,650
I'm sorry. I didn't hear it.

672
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:43,990
Something going on?

673
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,320
Yes, there is something.

674
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,700
We missed our movie. What do we do?

675
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,340
Let's go somewhere for now. It's cold.

676
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:11,120
♫  Patiently waiting on my dreams to come true  ♫

677
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,810
♫  Hoping and praying one day that they do  ♫

678
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:16,560
Since when

679
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,520
did you start liking me?

680
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,380
It's not like you can set a date and time for such things.

681
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,070
It just happened one day.

682
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,770
My heart aches.

683
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,650
It's possible to not realize it.

684
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:35,690
You don't have to feel bad.

685
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:43,100
I'm not going to like you.

686
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,060
Why not? Because of my looks?

687
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:51,480
You know, I look pretty good if you take a good look at me.

688
00:49:56,470 --> 00:50:00,410
Love should be mysterious.

689
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:05,020
But you've seen me getting dumped by J

690
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,000
and losing against Yeong Eun.

691
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,340
You saw all that.

692
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,980
I saw because you showed me. Is it my fault?

693
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:18,190
Anyway, I won't like you.

694
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:23,360
So let me go from

695
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,810
that heart of yours, okay?

696
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:29,640
If you're not going to like me, don't do this to me.

697
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:34,210
Okay, okay. I got it. I got it. I won't do it.

698
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:37,790
Again! There you go again.

699
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:40,540
♫  Maybe this whole thing is a joke  ♫

700
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:45,470
♫  Still, I’m patiently waiting with you by my side  ♫

701
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:50,840
♫  Trusting one day that I can provide  ♫

702
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,850
♫  The life you’ve deserved but never demand  ♫

703
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:57,360
♫  Patiently waiting  ♫

704
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,650
♫  Patiently waiting till then  ♫

705
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,670
Why is it so cold?

706
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:11,060
Hold on. We're almost home.

707
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,810
Director Hwang, can you stand up for a second?

708
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:14,690
One, two, three!

709
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:16,660
If you just put some strength into your legs...

710
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,310
A little.

711
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:21,170
Okay, hold on.

712
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:23,590
I don't feel too good.

713
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:28,160
 I don't feel good. 

714
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,070
- I don't feel good. 
 - You don't?

715
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:31,270
Who is it?

716
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:33,370
Hold on.

717
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:36,770
  Hello, this is your daughter. 

718
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:40,270
Who are you?! Why is a grown man saying he's my daughter?

719
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:41,570
  What? 

720
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,370
- Director Hwang.  
 - Yes?

721
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:45,410
We need to prove that it's you.

722
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:48,770
One, two, three!

723
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:52,990
  Oh, here. Here. 

724
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,910
Who is this guy again?

725
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:22,700
   

726
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,420
   

727
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,840
Gyeong Ja?

728
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:35,050
Are these really the only choices?

729
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:36,670
Let's choose at the same time to make it fair.

730
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:39,310
Thirty-thread Supima cotton. Its coziness is the selling point.

731
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:43,580
Or a silk base with Lasalle lace. Its strength is that it's extremely lovely.

732
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,920
One, two, three.

733
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,800
- Lovely. 
 - Cozy.

734
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:51,680
So I've confirmed that we have different tastes in gowns.

735
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,600
You put eggs in ramyeon, right?

736
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,590
No, I don't.

737
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:00,370
Then at least you agree that chicken drumsticks are the best, right?

738
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,420
Chicken breasts taste clean and aren't greasy.

739
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,930
Wow, we really aren't compatible.

740
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:07,880
We're probably going to fight a lot in the future, right?

741
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,810
You'll find out that ramyeon without eggs is good,

742
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:13,060
and we won't have to fight over drumsticks.

743
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,390
I think this is better.

744
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:35,000
 Without a reason, I thought this wouldn't work out. 

745
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:42,020
 That I, that we... 

746
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:46,010
 wouldn't be able to have a normal, ordinary relationship. 

747
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,750
What is it?

748
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,480
I got a call from Soo Wan.

749
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:08,140
 Up to what point is it okay to love, 

750
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,350
 and at what point does it become not okay? 

751
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,380
 Besides me 

752
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:20,320
  and him, 

753
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:25,350
  whose and what approval do we need to love? 

754
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:35,050
 Have you been well? 

755
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:51,940
 Yes, I'm doing well. 

756
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,500
   

757
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,860
   

758
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,160
   

759
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:06,470
     
 It turned out that I never deleted Soo Wan's number for 10 years.

760
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,140
I was so busy with life that at some point,

761
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:17,620
I completely forgot to the point that I didn't even think about how I should delete it.

762
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:23,110
I'm sorry for bringing Soo Wan up again.

763
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:27,470
But I'm not talking about him right now. I'm talking about myself.

764
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:29,620
I know.

765
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:34,700
I also hear it as you talking about yourself and not my brother.

766
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:41,350
♫  Do you know how I feel  ♫

767
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:44,250
Would you like more ramyeon?

768
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:47,330
♫  I love you exclusively, just you  ♫

769
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:53,920
 And now, our story has started. 

770
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,790
You know, I knew you were kind of slow to catch on to things,

771
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:58,820
but I guess you are not that flexible either.

772
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,230
How could you get soaked by all that rain?

773
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:04,070
I was only going to wait 10 minutes and then leave.

774
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:06,460
You waited 20 minutes.

775
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,910
Is the soup not bland?

776
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,960
It was my first time making 2 servings, so I didn't measure the amount of water correctly.

777
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,430
It must be bland.

778
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:19,230
It's fine. It's just right.

779
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,890
  When he says it's fine, it really does become fine. 

780
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:25,500
  That laugh also makes me laugh. 

781
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,070
Do you want more soup?

782
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:31,420
- Oh, that's hot. 
 - It'll get on your gown. It's expensive.

783
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:34,430
It's not like you're going to wash it.

784
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:37,140
Eat up and wash it in the laundry before you go.

785
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:43,100
  - A normal, ordinary relationship   
 - It's good.

786
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,150
 that I didn't think was possible 

787
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:48,140

00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:52,930
♫  I'm sure one day you will embrace me  ♫

801
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:58,810
♫  Please don't go farther away  ♫

802
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:01,820
What brings you here this morning?

803
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,840
I wanted to talk to you about something.

804
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:16,000
Hold on.

805
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,330
So it was you.

806
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:49,440
What are you doing right now?

807
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:52,950
I came to ask you that.

808
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,580
What are you doing right now?

809
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:59,290
What are you doing to Ha Yeong Eun with Hyung's phone?

810
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:00,890
I told you.

811
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:03,400
I'm worried about your mother.

812
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:07,570
Aren't you using that worry as an excuse to take out your anger?

813
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:11,630
Are you really okay?

814
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:17,510
Are you okay with the shock and the pain you'll give her?

815
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:20,740
You aren't.

816
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:25,920
That's why you couldn't say anything in front of your mother either.

817
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:33,950


818
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:37,570
Mother, it's me.

819
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:43,860
I'd like to introduce you to the person I like.

820
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,880
That person's name

821
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:51,630
is Ha Yeong Eun.

822
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:58,990
What? Ha Yeong Eun?

823
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:13,310
Jae Gook, by any chance, are you...

824
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:20,020
Yes. It's that Ha Yeong Eun.

825
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:27,020
♫  Passing through this frozen path  ♫

826
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,610
♫  Can I meet you  ♫

827
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:42,960
♫  Blowing somewhere  ♫

828
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:49,940
♫  The wind which is you  ♫

829
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:58,600
♫  Oh, this untouchable heart  ♫

830
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:05,030
♫  I hope I can finally reach you  ♫

831
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:13,910
♫  I'm going to call you  ♫

832
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:15,530
♫  I only love you  ♫

833
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:18,240
   

834
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,920
 Domestic brands are no longer competitive. 

835
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,740
 Send all of them a termination letter. 

836
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,620
 What do you mean by a termination letter? All of a sudden? 

837
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,940
  - You should've found an appropriate compromise! 
 - That's enough, stop! 

838
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:29,320
 I will see how things turn out at the end of this month. 

839
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,400
  There are realistic limitations that can't be overcome. 

840
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,170
 So stop with the useless efforts. 

841
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:38,410
 Wow, Yoon Soo Wan! What a bastard! 

842
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:39,370
  Jae Gook. 

843
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:42,500
 I know how hard it'll be for you and how difficult it will be for you to accept it. 

844
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,560
 Then you're actually going to... 

845
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,350
  Good shot. 

846
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:47,760
  I'll do it. 

847
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,370
  You can get in first. Let's have another round back in Seoul. 

848
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:56,120
 The pain will spread a lot towards your back. 

849
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:00,100
 You'll develop jaundice and lose a lot of weight. 

850
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,810
  Mi Sook, pick up. 

851
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:04,850
  Yeong Eun, I... It hurts so much. 

852
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:08,810
  This world is not yet tolerant of the love between you two. 

853
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:11,890
 Do I have to give up the woman I love for fear of that short while? 

854
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:15,740
  The one who wronged you is my brother, not her. 

855
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,180
 You're lashing out at the wrong person. 

856
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,800
♫  Oh, this untouchable heart  ♫
