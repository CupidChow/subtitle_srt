1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:06,010
   

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,120
   

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,970
   

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,080
   
   

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:33,040
 Timing and subtitles brought to you by 
 Are You The One Team @ Viki 

6
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,860
   

7
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,610
 Jae Gook, by any chance, are you... 

8
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,030
 - There's someone I love. 
 - It's that Ha Yeong Eun. 

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,870
How do you think people will see you two?

10
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,470
This world is not yet tolerant of the love between you two.

11
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,270
I'm sure they'll enjoy gossiping about it for the first few days.

12
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,960
Do I have to give up the woman I love for fear of that short while?

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,930
If people say our relationship isn't possible in Korea,

14
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,990
then all I have to do is take her to Paris.

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,630
You're insane.

16
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,180
You're so out of it, you can't even think straight now.

17
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,090
The one who wronged you is my brother, not her.

18
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,110
You're lashing out at the wrong person.

19
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:14,380
   

20
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,230
   

21
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,590
   

22
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,390
They all want to work with you!

23
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,120
- So? 
 - So these are all yours.

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,960
How?

25
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,390
This came.

26
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,670
An invitation from Chairman Alexandre de Fontenay of DPHP,

27
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:44,070
the conglomerate that owns all of these luxury brands as subsidiary companies.

28
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,200
Honestly, the domestic PR industry is a little small for me to be in.

29
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,500
It's too tight.

30
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,180
You should cut the midnight snacks.

31
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,960
Straightforward.

32
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,420
Let's be that straightforward when signing the contract, okay?

33
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,490
You will be in charge of advertising for all of the brands under DPHP.

34
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,800
Whatever they request, say oui. No matter what, say oui. Got it?

35
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,610
A representative from DPHP came to meet with you personally right now.

36
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,010
From where? Paris. Voilà!

37
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,050
Some of the schedule overlaps with my current schedule.

38
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,870
We have the concept shoot with Clair Marie.

39
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,200
We'll have to push that back obviously. They'll understand.

40
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,150
Either way, ten days is too long.

41
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,840
Change the dates.

42
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,150
Yo, Cookie, that's not how it works.

43
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,880
They are DPHP.

44
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,010
I looked through it, and one week should be plenty of time.

45
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,930
Cookie, your bro wants to expand to Paris.

46
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,240
Can't you just pave out a path for me without resisting?

47
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,480
The more stuck-up you are, the more attractive you become. That's the Paris mindset.

48
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,780
Cookie, please!

49
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,920
Hyung, do you really think that little of me?

50
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,760
People from DPHP have arrived.

51
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,610
Hello! I am CEO Seok Do Hoon from Vision PR. 
  (in French) 

52
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,850
I am so glad to meet you. 
  (in French) 

53
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,220
Nice to meet you. I am Cédric Roux from DPHP. 
  (in French) 

54
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,620
Who did you say was DPHP's new head director?

55
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,700
Some say he's a rising designer, and others say he's a big shot in the fashion industry.

56
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,560
They say this director is quite aggressive in recruiting talented people from all fields.

57
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,100
He has already reached out to some in certain fields.

58
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,030
Look into the brands their head is contacting,

59
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,310
and let's bring them into our department store.

60
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,340
Which area should we offer them?

61
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,280
Domestic brands are no longer competitive.

62
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,850
You can let them all go.

63
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,330
All of them? What about Notié, Mardi Mohan, and Sonó?

64
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,970
- Their sales are still— 
 - Send all of them a termination letter.

65
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,220
- Team Leader. 
 - Did something suddenly happen?  A termination letter?

66
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,780
Apparently, The Hills contacted us in the morning stating we muct vacate our store.

67
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,030
Just because they're a department store, it doesn't give them the right to tell us to vacate our store like this!

68
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,920
Then what's the point of the contract in the first place?

69
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,460
Just how on earth are you doing your work?

70
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,800
Vacating the store at The Hills is pretty much publicly advertising that we are past our prime.

71
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,750
No one was able to foresee this until it blew up like this?

72
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,750
Do you think it's because we made it difficult for them when they asked for an increase on their commission?

73
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,120
The sales team has to take the company's profits into consideration.

74
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,090
It has only been a year since we raised it from 40% to 45%.

75
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,280
If we raise it again, the price of clothing has to increase to compensate for it in the end.

76
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,980
That's why you should've found an appropriate compromise!

77
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,370
Just how terribly did you manage your connections on a day-to-day basis

78
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,520
that you're just sitting here and taking this bomb?!

79
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,550
That's enough, stop!

80
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,430
Is figuring out who did right and who did wrong important right now?

81
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,470
We need to consider our next step.

82
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,480
How about we take this opportunity

83
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,830
to take all of Sonó's marketing budget and employees

84
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,580
and bring them all to Clair Marie?

85
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,850
We are riding an upward popularity trend after the jersey show.

86
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,220
We have never shown a drop in sales to the point where we'd close overnight.

87
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,240
That's what we think, but look at reality.

88
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,850
The news will spread widely about how The Hills kicked us out

89
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,370
which means all of the other department stores will start saying they'll close our stores, too.

90
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,100
Rather than becoming a local brand outside of Seoul after getting kicked out of everywhere,

91
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,080
it will at least look better to retire with honor.

92
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,640
- Chief. 
 - If you think about it, Director Hwang

93
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,060
has the gift of foresight for sure.

94
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,290
What would've happened if Clair Marie hadn't launched?

95
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,030
The fact that the sales aren't like before isn't Sonó's fault.

96
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,920
It's the overall situation for domestic brands.

97
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,560
We have always complied without a fuss

98
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,320
each time they asked for an unreasonable raise in commission.

99
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,930
Plus, Sonó does not fall under the 3-strikes-and-out system.

100
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,680
It's just an unfair contract termination.

101
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,360
If you're complaining to me about it being unfair,

102
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,040
- will that change The Hills' decision? 
 - Pardon me?

103
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,780
Instead of spending time being angry, bring more realistic next steps to me.

104
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,900
Either run headfirst into them, or bow down completely.

105
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,970
Do whatever you can to try and change the decision.

106
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,970
Then report back on the results. Do you understand?

107
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,980
Why are you still sitting around? Go and figure out a solution for each department.

108
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,260
You are a very consistent person.

109
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,090
Whether at home or at work, you're exactly the same.

110
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,320
You're not fake at all.

111
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,530
I need to relieve my hangover.

112
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,080
Where's Yeong Eun?

113
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,820
Can you even eat hangover soup when The Hills just evicted you?

114
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,550
- What is that supposed to mean? 
- Are you really the director?

115
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,170
You should take the gold out from your business card.

116
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:53,590
Do you really plan on cutting Sonó?

117
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,660
Depending on the circumstances,

118
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,850
we cannot live with a rotting arm. Don't you agree?

119
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,840
The Hills gave us until the end of this month?

120
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,840
I, too, will see how things turn out

121
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,930
at the end of this month.

122
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,480
If you want to save Sonó,

123
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,660
do something.

124
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,290
Ha Yeong Eun, is it true?

125
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:44,850
I heard Sonó is on the brink of being evicted by The Hills.

126
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,460
By any chance, did you cause any trouble that I don't know about?

127
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,380
Trouble?

128
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,230
 Senseless child. 

129
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,860
 Drunk day in and day out. 

130
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,280
 It's not... 

131
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,960
 It's not like I didn't try either. 

132
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:15,710
 But the person he likes is none other than my friend. 

133
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,900
 It's too hard. 

134
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:24,800
 Love, men, women. They make my head hurt. 

135
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,940
Something did happen.

136
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,600
No, nothing happened.

137
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,370
Other than staying up late drinking, nothing happened!

138
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:45,040
Either go eat hangover soup or go to a sauna.

139
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,660
You reek of alcohol.

140
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,250
Where are you going?

141
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,170
The Hills. Whether I run headfirst into them, or bow down completely,

142
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,470
I should try something.

143
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,530
Good luck!

144
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,420
What do I do?

145
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,340
   
   

146
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,040
 The Ha Yeong Eun whom Hyung liked... 

147
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,340
 It is her. 

148
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,680
 We met by chance, 

149
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,080
 and I liked her from that time. 

150
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,430
 Then I found out later 

151
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,810
 that between her and me... 

152
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,050
 Hyung was there. 

153
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,610
 Does she know about it too? 

154
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,950
 She said we can't. 

155
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,910
 But then? 

156
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,920
 I held on to her. 

157
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,090
 Because I love her too much. 

158
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,880
 Because it can't be anyone else but her. That's why. 

159
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,950
 Jae Gook. 

160
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:09,040
 I know how hard it'll be for you and how difficult it will be for you to accept it. 

161
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,540
 - I'm sorry. 
 - What do you mean you are sorry? 

162
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,500
 Then you're actually going to... 

163
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,120
 I'm sorry. 

164
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,900
It can't be.

165
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,460
What? Marie Amelie as the styling director? 
  (in French) 

166
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,350
And Julien Disse as hairstylist? 
  (in French) 

167
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,250
After his success at the three biggest fashion weeks, he's the one everyone wants.  (in French) 

168
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,880
Shall I give you the moon as well? 
  (in French) 

169
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,910
Helena Christian as the model. 
  (in French) 

170
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:05,010
I hope you won't have any problems in getting her. 
  (in French) 

171
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,200
Cookie, stop being so stuck-up.

172
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,750
If they take everything off the table and leave, what are you going to do?

173
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,610
Then we'll have the photo shoot at the Musée d'Orsay? 
  (in French) 

174
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,240
It's a joke  (in French) . A joke—

175
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,740
I mean, a Korean joke. A Korean joke!

176
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,990
I don't need 10 days. A week is enough time. 
  (in French) 

177
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,040
You little con. 
  (in French) 

178
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,500
I know. 
  (in French) 

179
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:49,520
Fine. If there's nothing else, let's sign 
  (in French) 

180
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,860
because if it doesn't work with your schedule, I'll charter you a private jet. 
  (in French) 

181
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,350
Business class is good enough for me. 
  (in French) 

182
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,420
Then it's a deal! 
  (in French) 

183
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Deal! 
  (in French) 

184
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,010
Oh! Yes! Yes! Yes! 
  (in French) 

185
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,700
You still act as arrogantly as ever. 
  (in French) 

186
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,340
As for you, look where you are now. 
  (in French) 

187
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,200
You're the marketing director of DPHP. 
  (in French) 

188
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,840
As promised, you're coming to Paris with me? 
  (in French) 

189
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,160
A promise is a promise. 
  (in French) 

190
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,250
But it was only because of you, my friend. 
  (in French) 

191
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,110
Tell me, since when did you become so attached to Seoul? 
  (in French) 

192
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,970
Do you have a girlfriend? 
  (in French) 

193
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,350
Cédric, do you remember ten years ago 
  (in French) 

194
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,170
when you ripped off a woman 
  (in French) 

195
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,950
by charging her five extra euros for my photo? 
  (in French) 

196
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,630
 Come look! Come look! 
 (in French) 

197
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,380
 How much? 
 (in French) 

198
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,250
It's that woman. 
  (in French) 

199
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,060
I found her. 
  (in French) 

200
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,370
What? You're kidding! 
  (in French) 

201
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,480
It's a rough draft of the designs including next year's spring/summer line.

202
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,720
Please reconsider after you've looked over Sonó's potential and the profits from this season.

203
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,790
Can you lower the retail price of the Sonó wool overcoat

204
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,270
to under ₩500,000 (~US$425)?

205
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:47,220
That would be difficult, considering the manufacturing cost.

206
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,990
A piece where one can tell this is from Sonó without checking the label...

207
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,780
Do you have a signature like that?

208
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,300
What about a Sonó exclusive design that has never been seen overseas?

209
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,680
Foreign luxury brands make their clothes in size 44 as the standard.

210
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,750
They look pretty, but they're uncomfortable for us to wear

211
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,700
since the structure of our hips and shoulders are different.

212
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,590
We are a premium brand that uses good fabrics to make clothes that are comfortable for us to wear.

213
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:17,020
A luxury brand's logo makes us put up with discomfort.

214
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,050
Some luxury brands are carried by department stores without a commission.

215
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,500
We have to pay on average 40 percent to a maximum of 50 percent.

216
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,430
It would be difficult for us to lower the price more.

217
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:32,680
In the end, you're saying that you don't have a competitive edge.

218
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,940
I follow your social media accounts consistently.

219
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,420
You don't take sponsorships but buy the items yourself

220
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,510
from domestic brands and mention them.

221
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,830
Our clothes are good quality, but it's a shame that no one knows about it.

222
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,780
I remember you saying that.

223
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,370
However, there are realistic limitations

224
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,500
that can't be overcome.

225
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,530
I believe that is your reality and limitation.

226
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,350
So stop with the useless efforts.

227
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,190
I won't change my mind.

228
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,220
   

229
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,760
 The pain will spread a lot towards your back. 

230
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,950
 You'll develop jaundice and lose a lot of weight. 

231
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,480
 First, we're planning on using the AG method (a combination of Abraxane, a cytotoxic anticancer drug, and Gemcitabine, an anti-metabolic drug). 

232
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,640
 After that, we will continue to check your condition 

233
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,450
  and control the dose and medication. 

234
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,530
 And because the chemotherapy is toxic, 

235
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,520
 bleeding, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, 

236
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,720
 and hair loss are possible. 

237
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,610
 Are the side effects really that severe? 

238
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,200
 Still, you need to be strong and overcome it. 

239
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,070
 My son has just started his first round of chemotherapy. 

240
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,770
 Are the side effects really that severe? 

241
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,700
 The AC chemotherapy treatment was more painful. 

242
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,760
 I vomited and felt lethargic... 

243
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,260
 I went to my child's school wearing a hat in the middle of summer, 

244
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,690
 then turned back home because I was sorry about the way I looked. 

245
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,020
 You must be having a really hard time. 

246
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,310
 I'm rooting for you. 

247
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,520
Paris?

248
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,690
They said that I absolutely, without fail, must be their photographer.

249
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,940
That's what DPHP said.

250
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,500
I mean, DPHP said absolutely, without fail.

251
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,360
Wow, you're so cool.  I'm jealous.

252
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,950
How long are you going to stay there?

253
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,640
I'm leaving tomorrow and staying about a week.

254
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,310
Do you want to go with me?

255
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,810
I'm a company employee.

256
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,490
You're a designer.

257
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,320
If you go with me, there are a lot of people I could introduce you to.

258
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,470
I could also introduce you to people from DPHP.

259
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,160
I would love to, but I have things I need to resolve.

260
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,670
I think it will be a bit difficult this time.

261
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,790
Why?  Did something happen?

262
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,810
 I think that you aren't making a decision based on your personal feelings. 

263
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:47,370
 No, they're my personal feelings. 

264
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,280
 I don't want clothes made by a designer like you 

265
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,840
 to be hung up in my department store. 

266
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,760
 Since clothes are shaped by feelings as well. 

267
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,420
 I have lost everything because of love before. 

268
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,020
 I said that I would never do that again. 

269
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,740
 After ten years, love is asking again, 

270
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:15,360
 "Nevertheless, can you do it again?" 

271
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,290
Something happened, didn't it?

272
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,980
There are lots of things that happen when you make clothes and try to sell them.

273
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,630
A ship with the fabric that was supposed to arrive runs into a storm and can't sail.

274
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,800
Or it finally arrives and is being held in customs.

275
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,820
But that's our situation,

276
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,440
and my job is to make it work no matter what.

277
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,420
I don't want to leave.

278
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,530
Can't you just pretend those problems don't exist and set them all aside for a few days?

279
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,640
Thank you for the sentiment, but my work is here,

280
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,470
and I will be here working really hard.

281
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,960
So do a killer job that will impress those in Paris, okay?

282
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,600
Dad, you know what I said last night when I was drunk.

283
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,530
Foolish punk.

284
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,610
Is that my fault?

285
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,980
Is it a bag or shoes?

286
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,620
It's not like I can swipe a credit card to buy a person's heart.

287
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,080
That's your problem.

288
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,330
You don't have the guts to just go all out for it.

289
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,900
You don't even have the will to make him yours.

290
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,010
The one who takes it away is bad, but the one who gets it taken away is more pathetic.

291
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,990
Do you like talking to your daughter like that?

292
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:40,470
And it's not that Yeong Eun took him away, but our destinies crossed. Destiny!

293
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,350
You... you... you...

294
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,880
Anyhow, I don't have feelings for J,

295
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,120
so don't bring it up anymore

296
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,810
and don't say anything embarrassing to Yeong Eun.

297
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,970
Let's keep public and private matters separated.

298
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,270
If you get kicked out of The Hills, I'm closing Sonó down!

299
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,500
Dad? Dad.

300
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,960
Oh, this is driving me crazy!

301
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,980
My head...

302
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,670
Pardon?

303
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,280
What do you mean all of a sudden?

304
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,030
You must have a source at The Hills that you've been working on.

305
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,500
Of course, I do...

306
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,510
I mean, no matter what type of work, people are the ones behind it all.

307
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,150
Then what are you doing?

308
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:36,250
The saying "crisis is an opportunity." This is your time to show your abilities.

309
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,960
Pardon?

310
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,330
Are you going to stay as a chief forever?

311
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:47,380
An executive director or director... I guess you don't dream about a promotion at all.

312
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,980
You live a small life.

313
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,750
   

314
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,720
Do you do business through your computer?

315
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,260
This is why people say those who are book smart can't make it big.

316
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,000
What is it?

317
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,370
Learn what it means to do business by running around and sweating by seeing how it's done yourself.

318
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,090
I've already established a connection with the person who has the power to decide.

319
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:45,910
The designer should personally explain the plan for next season so that they can trust us.

320
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,750
They will meet with me?

321
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,590
I scheduled a round of golf with the senior vice president there in four days.

322
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,770
Make sure you're on time.

323
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,950
   
   
   

324
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,400
Cédric.

325
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,150
Mr. J, you're finally here. 
  (in French) 

326
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,950
It's been a while. How are you? 
  (in French) 

327
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,930
J, we're so glad to be working with you. 
  (in French) 

328
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:36,980
I looked at the mood board for the photo shoot that you sent me. 
  (in French) 

329
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,990
Ah, it's just a rough concept. 
  (in French) 

330
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,500
The final concept is, of course, up to you. 
  (in French) 

331
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,660
Great. I hope you got the model I asked for. 
  (in French) 

332
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,950
Helena Christian just called me from the airport. 
  (in French) 

333
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,640
She just arrived in Roissy, and the others are already there.
  (in French) 

334
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,450
That's great. 
  (in French) 

335
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,160
Where did you go that you're still not home yet?

336
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,820
I went out for some air because it felt so stuffy,

337
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,690
but there was some traffic.

338
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:28,100
Oh, some air? Did it feel nice?

339
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,630
Must have felt really refreshing while Ji Min was uncomfortable all day.

340
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:37,490
She had an accident at school, but you were the only one that didn't send an extra set of clothes.

341
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:42,000
I went to pick her up, and they had her wrapped up in towels.

342
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,990
Tell me the truth. Something is up, isn't it?

343
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,120
Is Ji Min sleeping?

344
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,760
You...

345
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,920
Did you invest in stocks?

346
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:01,660
- What? 
 - If not, what is all this?

347
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,160
You didn't wear this many times because you said you were saving it.

348
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,300
How much did you lose exactly?

349
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,460
Half? All?

350
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:14,860
How much would you even get from selling this used?

351
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,820
I can't wear it anyway since it's out of style.

352
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,960
What about all of Ji Min's clothes?

353
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,730
Why are you being so frugal that you bought such large sizes to dress her from now until later on?

354
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,120
What if I forget again?

355
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,130
Tell me. Did you lose ₩3,000,000?

356
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,490
₩5,000,000? Hey, is it more than ₩10,000,000?

357
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,000
Is that why you're so out of your mind?

358
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,520
That's why I told you not to do it!

359
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,290
Stocks aren't for everyone!

360
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,260
You're right.

361
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,230
Think of it that way if that makes you feel better.

362
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,100
I'm sorry, Ji Min.

363
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,590
I didn't even say much, but she's crying?

364
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,740
   

365
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,770
 Mo Gyeong Ja. 

366
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,030
   

367
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,790
Manager Nam, where did Yeong Eun go?

368
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,030
She went to meet someone at The Hills.

369
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,800
She asked not to be disturbed if it wasn't something very urgent.

370
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,170
Sounds like she said that to you just for me to hear.

371
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,490
That's not true.

372
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,830
 What's with her walking? 

373
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,980
 Did she sprain her ankle? 

374
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,510
 Or is her back not well? 

375
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,930
 Why am I even thinking about this? 

376
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,040
I didn't hear that there is a marketing meeting, but you're here.

377
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,900
Yes, we need to adjust the timeline due to my artist's schedule.

378
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,930
Lies.

379
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,730
It's the truth.

380
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,770
Do your job then.

381
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:34,760
Oh yeah, is Team Leader Ha... okay?

382
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:46,630
Good shot! Your transition is no joke.

383
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,700
Your form is impeccable so the ball flies so far!

384
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,970
My driving distance is not good at all.

385
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,630
Try putting your left foot down a little when lift your heel up to swing.

386
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,560
The ball's direction can change

387
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,300
if you put the heel down in a different place than where it was lifted from.

388
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,500
All right, let's go to the next hole!

389
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,960
We're going.

390
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,940
Wow, Yoon Soo Wan! What a bastard!

391
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,600
You don't have to be so harsh.

392
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,950
Shin Yoo Jeong is really clingy too!

393
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,540
I didn't think she was!

394
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,810
I mean, is she getting revenge on Yeong Eun over a 10-year-old issue right now?

395
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,680
Oh, my god.

396
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,080
Real, glamorous, and sensible celeb, my butt!

397
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,970
How dare she abuse her power and act the role of an ex-fiancée from 10 years ago?

398
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,710
It might be a misunderstanding, so don't get carried away.

399
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,520
So besides my father, there's Shin Yoo Jeong too...

400
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,750
What is Yeong Eun going to do?

401
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,500
I am only saying this just in case,

402
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,330
but there isn't any way for Vision PR or myself

403
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,360
to play a part in the department store contract situation.

404
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,830
Well, life doesn't always go as planned, does it?

405
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,700
Absolutely not, never, not even a chance.

406
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,990
Look how a fiancée from 10 years back showed up.

407
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,460
Something...

408
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,180
There is definitely something we can do.

409
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,350
The senior vice president's swing today was...

410
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,530
It was like seeing the never ending future of The Hills.

411
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,650
Team Leader Ha, you have some as well.

412
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:39,170
I'm sorry, but I drove here.

413
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:43,120
You can call a substitute driver. Don't be so uptight.

414
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,000
Kids these days are all work, no play.

415
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,660
It shows how fierce they are.

416
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,040
I am working hard.

417
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,780
Which is how Sonó came up with these for our spring/summer season—

418
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,720
The senior vice president's glass is empty!

419
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,270
Team Leader Ha would like to pour you a drink.

420
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,960
Fill it all the way to the brim, so he knows how much you care.

421
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,190
Don't you agree?

422
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,780
I will do it.

423
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:21,430
   

424
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:27,080
Team Leader Ha, you can get in first.

425
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,780
Let's have another round back in Seoul.

426
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,870
What are you waiting for? The senior vice president is waiting.

427
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:36,770
It's hard for me to find another time to meet you, Team Leader Ha.

428
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,910
What are you doing?

429
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,080
   

430
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,340
You don't want to renew the contract?

431
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,490
   

432
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,740
I'm sorry, but I'll find my own way back.

433
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:03,640
You're not as desperate as I thought, Team Leader Ha.

434
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,830
No, I am.

435
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,430
This is the most desperate and frantic I've ever felt in my life.

436
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:14,120
Which is why I waited all day for the ten minute briefing, let you touch my hand,

437
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,860
and stressed about whether or not I should get in a car with you alone.

438
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,910
Hey, Team Leader Ha!

439
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:23,670
In the three hours we ate, there were so many chances for you to speak or listen.

440
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,820
You're not saying you will listen to my briefing.

441
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,490
What do you want to do while having more drinks alone?

442
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:33,840
Don't you plan on using my earnestness and desperateness as a hotel room key?

443
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,900
But I can't do that.

444
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,830
In this situation, that's so pathetic.

445
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,370
Hey, Team Leader Ha. Don't you know who I am?

446
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:48,680
You were given your position through your family connections to keep Shin Yoo Jeong in check!

447
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,100
Even if you want to abuse your power, act like a man of your position.

448
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,050
Be more high class about it, will you?

449
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,190
Mi Sook, pick up. Please pick up.

450
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,530
Mi Sook.

451
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,980
 Yeong Eun, I... 

452
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,200
 It hurts so much... 

453
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,950
Mi Sook, what's wrong?

454
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,200
   

455
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,680
Mi Sook!

456
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,740
Mi Sook, it's me!

457
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,310
Open the door, Mi Sook!

458
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,140
Mi Sook! Mi Sook!

459
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,920
Hurry!

460
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:59,050
Mi Sook! Mi Sook!

461
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,670
Mi Sook!

462
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,370
Mi Sook! Mi Sook!

463
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,980
Mi Sook! Mi Sook!

464
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,760
What do I do? Mi Sook!

465
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,690
Mi Sook!

466
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:30,740
- Excuse me, is there a patient with the name Jeon Mi Sook— 
 - What happened?

467
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:35,130
The doctor will explain the results of her MRI scan once her guardian arrives.

468
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,990
First, you need to proceed to admit her to the hospital.

469
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,690
Mi Sook, are you okay?

470
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:27,730
Sorry. You must be busy.

471
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,460
Jeon Mi Sook, you're really...

472
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,290
Ji Min's dad.

473
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,030
Ji Min's mom.

474
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,720
What is the doctor saying?

475
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,690
Jeon Mi Sook, you...

476
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,080
Why are you here like this?

477
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,880
Mi Sook.

478
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:07,110
What are we going to do with you?

479
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,980
Mi Sook.

480
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,100
Mi Sook.

481
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,560
Mi Sook!

482
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,320
Mi Sook!

483
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,680
What time is it in Paris?

484
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,980
You must be right in the middle of preparing for work.

485
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,120
Tonight, I...

486
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,610
I don't even know what I did all day.

487
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,000
I wished for that bastard to hit the ball well

488
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,630
so that he would at least be in a good mood.

489
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,460
I stood there silently in prayer while feeling punished,

490
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,560
"Fine."

491
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:40,560
"I just need to pour this glass. No big deal."

492
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,490
But then he grabbed my hand.

493
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,280
"Fine, that's fine."

494
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,110
Because until I leave work to go home,

495
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:58,330
I need to be professional.

496
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,460
So...

497
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,070
I wondered if I should get in the car.

498
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,900
I actually thought about it.

499
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,660
But...

500
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,470
during that time,

501
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:34,340
my friend was in a lot of pain.

502
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,460
I'm so mad about that.

503
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,470
While I was pondering something stupid like that,

504
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,980
my friend

505
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,990
was suffering by herself.

506
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,690
That makes me so mad.

507
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,950
Walk a bit faster, please.

508
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:43,170
So that having been called a crazy bastard for not sleeping or eating and working like I'm dying

509
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:47,500
to condense a week's worth of work into three days can be worth the effort.

510
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,820
I missed you.

511
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,500
I missed you too.

512
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,010
The worst man in the world...

513
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,590
Didn't even know his wife was horribly ill...

514
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:03,440
 There really isn't much to life. 

515
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:09,110
 How this could happen to me... 

516
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:11,970
 Nothing felt real. 

517
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,980
 But now that I'm this sick, 

518
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,620
 I suddenly felt scared. 

519
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,920
 Let's get chemo. 

520
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,130
 Why are you giving up already without trying anything? 

521
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:30,250
 Ji Min is only seven years old. 

522
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,910
 Lying there after getting chemo 

523
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:36,220
 and making her get water for me... 

524
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,650
 Not being able to braid her hair from lack of energy... 

525
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:42,600
 Not being able to even put stockings on her. 

526
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,480
 "Mom, why are you always sick?" 

527
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,360
 "Mom, I'm tired of you being sick." 

528
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,430
 "Mom, I hate you." 

529
00:41:56,390 --> 00:42:02,510
 Yeong Eun, I don't want to say goodbye to Ji Min like that. 

530
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,560
 I'll do it. 

531
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,850
 I'll braid her hair, 

532
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:18,960
 and I'll drop her off at school in the mornings. 

533
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,060
 So let's get chemo. 

534
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:24,020
 Even if you'll live for just one extra day. 

535
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,780
 On that day, unlike now, 

536
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,350
 do what you want to do 

537
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:35,480
 and everything you haven't done. 

538
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:40,770
 Let's live one more day, Mi Sook. 

539
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:45,400
 Don't give me hope like that. 

540
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,200
 They said I can't. 

541
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,810
 Yeong Eun, what will I do? 

542
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,450
What do you think is at the end of that road?

543
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,950
Is it hope, or is it

544
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:39,660
an empty end with nothing at all?

545
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,520
It's probably

546
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,980
me there.

547
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,980
No matter what path you take,

548
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:55,630
at the end of it, I'll always be there.

549
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,350
I won't avoid it.

550
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:04,410
No matter what happens.

551
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:15,430
Yoon Jae Gook, can I take advantage of you being my boyfriend just once?

552
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,780
You know, Paris is full of talented designers. 
  (in French) 

553
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:27,370
Even though Mr. J introduced you to me, it is what it is. 
  (in French) 

554
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:30,770
You can't persuade me with simple designs. 
  (in French) 

555
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:36,300
I know. That's why I wanted to show you in person. 
  (in French) 

556
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,410
   

557
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:56,920
What are you so nervous for?

558
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,750
You were the one who introduced her to him. He'll treat her well.

559
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:03,190
They don't care if we're friends or not, Hyung.

560
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:05,270
If it's good, it's good and if not, it's not.

561
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:08,150
When it comes to work, they are extremely cold.

562
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,680
Sonó. Interesting. 
  (in French) 

563
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:24,870
Let me tell you a fairy tale. 
  (in French) 

564
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:29,760
Once upon a time, the assistant of a famous photographer 
  (in French) 

565
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,190
left this note in a young designer's portfolio. 
  (in French) 

566
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:48,090
♫  When you look deeply into my heart  ♫

567
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:50,650
I hope one day, passions become "sono."

568
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:54,640
 It means that I want my passion to become an echo. 

569
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,410
 Isn't it cool? 

570
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:02,370
 Wherever it may be, my first brand will be Sonó. 

571
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,920
This man became a world-famous photographer. 
  (in French) 

572
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,750
And the young lady... 
  (in French) 

573
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,200
She's here. She's become a marvelous designer. 
  (in French) 

574
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:24,020
♫  Which will fill my heart is you  ♫

575
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,870
♫  Please hold my hand  ♫

576
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:28,690
How did it go?

577
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:33,920
What is it? Did it not go well?

578
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:38,640
That little bastard. I told him to treat you well.

579
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:42,060
He gave me two months.

580
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:47,160
He'd like to start a pop-up store at Galeries Lafayette for two months.

581
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,570
He's going to see the results before deciding to open an official store or not.

582
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:06,450
♫  Please hold my hand  ♫

583
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:09,350
♫  Please don't leave me alone  ♫

584
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:15,550
  Fate disguises itself as coincidence and approaches you. 

585
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:20,560
  Maybe, even in moments that I was unaware of, 

586
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:28,300
♫  I think I will be fine again  ♫

587
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:32,520
  you were at the end of the road, 

588
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,340
  standing there for me. 

589
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:41,020
 What do you think is at the end of that road? 

590
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,100
  Probably me. 

591
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,910
  No matter what path you take, 

592
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:50,940
 at the end of it, I'll always be there. 

593
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:00,840
See? You never know how life will flow by.

594
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,600
That's true.

595
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,380
I never expected that the four of us would plan to go to Paris. Never.

596
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,080
I never saw it coming.

597
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:12,280
Then, let's all have a huge cheers.

598
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,340
Cheers.

599
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:17,840
Make sure you order drinks more than dishes. The margins are higher.

600
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,510
Okay, okay.

601
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,760
You used to be a chief at The One,

602
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,540
but now you're working as a boss here. Do you like it?

603
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:30,650
I quit because I thought it was unfair living to serve work, but now I'm serving others' needs.

604
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:34,360
With that being said, I'd be grateful for more orders.

605
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,320
Please market it well, CEO Seok.

606
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,650
Don't worry. I know some people in Paris.

607
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:43,900
You have to approach them head-on.

608
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,860
The more stuck-up you are, the more attraction they feel.

609
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,880
You learn quickly, CEO Seok.

610
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,660
Hey, I go out to Paris twice a year in the spring and fall.

611
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,180
I'm so excited.

612
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:59,050
I can't believe this, the Galeries Lafayette in Paris!

613
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:02,490
Do well or my dad will fire you.

614
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:06,550
Oh, did the CEO of The One say that he'll fire me if I don't do this well?

615
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:11,210
To be honest, my father found out

616
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:13,930
about Yeong Eun and Yoon Jae Gook.

617
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:18,020
Then, Team Leader Ha is going to get fired too?

618
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,160
You'd get fired over that?

619
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,020
Well, if I get fired, there's nothing I can do about it.

620
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:27,090
Enough of that. So I'm telling you to do well in Paris at Galeries Lafayette,

621
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:29,210
or I'll be the one getting fired this time.

622
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:30,990
Do you understand, CEO Seok?

623
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:36,270
You're the one who would be least affected by getting fired.

624
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:43,130
Anyway, whether it be personal or official, we are aiming for Galeries Lafayette in Paris.

625
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:45,350
We're one team until we reach our goal,

626
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:48,140
so let's work well as a team together. Okay?

627
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,400
Okay!

628
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,930
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

629
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,120
I told you I'd get you a taxi, but you insisted on coming along.

630
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:08,340
From my exhausted point of view, I can't understand you.

631
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:11,380
If you didn't come with me, you would have gone with J.

632
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:15,810
He's my roommate, so that sounds like the obvious.

633
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,790
You've never dated anyone, right?

634
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:23,470
You could say I'm a careful type who doesn't give his heart out recklessly.

635
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:31,090
For me, my love experiences are my life's only asset.

636
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:35,320
Must feel quite secure having such an abundance of life assets.

637
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,210
My father's scary,

638
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:42,400
and my younger brother is no help to me.

639
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:47,470
So I always filled what I needed with love.

640
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:49,240
Why are you speaking slower again?

641
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,870
I can't carry you on my back.

642
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:54,390
If you get drunk, you're too heavy.

643
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:56,080
Did you see earlier?

644
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,040
J stuck his fork into a fruit and gave it to Yeong Eun.

645
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,060
Not sure, I'm not too interested in Cookie.

646
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,510
Yeong Eun only looked at J, too.

647
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:09,220
Well, they were sitting across from each other.

648
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:20,830
What does this uncomfortable stare mean?

649
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,750
Paris. We're going, right?

650
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:25,780
It'd be nice to go.

651
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,440
Then my father has to trust Yeong Eun like he did in the past,

652
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,950
and it'd be advantageous for him to give his full support.

653
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:35,240
With adequate support, it'll be easier.

654
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,460
Will you take my side just once?

655
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,150
What?

656
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,120
Listen well.

657
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,060
What'd you say? I can't really hear you.

658
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,170
This is strictly business.

659
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:54,580
Me, you, Yeong Eun, and J. It's for everyone.

660
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:57,740
- What? 
 - It'll just take a moment, so trust me and follow.

661
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,470
Where are we going now?

662
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,410
It's him again?!

663
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:28,980
Chi Sook! Come in this instant!

664
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:35,120
Are you rebelling on purpose for me to see?

665
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,710
Are you not embarrassed? How could you, in front of the house?

666
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:40,970
Because I love him and I feel passionate.

667
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,820
Is it love if you're afraid of others' gazes?

668
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,130
Quiet!

669
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:46,480
That man won't do! End it immediately.

670
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,960
There probably is no other country besides ours where people interfere in others' dating lives to this extent.

671
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,680
Am I a stranger?!

672
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,660
Anyway, when it comes to love between a man and a woman, you're a third party.

673
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,360
Oh, you little!

674
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,960
But, Dad, you're going overboard.

675
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,740
Yeong Eun and Jae Gook both like each other, but if you hold a grudge

676
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:12,920
and act mean to her, driving her to a corner, that's going way overboard.

677
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:17,030
Wash up now and go to bed. We'll talk again tomorrow.

678
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:20,510
Please help Yeong Eun, Dad.

679
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:23,180
She didn't steal him, Dad.

680
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,260
I didn't show up at the meeting that day.

681
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:29,720
Yeong Eun is only guilty of helping me and cleaning up after my mess.

682
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:36,620
I don't want to lose my only best friend because of you, Dad!

683
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,890
So clumsy...

684
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,200
   

685
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,290
   

686
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:00,340
   

687
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,360
   

688
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,740
Assistant Manager Seo, how's the press release coming along?

689
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,350
- It's almost done. 
 - Okay!

690
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:09,860
The articles are concise, accurate, and strong!

691
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,880
This is Vision PR and Sonó coming together!

692
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,050
Everyone, let's go for it!

693
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,000
 Sonó is going to be in the same space as Givenchy and Tiffany's pop-up stores? 

694
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,650
 K Fashion finally enters the Paris market! 

695
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:20,240
 It's properly showing that Korea is a fashion powerhouse. 

696
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,820
 - Buy me a Sonó dress for my birthday. 
 - My wife is a Sonó fanatic. 

697
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,580
 Sonó's jersey dress is still sold out. When are they going to restock? 

698
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:24,850
If you wait just a little longer...

699
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:26,800
We are open to the possibility of...

700
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,850
We will consider it positively.

701
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,000
What happened?

702
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,250
DPHP was looking for a brand,

703
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:35,110
and it seems to have been impressed by Sonó's jersey show.

704
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,570
So you're telling me that Sonó approached their head director whom we couldn't identify

705
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:39,780
before we did?

706
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:43,530
A photographer named Mr. J was the bridge between the two.

707
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:47,360
Galeries Lafayette in Paris okayed the pop-up?

708
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,170
DPHP recognized it right away.

709
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:53,250
I may not make clothes well, but I have a good eye.

710
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,540
I okayed each and every one of those pieces.

711
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:58,390
It's not surprising, is it Team Leader Ha?

712
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:00,460
Her discerning eye helped a lot, too.

713
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,390
Not only that,

714
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:04,420
everyone is going crazy right now.

715
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:07,980
The department stores where Sonó has a retail space are asking to extend the contract and offering cuts in commission.

716
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,540
Hanseong is asking for exclusivity,

717
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,540
and places that aren't finished with their construction are asking us to choose a space.

718
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,810
Nothing from The Hills?

719
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:18,750
I think we need to make the decision this time.

720
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,760
You have something to say.

721
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,290
There is something you misunderstood.

722
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:29,110
You said that domestic brands have a limitation.

723
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:32,930
To me, it looks like The Hills has a limitation.

724
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:37,940
Your groundbreaking initiative was merely importing many foreign brands,

725
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:42,430
so the commission you couldn't receive from them, you took it from domestic brands.

726
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:46,450
Retail prices rose and customers left again.

727
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:50,740
Jae Gook helped you get a pop-up at Galeries Lafayette,

728
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,370
so it will be great for a month.

729
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:56,680
But how long do you think that will last?

730
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,420
It won't change at once.

731
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:03,190
So I am going to try two, three more times.

732
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:05,520
I am going to try until I succeed.

733
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:11,000
You are much more reckless than I thought.

734
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,980
Perhaps.

735
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:19,970
Yes, I lost to love and experienced losing my dreams, my future, everything.

736
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:24,310
I know how foolish and reckless this emotion is.

737
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:30,450
But if I am this way regardless, it is because I am serious about Yoon Jae Gook.

738
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:34,720
But this self,

739
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,390
this foolish and reckless self...

740
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,360
I welcome it.

741
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:47,300
Don't retract the termination letter.

742
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:52,000
We, Sonó, will not sell at The Hills.

743
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,630
It's not that The Hills is firing us, but we are cutting off The Hills.

744
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:59,110
Thank you, my friend. 
  (in French) 

745
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:01,280
No, I don't accept your thanks. 
  (in French) 

746
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,780
We didn't choose her because of you. It was her talent. 
  (in French) 

747
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:06,350
You know me. I don't mix the friendship and business together. 
  (in French) 

748
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:09,420
As expected, you have an eye for talent. 
  (in French) 

749
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,940
You deserve your place at DPHP. 
  (in French) 

750
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,520
I really liked her creativity and style. 
  (in French) 

751
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,400
Really, I won't let her go. 
  (in French) 

752
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,020
It's true. She has style.
  (in French) 

753
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:22,750
You've got everything, don't you? Do you know how lucky you are?  (in French) 

754
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:27,020
 I've never once had it all. 

755
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:30,110
 When I was born, my father wasn't there. 

756
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:34,780
 When I turned two, my mother disappeared. 

757
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:48,390
 My life... was not envied by anyone else. 

758
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:09,180
Because I'm thankful. Immensely and crazily thankful.

759
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,850
It wasn't because of me.

760
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:15,410
He said your clothes said it all.

761
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:26,340
Good job. You did really well.

762
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,080
Good morning.

763
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,190
You're here.

764
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:20,370
Hello, Ha Yeong Eun speaking.

765
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,590
 Hello? 

766
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:29,720
Hello? Please speak.

767
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:35,600
I'm... Soo Wan's mom.

768
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:43,820
Let's... meet.

769
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:55,160
If you're Soo Wan's mother,

770
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,720
there's no reason why we should meet.

771
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:03,960
But...

772
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:08,220
if you're Yoon Jae Gook's mother,

773
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,870
yes, I'll meet you.

774
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:21,240
♫  As much as I think of you  ♫

775
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:28,240
♫  As much as I  am concerned about you  ♫

776
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,700
♫  As much as the time we've spent together  ♫

777
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,460
♫  As much as  we miss each other  ♫

778
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:38,400
♫  That's how much distance  ♫

779
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:44,590
♫  Our relationship needs right now  ♫

01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,060
 How do you feel about him? 

783
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,980
 It's love. 

784
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,380
 Does this look normal to you? 

785
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:06,130
 It's not enough that just you two are happy. You don't live alone in this world. 

786
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:07,570
 Yeong Eun! 

787
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:09,450
 Another hill to climb over is approaching me. 

788
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:11,260
 Has my father said anything? 

789
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,400
 - Did you cause a problem? 
 - CEO Seok confessed that he likes me. 

790
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,770
 Nice to meet you. 

791
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:17,620
 I've come to see Director Hwang Chi Sook. 

792
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,410
 Since when? Are you serious about him, too? 

793
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:22,850
 Not me! You know he's not my type. 

794
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:24,710
 Can I lean on you? 

795
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:28,400
 I'm going to do everything I can and say goodbye well. 

796
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,520
 It's a resignation letter. 

797
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,430
 Why so suddenly? 

798
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:34,080
 Why didn't you tell me? Why? 

799
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:38,120
 Why was I the only one who didn't know? You wenches. 

800
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,600
 Do you want to bring her home once? 

801
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,270
 Let's just do what we've been doing. Let's do what we can. 

802
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:47,480
 Jae Gook and that girl, their feelings are resolute. 

803
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,990
 in the end, 

804
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:55,530
 those two... 

805
01:01:55,530 --> 01:01:59,110
♫  How is the place without me  ♫

806
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,800
♫  Is your mind at peace a little  ♫
