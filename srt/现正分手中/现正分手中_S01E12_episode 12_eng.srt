1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:05,940
   

2
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,310
   

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,340
   

4
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,870
   
   

5
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:33,050


6
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,840
   

7
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,440
Should we

8
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,580
just go to Paris?

9
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,890
A place where there is no one...

10
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,340
No family, no one we know...

11
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,930
A place where there's no one to tell us

12
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,840
to do this or that.

13
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,400
A place where there's just the two of us...

14
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,180
Shall we go?

15
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,290
 If I can't overcome it, 

16
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,960
 I'll try once more. 

17
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,330
 If I can't go, 

18
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,800
 I'll take one more step. 

19
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,950
Because you are you

20
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,340
and because I am me,

21
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,280
if we can't love here no matter how hard we try,

22
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,990
let's go.

23
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,360
Let's leave.

24
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,170
   

25
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,410
   

26
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,820
   

27
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,170
   
   

28
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,020
   

29
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,920
   

30
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,370
   

31
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,470
   
   

32
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,910
What? An interview? 
    

33
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,010
Are you really thinking of working at another company?

34
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,680
I'm going to get this month's paycheck and then go.

35
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,060
They said that they'd give us a better deal if you and I move as a team.

36
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,620
How could you? What if the team leader finds about this?

37
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,770
Whose side do you think the team leader will be on?

38
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,610
Our side or Director Hwang and her family's side?

39
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,890
Still, this isn't right, Ahn Seon Joo. This is stabbing somebody in the back.

40
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,640
We're the ones who were stabbed in the back.

41
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,630
After losing our jobs and becoming unemployed one morning because we trusted the team leader,

42
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,110
there's no point in blaming her then.

43
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,970
They said it's enough to bring the portfolio.

44
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,930
Let's include the designs that we created for Lafayette, too.

45
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,750
We made all those anyway.

46
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,160
   

47
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,650
   
   

48
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,690
Was there a reply from Lafayette?

49
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,470
No, not yet.

50
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,500
What are you two doing?

51
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,840
You see, Team Leader, it is hard to concentrate on work,

52
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,150
and it keeps feeling unstable to work here, so...

53
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,880
There was an article this morning saying even Jangseo Group was sold.

54
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,160
There are rumors circulating that The One is up next on the chopping block.

55
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,000
- So? 
 - Team Leader Oh In Na is even submitting medical leave for fibroids.

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,200
She's basically announcing that she's taking time off to go on interviews.

57
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,110
The company won't tell us anything, and these rumors keep circulating,

58
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,660
so it's true that we're anxious, Team Leader.

59
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,000
So there is no reply from Lafayette yet?

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,180
Even if Lafayette were to respond, so much time has passed

61
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,780
that it's difficult to meet the deadline within the month they gave us.

62
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,530
We won't be able to do it, Team Leader.

63
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:31,840
Director Hwang or the CEO will probably take care of you whether the company is sold or not,

64
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,200
but that's not the case for us.

65
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,970
 Should we go to Paris? 

66
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,330
We need to find our own path for survival.

67
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,420
It's not like you're going to take responsibility for us.

68
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,320
 Shall we go? 

69
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,910
Request once more for an answer by today.

70
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:57,290
- Team Leader. 
 - You all may be able to give up this easily, but I can't.

71
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,770
You're trying to survive by going to interviews and making portfolios,

72
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,930
so fine, I won't say anything about those.

73
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,940
But do what you're supposed to do here properly.

74
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,320
Faithfully until the end.

75
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,160
That's right. You have to be hurt. Being hurt matures you.

76
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,520
Thank you for making even my coffee. You've grown up, my Cookie.

77
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,850
Why are you going to work so late?

78
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,550
There's a meeting at The One, so I'm going to go straight there.

79
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,900
The company atmosphere there seems very uneasy.

80
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,250
   
   

81
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,230
Cookie, you've got a text message.

82
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,330
 Hello, Mr. Yoon Jae Gook. This is Frédéric from Lavilles Real Estate. 

83
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,690
 This is in regards to the apartment listings in Marais.  

84
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,930
Are you going back to Paris?

85
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,480
- For good? 
 - I haven't decided for sure yet.

86
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,900
Together with Team Leader Ha Yeong Eun?

87
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,260
That's not decided for sure either.

88
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,750
Just a minute.

89
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,110
Yes? 
  (in French) 

90
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,520
I guess the kid has decided to go.

91
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,370
Team Leader, the sample is out. I should take care of the fitting, right?

92
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,640
- Anything from Lafayette? 
 - I don't think we've heard anything yet.

93
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,630
- Really? 
 - I'll prepare for the fitting.

94
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,890
You're not looking for another job?

95
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,180
This is my job. Why should I look for another one?

96
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,940
Manager Nam and Assistant Manager Ahn both seem fiercely busy in order to survive.

97
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,290
Hey, Mr. Hwang Chi Hyeong, you keep speaking informally.

98
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,950
I'm just saying you should not work so hard.

99
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,240
You don't always get rewarded for it.

100
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,730
I'm not working hard for the company. I'm working hard on my job.

101
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:14,980
Whether the company is sold or not, I don't know what the higher ups are thinking.

102
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,130
What's important to me is the 2022 S/S of Sonó.

103
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,350
Whether it goes to Lafayette or not, Korea or Paris,

104
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,930
if there are people wearing the shirt I designed, that's its own reward.

105
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,780
What are you doing at dinner time tonight?

106
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,940
- Of course, I'm going to be busy. 
 - What about tomorrow?

107
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,780
Tomorrow also.

108
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,270
You're putting up too strong a wall.

109
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,460
Did you just call me "you"?

110
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,580
You-nim?

111
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,360
Sunbae-nim? 
   (Adding -nim is a respectful sign of address, formal speech)  

112
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,360
- Steam. 
 - Okay.  (Informal) 

113
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,840
Okay.  (Formal) 

114
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,280
- Shall we start? 
 - Yes!

115
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,990
Just a minute.

116
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,100
Yes, it's me.

117
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,850
 Daughter, just know that your mother and I are going to court. 

118
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,840
Mom, what's all this?

119
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,120
The lawyer told me to do it.

120
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,290
She told me to write all that.

121
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,020
The lawyer?

122
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,010
   

123
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,860
 Then shall we start? 

124
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,430
 Did your husband step out on you? 

125
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,900
 Did he raise his hand to you when he drank alcohol? 

126
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,380
 Did he not provide you with any living expenses at all during your marriage? 

127
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,840
 It wasn't any of that. 

128
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,770
 I just don't want to live with him anymore. 

129
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,340
 You have to prove your husband's fault in divorce  

130
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,540
 to be able to receive alimony. 

131
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,040
Alimony? Alimony, as if.

132
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,760
So I'm saying let's go speak in court.

133
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,940
Let's see if the judge takes your side.

134
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,290
Just what fault do I have?

135
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,050
"I spent my whole life eating dry rice."

136
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,720
"I like sticky rice"?

137
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,770
You asked me why I always ate my rice mixed with water.

138
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,140
It's because I couldn't swallow it.

139
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,330
So you want to separate over something so trivial?

140
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:52,120
Something so trivial? Everything written there is trivial?

141
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,530
You said nothing all this time, and now that I'm old and jobless,

142
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,280
you want to divorce immediately.

143
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,310
You're so ungrateful that I can't give you one cent of this house or my pension. Not one cent!

144
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,470
Why can't you give it to me? Why won't you give it to me?

145
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,890
I can't give it to you. It's all mine.

146
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:14,430
How much did I do for you for 30 years?

147
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,550
Why are you saying you can't give it to me?

148
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,740
I earned it all.

149
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,490
You only earned it. Did you try saving even a cent?

150
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,800
I cooked, did laundry, and raised the child. Half of this house—

151
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,920
Did I play? Did I?

152
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,710
You always stood as a guarantor for people and lost all our money.

153
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,170
You gave money to all sorts of random places.

154
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,130
 I went to a gathering with my husband, 

155
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,260
 but my husband introduced me. 

156
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,130
 He called me "his wife" and "the mother of my child." 

157
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,490
 He has never once introduced me with my name. 

158
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,760
 For 40 years, the two names "wife" and "mother" 

159
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,840
 were the only names I lived under. 

160
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,670
 At the culture center, I had to write what I am good at. 

161
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,240
 But all I know how to do are 

162
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,100
 to cook, to do laundry, and to clean... 

163
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,510
 so I could not fill it out until the end. 

164
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:35,110
 Looking at the other wives, they had various hobbies like 

165
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,760
 flower arrangement and cross-stitching. 

166
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,980
 The day before yesterday at our savings club meeting, people said we should go on a trip. 

167
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,330
 My husband asks 

168
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,280
 "Where would you go leaving the kitchen unattended?" 

169
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,950
 "What would I eat before going to work?" 

170
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,230
 Giving an excuse that we're busy, 

171
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,120
 we didn't go. 

172
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,140
What kind of money do you have that you would have your eyes on a super car worth over ₩100 million?

173
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,460
If the company gets sold, something should come my way.

174
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,220
What have you done for the company?

175
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,970
You're a new hire.

176
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,490
What have you done?

177
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,400
I'm a director.

178
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,180
You're only a director in title. In practice, Yeong Eun is the one who did everything.

179
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,250
Anyway, there will be nothing left for you if I am to open a specialty boutique,

180
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,700
so drive around carefully in the car you have.

181
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,720
Specialty boutique?

182
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,650
Shopping is my hobby and specialty.

183
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,670
I'm going to gather and buy all the luxury brands at once. A big buyer.

184
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,420
Who would trust your taste?

185
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:49,090
That's because my hands aren't great, but my taste is properly high class.

186
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,470
Even so, Hwang Chi Sook without Ha Yeong Eun

187
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,010
- is a snail shell without a snail. 
 - That's it!

188
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,740
Would the two of you stop?

189
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,040
Oh!

190
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,520
What brings you here?

191
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,030
Who is he?

192
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,130
I'm Seok Do Hoon,

193
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:10,300
the CEO of Vision PR and Director Hwang Chi Sook's current boyfriend.

194
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:11,890
Noona, are you crazy?

195
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,310
Why are you presenting your boyfriend at a lunch appointment called by our dad?

196
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,680
I... didn't call him though.

197
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,650
CEO Hwang called me.

198
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,740
- My dad did? 
 - Our father did?

199
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,200
After listening to your conversation for a bit while waiting for the CEO outside,

200
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,850
it was so ridiculous beyond measure

201
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,970
that I had no choice but to step in.

202
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,090
What?

203
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,700
With the rumor going around that this company is being handed over,

204
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,480
the children of the company owner are talking about specialty boutiques

205
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,420
and super cars?

206
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,680
Do you know how nervous the employees are right now?

207
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,770
There are heads of family worried about their children's after school program fees for the upcoming month.

208
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,970
How many months will they be able to afford on severance pay? Will they be rehired?

209
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,890
There are colleagues who are sleeping fitfully at night wondering about those.

210
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,930
Do you not feel a single bit of responsibility for those people?

211
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,810
I'm making new plans so I can take responsibility for my own life.

212
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,730
And that will be through buying luxury goods with the money from the company sale?

213
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,940
Hwang Chi Sook, have you always been in that position with that mindset?

214
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,960
Pretty sure she has been.

215
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,060
An owner is not someone who only deliberates over how they will live.

216
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,450
Increasing the value of the company

217
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,460
and giving the employees faith that they will be able to work here in the future is what an owner does!

218
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,740
That's why they get a large room and a nice chair.

219
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,740
Because the weight of their role on their shoulders is heavy and burdensome.

220
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,300
There is no need to raise your voice.

221
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,400
My sister can't understand anyway.

222
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,010
You don't know what he's talking about, do you?

223
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,410
Sister, you say?

224
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,230
Where is your sister here?

225
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,070
Excuse me?

226
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,470
Wow, it appears that these siblings don't know about the three principles and five virtues of Confucianism

227
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,680
or that elders come first.

228
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,280
Please treat each other with respect!

229
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,820
If this were my company–

230
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,100
And if you were my younger brother–

231
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,600
Hold on there.

232
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,260
I'm not "there" nor am I "here." I am Vision PR's CEO Seok Do Hoon.

233
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,050
What I'm saying is, CEO Seok Do Hoon–

234
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,270
Take your hands out of your pockets!

235
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,740
Responsibility.

236
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,880
Take it on.

237
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,160
Yes.

238
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,290
Ah, you have arrived, CEO.

239
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,020
Dad...

240
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,430
Hi...

241
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,840
Sit.

242
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,830
Great job!

243
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,400
Did I go through all of that raising you for you to come out like this?

244
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,020
What's a man doing working in the kitchen?

245
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,860
- Mom. 
 - Look at you!

246
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,670
What is this?

247
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,990
- Seriously! 
 - Mom...

248
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,790
Honey...

249
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,340
And you were sleeping?

250
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,040
You came, Mother-in-Law?

251
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,910
You should have at least called.

252
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,030
Was I in the situation to?

253
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,040
I've been shocked twice today.

254
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,390
I went near his work and gave him a call, but what do I hear?

255
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,050
He resigned?

256
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,520
Wondering if he was sick, I came all the way here without stopping, but you've got it made!

257
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,690
You're sleeping while my precious child is making food?

258
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,520
Mom, that's not it. Ji Min's mom isn't doing too well.

259
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,330
- So I– 
 - It's always this hurts or that hurts!

260
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,290
Those exact words prevent a man working hard outside from succeeding!

261
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,720
Mom...

262
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,240
What benefit has my son received by being with you?

263
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,510
Did you work to contribute to the household or was your family wealthy enough to be helpful in getting a bigger house?

264
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,770
Please go, Mom! She's actually sick!

265
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,900
- Please don't be like this! 
 - Let go!

266
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,840
I didn't receive it.

267
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,710
In order to help contribute to buying our house,

268
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,290
my mother pulled out her retirement savings. How could I accept that?

269
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,930
If you're married, you're an adult,

270
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,810
so we should take care of it on our own.

271
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,520
So taking care of it is

272
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,100
making your husband resign while you lie down getting fed?

273
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,820
Mother!

274
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,000
Whether he writes a resignation letter or I get fed

275
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,530
is our business, and we will decide it.

276
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,160
Look at how this girl speaks!

277
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,560
So what? I should keep my mouth shut?

278
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,730
Is that what you're saying?

279
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,530
I'm telling you to stop! Please!

280
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,460
Why? Now while you're at it, just say that I shouldn't come at all!

281
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,210
Would you be able to do that?

282
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,050
Then if you could do that for me, it would be great!

283
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,540
Wh-Wh-What did you say?

284
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,820
I'm going to get some air and come back.

285
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,880
Ji Min's mom.

286
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,270
What is she doing right now?

287
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,660
Mother, please!

288
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,390
I really can't believe the likes of that one.

289
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,040
So you came without even eating?

290
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,680
I came here suddenly, but you have a lot of side dishes.

291
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,740
I visited my mom.

292
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,470
I don't even eat that much but she always packs so much. You know.

293
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,840
At least my mother made us side dishes.

294
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,380
What exactly did she do?

295
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,700
If someone heard, they would think that she had at least bought us a house!

296
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,330
But we bought our house through Soo Ho's loan and my marriage fund!

297
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,600
You should have said that you two paid back the loan together, but your marriage fund was yours to begin with.

298
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,850
I was worked up, so I didn't think of it.

299
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,420
I mean, about having kids too...

300
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,840
Did we have just one because we wanted only one child?

301
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,040
It's already so expensive to raise one child.

302
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,060
If you're dating, it's "when are you getting married?"

303
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,240
If you're married, it's "when will you have kids?"

304
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,380
If you have a kid, it's "when are you having a second?"

305
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,640
It's not like they're going to live life for you, but they tell you to do this and that.

306
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,440
They have so much to say.

307
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,380
If she had changed Ji Min's diapers even just once, I would have held it in.

308
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,610
Did Soo Ho really say he won't go to work?

309
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,080
Yeah.

310
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,270
He doesn't listen.

311
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,440
It's because he's worried about you.

312
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,150
Living well would be helping me.

313
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,930
Rather than myself losing weight,

314
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:29,720
it pains me more to see Ji Min's dad's shoulders sag.

315
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,280
If I didn't have you at times like this, what would I have done?

316
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,870
Really?

317
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,160
Why?

318
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
Is something wrong again?

319
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,030
He said we should go to Paris together.

320
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,970
So?

321
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,160
Did you say that you would go?

322
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,190
Should I go?

323
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,710
Just like that?

324
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:25,480
   

325
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,980
   

326
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,930
Did you get hurt?

327
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,120
Yeah, while climbing.

328
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,370
   

329
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,600
I have been thinking about it since then.

330
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,350
Did I really love Soo Wan?

331
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,330
Could it have been an obsession?

332
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:30,320
Or... did I dislike being rejected?

333
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,840
If it wasn't for Ha Yeong Eun,

334
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,160
would Soo Wan and I

335
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,980
really not have any problems?

336
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,370
Would we be...

337
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:44,550
living happily until now?

338
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,830
Even still, I have no choice

339
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,900
but to still have lingering feelings about

340
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,260
a road I was not able to take.

341
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:58,700
And even still, I have no choice but to resent Ha Yeong Eun.

342
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,900
I know.

343
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,760
And I still...

344
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:13,460
long for Soo Wan so much, Jae Gook.

345
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,970
Yes.

346
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,680
I know, Noona.

347
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,480
Don't let go

348
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,120
of Ha Yeong Eun.

349
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,690
The thing that hurts the most in life is frequently thinking of

350
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,010
the road that I wasn't able to reach the end of.

351
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,030
I can't forgive Ha Yeong Eun,

352
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,270
but even then,

353
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:46,090
your love is not something that I can call into question.

354
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:50,560
Can anyone throw a rock at someone else?

355
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,200
I won't speak about Ha Yeong Eun with you anymore.

356
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,530
You know what I mean, right?

357
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,620
Yeah.

358
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,340
Stay well.

359
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,970
   

360
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,050
  Life is beginning to wrinkle from its troubles. 

361
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,380
  At times, it becomes a sigh. 

362
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:54,210
  At times, it becomes tears. 

363
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,600
She's not waking at all?

364
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,060
No, the medications must be too strong

365
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,210
that she wasn't able to keep her dinner down

366
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,560
and she has been knocked out, sleeping.

367
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,600
I see.

368
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,910
You haven't told your mother about Mi Sook yet?

369
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,390
I told her earlier.

370
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:39,100
She was asking me why I didn't tell her sooner.

371
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,260
She was saying she felt so bad for Ji Min's mom

372
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,370
and she's sorry.

373
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:52,150
You should go back to work.

374
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,180
Although it's good to be by Mi Sook's side,

375
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,700
what she truly wants

376
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,550
is for you to act like nothing's wrong.

377
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:09,060
You need to show her that you can live on like nothing's wrong,

378
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,720
and that'll make her feel better.

379
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,340
For me...

380
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,010
For me, Yeong Eun,

381
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:21,400
I didn't realize how much I was relying on Mi Sook until now.

382
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,080
I didn't know how much I loved her.

383
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,350
Why did I only realize that now?

384
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:32,410
We were together for so long.

385
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:39,110
That's the same for all of us, don't you think?

386
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,330
Oh, I'm sorry.

387
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,000
I'll come by early tomorrow morning to pick her up.

388
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,780
You should rest up.

389
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:55,370
  One line after the other, life forms new wrinkles. 

390
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:59,940
  At times, it becomes a sigh. 

391
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,480
  At times, it becomes tears. 

392
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,520
  At times, it becomes a path. 

393
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,600
I've looked into a few places where we could stay in Paris.

394
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,380
There's one that is next to an art museum and some with good infrastructure.

395
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,280
And this one has a lot of parks.

396
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,940
There is one near a pretty cafe, too.

397
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,710
I know where this is. When I was studying abroad,

398
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,450
I told myself that I'd earn a lot of money and live there one day.

399
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,190
You can live there now. With me.

400
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,970
That'll be fun.

401
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,590
I'm going to call them right now and sign the contract then.

402
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,050
My mom wants to get a divorce.

403
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:08,370
There is a high chance that my parents will take it to court.

404
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,300
I tried to stop them,

405
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,140
but after reading all of the details that my mom wrote out,

406
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,710
I am not sure if stopping them will solve anything.

407
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:24,130
Each time I meet my friend whom I love so much,

408
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,050
she seems to be dropping a size.

409
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,790
People are saying that the company will be sold.

410
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,020
Trying to find new jobs,

411
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,620
my team members have been looking into other companies.

412
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,350
So...

413
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,020
So?

414
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,930
How can I leave by myself?

415
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,960
Those people are the ones who are going through such a hard time right now.

416
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,740
How can I ignore it?

417
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,930
When I lost everything,

418
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:01,650
Sonó was what kept me going.

419
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:07,000
Even if everyone else leaves, I should be the one to stay.

420
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,550
Yeong Eun.

421
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:13,790
♫  I am apprehensive  ♫

422
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:18,620
My heart is with you in Paris,

423
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:24,280
on these streets, looking up at the sky and laughing

424
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,910
already.

425
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:32,310
But my life won't actually let me go.

426
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:37,010
♫  Stay with me always  ♫

427
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:40,610
Can't you live in a less exhausting way?

428
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:44,960
Can't you forget it all and just think about me?

429
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,320
Am I not allowed to be that greedy?

430
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,210
♫  Because it's you, I hold your hand because it's you  ♫

431
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:57,360
♫  Even if I run away for a long time again  ♫

432
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,590
♫  We'll always be together  ♫

433
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:10,990
♫  Like my unchanging heart, forevermore  ♫

434
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,280
♫  Being filled with memories which are our painful memories  ♫

435
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:29,590
 I love you, but I love my life too. 

436
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,830
Even though my parents are getting divorced, my friend is sick,

437
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:41,080
and my company is at risk since it may be sold at any moment...

438
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,070
Although it's all unstable,

439
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:51,460
that's more of a reason as to why I can't leave.

440
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:59,920
♫  We'll always be together  ♫

441
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:06,970
♫  Like my unchanging heart, forevermore  ♫

442
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,640
Team Leader.

443
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,910
Yes? Did Lafayette respond?

444
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,920
No, not yet.

445
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,790
What should we do now?

446
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,340
Let's stop waiting.

447
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,840
If they're not giving a response,

448
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,950
it's because they're unsure as to whether our clothes will come out well or not.

449
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,460
Then we'll have them look at it directly and decide.

450
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,940
Are you going to alter the sample and send it over?

451
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,680
No, we're going to have a show.

452
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,900
What?

453
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,590
For Sonó's 2022 S/S show, let's go with a virtual show.

454
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:05,470
Sonó is going to have a show in front of international buyers?

455
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,980
Wow, the scale.

456
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,930
You always exceed expectations, Team Leader Ha.

457
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:11,790
We can't waste time waiting for a response.

458
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:16,070
Nothing will happen if we just keep altering things based on what they say,

459
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,020
and the end result won't turn out well.

460
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,190
Since we are confident about what we make, instead of doing that,

461
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,830
we can just tell them to take a look then decide how they want to judge us.

462
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:28,090
 The company is going through a hardship, and people arguing whether it will be sold or not. 

463
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,800
 Do you think Chief Go will even sign it? 

464
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,830
Use it. Use as much as you'd like.

465
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:38,090
When you need to go all out, you really need to go all out.

466
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,240
March forward!

467
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,630
There are no take-backs.

468
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,230
Team Leader Ha, have you done a lot of take-backs?

469
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,380
I'll take all responsibility!

470
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,230
I'll take all responsibility, so

471
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,460
you can do what you want, Team Leader Ha.

472
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,520
As much as you want.

473
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,810
Oh, of course. Huh?

474
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,540
What's the salary like?

475
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,030
A buyers show?

476
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:08,220
The goal of the Lafayette pop-up was to increase awareness of our clothes.

477
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,510
I think it's more efficient to show them directly to the buyers.

478
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,090
To bring in one purchasing buyer, it costs tens of millions to over a hundred million won.

479
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,530
And on top of that, there's the cost of models, staff, and personnel.

480
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,930
The burden of the costs is too high.

481
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:25,180
But what the buyers are looking for the most is a skilled designer, isn't that true?

482
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,900
I'm a director.

483
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,830
I'm thinking on behalf of the company.

484
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,790
If you think they won't come because of the lack of brand awareness,

485
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,390
let's take off the labels and tell them to just look at the clothes.

486
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,300
- What? 
 - Even for designer luxury items,

487
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,350
if we take off the labels and logo...

488
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,950
There are lots of people who think

489
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,720
"You're going to pay millions of won to buy this? You must have money to throw away."

490
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,690
What do you think, CEO Seok?

491
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,880
I think it's a good idea.

492
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,240
One of the greatest obstacles for domestic brands is brand power.

493
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,980
If you take that away and compete only using the clothes,

494
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,470
you will be able to receive a proper evaluation without prejudice.

495
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,180
If you're going to go for it anyway, going all out

496
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,550
will be helpful in attracting people's attention.

497
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:07,190
If we invite 50 buyers from Europe, the United States, and China,

498
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,660
the anticipated cost is 400 million won.

499
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,920
We're going to proceed with a virtual, online show.

500
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,500
The anticipated cost is zero.

501
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,940
Like Vivienne Westwood, Balenciaga, Vetements, and other luxury brands?

502
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:20,310
The camera catches even the texture of the clothes, so the buyers prefer it very much.

503
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,180
Will they come just because we asked them to?

504
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:26,440
As to that point, I think you can trust us, Vision PR.

505
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:31,300
Then go ahead with it.

506
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:36,530
CEO, the show itself has a cost that shouldn't be taken lightly.

507
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,640
The investment has been decided.

508
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,240
 We have found that many directly managed stores are losing money. 

509
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,570
 Can we get a list of directly managed stores and other retail stores? 

510
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:51,130
The auditors you guys were worried about were actually an investment group.

511
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,490
What?

512
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,390
Yes.

513
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,400
What? We're receiving an investment?

514
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,510
Oh, I understand. I'll come back.

515
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,870
   

516
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:12,710
   

517
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,360
Taxi! Taxi!

518
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,370
- Driver, I'm going to The One. 
 - Okay.

519
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,550
The financial performance of the company, the future market opportunities of Sonó,

520
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,050
and the skills and hard work that you've poured into Sonó, Yeong Eun.

521
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:33,940
The investment group assessed them objectively and acknowledged them positively.

522
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,120
Knowing that we won't be able to protest,

523
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,970
The Parisians are neglecting us and treating us carelessly.

524
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:46,890
But, Yeong Eun, the one who accepts neglect as the default and starts with their head bowed

525
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,750
is the worst.

526
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,930
Since CEO Seok acknowledges Chi Sook's idea, I will believe in it too.

527
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:59,230
Okay, you three make those punks who lord over us rue their day.

528
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,550
Go cause some trouble.

529
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,240
I'm so excited.

530
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,940
I'm really going to cause some trouble.

531
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,900
Thank you.

532
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,430
We should be popping the champagne.

533
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,440
Thank you for taking my side in front of my father.

534
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,690
I didn't take your side.

535
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:24,630
I only said it was a good idea because it was.

536
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,410
Do you know why I couldn't give up dating?

537
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:36,280
I'm only a pathetic person to Father and Chi Hyeong.

538
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,290
But I wanted to show them that there is someone

539
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:43,880
who acknowledges me and who sees me clearly.

540
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,260
But I was always dumped.

541
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,850
Ms. Hwang Chi Sook.

542
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,380
You're not a pathetic person.

543
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,480
Don't try to meet your father's expectations.

544
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,980
Chi Sook, you're not some common "off the rack"

545
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:04,500
but a very unique limited edition kind of person.

546
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,110
You are a woman who means that much to me.

547
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,080
I'm so happy that you're my man.

548
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:25,830
Me too. I'm very glad because I'm yours.

549
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,950
Yes.

550
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,140
Yes, I understand. In an hour?

551
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:39,270
What I saw was a bit strong. How about going with this color?

552
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,070
- Iced Americano. 
 - Thank you!

553
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,670
No, that's—

554
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,440
Drink this.

555
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,950
So you must really like fashion shows.

556
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:55,690
It's not that I like shows but because I can keep doing the work I like.

557
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,900
The samples are priority.

558
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,690
Na Ri, take charge of the development room and Seon Joo, get the invitation list.

559
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,510
- Okay. 
 - So Yeong, gather all of Sonó's sample photos.

560
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,320
Why do you need the sample photos?

561
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,650
If we use our brand name and tell them who we are, they are sure to have prejudice.

562
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,530
Instead, let's send the invitations with the photos of our clothing.

563
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,460
Let them decide if they'll come to the show or not after looking at the clothes.

564
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,230
Okay.

565
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,380
Then everyone work hard. I'm going to go recruit someone.

566
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,600
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

567
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,450
Seon Joo, check the invitations again.

568
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,460
- I'll go to the development room and then directly to you, okay? 
 - Okay.

569
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,950
- What invitations? 
 - For the buyer show.

570
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,350
They said Chief Go decided to support them.

571
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,270
Chief Go did?

572
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,620
- Good shot. 
 - You signed off on it.

573
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,340
Yes.

574
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,150
Your must feel a lot of responsibility.

575
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,240
You decided after weighing all the factors, right?

576
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,000
I will make sure to take care to reduce risk.

577
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,820
Birdie.

578
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,390
Stop! Everyone, stop! Stop, stop, stop!

579
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,050
You haven't released the budget yet, right?

580
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:59,490
I did, just now.

581
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,630
Hey, the invitations.

582
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,270
It will take time to send out the invitations, right? Let's be careful.

583
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:10,420
I've already sent them via email. It's the digital age.

584
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,920
Gosh, they're doing their work so well...

585
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,860
You haven't started the set design yet, right?

586
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,300
Don't do it. Don't do it. Stop!

587
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,200
Oh, it's already done.

588
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,960
Everything is falling into place so well, isn't it?

589
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,780
Don't laugh, don't laugh!

590
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,620
Honey, Ji Min's dad,

591
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,440
did I hear correctly?

592
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,710
We must have heard wrong.

593
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,520
I'm not using difficult words, so why are you hearing it wrong?

594
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,250
Jeon Mi Sook, please be a model for our show.

595
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,780
The clothing came out really well.

596
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,170
You'll have to wear them for us and make them shine.

597
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,760
These crazy women.

598
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,070
My size came back to being a model fit just in time.

599
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:15,890
The timing is incredible! Why not? I should do it!

600
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:19,080
Ah, seriously.

601
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,560
Hey, you guys look forward to it. I can walk really well.

602
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,820
Hey, you're going to be wearing this while walking!

603
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,930
Since you're going to be wearing clothes like this and walking, you should practice your walk first.

604
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,670
I should practice a little, shouldn't I?

605
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:33,390
- You're too old-fashioned. 
 - True. Kids these days are different.

606
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,860
Thank you, Yeong Eun.

607
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,410
I didn't know that Mi Sook would like it that much.

608
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:44,130
You will host this show for us, right?

609
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,860
Just try to decline.

610
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:51,790
- I definitely won't overlook my anger and my friend's sadness. 
 - Excuse me?

611
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:55,620
The reason you put in your resignation and are at Mi Sook's side now is because you feel sorry for her.

612
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,390
Of course I feel sorry. I'm thankful and shameless...

613
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,610
I find people who only show things through words the most annoying.

614
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,840
Do it through your actions! Show it with your body!

615
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,930
How can we know and feel your heart? Are you a transparent human?

616
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,640
Anyway, I have a lot of things that I want to say,

617
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,300
but for Mi Sook, I won't say them because I'm a third party. Just know that.

618
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:19,250
You have to come host this show no matter what, Senior  Manager Gwak.

619
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,170
Or else I'll just–

620
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:24,520
I'll assume that we will be working together.

621
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,060
Did you get kicked out by Mom?

622
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:43,400
Kicked out? That house is in my name.

623
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,780
Then what brings you here?

624
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,590
My legs hurt. Open the door.

625
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,540
Is your dad over there?

626
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,120
This human hasn't come home for two days.

627
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,820
Don't worry. He's here.

628
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,140
Got it.

629
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,860
I was already planning on taking over some fruit. Sleep.

630
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,880
Where did you sleep yesterday?

631
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,390
I have countless classmates

632
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,000
who are alone because they got divorced or were bereaved.

633
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,260
After saying you wouldn't give her anything,

634
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,510
it looks like you're giving her the house.

635
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,020
Give what? As if.

636
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,570
Then why did you come out?

637
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,820
Actions that I've done without thinking

638
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,310
made your mother tired and sad.

639
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:46,980
It's not like I can tell her to get out.

640
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,480
Divorce Mom, Dad.

641
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:54,880
What?

642
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,750
To us, they seem like really insignificant reasons,

643
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:02,100
but that makes them all the more upsetting.

644
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,430
That those insignificant things were so difficult.

645
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:07,740
Did I do it intentionally?

646
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,550
Did I do it on purpose?

647
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:12,020
Since Mom loves you,

648
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,790
she's asking for a divorce in order to not hate you more.

649
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:16,690
Exactly whose side are you on?

650
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,300
As for you, break up with that guy.

651
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,630
In Ha Taek Soo's life, there are no failures. In work or love.

652
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:24,790
You love Mom too.

653
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,130
That's why you aren't going back in the house for her.

654
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:32,320
What about love...

655
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,170
Why is your face getting red?

656
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:37,660
What are you talking about? I have to watch the news.

657
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,920
 Crime through romance scams is getting increasingly worse. 

658
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,160
 Recently, cryptocurrency is even used as a new method... 

659
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:53,670
Why? Why would Sonó, a non-designer brand, have a buyer show?

660
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:54,930
Is that what you're saying?

661
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:57,730
I didn't say that yet.

662
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:02,160
It's a new form of show combining an event and fashion film. 
  (Fashion film: short videos made by fashion brands and businesses with the intent to advertise products.) 

663
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,050
It would be great if you would work with us.

664
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:10,250
The Parisians won't respond, and time just keeps passing.

665
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:13,340
"At this rate, will this project end without my being able to try anything?"

666
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:17,180
"If this is the last day I'm given, what will I do?"

667
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,420
"What do I have to do?" are what I thought.

668
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,780
And your conclusion is?

669
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:28,050
I want to make the clothes that I like and work with the person I like.

670
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,120
That's all for now.

671
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:37,340
So when should I start work?

672
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,150
Immediately, right now.

673
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,750
You really are just doing whatever you want, however you want.

674
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:46,190
That's because you're the only man in the world whom I can whine to.

675
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:51,260
Yoon Jae Gook, I can do that to you, right?

676
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,290
Whenever you want.

677
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:09,540
As much as you want.

678
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:25,340
All right! Since this stage's equipment and technological aspects are very experimental, everyone should stay on their toes!

679
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,400
- Yes! 
 - Okay, good.

680
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:33,790
Senior Manager! Are you back?

681
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:36,270
Senior Manager, I knew you would come back!

682
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,730
Why are you only coming back now?

683
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,300
It's really great that you're back.

684
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,030
All right! A welcome round of applause, everyone!

685
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,620
Things progressed this far because I lost my mind for a bit,

686
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,060
but I have to control the risks.

687
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,420
Are there fallback measures planned out?

688
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,580
Fallback measures?

689
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,410
Is there a guarantee that the clothing will sell well just because you held a show?

690
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:03,690
What if inventory just piles up because we made so much recklessly?

691
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:06,110
The stock will become a loss.

692
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:09,510
We will receive orders in real time, on location from buyers.

693
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,470
We will only produce as much as we receive.

694
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:12,950
What if orders don't come in?

695
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:15,520
We will have to make the clothes prettily and well to prevent that from happening.

696
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,670
How many buyers said they were coming?

697
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:20,140
Call a lot to start, since we don't know how many will buy.

698
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,480
I have a concept meeting.

699
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:32,750
Your size shrunk again.

700
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:36,930
Hey, we will measure the size later. Look at this walking first.

701
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,980
We have to measure size first.

702
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,400
After taking measurement...

703
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,090
The concept is urban secret garden.

704
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:49,950
So make that big studio into a city? With a garden?

705
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:51,830
With this budget?

706
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:54,580
With a white wall that feels architectural and structural.

707
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,890
For the highlight, special effects should go in, right?

708
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:58,560
Extravagantly without holding back.

709
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,120
Ah, headache... Senior Manager Gwak, you say something.

710
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,230
Director Hwang, is it all right if we find a sponsor for the jewelry?

711
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:07,430
The limited edition piece where only three exist domestically.

712
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:09,680
- Ah, shoes too? 
 - Yes.

713
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,790
Ah, my heart...

714
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,730
Since we will be doing the live and fashion film at the same time,

715
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,410
please carefully select skilled professionals in this field.

716
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:18,320
You know I don't work with amateurs.

717
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,690
Nutritional supplements... I think I need nutritional supplements.

718
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:25,260
- I'll fully mobilize my connections. 
 - Okay, let's make it happen.

719
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,860
Sorry, I made you alter it so much.

720
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,750
You are sorry about everything.

721
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:33,210
Fixing it, ripping it out, and fixing it again is my job.

722
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:37,040
Hey, you should stop losing weight.

723
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,090
Hey, look at her. She is probably 3 kilograms lighter than me.

724
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,870
I guess I need to work harder.

725
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:45,030
- Forget it. 
 - You're enough right now!

726
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,520
Hey, my poses are too old, aren't they? Something like this?

727
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,370
So these days, don't hold your angle so sharply, but make it a little more... how should I say it?

728
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:56,610
By the way, when are you going to Paris?

729
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:59,310
She's working quite hard for someone going to Paris.

730
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,160
She said she's not going.

731
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,220
She said she's not going?

732
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,040
What about you then?

733
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,370
Right?

734
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:14,170
What should I do?

735
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:17,210
I saw the reference too.

736
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:21,400
Try walking.

737
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,340
Ji Min's dad!

738
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,600
So pretty!

739
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,460
Do you like it?

740
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,530
Of course, it's so pretty.

741
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:43,800
 How... do I break up? 

742
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:58,820
   

743
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:14,000
 Hyung, 

744
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,230
 do you hate it that much? 

745
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,270
 Ha Yeong Eun and I... 

746
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,390
 are we really not meant to be? 

747
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:36,010
   

748
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:57,580
Senior Manager, they are almost done getting dressed.

749
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:00,160
After you check their order, we'll go straight to rehearsal.

750
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,470
Yes, understood. The rehearsal will start soon!

751
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:04,940
Okay!

752
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:10,470
- Mom! 
 - Ji Min! You shouldn't run around!

753
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:12,820
- How does Mom look? 
 - Pretty!

754
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,960
My hair is cool, isn't it?

755
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,050
If we just start with these three people, that should be good...

756
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:22,550
- Hello. 
 - Hello, Assistant Manager Seo!

757
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,230
I'll leave it to you to confirm.

758
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:29,120
Ji Min, say hi! She's an auntie that's close to your dad!

759
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,710
Hi, Ji Min.

760
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:38,670
So you're Ji Min, you look pretty!

761
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:42,660
Gwak Ji Min, you should greet her. Loudly.

762
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,090
Hello.

763
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:47,970
Hi. Handshake?

764
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,460
Hey, Assistant Manager Seo.

765
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,870
I know you're busy, but could you watch Ji Min for a second?

766
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:59,880
Oh, of course...

767
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,830
Don't worry, and please focus on the show.

768
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:04,830
Thank you.

769
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:10,820
Ji Min, do you want to come with me and watch what your mom will do?

770
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,590
Let's go.

771
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:25,930
- You've worked hard, Team Leader. 
 - Thanks.

772
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,380
- The lighting set up is going well, yes? 
 - Yes.

773
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,530
Alright, our camera team and sound team have no issues, correct?

774
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:35,420
Show me the moving shot one time.

775
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,340
Jeon Mi Sook, it is your turn for fitting!

776
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,490
Got it!

777
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,290
Ready.

778
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:01,610
Be sure to maintain your spacing.

779
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:03,730
Good.

780
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:13,330
I'll leave the time check to you.

781
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,660
How is the connection rate?

782
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:18,650
It's under 20 percent. None of the big buyers showed up yet.

783
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,760
I'm going to lose it.

784
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,360
Time check, time check.

785
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:27,780
Team Leader Ha, a characteristic of the live show is that buyers can come in right in the middle.

786
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,010
- Yes. 
 - Just in case, I sent the mass email again,

787
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:32,420
asking them to please attend since the show starts in 20 minutes.

788
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,270
- And the fittings? 
 - We're all good after you do the last check.

789
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:36,670
- Got it. 
 - All right, let's go.

790
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:45,420
Get ready.  We're starting.

791
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,490
- Please check the sleeves. 
 - Okay.

792
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:55,750
CEO, you need to come.

793
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:59,930
- Excuse me. 
 - Okay.

794
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:03,900
What happened with the connection rate? I said what happened?!

795
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,680
Oh! The connection rate is increasing.

796
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,810
- What? 
 - It's already more than 70% connected too.

797
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:20,250
Wow! Ah, we're good!

798
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,230
Chief Go.

799
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:38,540
Team Leader.

800
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:42,710
Team Leader, all of the big buyers have connected.

801
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:40,610
Olivier came!

802
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:43,630
- Really? 
 - It's full! Full!

803
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,050
It's Mom.

804
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,510
 The flowers are blooming. 

805
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,960
 The season is opening. 

806
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:53,120
 The flower are in full bloom. 

807
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:59,160
 The season ripens.  

808
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:06,140
 The flower petals are raining down, a brilliant sadness.  

809
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:10,460
 The flower doesn't wilt.  

810
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:17,140
 Thanks to the flower that bloomed, the fruit is produced. 

811
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:20,380
 Another beginning commences. 

812
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:25,810
 In my heart, a spring that will never wither 

813
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,860
 has bloomed. 

814
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:31,140
 I won't sell this dress. 

815
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:34,450
 I made exactly one. 

816
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:39,780
 It's a present I'm giving my friend Mi Sook. 

817
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:44,360
♫  Lean on me for a bit and close your eyes  ♫

818
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,790
 I made it thinking of you. 

819
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:52,980
 I hope my clothes bring you happiness. 

820
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:58,720
 I'm already plenty happy, Yeong Eun. 

821
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,780
 This much is enough. 

822
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:07,010
 With this, I feel like I've lived a happy, good life. 

823
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:12,240
 Thank you 

824
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,760
 for being my friend. 

825
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,560
 Thank you for being my friend. 

826
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:25,240
 I love you so, so much. 

827
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:32,020
♫  This night, tonight won't come again  ♫

828
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:36,770
♫  Hurry and close your eyes  ♫

830
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,810

831

♫  Please smile that day  ♫

832
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:59,790
♫  The flowers that we've waited for welcome us  ♫

833
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:01,910
   

834
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:07,420
♫  So love spreads  ♫

835

♫  You came to me today so my heart flutters  ♫

836
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:22,380
♫  I cannot fall sleep easily  ♫

837
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:31,110

839

840
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:09,970
Because I was thirsty.

841
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:16,090
The buyers have started ordering!

842
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:18,670
Success!

843
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,160
I was so thirsty.

844
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,980
They say the Sonó show ended successfully.

845
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:46,680
All right. You can leave.

846
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,630
Jae Gook.

847
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:04,860


848
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,480
I just came

849
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:11,920
from seeing my brother.

850
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,540
- Jae Gook. 
 - But Mother...

851
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:25,030
Just one month.

852
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:31,650
 I'll break up with her, Hyung. 

853
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,870
 I'll try breaking up with her well. 

854
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:49,620
Just give me one month's time.

855
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,250
After loving her as much as I can

856
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:57,530
for one month,

857
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,540
I'll break up with her.

858
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:07,320
Sonó, fighting!

859
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,740
I will buy the meal.

860
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:11,600
The director said she will buy!

861
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:17,320
Director! Director!

862
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:21,920
♫  The fuzzy world seen though eyeglasses  ♫

863
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,460
♫  Seems just like me  ♫

864
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:35,800
♫  The song I wrote all night  ♫

865
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,880
♫  Seems just like a burned moth  ♫

866
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:46,300
♫  Stay my tiny dreams  ♫

867
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:52,610
♫  When the one star in my small room goes out  ♫

868
01:02:54,280 --> 01:03:00,010
♫  Stay my shiny dreams  ♫

869
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:06,180
♫  My close friend, you will come find me, right?  ♫

870
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:13,730
♫  Stay my tiny dreams  ♫

871
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:15,780
♫  When the one star in my small room goes out  ♫

872
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:18,670
   

873
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,590
 Calls asking for you have been flooding in since the morning. 

874
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:22,980
  - What kind of person is Ha Yeong Eun? 
 - A person that I envy? 

875
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,460
  With that person... 

876
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:29,720
 Let's go together tomorrow. I want to  be with you.  

877
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:36,390
 I asked to break up first, but I keep losing confidence. 

878
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:38,820
 Senior Manager! It's just coffee. 

879
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:41,800
 Other men? They just love your background. 

880
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,600
 - I love money. 
 - This is the email that came from Olivier just now. 

881
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,880
 - Recruitment? 
 - Did someone ask you to poach someone from our company? 

882
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,810
  Who is it? 

883
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:56,960
♫  I think I will be discovered in a mess  ♫

884
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:06,210
