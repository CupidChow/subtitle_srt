 Timing and subtitles brought to you by 
 Are You The One Team @ Viki 

7
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  I close my eyes and feel it  ♫

8
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,640
What we'll do in the future...

9
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,510
Whether or not we'll continue to meet ...

10
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,430
That's all up to you.

11
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,310
But...

12
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,650
tell me this one thing.

13
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,090
Did you...

14
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,160
miss me?

15
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,660
♫  On top of my lap  ♫

16
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,260
♫  With the sunshine shining on you  ♫

17
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:33,020
♫  Watching you is enough for me  ♫

18
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:41,050
♫  Embrace me when the wind is cold  ♫

19
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,290
♫  Be my umbrella on a rainy day  ♫

20
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,450
 There are things you pass by without realizing. 

21
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:53,230
♫  On a fine day in the sunlight which looks like you  ♫

22
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,890
 There are things you didn't realize then 

23
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,700
 but do now. 

24
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,120
♫  I can't completely fill my heart  ♫

25
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,160
♫  Stay with me as always  ♫

26
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,450
 I just want to keep living this life of freedom and independence. 

27
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,280
 You think you're some flying global dandelion or something? 

28
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,340
 Carpe diem. I'm just being faithful to this moment and the present. 

29
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,120
 It was just a simple one-night stand. 

30
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,310
 You know how that can happen with physical attraction. 

31
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,180
 There's no need to be backward and keep thinking about it. 

32
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,790
 How many times 

33
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,310
 have we passed by each other? 

34
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,280
 This... Can you deliver it to her for me? 

35
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,180
  The school and name are all written on there. 

36
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,080
 Thanks a lot. 

37
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,350
  Don't be late and get it to her on time. 

38
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,080
  It's really important for that student. Okay? 

39
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,490
 Whose photo is this? 

40
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,540
 It's an unknown artist's work. 

41
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,670
 The exposure is a mess, and the composition isn't good either. 

42
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,970
 You can immediately tell that the photographer is an amateur. 

43
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,050
 There is lens flare from the streetlights. 

44
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,150
 That I couldn't leave... 

45
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,030
 You knew, didn't you? 

46
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,870
 Right now, I'm scared 

47
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,430
 of you. 

48
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,900
 I'm not confident about my choices. 

49
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,480
 Let's not do anything from now on. 

50
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,750
 I'm here to ask for some work. 

51
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,960
 I think I'm going to be staying here longer. 

52
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,160
 Is there someone you like, by chance? 

53
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,340
 How has our Cookie become so interested in such a hard-to-get woman? 

54
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,430
 I'm waiting right now. 

55
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,580
 When her mind is set, 

56
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,550
 I will introduce her to you. 

57
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,580
 Let her choose 

58
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,790
 if you'll break up or not. 

59
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,560
 You said you love her. 

60
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,730
 By chance, is it Ha Yeong Eun? 

61
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,990
 - Jae Gook. 
 - Noona, I know what you want to say. 

62
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,970
  My brother isn't here anymore. 

63
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,620
 If yesterday can't be changed, 

64
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,870
 there's only one thing I can do. 

65
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,380
 Just living for today. 

66
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,370
Tell me this one thing.

67
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,880
Did you...

68
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,090
miss me?

69
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,830
I...

70
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,100
missed you.

71
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,690
   

72
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,070
   

73
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,830
   

74
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,590
Whether we should follow the trend or do something new...

75
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,640
Every time we prepare for a new season, it's so hard to make a decision.

76
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,550
If you wear clothes and makeup based on trends and take photos,

77
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,210
they stay forever as an embarrassing past. You know that, right?

78
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,490
Are you thinking about doing something new?

79
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,850
You are already late if you take the same path as everyone else.

80
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,250
Let's do it in a basic and classic style, how Sonó should be.

81
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,480
Na Ri, check the status of the fabric we ordered.

82
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,770
Seon Joo, check the fabric stock from the previous season.

83
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,690
So Yeong, I talked to the material team about some raw materials.

84
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,530
Can you find out how much we can get?

85
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,360
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

86
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,660
Clair Marie said they would do all of it.

87
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,900
You know that the brand is being launched in a hurry.

88
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,130
The new season is right around the corner. There's no time now to place an order to Italy

89
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,280
and send work to South America to make the clothes.

90
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,520
Sonó had already reserved it six months prior.

91
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,140
We already talked to the material team, and you signed off on it yourself.

92
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:37,590
Then, go talk to Director Hwang yourself.

93
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,750
So? What do you need?

94
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,510
Spandex and summer tweed fabric.

95
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,740
We need them to make a matching jacket and skirt set.

96
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,110
Those are going to Clair Marie though.

97
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,250
And what else?

98
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,620
Then... We'll use the gingham seersucker.

99
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,810
The budgeted funds have already been used,

100
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,800
and it's the fabric we said we'd use.

101
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,820
Having to find a different fabric and adjusting our timeline now

102
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,410
are just not realistic.

103
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,640
Too bad. Clair Marie's going to use that, too.

104
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,820
Director Hwang.

105
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,540
The factory in Paju that Sonó worked with before

106
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,810
will be working with Clair Marie starting this season.

107
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,990
- Chi Sook. 
 - What's with the serious face?

108
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,550
Over just a mere factory?

109
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,390
Honestly, should you be scared, or should I, the one launching a new brand, be scared?

110
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,640
Isn't it because you are confident that you wouldn't be fazed that you decided to stay at Sonó?

111
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,550
I've known the vice president there for 10 years since he was an assistant manager.

112
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,330
We've learned to work with each other and came this far.

113
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,190
Not you, but The One.

114
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,300
You might think that you were the one going easy on me all this time,

115
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,000
but I went easy on you many times as well.

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,430
Fabrics, materials, factories.

117
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,800
Why do you think you did all of that?

118
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,210
They were possible because I was behind them all.

119
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,490
- So? 
 - I won't go easy on you from now on.

120
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,560
So on your own without me,

121
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,940
try to beat me with your abilities.

122
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,250
Can I actually?

123
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,280
Is it really okay for me to beat you?

124
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,460
Director, you have a visitor from Vision PR.

125
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,330
Oh, right!

126
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,750
- Hello. 
 - CEO Seok.

127
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,320
Welcome, J.

128
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,700
J, you so willingly accepted The One's offer,

129
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,540
so we very eagerly welcome you!

130
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,510
    
 Cookie, a job finally came in for you. 

131
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:45,520
  This is your first task after becoming an artist in Vision PR. 

132
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,740
  What is it? 

133
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,100
  - It's related to The One, but... 
 - I'll do it. 

134
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,090
  But the one who wants you isn't Team Leader Ha. It's Director Hwang. 

135
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,270
 It doesn't matter.  I've decided to stay in Seoul. 

136
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,580
  I'll have to work hard to earn money. 

137
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,630
It's been a while.

138
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,630
Mr. J has agreed to collaborate with us.

139
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,780
I'll leave you to it.

140
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,640
   

141
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,790
   

142
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,250
Yes, Mom?

143
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,280
Your dad's retirement ceremony is in a couple of days, so I'm getting my hair done.

144
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,220
It's time for the neutralization part now, so how can I?

145
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,200
Mom, I'm working right now.

146
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,330
He's just too gullible! That's why!

147
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,110
He left again a moment ago saying he had things to take care of.

148
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,710
It's because I have a bad feeling about it.

149
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,590
 Since a while ago, he has been making a big deal 

150
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,300
about how he will let me live in leisure once he has retired.

151
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,840
I'm worried he will lose all of his retirement savings from his interest in investing.

152
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,470
I doubt he'd do something like that again.

153
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,180
 Well that's why I want you to go! 

154
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,520
Find out whom he's meeting and what he's doing.

155
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,660
I'm not in a situation to do that right now, Mom.

156
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,160
I'm busy. I'll hang up now.

157
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,530
It's not like I have two or three kids.

158
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,920
He won't accept my calls, so that's why I called you!

159
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,840
Would I be bothering you otherwise?!

160
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,980
I'll try calling him. I'm hanging up.

161
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,240
   

162
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,530
   

163
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,950
 The number you are calling— 

164
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,320
Noona, why are you sighing? It breaks my heart.

165
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,290
Good morning, Noona.

166
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,570
Do you know what time it is? How could you come in now?

167
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,830
Noona, I'm the owner's son.

168
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,440
If I come in on time every day,

169
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,040
I'll look too time conscious.

170
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,970
I need to just do the bare minimum

171
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,510
so that these hardworking people have a reason to talk behind my back.

172
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,860
I want my image to be that of a public enemy.

173
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,540
Go to the production department and ask them for a list of factories.

174
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,500
I've just come in and I'm already tired.

175
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,960
Can't I finish this first?

176
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,170
Would you like me to ask the CEO to transfer you to a department with less work?

177
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,510
- What floor is the production department on? 
 - Sixth.

178
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,430
Bring it back within 30 minutes. We're going out right away to pick a factory.

179
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,330
Yes, ma'am.

180
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,340
- It's not that way. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

181
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,860
   

182
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,450
I just have to print you the factory list, right?

183
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,030
Yes, a list of good ones.

184
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,240
I'll take out the ones that are check-marked since they're on the blacklist.

185
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,900
They steal labels and can't make deadlines. Such a pain.

186
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,250
Be sure to remember this.

187
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,390
Oh, really?

188
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,180
   

189
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,560
   
 How long will it take? 

190
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,230
How much longer will this take?

191
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,280
Seven minutes?

192
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,710
No, five minutes.

193
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,910
No, wait.

194
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,140
Seven minutes. There's a lot.

195
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,630
   

196
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,600
 It will take seven minutes. 

197
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,510
Did your guardian not come with you?

198
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:22,230
No, I came alone. Is it very serious?

199
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,520
From the blood work, the tumor marker CA 19-9

200
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,480
came out very high.

201
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,460
That's why we suggested a CT and a biopsy.

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,330
The results show pancreatic cancer.

203
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,870
Among pancreatic cancers, this is adenocarcinoma

204
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,700
commonly referred to as glandular cancer.

205
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:49,570
Unfortunately, pancreatic cancer is extremely difficult to diagnose early.

206
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,250
Early discovery...

207
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,700
Metastasis...

208
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,090
Bye.

209
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,970
Wait! I'm sorry.

210
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,440
- You must be coming from outside work, right? 
 - Yes.

211
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,270
You have something on your tie.

212
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,620
You can give it to me. I'll get it dry cleaned.

213
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:26,590
Min Gyeong, I put some documents for you to review in the second drawer of your cabinet.

214
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,120
Okay.

215
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,490
- Assistant Manager Seo. 
 - Yes?

216
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,880
Finish that report by the end of today.

217
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,750
Okay.

218
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,950
   

219
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,990
   

220
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,470
- Hello? 
  - What should we do? The senior manager just went into a meeting. 

221
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,210
  He must've forgotten his phone. 

222
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,930
Ah, I see.

223
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,790
Is it an emergency?

224
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,850
No, it is not. I just wanted to know

225
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,840
if he will be very late today.

226
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,520
I'll tell him to contact you when the meeting ends.

227
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,200
Okay, thank you.

228
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,000
- The payment has been completed. 
 - Ah, okay.

229
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,480
Starting 12 AM the night prior, refrain from having water or  gum.

230
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,550
Even if you make an appointment at the outpatient center for the next available time,

231
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,720
the waiting time may be long, so we ask for your understanding.

232
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,660
Blood lab...

233
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,790
CEO Hwang.

234
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,550
- Is it going well? 
 - I'm doing my best.

235
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,850
Even though we started a new brand,

236
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,790
Sonó is still our image. Make good sales, okay?

237
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,950
Yes, sir.

238
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,250
But who is the person in there?

239
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,970
I think it might be okay to leave the rough texture as if nature is the concept.

240
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,550
  Rough? What a rough man! 

241
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,910
He's the photographer collaborating with Clair Marie this time.

242
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,090
Photographer?

243
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,370
He's the man you asked her to meet in Busan last time.

244
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,940
Busan?

245
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,610
Jae Gook!

246
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,170
Yes.

247
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,750
The fact that I'm the only one seeing you two side by side here...

248
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,260
When I used to drink with your father,

249
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,490
we used to talk about having our kids get married later on.

250
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,870
It was probably not me, but my older brother.

251
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,690
Oh, you have an older brother?

252
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,910
Yeah, it was such a shame.

253
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:23,620
If it weren't for the accident, he would've become such a brilliant doctor like his father.

254
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,350
That one time in middle school when you represented your school at a math competition and won the grand prize...

255
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,470
He used to boast so much about you.

256
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,010
- That too was probably my brother. 
 - What?

257
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,520
I was always in Paris.

258
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,990
I went to school there and only came to Seoul very occasionally over break.

259
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,150
I see, I see. It was indeed so long ago.

260
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,320
Your mother is doing well, right? I have not seen her in so long.

261
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,530
Yes. She's doing well.

262
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,400
Good, good.

263
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:09,660
 Your father already passed away, but your mother is still alive. 

264
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,990
 And what else? Do you have any brothers and sisters? 

265
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,620
 Do you want more wine? 

266
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,950
 Sounds good. 

267
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,910
 Here. 

268
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:34,660
 Come to think of it, Soo Wan never mentioned his younger brother. 

269
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,740
Come to think of it... why were you in Paris alone?

270
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,490
 Team Leader, did we get our fabrics figured out? 

271
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,190
 - Na Ri.  
 - Yes?

272
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,530
I think the gabardine and the tweed will both work,

273
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,050
but the gabardine has a heavy color,

274
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,450
so let's go with the tweed.

275
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,120
We can use tone-on-tone patches to cover different textures.

276
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,550
 Okay, got it. 

277
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,330
Okay.

278
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,830
I wanted to see the swatch colors directly.

279
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,570
Okay.

280
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,460
My brother and I have different mothers.

281
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:10,020
But I was never discriminated against because of that.

282
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,250
I was never hated for it.

283
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,750
My current mother is a good person.

284
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,520
It seemed like you were curious since earlier on.

285
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,510
Am I wrong?

286
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,410
Just... a little bit.

287
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,850
Either way, that means I was

288
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,030
on your mind.

289
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,990
Will you finish late today?

290
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,250
Why?

291
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,870
I would like us to get dinner together.

292
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,930
Rather than a restaurant recommended on social media,

293
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,570
can you guide me to a local hot spot?

294
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:08,550
Well, it'd be better if you took me around, too.

295
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,000
She already has plans with me today though.

296
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,940
Noona, the factory list.

297
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,540
I told you to wait for only seven minutes, but you couldn't even wait that long?

298
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,230
We'll leave right away. Get ready in three minutes.

299
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,030
Just the two of us? Oh yeah.

300
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,260
I heard you're working with the other team.

301
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,270
Then, work well with that other team.

302
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,120
Don't bother our team leader.

303
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,780
Noona, wait for me.

304
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,690
After approval is given, will it be possible in two weeks?

305
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,690
It's not like we're machines. We need at least a month.

306
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,020
This won't work. We won't be able to make the deadline.

307
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:08,100
We're making this for another place, but I'm letting you take a look especially.

308
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,120
- Sir! 
 - Yes, what is it?

309
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,610
- Excuse me. 
 - Sure.

310
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,400
If they show us someone else's, then they will show other people ours too.

311
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,950
   

312
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,190
Oh my, oh my!

313
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,150
It's hard to memorize the spec sheet, you know.

314
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,500
- Where is the next factory? 
 - Dongdaemun.

315
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,780
The optional belt will go into pouch #2 and be delivered on the hangers.

316
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,900
The extra care labels have to be ordered by Friday.

317
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,580
Are they permanent or temporary workers?

318
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,900
We don't deal with temporary workers. Too unstable.

319
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,190
- They're all permanent workers here. 
 - Really?

320
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,930
We even deliver whatever gets finished first and make at least 80 jackets a day.

321
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,830
- What's wrong? 
 - Nothing.

322
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,590
Why would the production department ask the designer to figure out which factory to contract with?

323
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,030
Otherwise we will have to work with whichever is assigned to us.

324
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,080
That would lower the quality.

325
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,440
Chief Choi's factory... wouldn't do, right?

326
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,670
It'd be better to ask another team to lend us their factory.

327
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:35,610
If we say we will work with the factory that produced our copies, people will probably throw a fit.

328
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:39,840
Clair Marie doesn't even have a team set yet, but they already have Mr. J.

329
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,980
It's just that that team is on fire

330
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,390
so it's making me worry about anything and everything.

331
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,130
Haven't they filled the headcount yet?

332
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,090
I don't think so.

333
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,880
May I ask the reason for this meeting?

334
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,840
I wanted to help you make some memories in Korea.

335
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,510
It just happens that there is a good exhibition going on.

336
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:16,090
If we go together, you might get some inspiration.

337
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:20,140
- Excuse me, Director Hwang— 
 - Let's restart

338
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,110
our fate from the beginning.

339
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,990
Not showing up that day was purely my misjudgement.

340
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,000
Nevertheless, no one can turn back time.

341
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,520
I don't want to fuss over things that happened in the past.

342
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,510
The future is more important.

343
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,760
I don't want to live my life doing whatever the elders say.

344
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,180
I'm the same way! That's why I didn't show up that day.

345
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,360
But it turns out that there is a reason behind the elders' actions.

346
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,730
Look at me, for example. I'm regretting not listening to them.

347
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,650
Let's just be friends.

348
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,870
I have friends, though. What I don't have is a man.

349
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:05,010
I already have a woman I'd like to be a man for.

350
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:22,240
What's this? You said it was urgent.

351
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,450
So I came this way instead of going back to work.

352
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,760
Hey, what about the factory? You couldn't find one?

353
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,480
There's one place I like, but I'm not sure if it'll do.

354
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,950
But why are you buying so many clothes?

355
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,730
I thought about it, and I feel like I've never bought clothes for Ji Min

356
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,930
at the department store unless they were on sale.

357
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,880
Hey, that's too big for Ji Min.

358
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,560
Hey, kids grow so quickly. It's fine.

359
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,180
You're usually so cheap.

360
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,610
What's gotten into you that you're on a buying binge?

361
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,430
  If you're working right now, you should resign soon 

362
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,740
  and go through the hospitalization process. 

363
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,100
It's because everything just feels so annoying and unfair.

364
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,090
I was just wondering what kept me so busy

365
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,450
that I've never bought clothes for my daughter from the department store.

366
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,020
Is something wrong?

367
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,940
Why? What is it?

368
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,830
Did Ji Min's dad get himself into trouble?

369
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:24,160
Hey. He's too timid to do anything of the kind.

370
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,740
Are your in-laws asking for a trip abroad again?

371
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,250
Just because.

372
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,260
When Ji Min gets older, when I finish my installment savings next month,

373
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,720
when I move to a more spacious place...

374
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,170
it's always "next time."

375
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:45,080
Turns out that now my daughter doesn't have a jacket that all the other kids have,

376
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,330
and I'm in this shape.

377
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,100
It all just feels so crappy and annoying.

378
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,440
It just means you lived well and frugally.

379
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,460
Maybe it's depression related to menopause.

380
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,160
So I am planning on living however I want.

381
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,970
No matter what I do, just let me be and accept it.

382
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,440
I'll buy this one for Ji Min.

383
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:19,470
When you want to go all out, you should.

384
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,570
So you should just go all out, too.

385
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,460
Who cares if he's Soo Wan's younger brother?

386
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,480
What matters is that you like him.

387
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,010
No one can live your life for you.

388
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,540
Excuse me.

389
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,120
- I'll have those and these, please. 
 - Okay.

390
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:53,020
You said you never bought new bedcovers after getting married.

391
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,200
That's true. Should I change the whole bedding while I'm at it?

392
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,710
Doesn't this one give more of a newly-wed feeling than that one?

393
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,800
What do you mean newly-wed? That's gross.

394
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,080
Who knows? You might have a second child.

395
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,950
You don't need anything? You should look, too.

396
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,490
I'm fine. I live alone, anyway.

397
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,720
♫  When we're together they don't stand a chance  ♫

398
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,920
♫  The world is in our hands  ♫

399
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,520
♫  We light up like a trance (come pull me closer to you)  ♫

400
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,930
♫  And when we take the wheel we never crash  ♫

401
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,250
♫  We ride out like a flash  ♫

402
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,460
♫  Cause what we have is natural  ♫

403
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,160
♫  When we're together  ♫

404
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,950
♫  You and I, feels so right  ♫

405
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,670
♫  When we're together, hearts on fire  ♫

406
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,760
♫  Cause we got something natural  ♫

407
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,200
♫  You and I, feels so right  ♫

408
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,920
♫  Have to give in, I'm letting you in  ♫

409
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,820
I just have to send it over by tomorrow, right?

410
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,700
They said they'll use it for the homepage banner.

411
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,060
Oh, and the client is pretty strict,

412
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,280
so make sure you have a few best cuts ready to go.

413
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,940
What's next on the schedule?

414
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,020
Kitchenware brochure isn't your specialty.

415
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,400
- I'll do it. 
 - Okay.

416
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,060
Hey, we're talking about frying pans.

417
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,860
I'm not going to be picky about work.

418
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,280
I need to earn money to settle down.

419
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,530
So do the work that'll get you a lot of money.

420
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,430
There are so many places that want you for their photo shoots.

421
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,620
That's no fun.

422
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,250
   

423
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,700
I'm getting a call. Text me my schedule once it is figured out.

424
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,970
- Yes, Mother? 
 - Are you busy right now?

425
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,760
I thought you might be busy meeting your girlfriend.

426
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,060
How's it going? Making some progress?

427
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,060
Why are you laughing?

428
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,720
It's just weird that you're asking this.

429
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,310
But it's also new.

430
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,160
My son has someone he likes, so of course I'm curious.

431
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,460
I'm trying hard to make some progress right now.

432
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,630
I'd love to meet whomever she is. Make a good effort.

433
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,130
Hey, stop right there! Stop there!

434
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,630
Stop there, you punk!

435
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,850
Hey, you! Stop right there!

436
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,260
Oh, go ahead and work.

437
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,790
Mother?

438
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,460
Have you been well?

439
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,490
I have been well. You've been well too, right?

440
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,030
If I'd known that you have been coming to our culture center,

441
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,140
I would've already arranged to have a meal with you.

442
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,650
I'd be sorry to impose upon such a busy person. It's fine.

443
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,280
Let's meet next time with Jae Gook.

444
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,520
Yoo Jeong, Jae Gook has a woman he likes.

445
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,130
Have you met her?

446
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:49,230
No, he said she's not into him yet.

447
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,640
It seems that only he has completely fallen for her.

448
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,480
It's the first time he's talked about a woman like that.

449
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,860
  - Let's take it. This is a video, right? 
 - Of course. 

450
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,360
    
 - Look here. 
 - It's so pretty! 

451
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,650
  Hello! Hello! 

452
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,520
  Press that. 

453
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,390
  I'm going to kiss you. 

454
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,950
 I want to concentrate! 

455
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,610
 - Come on! 
 - I'm concentrating! 

456
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,290
 Hold still. 

457
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,230
  What are you doing, you thief? 

458
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,680
It was my first time seeing him so happy.

459
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,280
I wonder what kind of woman she is.

460
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,140
This time, no matter who it is, I will definitely accept her.

461
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,550
No matter who she is?

462
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,840
Jae Gook says he likes her.

463
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,670
That's enough. I won't be greedy.

464
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,660
I am not going to hurt him over such things anymore.

465
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,520
I just want  Jae Gook to be happy.

466
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,620
I'd take joy in life by seeing that.

467
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,810
Team Leader, which button is better?

468
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,780
The one without the shine is prettier.

469
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,730
Alright.

470
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,220
How long will you keep dawdling?

471
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,140
Don't you want to grow in a successful team?

472
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,950
There are a lot of juniors from Lamong who are saying they'll take the spot if you won't.

473
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,450
I can't wait for much longer.

474
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:46,160
Bring me what Team Leader Ha is doing by tonight.

475
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,400
Interesting.

476
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,370
I was just going my usual way,

477
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,830
and this old man assaulted me out of nowhere!

478
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,840
Who hit whom?

479
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,540
You just fell while running, you liar!

480
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,040
I'm going to go crazy. Do you know me?

481
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,560
You stole my money and ran off!

482
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,200
It's my first time seeing you.

483
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,080
You were the one who hit me first.

484
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,770
Who are you calling a liar?

485
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,400
- Geez. 
 - Did you confirm?

486
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,840
- There's nothing. 
 - Nothing? 
 - Nope.

487
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,780
There are no CCTV cameras nearby.

488
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,420
This conversation might get longer,

489
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,940
so for now, let's talk at the station, both of you.

490
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,950
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

491
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,260
Forget "elders first." I won't let you be.

492
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,510
I'll make sure you go to prison for assault.

493
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,150
There won't be any settlement, all right?

494
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,920
Oh, I can't believe this.

495
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,340
Excuse me.

496
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,540
- What is it? 
 - I filmed something interesting.

497
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,860
In high-definition. Clearly.

498
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,220
 Hey, you! Stop right there! 

499
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,790
Okay, I understand.

500
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,970
Can everyone bring me their sketches?

501
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,180
It's not bad. It's got some sense.

502
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,850
As expected, Manager. It looks good.

503
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:42,120
Isn't it too basic?

504
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,010
You could choose a lining with print on it.

505
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,160
Please take a look at mine too.

506
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:55,220
I wanted to work on a set, so I stayed true to my passion.

507
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,090
How did you hold back all this time?

508
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,360
I know, right?

509
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,290
So Yeong, what about you?

510
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,980
I... don't have anything yet.

511
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,420
Why? Is it not going well?

512
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,480
I'm sorry.

513
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,110
In that case, would you like to use this as reference material?

514
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:16,260
When I was your age, I drew these for my graduation project.

515
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,080
Wow! Those look great.

516
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,690
You sketched them when you were So Yeong's age?

517
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,030
No wonder you got into ESMOD.

518
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,750
You keep feeling impatient, right?

519
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,520
Pardon?

520
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,740
You want to do well, but you also don't want to miss out on any opportunities.

521
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,320
But, So Yeong, there's no need to rush.

522
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,260
So what if it takes you longer?

523
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,160
So what if you don't do that well?

524
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,740
Just think of pretty clothes and good clothes.

525
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:52,200
Opportunities will follow naturally after.

526
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,990
You have so much ahead of you, so why are you uneasy about not getting an opportunity?

527
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:59,540
Don't be so uneasy. We have so much work set out for you.

528
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,650
If someone asks you to do something crazy, come tell us right away.

529
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:08,740
A good mentor only wants your talent.

530
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,550
They will not make you do something you shouldn't.

531
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,570
Make sure the revisions are done by tomorrow morning for me to review.

532
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,910
Keep working hard.

533
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,410
- Yes, ma'am. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

534
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,360
You are really naïve.

535
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,190
Do you really believe that will make Jeong So Yeong stay?

536
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,380
You didn't see or hear anything, okay?

537
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,000
Consideration becomes a right before you know it. If you treat them well, they will walk all over you.

538
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,920
If you let it go once, they will expect to be excused again. That's how people are.

539
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,860
All right. If you're late to work again,

540
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,670
it'll be reflected in your performance assessment right away.

541
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,710
You can't treat your informant like this.

542
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,710
Yes, what is it now?

543
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:53,360
 I told you to go to your dad, didn't I? 

544
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,030
 He's at the police station right now. 

545
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,730
Dad.

546
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,060
It's a case related to fraud and assault.

547
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,190
Your father bought a one week vacation package to Europe.

548
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:42,410
He made a prepayment to the travel agency, but it was a paper company.

549
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:48,420
I was going to travel around Europe with your mom once I retired.

550
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,910
They said they'd give me half-off on many of the additional services

551
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,260
and give me a big discount, too.

552
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,330
I didn't even get to see any of that money.

553
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,460
All I did was speak to you on the phone.

554
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,040
It was just a part-time job. That's all.

555
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,880
But why is this person here?

556
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,270
Oh, he's the witness.

557
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:11,860
If it weren't for him, I would have been in big trouble.

558
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:19,230
   

559
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,120
You're extremely nosy.

560
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,700
Thanks to this, I happened upon an unbelievable coincidence.

561
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,560
What would you have done if your camera got broken?

562
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,510
Are you worrying about me on top of that?

563
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:31,210
No, it's not worry.

564
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:34,090
Oh, I was on your mind again, right?

565
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,620
All right, I got it. Okay.

566
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,760
It's your mom.

567
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,290
It was really nothing.

568
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,950
Don't raise your voice.

569
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:54,000
I heard he was a vice principal.

570
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,040
- He'll be retiring soon. 
 - It has been taken care of.

571
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,520
You take after your father.

572
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,690
I got it. Let's talk when I get back.

573
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:04,090
Your mother is really freaking out.

574
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,920
I made a separate report for the fraud, like they suggested.

575
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,760
It'll take about two to three months for the police to investigate their bank accounts and provide results.

576
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,690
They said they'll also re-investigate the assault case, so just keep that in mind.

577
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,760
You were brought up so well.

578
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,620
Stepping up to help like it's your own business in this kind of world we live in.

579
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,100
I would at least like to buy you a meal. What do you like?

580
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,870
This person is a busy person.

581
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:27,130
I'm okay. I'm not busy.

582
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:31,750
I've been abroad, so I like anything Korean.

583
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,480
I have to eat anyway.

584
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,710
It's your mom.

585
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,040
Why don't you go home now?

586
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,650
Still, he helped me. I can't just leave.

587
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,880
I'll buy him a meal, okay?

588
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,250
Aren't you busy?

589
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,680
Just go home. Mom's worried.

590
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,550
Okay then. Let's talk another time.

591
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,440
Thank you.

592
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,370
But do you two know each other?

593
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,720
- No. 
 - Yes.

594
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,920
- Excuse me. 
 - He asked.

595
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,960
The secretary's office scheduled this, so they'll check if I came here or not.

596
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,070
Ah, yes. It's good that you did.  Well...

597
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:48,100
As a person who is a leader in the arts,

598
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:52,660
I use exhibitions or music to recharge and get inspiration from time to time.

599
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,550
And today just happens to be exactly the time for that.

600
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:59,110
Did I call you out when you're busy?

601
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,410
If that's the case, then I'm sorry.

602
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,290
Oh, I'm not busy.

603
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,820
My schedule was completely free today, yes.

604
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,400
  Where are you? You have so many things to sign off on! 

605
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,250
  Are you even coming in today? 

606
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,110
   

607
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,510
Director Hwang?

608
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:44,170
I don't expect much.

609
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:49,000
Meeting someone by fate, then living and loving passionately.

610
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,480
That's all I need.

611
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:57,000
But is that too much to ask for?

612
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,620
No, it's not. It's a very understandable wish.

613
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,180
But why is it so hard?

614
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,000
I'm just...

615
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,890
Why is it...

616
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:21,760
Is it because I'm too sad or because my life is bitter?

617
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,950
This liquor is so bland.

618
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,140
In life, there are days when liquor tastes like water.

619
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,380
Just brush it all off.

620
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,540
You like Yeong Eun too, right? 
  (informal) 

621
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,020
What do you mean "you  (informal) "?

622
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:43,180
Oh, and Team Leader Ha? No, not me.

623
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:47,620
Why not? Did you give up because of Mr. J?

624
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,710
Why are you continuing to talk informally?

625
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:52,690
Also, I've never liked her from the get go.

626
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:55,290
She's not my type at all.

627
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,460
- She's not your type? 
 - No.

628
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:01,030
No, she is not my type at all.

629
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,290
I got dumped today.

630
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:14,960
I didn't even get to start, but I got dumped without any hope left behind.

631
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,390
It's fine. It's not the first time.

632
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:20,130
I'm not going to just obediently give up these feelings either.

633
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:23,720
I keep getting mad though.

634
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,330
I'm just jealous and annoyed.

635
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:29,440
I keep getting mad at Yeong Eun.

636
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,500
No. Why am I jealous?

637
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,450
There is nothing inferior about me.

638
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:39,520
Honestly, I'm the type where the more you see me,

639
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,700
the more attractive I become.

640
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,360
It's because J doesn't know.

641
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,030
That's true. The more I see you, the more attractive you become.

642
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,060
Just wait and see.

643
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,470
He's going to fall for my attractiveness.

644
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:09,330
♫  Love could be so simple  ♫

645
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:12,790
♫  Particularly on the day we  ♫

646
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,960
♫  Making time for some loving  ♫

647
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,280
♫  Put some mood on today  ♫

648
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,330
   

649
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:55,210
You just have to clip your nails here

650
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,300
for them to be clipped well, right?

651
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,890
It's a computer class this time?

652
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,770
I told you there's someone I want to set Yeong Eun up with.

653
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:07,360
I'm trying to take a computer class with his mother.

654
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,910
She's good at everything, so she must be good at this, too.

655
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:12,950
Are you trying to let go of the resentment over never going to college?

656
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,030
Why are you trying to learn everything?

657
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:19,070
People live to be 100 years old these days, so who knows what I'll be doing in the future.

658
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:21,860
I should learn everything that is offered at the culture center.

659
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,130
We don't know just when you'll get scammed again and lose everything.

660
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:26,380
Oh, it wasn't a scam!

661
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:30,500
Why do you keep nagging me about a little fight I got into?

662
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,860
You'll be retiring soon enough.

663
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:37,000
If you don't want a disgraceful retirement, always be careful.

664
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Careful!

665
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:47,470
 Mok Gyeok Ja (means witness). 

666
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:55,130
 This is my number. If you ever need my help, feel free to contact me. 

667
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,990
 Mo Gyeong Ja (sounds similar to "witness" and also sounds like a normal name). 

668
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:42,190
You got her to sleep early.

669
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:43,730
Yes.

670
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,730
Did you give her ramyeon?

671
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:55,420
Once or twice is fine.

672
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:05,700
- I told you to do the recycling. 
 - Later.

673
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,450
When is later?

674
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:09,930
If you don't do it today, it'll be sitting here for a whole week.

675
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:12,840
Hey, do I play all day?

676
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,380
Are you the only one who goes to work?

677
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,660
Other people work and still do the recycling.

678
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:21,940
Hey! And what did you do all day?! Oh, shopping?

679
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,900
What an amazing thing you did. Is that why there's no rice at home?

680
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,700
No wonder I gave her ramyeon!

681
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,440
If there's none, then make some. Make some, eat it, and clean up after.

682
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,490
How long will you just keep relying on me?

683
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:40,270
If I'm gone, will you only feed her ramyeon?!

684
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,780
I only gave it to her once, just once!

685
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,000
   

686
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:05,720
Oh, it's nothing.

687
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,220
I was looking at the materials for the meeting tomorrow,

688
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,740
but I came out for some air.

689
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,990
There's just a lot to think about.

690
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,960
The weather is so nice.

691
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,600
Yeah, there's no fine dust pollution at all.

692
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,920
But... How did you know I wanted this?

693
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:33,160
You thought I wouldn't know?

694
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:40,070
Of course. Should I pick you up tomorrow?

695
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:48,370
Where should we meet? 
    

696
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:06,960
 This is the hot restaurant? 

697
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,030
Thank you.

698
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,560
If you apply this, it will heal quickly without a scar.

699
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,430
As soon as you get home, wash up and apply it.

700
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:20,320
What about dinner?

701
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,390
I'm sorry, but there is something that I have to resolve first.

702
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:29,200
It's a very dire situation right now since we haven't even found a factory to work with yet.

703
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,490
Why are you hesitating?

704
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:04,400
I told the team not to worry, but I'm actually really scared.

705
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,800
If we go with the factory decided by the company,

706
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,160
at least we have an excuse even if things don't go well.

707
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,300
But if I choose to go with the factory that made copies, there will be a huge uproar.

708
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,220
But you still want to work with her again?

709
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,380
To be honest, yes.

710
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,790
So why hesitate?

711
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,960
There must be a good reason why you would choose to entrust someone who made copies.

712
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,030
That you have come all the way here means you want to work with her.

713
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:31,120
Then just do that.

714
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,670
Although that's how I feel, having to deal with the consequence is a burden,

715
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:39,390
and I'm afraid that if a problem happens,

716
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:41,450
I'll regret the decision.

717
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:44,300
What will you regret more?

718
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,440
Not being able to find a factory so going with the one the company decides on?

719
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:54,350
Or not choosing to work with whom you want because you're worried that another bad situation might occur?

720
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:09,060
Yes, I'll be going.

721
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,960
   
   

722
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:22,570
You're working temporarily at BI?

723
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:24,390
Because of your daughter's academy fee?

724
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:26,690
I received the complaint.

725
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,990
I need to do whatever I can to pay for the lawsuit.

726
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:32,150
People won't bring their spec sheets to me anymore.

727
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:34,830
They're thankful when I work on their clothes,

728
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:37,560
but they're afraid their work might get leaked.

729
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,060
That's how people are.

730
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:44,130
Would you like to work with me?

731
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:50,990
But I won't be able to stop others from criticizing you, nor help with your lawsuit.

732
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:55,530
If you're okay with it, let's work together.

733
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,390
Don't trust people. You've already suffered because of it.

734
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:02,590
So, this time, you can redeem yourself.

735
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:05,670
I know it's been eating you up inside.

736
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:17,900
♫  The fuzzy world seen though eyeglasses  ♫

737

♫  Seems just like me  ♫

00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,960
   

748
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,860
   
   

749
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:44,330
   

750
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:47,200
 This time, no matter who it is, I will definitely accept her. 

751
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,070
 Jae Gook says he likes her. 

752
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,050
 - This is a video, right? 
 - Of course. 

753
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,510
 - Look here. 
 - It's so pretty! 

754
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:05,500
  Hello! Hello! 

755
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:09,770
 By chance, is it Ha Yeong Eun? 

756
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,450
 - Jae Gook. 
 - I know what you want to say. 

757
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:15,650
 But my brother... 

758
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:18,510
 isn't here anymore. 

759
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:33,680
Ah, I'm dying.

760
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:37,140
Manager, let's call it a day.

761
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,970
Let's do it.

762
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:42,980
Let's finish things up.

763
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:49,130
Jeong So Yeong, you can leave tomorrow's matters to tomorrow's you, so let's leave now.

764
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:53,100
I'll go a little later. Please go ahead.

765
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,300
It's nice to see you working hard. Work hard!

766
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:04,340
See you tomorrow.

767
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:07,660
You're working really hard.

768
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,760
You seemed to be drawing all day.

769
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,980
If you're done with your work, you can be on your way.

770
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:18,350
Why? Is there a reason why you would be uncomfortable if I stayed?

771
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:23,960
Okay then.

772
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,390
Which department are you from?

773
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:36,530
Sonó's Hwang Chi Hyeong? And what about it?

774
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:38,770
I guess the rumors haven't reached you yet.

775
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:42,400
It should have been quite noisy for a few days from all the talk about how the CEO let his son have a job.

776
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,510
Because it doesn't matter to me whether you're the CEO's son or not.

777
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:50,760
That's Sonó's workspace, right?

778
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,320
What?

779
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:07,980
You, I've got you red-handed.

780
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:28,360
This beast!

781
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:33,960
Or... not?

782
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:41,740
Are you awake?

783
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,500
Honey water for Director Hwang.

784
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:53,200
Chamomile tea for me.

785
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,910
Helps to ease the mind and body.

786
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:05,440
Drinking tea alone with a woman very late at night in an empty place.

787
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,670
What a peaceful sight.

788
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,490
It's making me take another look at you.

789
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,720
Although we had an accident,

790
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:15,810
I don't behave like the others just because I can.

791
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:18,160
Your taste is also very elegant.

792
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,100
I'm like that from all aspects.

793
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:25,320
Elegance, class, and beauty are precious.

794
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,770
 Team Leader Ha? 

795
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:42,790
  She's not my type at all. 

796
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:49,900
   

797
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:54,840
Was that it?

798
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,540
Pardon?

799
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,060
If you have something to say, just go ahead.

800
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:03,200
I feel like I can completely understand you now.

801
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,800
About what?

802
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,760
I can catch onto that much.

803
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:12,440
How refreshing.

804
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,740
I don't like it too sweet. Does it suit your taste?

805
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,180
It isn't perfect, but I still respect it.

806
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,940
Everyone has their own preference.

807
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:44,480
  It was good to see him. 

808
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,350
 It's been a while. 

809
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:50,360
 I was curious. 

810
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,640
 I wanted to know. 

811
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,870
 I was on your mind again, right? 

812
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:02,750
 If you apply this, it will heal quickly without a scar. 

813
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,500
 As soon as you get home, wash up and apply it. 

814
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:11,870
 He was on my mind. 

815
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:21,620
 My heart keeps trying to take over my mind. 

816
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:25,170
The end will just be lame either way.

817
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:30,870
Liking someone, thinking that it can't be anyone else but that person...

818
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:34,470
That kind of burning passion will be temporary.

819
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:39,050
In the end, you get tired and fight.

820
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:41,320
You ask yourself, "Why did we like each other?"

821
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,340
"Did we really like each other?"

822
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,880
"This is who you are?"

823
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:49,140
You'll be disappointed and regret it.

824
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:54,620
That will probably happen.

825
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:58,120
I don't want to do that again.

826
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:09,280
How would you know when you haven't gotten there yet?

827
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,390
A man, a woman, and love.

828
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:17,050
The beginning and the end are all predictable, no?

829
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:18,690
We can be different.

830
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:22,990
People are fooled by that, and that's why they start.

831
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,420
Hope you get home safely.

832
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:33,800
You went through a lot of burden today without my intention.

833
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:57,110
  You should change your background now. 

834
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:00,850
   

835
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:10,990
Like you said, the road I took a picture of 10 years ago

836
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:14,670
was vague and vast.

837
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:20,740
It was a road that left me confused.

838
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:34,360
But this road I'm on now is clear.

839
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:39,430
Where I should go. What's awaiting me at the end.

840
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:43,440
You were the one...

841
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,810
who took that picture?

842
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,830
Because of a woman who bought that picture,

843
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:53,830
I was able to endure 10 years.

844
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:57,430
By coincidence, I met that woman, and my heart started beating like crazy.

845
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:02,140
 Because of that woman, I canceled my flight like a crazy man. 

846
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,630
Because that woman is here,

847
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:15,110
I decided to stay here as well.

848
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,540
 But if these reasons aren't good enough, 

849
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:22,130
if they're still not good enough...

850
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,710
then we...

851
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:31,100
can break up.

852
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:37,620
Our relationship, which started 10 years ago...

853
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:43,710
Let's say we're in the middle of breaking up right now.

854
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:49,580
I don't know how long it'll take,

855
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,890
but at least while we're breaking up,

856
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:57,570
let's love,

857
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:03,980
Ha Yeong Eun.

858
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:11,820
♫  I'm going to call you  ♫

859
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:19,480
♫   I only love you   ♫

860
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:26,450
♫  I miss you, I miss you  ♫

861
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:32,910
♫   My love is only you   ♫

862
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:39,350
♫   You keep getting farther, call loudly   ♫

863
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:44,730
♫   I am standing right here   ♫

864
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:52,790
♫   That I can't even look at  you   ♫

865
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:59,390
♫  Means I love you  ♫

866
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:07,290
♫   That I am crying over and over   ♫

867
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:10,150
   

868
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:11,720
 Are we playing spot the difference? 

869
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,970
  - Even the fabric is the same. 
 - You did this, right? 

870
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:15,910
 - Are you suspecting me right now? 
 - What are  you going to do? 

871
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:18,980
 One person copied from the other and I'm saying it was not me. 

872
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:21,700
  The design got leaked, but it's so quiet. 

873
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:25,620
  I don't believe that anyone from our team would've done it. 

874
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:27,780
 I think this is your scarf. 

875
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,310
 You can just keep it. 

876
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:30,860
 She's being so forward and boldly not hiding her feelings. 

877
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,370
 The courage of not hiding one's feelings. 

878
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:33,470
 What do you think this is? 

879
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:35,410
 - A man? 
 - She must like you. 

880
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:37,170
  Why do you always leave the socks like this? 

881
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:41,540
  Is it that hard to turn the socks inside out and put them in the washer? 

882
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:44,550
  Maybe the device was faulty, or it was a misdiagnosis. 

883
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:47,370
 - Make sure to keep the interval. 
 - Sir, a separate pin light needs to go on the artist. 

884
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:49,310
  Camera 1, 2. Okay. 

885
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:51,810
  - Assistant Manager Seo, how are the models? 
 - Let's check the order. 

886
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:52,970
 This person changed. 

887
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:54,270
  How's Sonó doing? 

888
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:56,640
  There will be a live broadcast today on the internet. 

889
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,240
 As expected, Team Leader Ha knows business. 

890
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:02,310
 Because it's a dress without a particular characteristic or signature, it can become anything. 

891
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:04,210
 - Should I turn it off? 
 - Leave it. 

892
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:06,270
 Aren't those your photographs? 

893
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:08,570
 Jae Gook, what exactly are you planning? 

894
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:10,710
 How far exactly do you think you can go with this? 

895
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:12,120
  I haven't thought that far. 

896
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:17,120
 Right now, we're just going to focus on what we can do. 

897
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:23,740
 Timing and subtitles brought to you by 
 Are You The One Team @ Viki 

898
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:33,320
