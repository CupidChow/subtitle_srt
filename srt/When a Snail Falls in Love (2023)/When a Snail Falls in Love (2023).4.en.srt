3
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,400
(An adaptation of the novel
"When a Snail Falls in Love" by Ding Mo)

4
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,360
All the people we sent
have been arrested.

5
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,760
As for those women,

6
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,080
we drugged them.

7
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,560
The drug rendered them unable to speak.

8
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,760
Eig, my brother was arrested.

9
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,320
The organization

10
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,080
wants us to stop delivering the goods.

11
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,880
They want us to take care of
the meddling police officers.

12
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,440
Stop delivering?

13
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,440
Then we have to live on air?

14
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,360
Don't worry about Eig's problem.

15
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,200
Someone will get him out eventually.

16
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,640
As for whether or not
he will keep his mouth shut,

17
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,800
there's no need to worry.

18
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,800
Are you scared?

19
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,640
I'm worried

20
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,800
about the Black Lion.

21
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,560
He is relentless.

22
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,880
Illegal operating of casinos,

23
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,920
transnational human trafficking,

24
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,520
assaulting police officers...

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,120
When did I ever assault any officers?

26
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,680
It was you who assaulted me.

27
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,120
If you mean the incident at the museum,

28
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,400
why not add another charge of
stealing national relics?

29
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,480
Come on, show me what you have.

30
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,840
I don't even have to interrogate you.

31
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,120
The charges on this file

32
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,400
are enough to make you
spend the rest of your life in prison.

33
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,480
So, keeping any secrets from us
is never going to help.

34
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,520
Just spill it if you know anything.

35
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,880
At least you get to
reduce your sentence.

36
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,160
People like me

37
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,800
won't be in jail for too long.

38
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,240
And where did you get the confidence?

39
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,800
Do you have friends in jail?

40
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,160
Or is it the justice system?

41
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,560
Or is it because Luger is still alive?

42
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,280
The look on your face means
a lot more than your true words.

43
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,160
Luger is still alive.

44
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,400
Am I right?

45
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,200
When you decide to come clean,

46
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,480
feel free to ask for me.

47
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,960
Hey, Black Lion.

48
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,640
You will never accomplish your goal.

49
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,920
Heed my advice.

50
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,760
The past is like a raging fire.

51
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,040
Don't put your hand in the fire.

52
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,040
That person is not someone
you can mess with.

53
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,120
Listen closely.

54
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,520
I took him down five years ago
with my own hands.

55
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,520
If Luger is really still alive,

56
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,920
I'll just kill him with my hands again.

57
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,640
Did you just come home?

58
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,760
And the first thing you do is drinking wine?

59
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,160
The ice bucket has
water droplets on the outside.

60
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,720
It means you just got home.

61
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,120
And who's fault is that?

62
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,800
You went missing after hanging up.

63
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,160
I had to trouble Miss Mu
until she closed the shop.

64
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,120
I bet you didn't want to come home.

65
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,640
- And the reason being...
- No!

66
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,120
It's not what you think.

67
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,880
I'm not in love with Miss Mu.

68
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,360
Whatever the case is,

69
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,520
thanks for today.

70
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,840
Vita.

71
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,280
Did your boss say anything

72
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,240
about letting an outsider
like me be involved?

73
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,800
What outsider?

74
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Brother?

75
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,560
Vita...

76
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,640
You are on a secret investigation
on your own again?

77
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,040
The police investigate cases
as a team, right?

78
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,520
I don't mean to berate you,

79
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,600
but you should learn
to open up a little.

80
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,320
Don't shoulder everything yourself.

81
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,480
Okay?

82
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,720
Time to go to bed.

83
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,560
What are you doing?

84
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,600
Vita?

85
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,560
Why are you sleeping there?

86
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,160
You should go to bed.

87
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,120
There is a physical test tomorrow.

88
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,040
The captain
brought it forward to morning.

89
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,280
Vita.

90
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,120
Go to bed.

91
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,040
Don't push yourself too hard.
It won't do you any good.

92
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,080
It doesn't work.

93
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,840
Don't forget, I look forward
to working with you.

94
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,960
Let me be honest with you.

95
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,640
You have an interesting captain.

96
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,520
If he could make you quit this job,

97
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,920
that would be terrific.

98
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,120
Put more strength into your legs.

99
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,040
Why are you holding your breath?

100
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,000
Move faster!

101
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,080
Why do you only take high-calorie food?

102
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,640
You need high-protein food
to increase your muscle strength.

103
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,200
It's no wonder

104
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,000
you're so weak.

105
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,760
Breathe in and fill your lungs.

106
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,840
Breathe out.

107
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,640
Don't gasp like a puppy.

108
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,960
Get ready.

109
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,520
A record of my physical performance
since my first day in the academy.

110
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,200
Your score increased
by 1.17 every month.

111
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,000
It's not impossible.

112
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,520
You will reach 80 someday.

113
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,520
But it will take two years or longer.

114
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,880
Based on my observation,

115
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,560
you can't reach 1.17 every month.

116
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,600
But I can do more than that.

117
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,640
Therefore, I'll see to that test myself.

118
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,920
But that seems impossible.

119
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Captain.

120
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,400
Are you here for a jog too?

121
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,120
I didn't know.

122
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,800
Da.

123
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,840
I've never met the captain
when I work out.

124
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,880
Do you know

125
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,920
which gym he goes to?

126
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,320
Vita.

127
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,080
Are you working out too?

128
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,480
I asked her to come here.

129
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,920
Perfect timing.

130
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,240
Help me give Vita a test.

131
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,440
Show her what a strong
and healthy police officer

132
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,360
is like.

133
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,120
A test?

134
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,040
Isn't that three months from now?

135
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,480
This is the beginner's level.

136
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,240
Run laps around
the court for ten minutes.

137
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,680
Then, five minutes of sit-ups.

138
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,920
Two minutes of push-ups.

139
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,200
Do not pull any punches.

140
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,120
Commence!

141
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,360
You need high-protein food
to increase your muscle strength.

142
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,520
Vita.

143
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,280
Sorry.

144
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,920
I didn't know the captain
would give you a test.

145
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,840
I wouldn't have gone there had I known.

146
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,280
Every defeat and victory is
a contest for my will.

147
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,600
It's none of your concern.

148
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,720
But you did
a lot better today than before.

149
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,120
If the captain gives you more chances,

150
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,000
maybe

151
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,440
you'll be part of some important
missions and become a crime buster.

152
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,040
Hello, Chief.

153
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,640
You want me as the bodyguard?

154
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,480
Could you get the towel for me?

155
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,520
My job is to protect
your personal safety.

156
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,760
Taking the towel

157
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,920
is not part of my job.

158
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,080
Stop.

159
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,280
The regulations dictate

160
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,320
that the bodyguard must be
five meters away from the target

161
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,840
to have a better view of
any suspicious activities.

162
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,040
Who made the rules?

163
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,280
Fine, so be it.

164
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,960
You don't allow any distractions
when you work.

165
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,480
How professional.

166
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,080
Well? Are you attracted to my charm yet?

167
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,440
Don't bother wiping
if you keep dilly-dallying.

168
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
You'll be dry in a moment.

169
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,240
That's true enough.

170
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,800
Four and a half minutes.

171
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,240
I used to last longer than five minutes.

172
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,320
Maybe I lacked the concentration today.

173
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,040
What do you usually eat?

174
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,440
You are slim.

175
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,640
But you look strong.

176
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,160
My diet mostly covers the
five essential nutrients and

177
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,560
I have protein shake in the morning.

178
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,600
I take vitamins in the afternoon.

179
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
Hold on.

180
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,280
Are you secretly writing down
my recipe to maintain this good shape?

181
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,360
Is that necessary?

182
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,400
How about this?

183
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,160
I'll tell you all of my secrets

184
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,560
on one condition.

185
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,040
Vita!

186
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,760
Hey.

187
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,840
Sen.

188
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,240
What's wrong?

189
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,280
Vita.

190
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,680
Don't listen to him.

191
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,160
He doesn't know anything.

192
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,560
Come on.

193
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,800
Hold on.

194
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,960
Today,

195
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,400
Vita is my bodyguard.

196
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,520
What are you doing?

197
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,560
I'm the one who needs a bodyguard.

198
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,240
Aren't you worried about your sister?

199
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,200
Right.

200
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,760
Vita.

201
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,680
- That makes sense.
- This way.

202
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,960
Hold on.

203
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,360
Come on.

204
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,720
Thank you, Miss Mu,

205
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,840
for coming here
to give us your statement.

206
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,360
I'm the one who should thank you.

207
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,120
I'm able to be useful.

208
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,920
Is there anything else?

209
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,000
I thought someone
was here to pick me up.

210
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,800
Maybe they will be here soon.

211
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,160
Say hi to Vita for me.

212
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,320
It's a shame I didn't see her.

213
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,400
Okay.

214
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,720
The car is here.

215
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,920
Where is Vita?

216
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,280
She's been assigned
a special mission outside.

217
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,120
I thought you knew.

218
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,320
Miss Mu.

219
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,840
She is not here.

220
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,040
She went out.

221
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,600
What do you need?

222
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,960
She will be back later, right?

223
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,280
Of course.

224
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,360
She lives upstairs, after all.

225
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,040
But I don't know for sure
when she will be back.

226
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,240
I'll...

227
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,440
I'll take my time and browse around.

228
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm not in a hurry today.

229
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,360
I can take my time.

230
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,600
There aren't many
desserts left in the shop.

231
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,760
We only have layer cakes, banana cakes,
and cakes with fillings.

232
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,200
That's about it.

233
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,200
I think I saw...

234
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,760
This is Mr. Wasu.

235
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,120
Hello.

236
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,960
This is Pe. He is...

237
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,880
I am only here for some cakes.

238
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,640
But...

239
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,040
I must get going now.

240
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,760
Hey.

241
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,640
You said you weren't in a hurry.

242
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,440
So are you in a hurry or not?

243
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,720
Bo, help Pe move the stuff from the car.

244
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,120
Yes, Miss Mu.

245
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,720
I thought you didn't like desserts.

246
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,440
I fell in love with it
after trying it some days ago.

247
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,480
But what a shame,

248
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,480
there aren't many left today.

249
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,840
I didn't make a lot today.

250
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,640
I wanted to close the shop early

251
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,360
because Pe was coming.

252
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,840
He must mean a lot to you.

253
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,280
Of course,

254
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,320
he's the only younger brother I have.

255
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,880
You know what, Mr. Wasu?

256
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,080
When you smile,

257
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,640
I can hear you breathing.

258
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,080
Is that so?

259
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,560
I didn't know.

260
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,760
You're doing it now.

261
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,240
Oh, like this?

262
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,760
So...

263
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,960
I should pick myself some cakes.

264
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,160
Okay.

265
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,040
(The Miraculous Journey
of Edward Tulane)

266
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,040
You must be wondering.

267
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,400
Why is an adult of my age
still reading children's books?

268
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,680
Not at all.

269
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,240
I have this book at home too.

270
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,240
My brother has one in his collection.

271
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,880
Have you ever been in a relationship?

272
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,440
If you meet the right person...

273
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,520
I thought you were single.

274
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,120
I was in love once.

275
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,120
But we broke up long ago.

276
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,240
I have more important things to do.

277
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,720
And what might that be?

278
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,680
I want to repay my uncle's kindness.

279
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,320
Sen's father raised me.

280
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,200
Do you live with your parents?

281
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,920
I live with my brother.

282
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,800
Does he take good care of you?

283
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,240
He does.

284
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,120
But most of the time,
it's the other way around.

285
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,760
But I know for sure

286
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,600
that he cares a lot about me.

287
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,800
It must be nice

288
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,640
to have your family with you.

289
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,880
Let's go inside.

290
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,880
Okay.

291
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,560
You should have said so
if you were buying everything.

292
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,880
You took a long time to browse around.

293
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,400
Don't be so mean.

294
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,920
Thank you so much, Mr. Wasu.

295
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,480
This is great, Mu.

296
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,880
We can close early today.

297
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,360
We have more time
to try the other flavors.

298
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,560
What are you testing this time?

299
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,920
Kanom han tra.

300
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,480
Kanom han tra?

301
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,440
It's a tradition.

302
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,880
We want to prepare some kanom han tra

303
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,200
for everyone at the birthday party.

304
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:33,840
Birthday?

305
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,600
Is it Miss Mu's birthday?

306
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,520
Yes. It's in two days.

307
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,800
Mu.

308
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,280
You forgot to send him the invitation.

309
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,240
I'm so sorry about that.

310
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:43,840
I'm coming.

311
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,320
I'm sorry for the sudden invitation.

312
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,040
It must be awkward.

313
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,720
See you in two days.

314
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,160
Okay.

315
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,280
Okay, Mu. Time to make some snacks.

316
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,080
I should get going.

317
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,800
Okay.

318
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,800
See you there.

319
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,400
Okay.

320
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,640
You're home early today, Vita.

321
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,560
I didn't go to work today.

322
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Or maybe it was work.

323
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,280
But I'm not sure if it was work.

324
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,200
Did the captain put
one over on you again?

325
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,360
You should quit.

326
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,760
Just quit.

327
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,040
No, the order didn't
come from the captain.

328
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,680
The higher-up sent me
there to be Sen's bodyguard.

329
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,280
Bodyguard?

330
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,720
You, Vita? Who can you actually protect?

331
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,960
The thought of it makes me laugh.

332
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,640
That brat is putting in
some real effort to woo a girl.

333
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,320
I like the creativity.

334
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,440
I like it.

335
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,880
However,

336
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,920
Xin came along and helped me out.

337
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,760
So I spent the day with her instead.

338
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,200
Xin?

339
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,800
Xin?

340
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,600
Was she

341
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,840
the rich woman you saved
in the case with saw blades?

342
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,000
When did you become this close?

343
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,360
Are we that close?

344
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,080
But do you

345
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,040
know anyone else who can spend

346
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,240
an entire day talking to you?

347
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,000
Vita.

348
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,960
You should keep your distance from her.

349
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,680
They are not an ordinary family.

350
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,000
Rumors say they are
fighting for the family's wealth.

351
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,560
That has nothing to do with Xin, right?

352
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,480
Vita.

353
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,720
Her world is not
the same as the one we live in.

354
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,800
You didn't mention this
when we talked about Sen.

355
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,400
I realized that day

356
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,840
you will never fall for a guy like Sen.

357
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,760
Four minutes and 30 seconds.

358
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,120
You've never talked with me
for this long about my friends.

359
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,800
But for you,

360
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,400
my biggest problem is
not having friends, right?

361
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,080
Vita.

362
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,640
I'm worried about you.

363
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,880
I'll be in my room.

364
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,480
(Why didn't you come to work?)

365
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,760
I got an order from the higher-up.

366
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,160
(If you want to work with me,
you only take orders from me.)

367
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,560
Are you coming to work tomorrow?

368
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,240
(Yes.)

369
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,200
But...

370
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,200
But what?

371
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,400
Forget about the other things.

372
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,600
You're mine now.

373
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,400
What?

374
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,560
Yours?

375
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,000
You're in my unit.

376
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,240
You only take orders from me.
Is that clear?

377
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,560
(Captain Pla)

378
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,320
Mr. Indesh must really
value your captain

379
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,120
to change the order
assignment so quickly.

380
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,120
The chief changed his order

381
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,840
for a sound reason,
but because of personal connections.

382
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,960
Personal connections.

383
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,560
You're talking to me standing up
while she is sitting next to me.

384
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,320
You're not five meters away from me.

385
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,360
Am I right?

386
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,000
She is around one meter away.

387
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,120
You're 1.5 meters away.

388
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,480
The regulations dictate

389
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,200
that the bodyguards must be at least

390
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,400
five meters away from the target.

391
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,040
By standing so close to me,
you're violating the regulations.

392
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
What regulations?

393
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,360
Who sent you here?

394
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,200
The bodyguard regulations.

395
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,360
Who told you about the regulations?

396
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,800
Vita.

397
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
When she was here the last time,

398
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,880
she told me about the regulations.

399
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,640
It says that the bodyguards
and the person

400
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,880
they protect

401
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,360
must maintain a distance
of at least five meters

402
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,760
and maintain the distance

403
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,840
between each other...

404
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,280
And the target...

405
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,520
The regulations don't exist, right?

406
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,280
Yes.

407
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,160
(Luger Case File: Case Closed)

408
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,120
There have been a lot of cases.

409
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,880
Yes.

410
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,560
I need your help to take another look.

411
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,760
Hello, Chief.

412
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Hello.

413
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,800
Perfect timing.

414
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,600
Have you seen Captain Pla?

415
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,880
He is in his office.

416
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,360
I want him here now.

417
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,840
Yes, Chief.

418
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,280
Right away.

419
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,360
I want you to explain
every case in detail.

420
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,280
Captain!

421
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,280
What is it?

422
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,080
The chief wants to see you.

423
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,600
He's over there.

424
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,040
That's all.

425
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,480
Ning.

426
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,000
Yes?

427
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,560
Bring Vita here.

428
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,440
Okay.

429
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,680
Mr. Sen is an important person.

430
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,800
We can't send the weakest officer
to be his bodyguard.

431
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,480
Therefore, I sent two of
our elite officers there instead.

432
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,600
I did so out of respect.

433
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,040
Do you like the idea?

434
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,480
We'll proceed with your plan.

435
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,880
Ning.

436
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,520
Yes?

437
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,760
Did you talk to Vita?

438
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,680
I did.

439
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,680
Where is she now?

440
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,440
In your office.

441
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,000
You're here.

442
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,400
Yes.

443
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,040
Do you know why I want to talk to you?

444
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,640
It's because of

445
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,520
the previous physical test.

446
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,960
Not the last time.

447
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,360
It's this time.

448
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,400
But I'm not ready.

449
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,960
This isn't a test for your
physical performance

450
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,640
but your work capability.

451
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,320
Mr. Wasu?

452
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Miss Mu?

453
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,400
Mr. Wasu, have a drink.

454
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,040
Thank you.

455
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,920
Don't mention it.

456
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,240
How did you know about this entrance?

457
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,320
Pe called me and told me about it.

458
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,600
He wanted me to try your new snack.

459
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,280
He let me in from that entrance.

460
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,120
Pe always likes giving me surprises.

461
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,320
Sorry for the trouble.

462
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,480
Not at all.

463
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,440
Do you need my help with anything?

464
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,960
Give me your hands.

465
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,800
Roll this into a ball.

466
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,080
Then, press the middle with your thumb.

467
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,040
- Okay.
- Yes.

468
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,040
Sorry.

469
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,320
I pressed on your thumb instead.

470
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,800
I'll try with the other hand.

471
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,680
Okay.

472
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,760
Press a little harder.

473
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,800
Okay.

474
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,640
Okay.

475
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,560
Honestly,

476
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,680
I'm the lucky one.

477
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,280
That's because

478
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,920
I get to try it before anyone does.

479
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,240
And I get the chance
to make snacks with you.

480
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,840
I'm glad that you came.

481
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,680
I was hoping someone
could keep me company.

482
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,920
Miss Mu.

483
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,520
Could you take some photos
of the snacks for me?

484
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,760
That's alright.

485
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,960
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

486
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,560
I'll grab the camera upstairs.

487
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,160
You can stay here
and prepare the snacks.

488
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,040
I'll go upstairs
and get the camera for you.

489
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,480
It's alright. I live here.

490
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,480
It's easy for me.

491
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,960
- Sure.
- I'll be right back.

492
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,360
Okay.

493
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,560
What is the first thing
you do in an investigation?

494
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,120
Imagine that I am the criminal

495
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,840
by seeing things from their perspective.

496
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,600
But no one can
actually enter another's mind.

497
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,840
There is no way for us
to see what other thinks.

498
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,760
The best we can do is to think
as similarly as we can.

499
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,520
From what I see,

500
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,040
this is subjective imagination.

501
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,840
I'm not saying this is wrong.

502
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,960
But it means taking risks.

503
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,160
The risk being you could
use your imagination

504
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,840
to learn the truth.

505
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,640
But only 10% of the human brain
has been utilized.

506
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,320
Why can't we use
the intuition in the remaining 90%?

507
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,400
Because not all intuition
and imagination are right.

508
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,160
But after analyzing the evidence,

509
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,440
we know it never lies.

510
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,200
I use my intuition when I investigate.

511
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:51,920
However,

512
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,760
I use my intuition for
my decision-making.

513
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,440
You use your intuition
to draw a conclusion.

514
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,520
What if my intuition never lies?

515
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,280
No one's intuition will always be right.

516
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,480
Everyone makes mistakes.

517
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,800
But intuition can't tell you
the whole truth,

518
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,560
which is why we support it
with evidence.

519
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,040
Captain.

520
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,400
Someone broke into Miss Mu's house.

521
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,000
I'll tend to it later.

522
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,720
Yes.

523
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,960
Requesting permission to go with you.

524
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,280
I don't need a sidekick.

525
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:39,080
Get back to your work
and think about what I just said.

526
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,800
I want to be part of
this investigation too.

527
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,080
I can prove to you that my method
of apprehending criminals

528
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,960
is just as good as yours.

529
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,400
Did you not listen to

530
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,800
anything I just said?

531
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,480
You didn't listen at all!

532
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,400
I listened.

533
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,760
But I need to see the evidence

534
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,880
before I can believe

535
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,320
your hypothesis.

536
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
Isn't that a reasonable argument?

537
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,480
If I fail to arrest the burglar
that broke into Miss Mu's house,

538
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,280
I'll reflect on my mistakes.

539
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,640
Punish me however you want.

540
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,560
You can even

541
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,480
fire me.

542
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,760
But if I do it...

543
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,360
I won't bargain with you.

544
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,480
I won't let you pass unless you pass

545
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,040
the physical test.

546
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,240
I know.

547
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,760
But what I'm saying is,

548
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,320
if I do it,

549
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,440
I want you to be my coach.

550
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,280
I'm the one examining you.

551
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,240
And now you want me as your coach?

552
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,160
You're the best option I have.

553
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,960
So, you have other candidates?

554
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,160
Yes.

555
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,720
It's Sen.

556
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,920
That arrogant brat?

557
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,360
But Sen is not the best candidate.

558
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,160
Be it the personal experience,

559
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,160
physical condition,

560
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,480
or combat experience,

561
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,560
or even teaching experience as a coach,

562
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,000
he is no match for you.

563
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,720
That is true enough.

564
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,360
Well said.

565
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,520
As police officers,

566
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,760
we shouldn't be coached by

567
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,520
someone who overestimates his strengths.

568
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,800
In other words,

569
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,880
you are the best option

570
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,480
in this regard.

571
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,320
Fine.

572
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,360
That settles it.

573
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,680
Deal.

574
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,440
Bad news.

575
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,600
We're not getting any major cases,

576
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,560
but I can sniff the love in the air.

577
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
Listen.

578
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,720
Something must have happened
between the captain and Vita.

579
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,760
You don't get it. The thing is,

580
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,520
Vita and the captain had
a heated argument in his office.

581
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,880
But soon enough, I saw Vita smiling.

582
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,280
I was preparing snacks in the kitchen.

583
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,000
When I came upstairs to get some stuff,

584
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,840
I found the room in this shape.

585
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,360
Did anyone else move
the things inside this room?

586
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,000
I checked.

587
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,400
I didn't lose any valuable items.

588
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,600
The door was locked.

589
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,360
No one could have come in here.

590
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,400
Maybe it was the wind.

591
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
Wasu.

592
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,480
Are you serious or are you kidding?

593
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,600
I am serious.

594
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,400
I mean, anything could be possible.

595
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,480
Your brother is right.

596
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,480
The furniture all fell
in the same direction.

597
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,480
If this was a burglary,
it'd be too strange.

598
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,960
We should consider every possibility.

599
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,600
But I doubt it was

600
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,280
just the wind.

601
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,840
Wasu.

602
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,280
Take Miss Mu downstairs and wait there.

603
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,640
Yes.

604
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,680
So,

605
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,160
what do you think?

606
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,440
She didn't lose any valuable items.

607
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,760
She lost nothing
and her life wasn't in danger.

608
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,080
And more importantly,

609
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,200
there wasn't any threat note.

610
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,960
Miss Mu doesn't have any enemies.

611
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,280
All except

612
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,040
the human traffickers.

613
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,200
Could it be

614
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,120
that some of them slipped away

615
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,920
and tried to take her life?

616
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,520
If they wanted her dead,

617
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,440
why would they turn the room into a mess

618
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,840
and give her the chance
to call the police?

619
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,080
I think

620
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,120
you should think harder.

621
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,520
Take your time.

622
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,600
I won't distract you.

623
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,040
Knock yourself out.

624
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,280
Miss Mu.

625
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,640
Have you noticed anything unusual

626
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,240
after you gave the statement
at the police station?

627
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,800
Nothing worth noting.

628
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,600
But I have this feeling
that someone is watching me.

629
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,360
But it's just a feeling.

630
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,680
It's probably nothing.

631
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,600
Captain.

632
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,120
Captain, hold on!

633
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,840
What got into you?

634
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,240
I found the culprit.

635
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,600
We will contact you

636
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,160
when we arrest the culprit.

637
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,520
Take good care of Miss Mu.

638
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,760
Of course.

639
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,760
Until her brother is back,

640
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,000
don't go home.

641
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,400
Thank you.

642
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,000
Let's go inside, Miss Mu.

643
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,320
Okay.

644
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,200
Vita may look weak and small,

645
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,400
but she is amazing.

646
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,160
She will catch the bad guy.

647
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,600
I owe you an apology.

648
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,040
I'm sorry you ran
into this kind of thing.

649
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,160
Mr. Wasu?

650
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,720
I...

651
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,360
I was just thinking

652
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,840
I've never met a girl like you.

653
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,880
You always

654
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,600
put others before yourself.

655
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,920
I think I am less useful
compared to the others.

656
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,120
So I want to be useful to everyone.

657
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,640
When I cause trouble to someone,

658
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,600
I feel bad.

659
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,400
Miss Mu, I want you to know...

660
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,320
You should get back your work.

661
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,600
I'll be fine on my own.

662
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,800
But...

663
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,480
You care about others a lot too.

664
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,960
I'm answering this phone call.

665
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,880
If you need anything, just shout.

666
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,800
Yes.

667
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,920
Are you sure?

668
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,760
Will the culprit come back here?

669
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,720
They didn't get what he was after.

670
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,000
They will come back eventually.

671
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,800
Burglary?

672
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,280
Is this how you win a girl's heart?

673
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,400
How did you know it was me?

674
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,320
You can't handle cold weather,

675
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,720
but you've been
sweating the entire time.

676
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,120
And you looked anxious.

677
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,280
When you mentioned
that the gust blew the furniture down,

678
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,520
you didn't want the situation to escalate.

679
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,680
It may seem far-fetched,

680
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,640
but the evidence

681
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,200
is the men's handkerchief.

682
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,840
(You always carry one with you,
but not today.)

683
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,240
(You either forgot)

684
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,200
or lost it.

685
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,560
And most importantly,

686
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,840
it has the same scent as
the softener we use at home.

687
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,560
Not to mention it carries the scent
of the fragrance you use

688
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,440
and the WS embroidery.

689
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,880
W-A-S-U.

690
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,560
Okay.

691
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,880
I admit it.

692
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,880
When I got to shop just now,

693
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,520
(I received a call from her brother.)

694
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,800
(By the way, Wasu,)

695
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,440
(remind my sister for me.)

696
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,280
(Bring the clothes inside.
It's about to rain.)

697
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,800
Okay. Sure.

698
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:27,880
(But...)

699
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,120
(I had no idea
what present to give her.)

700
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,680
(So I wanted to find out)

701
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,800
(what she likes.)

702
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,600
Then,

703
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,240
I decided

704
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,160
to buy her perfume.

705
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,600
(Her bottle was already empty.)

706
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,160
(I didn't want to
forget the name of the brand,)

707
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,200
(so I took a picture
of it with my phone.)

708
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,840
(That was when I heard)

709
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,960
(someone was coming.)

710
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,040
We're here, Miss Mu.

711
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,800
- Okay.
- I got the door for you.

712
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,400
Your belongings are at the usual spot.

713
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,320
Thanks, Bo.

714
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,680
I didn't want to tell her

715
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,080
because

716
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,240
I didn't want her
to think of me as a pervert.

717
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,400
You went to great lengths
to prepare a gift for me,

718
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,080
why would I think of you as a pervert?

719
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,280
I think you should
resolve this problem in private.

720
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,080
As for you...

721
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,720
Miss Mu.

722
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,280
I'm so sorry.

723
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,280
Had I been honest from the start,

724
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,840
none of this would have happened.

725
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,960
But I was too scared.

726
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,280
That's why things

727
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,920
got worse.

728
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,880
Don't let it bother you.

729
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,640
When we talk about this in the future,

730
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,160
we'll both laugh at it.

731
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,080
Aren't you mad at me?

732
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:35,920
Are you

733
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,560
not upset at all?

734
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,560
Does that mean

735
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,120
we still have a chance

736
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,200
to meet again?

737
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,680
If you haven't tried the kanom han tra,

738
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,960
you're always welcome here.

739
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,840
You usually had more joy in your smile.

740
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,280
That's more like it.

741
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,160
Come in.

742
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,800
Okay.

743
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,360
So,

744
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,880
did I pass?

745
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,640
You merely got lucky.

746
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,680
Wasu is your brother.

747
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,080
You knew his personal info,

748
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,520
personality,

749
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,600
and habits.

750
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,120
But I must remind you,

751
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,920
you won't get to know
every criminal in the world.

752
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,640
Yes.

753
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,640
I'm going to listen to the arrangement
we agreed upon.

754
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,720
Okay.

755
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,160
I lost.

756
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,920
See you tomorrow at 7 a.m.

757
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,320
If you are late,

758
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,640
the training is canceled.

759
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,840
Yes, Captain!

760
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,160
No.

761
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,800
Yes,

762
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,400
Coach.

763
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,320
(You woke me up at this hour
to show off your result?)

764
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,440
(I found this on the deceased.)

765
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,480
(Does it remind you of something?)

766
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,640
You jerk!

767
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,160
(Where are you, Vita?)

768
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,440
At Miss Mu's shop.

769
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,280
(There's been an emergency,
come to the crime scene now!)

770
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,480
(I'll send you the location.)

771
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,880
(Actually, Vita is quite tough.)

772
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,360
(The victim)

773
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,360
(is not only someone she knew)

774
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,880
(but also her good friend.)

775
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,400
(But she can still control her emotions.)

776
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,800
(He didn't say a word)

777
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,800
(since we arrived.)

778
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,320
(He said he only wants to see you.)
