00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,300
(An adaptation of the novel
"When a Snail Falls in Love" by Ding Mo)

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,760
Hey, buddy.

5
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,040
Is it settled?

6
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,840
What?

7
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,320
Just one girl?

8
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,040
Do you think it's easy
to be a swindler on the street?

9
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,840
I'll call you later.

10
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,880
Hey!

11
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,640
It's you again!

12
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,640
What do you want?

13
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,920
I was just passing by.
I didn't overhear anything.

14
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,480
Which way is Alley 3?

15
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,840
That way?

16
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,240
What are you doing?

17
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,480
Da!

18
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,920
Did you leave the hospital?

19
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,240
Da!

20
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,160
I'm alright.

21
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,640
No, you're not!

22
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,560
Hey!

23
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,440
We have a guest here!

24
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,600
Da...

25
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
This way.

26
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,320
The party is in this room.

27
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,000
Go inside!

28
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,560
No!

29
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,640
Sit here.

30
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,200
Di.

31
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,960
The batch from this morning.

32
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,160
Take these two with you.

33
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,800
Okay.

34
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,440
You...

35
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,640
Are you okay?

36
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,520
The same scar on that woman.

37
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,320
Hey!

38
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,560
What are you doing?

39
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,800
Nothing.

40
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,000
Take this with you.

41
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,720
Okay.

42
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,280
Remember.

43
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,760
Please let me go, sir!

44
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,720
As you know,

45
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,400
there is no way I will ever let you go.

46
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,240
Get her out of here now!

47
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,960
- Stop right there!
- Let go!

48
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,680
Sit down!

49
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,560
Let go!

50
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,200
Stop!

51
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,480
Stop hurting her!

52
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,560
Aren't you a brave one?

53
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,320
You'll go

54
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,800
in her stead.

55
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,760
Fine.

56
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,520
But I want you to promise

57
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,000
you will stop hurting these girls

58
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,960
if I go with you.

59
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,840
But...

60
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,080
Why should I listen to you?

61
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,640
Take her away.

62
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,520
- Don't touch me!
- Let go!

63
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,440
Come here!

64
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,240
Stop resisting! Get over here!

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,840
Come here!

66
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,880
You troublemaker.

67
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,440
Stop resisting,

68
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,640
it will only hurt more.

69
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,520
You,

70
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
put some makeup on her.

71
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
As for you,

72
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,400
get changed when the makeup is done.

73
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,040
Get over here!

74
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,080
Let go of me!

75
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,120
How hard can it be?

76
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,000
Where are you going?

77
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,760
You could get yourself killed!

78
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,800
Stay here and sit still.

79
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,440
Do as they say.

80
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,520
Otherwise,

81
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,640
I'll be in trouble as well.

82
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,160
Please?

83
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,560
Trust me on this.

84
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,480
Da!

85
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,680
Da!

86
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,880
Da, get up!

87
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,840
Da!

88
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,320
Here comes another with a death wish.

89
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,640
Hey! He has a gun!

90
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,960
The first girl of the day.

91
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,840
Sixteen years old.

92
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,560
Blood type, A.

93
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,960
And her measurements, 34, 23, 35.

94
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,680
Most importantly, she is young

95
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,880
and doesn't know any better.

96
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,120
Today, we bring her here
so you may start bidding.

97
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
I'll look for Vita.

98
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,680
Stay cautious.
Go with Ning and proceed with the plan.

99
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Hey, pal.

100
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,600
The general manager wants to see you.

101
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,240
I can take it from here.

102
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,000
- Okay. VIP room one.
- VIP room one, got it.

103
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,440
The starting price
of the bid is 100,000 baht!

104
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,520
I'm here to deliver the fruits.

105
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,840
VIP room one, 150,000 baht!

106
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,200
Any other bidders?

107
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,160
- 150,000 baht, once!
- Hey!

108
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,920
- You can leave now.
- Okay.

109
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,120
150,000 baht, twice!

110
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,560
The item goes to
VIP room one for 150,000 baht!

111
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,000
Congratulations.

112
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,680
Allow me to introduce
the next beauty of the night.

113
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,560
She has a graceful figure

114
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,280
and comes with a special perk.

115
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,200
On her back is this beautiful tattoo

116
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,960
that is the work
of a famous tattoo artist.

117
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,120
For those who are interested,

118
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,080
the starting price

119
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,800
is 200,000 baht!

120
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,280

122
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,360
Prestigious guests,

123
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,120
let me introduce
the special entry of the night.

124
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,600
Normally, the items from our auction
only have six months of period of use.

125
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,680
But this item is special for it will be
auctioned at a transferred price.

126
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,840
The item doesn't have
our custom marking.

127
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,040
Therefore, you may do
as you please with her.

128
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,080
The starting price of this item

129
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,000
is 200,000 baht.

130
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,320
You may start bidding now.

131
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,520
I hear 250,000 baht!

132
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,400
It's 280,000 baht!

133
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,640
Now, 400,000 baht!

134
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,920
It's going up fast!
It's now 400,000 baht!

135
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,520
400,000 baht, once!

136
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,280
400,000 baht, twice!

137
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,800
Anyone?

138
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,320
It's now 500,000 baht!

139
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,840
It's 500,000 baht!

140
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,600
It seems everyone really likes
the special entry I prepared tonight!

141
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,520
Excuse me.

142
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,920
It's now 500,000 baht!

143
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,400
It seems...

144
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,200
Mr. Han?

145
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,760
The special entry of the night
really caught everyone's attention!

146
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,080
550,000 baht, once!

147
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,600
- Don't just stand there.
- 550,000 baht, twice!

148
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,480
Come here.

149
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,280
Yes.

150
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,400
The final bid is 550,000 baht!

151
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,320
Please take a seat.

152
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,840
Thrice!

153
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,200
- She will now go to VIP room one.
- Leave.

154
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Come here.

155
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,160
Behave yourself.

156
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,560
From what I heard,

157
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,640
your master is some kind of a big shot.

158
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,040
What master?

159
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,320
The customer you were sold to.

160
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,160
From now on,

161
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,520
you belong to him.

162
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,200
For everyone out there,
you are as good as

163
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,240
non-existent.

164
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,160
Be ready to welcome your new life.

165
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,040
Hey.

166
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,400
Be gentle.

167
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,720
If the auctioned item
gets any blemishes,

168
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,960
you're in trouble.

169
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,000
Go.

170
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,360
To room one.

171
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,840
Don't get the wrong room.

172
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,960
Vita.

173
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,480
Pita!

174
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,960
Pita!

175
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,440
Pita! I'm so sorry! I messed up.

176
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,520
- I am so sorry.
- No, you did great.

177
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,440
You've been very brave.

178
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,480
I ran into Mr. Han.

179
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,560
Mr. Han?

180
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,560
I thought he was sick.

181
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,760
- What is he doing here?
- First, we have to leave.

182
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,440
Name your price.

183
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,480
Pita.

184
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,240
Do you remember when Eig died,

185
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
we all thought

186
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,080
there was a mole among us?

187
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,440
It couldn't have been Mr. Han.

188
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,840
Pita.

189
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,080
You never let sentiments sway you.

190
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,160
Whatever the case is,
Mr. Han has his reason to be here.

191
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,400
I'll talk to him now.

192
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,440
Ming is here too.

193
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,880
Meet up with her.

194
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,760
Ning will

195
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,080
bring reinforcements.

196
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,400
Pita.

197
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,600
Stay safe.

198
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,920
Hello, Ming.

199
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,320
Vita, are you safe now?

200
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,000
Aren't you on stage?

201
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,880
Sorry.

202
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,960
I'm at VIP room ten.

203
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,240
I'm collecting evidence of them
auctioning women.

204
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,400
Ning and the reinforcements
are already at the front door.

205
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,360
Okay.

206
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,400
A bunch of worthless scoundrels.

207
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,840
Hey!

208
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,080
Hey!

209
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,120
Wake up!

210
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,280
What are you doing here?

211
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,200
Where is the girl who came with you?

212
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,400
Where is she?

213
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,200
Buddy,

214
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,720
she was the one who knocked me out.

215
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,120
Darn it!

216
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,360
This is bad.

217
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,000
What are you doing?

218
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,320
We are the police!

219
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,840
Liars!

220
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,680
What did you say?

221
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,320
Open your eyes and look closely!

222
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,760
Do you have a search warrant?

223
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,920
Oh? A search warrant?

224
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,720
We don't have it, so what?

225
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,680
Cuff him.

226
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Let go of me!

227
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,200
Stop right there!

228
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,640
Stop!

229
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,240
Turn around.

230
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,080
Bring them all to the station.

231
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,920
Yes!

232
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,120
Move!

233
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,520
- Get up.
- Walk.

234
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,880
Move.

235
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,320
Move.

236
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,160
Move!

237
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,360
Go.

238
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,400
Captain.

239
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,400
Vita said you ran into Mr. Han.
Was it true?

240
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,520
Yeah.

241
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,600
You...

242
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,760
You...

243
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,200
Mr. Han?

244
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,840
Mr. Han!

245
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,960
Mr. Han!

246
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,440
Mr. Han!

247
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,760
Call an ambulance now!

248
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,000
Call the ambulance!

249
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,960
Come to the crime scene immediately!

250
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,320
An officer has been stabbed!

251
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,880
Hurry!

252
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,040
Mr. Han!

253
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,040
Mr. Han!

254
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,280
Mr. Han!

255
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,840
Who did this?

256
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,120
Help...

257
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,800
Help...

258
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,240
Ming!

259
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
Bring me more tea.

260
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,760
Tea?

261
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,760
There is tea inside the cup, sir.

262
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,000
But it's not hot tea.

263
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,280
Tea should be hot!

264
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,480
What is this nonsense of a report?

265
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,480
It's unusable.

266
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,040
Did you learn anything at school?

267
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
Why you...

268
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,400
A waste of my time.

269
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,280
Ning...

270
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,040
Lieutenant Hannarong Kittijaruean,

271
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,400
a member of Bangkok Police Station's

272
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,760
Police Investigators Team.

273
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,040
Last night,

274
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,080
he was attacked

275
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,120
at the alley of the Golden Valley Club.

276
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,760
The victim

277
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,520
was stabbed by a triangular bayonet

278
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,520
which tore his vital organs,

279
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,800
which led to excessive blood loss.

280
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,760
Such is the cause of his death.

281
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,560
Golden Valley Club

282
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,720
was suspected of abducting women,

283
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,320
sexual trades, and illegal organ deals.

284
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,040
It's likely they are
linked to Luger's case.

285
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,640
There are two types
of women they abduct.

286
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,600
The beautiful ones

287
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,640
would be taken to the sex auction.

288
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,000
The period of use is half a year.

289
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,840
Women from the other category

290
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,640
will be traded as organ donors

291
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,040
and sold based on
the client's requirements.

292
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,480
They killed Mr. Han.

293
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,440
They killed Mr. Han.

294
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,240
Ning!

295
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,280
Based on the investigation,

296
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,160
Mr. Han was indeed

297
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,400
a guest of the VIP room three.

298
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,640
What did you say, Ming?

299
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,120
How is that even possible?

300
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,000
Ning!

301
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,920
Darn it!

302
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,040
"A shocking scandal
of the police force."

303
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,880
"A veteran officer became a perp."

304
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,360
They have no right to say that!

305
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,280
What proof do they have?

306
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,120
Captain!

307
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,240
Where are you going?
Have you lost your mind?

308
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,440
They have no right to say this!

309
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,840
How dare they write about him that way!

310
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,080
Captain.

311
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,400
You need to calm down.
Our priority is to find the culprit.

312
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,600
Do not make the same mistake
you made with Badin.

313
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,240
Captain!

314
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,120
Vita.

315
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,440
We received an update from the hospital.
The girl we rescued

316
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,240
is awake.

317
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,520
We'll go to the hospital.

318
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,240
Do you remember me?

319
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,360
We met last night

320
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,960
inside that room.

321
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,080
I have a question about the people

322
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,240
who hurt you.

323
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,360
There was someone who liked sweets.

324
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,760
He said

325
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,320
the pain would be gone
after eating a sweet.

326
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,160
Do you remember what he looked like?

327
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,640
They...

328
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,600
They took my kidney.

329
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,360
Okay.

330
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,040
Rest well.

331
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,400
Thanks for the information.

332
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,120
What a shame.

333
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,560
She doesn't remember
the look of those bad guys.

334
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,560
But I remember

335
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,840
there was another girl
who got beaten up that night.

336
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,240
I wanted to save her,

337
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,560
but they took her before I could.

338
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,360
But it's strange.

339
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,920
Her name is not
on the files of the victims.

340
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,600
Vita.

341
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,280
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

342
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,480
I'm sure of it.

343
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,920
I still remember her look.

344
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,600
I should get back to work, Ming.

345
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,640
I can't visit Da today.

346
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,560
Send him my regard.

347
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,120
So I...

348
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,560
It's nothing.

349
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,960
Okay.

350
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,160
See you later.

351
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,000
Da.

352
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,000
You already know, don't you?

353
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,360
Who gave you the orders?

354
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
No idea.

355
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,760
Captain.

356
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,200
Wait outside.

357
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,560
Yes.

358
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,680
It's you again.

359
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,920
You're nothing but bad luck.

360
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,800
Bad luck?

361
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,120
Who was he?

362
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,120
Who was the man?

363
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,560
I don't know!

364
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,000
You don't know?

365
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,920
Do you know now?

366
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,280
Do you?

367
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,960
I don't know.

368
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,360
Hold on!

369
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,080
I give up.

370
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,040
I've only met him once.

371
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,160
No one saw his face.

372
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,240
Why is that?

373
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,280
Because he wore a mask.

374
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:33,920
A mask?

375
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,880
What is the name?

376
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,600
Give me his name!

377
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,560
- Help!
- Captain!

378
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,240
- Help! Save me!
- Captain! Calm down!

379
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,200
Help!

380
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,520
Captain!

381
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,880
He had a scar on his face.

382
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,360
We only know him as

383
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
Luger.

384
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,560
Luger?

385
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,360
(There were three wounds on Mr. Han.)

386
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,440
(They were all at the abdomen.)

387
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,480
(All three stabs wounded vital organs.)

388
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,400
(The laceration went upward.)

389
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,160
(The murderer was
standing right in front of Mr. Han.)

390
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,160
Vita.

391
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,720
Yes, Chief?

392
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,280
It's alright.

393
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,960
Formality is not needed.

394
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,600
We caught the suspects,

395
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,680
but Mr. Han...

396
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,560
Every operation comes with risks.

397
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,160
Sometimes,
we have to make the sacrifice.

398
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,400
You must get yourself together.

399
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,160
I think our game with Luger

400
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,480
has just begun.

401
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,320
Yes.

402
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,320
I feel the same.

403
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,000
By the way,

404
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,280
the hospital just called.

405
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,120
You talked to
one of the victims yesterday.

406
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
Yes.

407
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,360
There are some leads we are unsure of.

408
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,760
Did you get any new leads?

409
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,640
No.

410
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,680
It's the same as the woman
who abducted children.

411
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,160
They probably suffered
a lot of mental trauma.

412
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,480
If you need any help,

413
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,760
feel free to let me know.

414
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,760
Yes.

415
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,120
(Police Investigators Team)

416
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,840
(Pita won't talk to
anyone at the moment.)

417
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,040
(Not even me.)

418
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,320
(Police Lieutenant
Hannarong Kittijaruean)

419
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,720
How are you feeling?

420
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,320
Shouldn't you stay in the hospital?

421
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,120
How was Mr. Han's funeral?

422
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,560
His remains will be cremated tomorrow.

423
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,240
Where is Vita?

424
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,960
She went looking for the captain.

425
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,280
I'm going to Mr. Han's home.

426
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,960
Maybe I can find something there.

427
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,120
I should wait for the captain,

428
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,200
but the chief told me

429
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,080
the captain
couldn't control his emotions.

430
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,280
It'd probably be too much for him.

431
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,480
It's best he's not there.

432
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,640
We'll go with you.

433
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,920
Come on.

434
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,440
Let's go.

435
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,760
Two, one...

436
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,720
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

437
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,160
Everyone, get ready!

438
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,560
Best wishes, three and four!

439
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,560
- Happy Birthday!
- Mr. Han!

440
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,320
- Happy Birthday!
- Mr. Han!

441
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,680
- Yeah! Happy birthday!
- Yeah!

442
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,240
Yeah!

443
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,440
Yeah!

444
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,200
Go on and play elsewhere.

445
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,840
Forget about me.

446
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,160
The captain and Vita had
already sent me their gifts.

447
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,040
Mr. Han, did you think
we'd forget your birthday?

448
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,400
- Yup.
- Yup, I forgot.

449
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,360
Just kidding.

450
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,360
Over here.

451
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,000
I bought this for you.

452
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,640
It's the perfect present
for an innocent old bachelor.

453
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,760
Ning.

454
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,040
You little rascal!
What are you giving me?

455
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,320
- Do you want it or not?
- Sir!

456
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,720
Mine is better.

457
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,600
It helps with back pain and sore neck.

458
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,440
Forget about the old pillow.
Get rid of it.

459
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,000
But mine shows
the greatest love for Mr. Han.

460
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,120
My present has to be the biggest.

461
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,560
Sir!

462
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,840
Since you are
the sharpshooter on our team,

463
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,880
how about

464
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,200
we have a game?

465
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,000
Don't look down on me.

466
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,920
I'm the best
in the entire police station.

467
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,640
No personal belongings were lost.

468
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,880
These are only daily items.

469
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,480
Have you found anything useful?

470
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,720
I found nothing.

471
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,480
I found something.

472
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,680
My present for Mr. Han.

473
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,160
This brings back the nostalgia.

474
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,280
Let's leave.

475
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,280
(Missing Mr. Han)

476
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,960
(Police Lt. Hannarong Kittijaruean)
(Born: April 12, 1969, Died October 24, 2022)

477
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,200
Officer,

478
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,800
have you been here the entire night?

479
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,560
Yes.

480
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,000
I'll be going soon.

481
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,920
I will catch the murderer.

482
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,800
I am saddened by the recent event.

483
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,600
We lost a valued officer.

484
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,080
I leave this case in your hand.

485
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,880
Yes.

486
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,920
Ning.

487
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,680
Did you see the captain?

488
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,320
No. I've been looking for him
the entire morning.

489
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,360
Da, did you see the captain?

490
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,680
I've been calling his phone,
he never answered.

491
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,600
Vita.

492
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,320
No.

493
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,080
I'm hungry.

494
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,240
Let's get some tom yum soup
at the cafeteria.

495
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,040
Let's go.

496
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,000
The best in the world you mentioned?

497
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,400
The best in the world

498
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,240
has to be the shop Mr. Han recommended.

499
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,800
We'll go there.

500
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,880
Yeah.

501
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,400
He said he'd take me there.

502
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,760
But sadly,

503
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,680
we never got the chance.

504
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,800
Chin up.

505
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,520
Mr. Han hated
seeing people with long faces.

506
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,480
Let's grab some food.

507
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,240
Hey.

508
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,160
I guarantee

509
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,480
this is the best around.

510
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,440
Are you sure?

511
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,760
You've been working here for a week.
How do you feel?

512
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,840
I'm still not used
to the new environment.

513
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,440
It somewhat
deviated from my expectation.

514
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,520
How so?

515
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,080
Are they not following your orders?

516
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,640
Something like that.

517
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,800
Especially Officer Ning.

518
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,480
He is slowing down the whole operation.

519
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,240
He even brought us risks
that weren't a problem originally.

520
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,240
You are replacing the old leader
they respected.

521
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,280
I understand.

522
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,960
Sometimes, they should know
whose orders to take

523
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,680
and who has the authority.

524
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,880
Captain.

525
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,320
I have no doubt about
your professional capabilities.

526
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,040
But in here, we are a family.

527
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,040
Simply giving orders won't work.

528
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,120
You shouldn't

529
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,000
talk to us only
when you are assigned a mission.

530
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,520
If you want to give an order,
it's most effective when everyone's eating.

531
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,520
Let's start with this lunch, shall we?

532
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,720
Sit down and join us.

533
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,160
How did you find this place?

534
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,200
It's a famous tom yum shop.

535
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,400
I'd like to try the food here.

536
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,320
But Mr. Han never brought you here.

537
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,520
How do you know this place?

538
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,080
I just...

539
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,880
I searched along the route
between Mr. Han's home

540
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,840
and the police station
or the famous tom yum shop

541
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,280
that sells beer.

542
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,960
After all, Mr. Han loved beer.

543
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,680
That's how I found this place.

544
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,920
Pita.

545
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,840
Mr. Han has left us.

546
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,160
We are all grieving.

547
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,040
But you are the captain.

548
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,520
You can't hide here
and run away from reality.

549
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,920
I'm not hiding.

550
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,520
Try it out.

551
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,720
Anything else, Vita?

552
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,600
Pita.

553
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,080
I found this candy wrapping

554
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,000
inside Mr. Han's drawer.

555
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,640
So?

556
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,600
It's a normal wrapping.

557
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,000
This thing can be found everywhere.

558
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,960
Do you also think Mr. Han
was there for the prostitutes?

559
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,280
Do you think he was the mole?

560
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,440
He may not mean anything to you,

561
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,760
but he meant a lot to me.

562
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,640
He would never hire a prostitute.

563
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,800
He would never be a mole!

564
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,320
(If Mr. Han was
investigating Luger's case,)

565
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,280
(why didn't we know about it?)

566
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,120
(I wouldn't be surprised
if Ming and I didn't know.)

567
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,640
(But even Da and Ning
never noticed anything.)

568
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,760
(Even you)

569
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,520
(were kept in the dark.)

570
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,880
(Mr. Han is dead, right?)

571
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,200
(I had warned him.)

572
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,600
(Naga reaches every corner of darkness.)

573
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,560
(There are demons in his eyes.)
