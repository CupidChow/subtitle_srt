00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,400
(An adaptation of the novel
"When a Snail Falls in Love" by Ding Mo)

4
00:02:13,498 --> 00:02:14,618
Where's Luger?

5
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:36,738
For my brother's freedom...

6
00:02:37,178 --> 00:02:37,938
Boss,

7
00:02:38,018 --> 00:02:40,058
please give me another chance
to kill the Black Lion.

8
00:02:40,538 --> 00:02:41,618
For the sake of my brother,

9
00:02:41,698 --> 00:02:43,098
give me one more day.

10
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:44,698
I can definitely take him down.

11
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,458
There's only

12
00:02:47,018 --> 00:02:48,258
one chance.

13
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:51,618
That scum, Black Lion let this threat
come back here on purpose.

14
00:02:51,698 --> 00:02:53,218
You're such a disappointment.

15
00:04:43,938 --> 00:04:44,938
So

16
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,578
you tracked
and investigated Luger's followers,

17
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:51,538
intending to use him to find Luger.

18
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:53,778
But he was silenced.

19
00:04:56,498 --> 00:04:57,778
Tell me.

20
00:04:57,858 --> 00:05:00,178
You woke me up at this hour
to show off your result?

21
00:05:02,298 --> 00:05:02,938
Hey!

22
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,218
I found this on the deceased.

23
00:05:13,298 --> 00:05:14,818
Does it remind you of something?

24
00:05:29,218 --> 00:05:30,258
You scum!

25
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:31,578
Let go!

26
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,058
Let go of me!

27
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:37,458
Let go!

28
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,538
Luger mercilessly killed
your younger brother.

29
00:05:44,058 --> 00:05:45,738
Do you still want to protect him?

30
00:05:46,898 --> 00:05:49,458
Do you want to drive a wedge between us?

31
00:06:03,938 --> 00:06:05,778
Avenge your younger brother.

32
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:08,058
Let's work together.

33
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:10,698
We have a common enemy.

34
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:16,978
I don't know the owner of this necklace.

35
00:06:18,018 --> 00:06:19,538
You won't get anything from me.

36
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:22,978
I'm sleepy. I want to go back.

37
00:06:45,058 --> 00:06:46,258
I'm here to pick up the pastries.

38
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,178
The pastries are packed.

39
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:57,338
Actually, the police station is close by.

40
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:58,938
Bo can deliver them.

41
00:06:59,258 --> 00:07:00,298
Right, Bo?

42
00:07:01,218 --> 00:07:02,538
Yes.

43
00:07:02,618 --> 00:07:03,618
Come on, Bo.

44
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:05,738
Okay, Miss Mu.

45
00:07:05,818 --> 00:07:08,298
I'll get back to work
in the kitchen first.

46
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:09,458
Okay.

47
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:14,418
I also include some new pastries.

48
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:17,658
Please ask your friends
for their opinions.

49
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,698
I want to know if men like them.

50
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:22,018
Uh, my friend is a woman.

51
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:23,258
Oh, is that so?

52
00:07:23,898 --> 00:07:25,938
Thinking it was Valentine's Day today,

53
00:07:26,018 --> 00:07:28,698
I thought it was a male friend.

54
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:32,618
I don't have many friends.

55
00:07:32,698 --> 00:07:34,298
But I do have one.

56
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:37,298
I'll bring her to your shop
when I have time.

57
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:43,978
Yes, Captain.

58
00:07:44,058 --> 00:07:45,178
Where are you, Vita?

59
00:07:45,658 --> 00:07:46,938
At Miss Mu's shop.

60
00:07:47,018 --> 00:07:48,138
It's not even seven yet.

61
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,698
Do we have training this morning?

62
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:51,938
There's been an emergency,
come to the crime scene now!

63
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:53,178
I'll send you the location.

64
00:07:53,938 --> 00:07:54,778
Yes, sir.

65
00:07:56,618 --> 00:07:57,818
Miss Mu,

66
00:07:58,218 --> 00:07:59,818
I have an urgent task.

67
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:01,458
Then

68
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:03,218
I'll have to leave
these pastries here first.

69
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:07,018
But if they're left for too long,
they might lose their taste.

70
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,138
How about this?

71
00:08:09,618 --> 00:08:13,698
Please deliver the pastries
to my friend.

72
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:15,018
Sure.

73
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:17,898
I'm sure your friend will like them.

74
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,818
Wait a moment.
I'll send you the address.

75
00:08:23,538 --> 00:08:27,058
Primo Condominium, Unit 1405.

76
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:31,738
Primo Condominium, Unit 1405.

77
00:08:34,378 --> 00:08:35,538
The same address.

78
00:08:40,618 --> 00:08:43,738
(Xin: I made snacks. Come if you're free.
Or I can send them to your workplace.)

79
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,778
Officer Vita.

80
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:50,738
Yes.

81
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:04,778
(Unit 1405, Primo Condominium)

82
00:10:10,378 --> 00:10:11,218
Vita,

83
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:13,578
you know Miss Xin, right?

84
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:14,938
Yes.

85
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,178
Actually, Vita is quite tough.

86
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:19,618
The victim

87
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:21,138
is not only someone she knew

88
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,898
but also her good friend.

89
00:10:23,338 --> 00:10:25,418
But she can still control her emotions.

90
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:28,778
Has anyone touched the body?

91
00:10:29,138 --> 00:10:31,058
The first person who discovered
the body was Mr. Sen.

92
00:10:34,298 --> 00:10:35,098
Vita,

93
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:38,258
he didn't say a word

94
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,098
since we arrived.

95
00:10:44,098 --> 00:10:45,818
He said he only wants to see you.

96
00:11:03,338 --> 00:11:04,738
Xin is dead.

97
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:09,978
Xin is dead, Vita.

98
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:17,778
Sen,

99
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:23,698
I know you're grieving right now.

100
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:29,538
But what we need to do now

101
00:11:30,378 --> 00:11:32,418
is to find the killer.

102
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:37,538
But you're the only one

103
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,218
who can help us.

104
00:11:41,938 --> 00:11:42,898
So

105
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:44,218
please calm down.

106
00:11:44,298 --> 00:11:46,858
Then tell me exactly what happened.

107
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,418
She sent me a message
at 10 p.m. last night.

108
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:08,578
(Help. Someone's after me. I'm at...)

109
00:12:08,658 --> 00:12:10,338
But by the time I saw it,
it was already 5 a.m.

110
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:14,698
I quickly drove here
and kept calling her on the way.

111
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:16,458
But her phone was turned off.

112
00:12:18,578 --> 00:12:20,658
When I arrived,
I noticed the door lock was broken.

113
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:22,738
So I went inside.

114
00:12:30,378 --> 00:12:31,298
And that was when I found Xin.

115
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:33,138
But looking at the messages she sent,

116
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,698
her message wasn't complete, right?

117
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:39,218
But how did you know

118
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:40,938
it's this place?

119
00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:48,418
Although Xin has several condominiums,

120
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,658
this is her favorite one

121
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,298
because it's quiet

122
00:12:55,898 --> 00:12:56,978
and very private.

123
00:12:57,378 --> 00:12:59,138
So not many people know about it.

124
00:12:59,218 --> 00:13:01,138
What was the condition of the room

125
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:03,058
when you arrived here?

126
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:05,258
It's just as you see it.

127
00:13:05,338 --> 00:13:07,138
I didn't touch anything.

128
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,698
I just lifted the towel
to see what happened.

129
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:13,818
Can you tell me specifically
how she was covered by the towel?

130
00:13:16,498 --> 00:13:18,418
Was it messily draped over

131
00:13:19,738 --> 00:13:21,578
or neatly arranged?

132
00:13:39,258 --> 00:13:40,418
It was neatly arranged

133
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:45,658
as if someone was trying
to hide a secret.

134
00:14:19,138 --> 00:14:20,058
(Yes, Uncle Han?)

135
00:14:20,138 --> 00:14:20,938
Hey, Ning.

136
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:23,378
I found a suspicious item.

137
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,818
Possibly a tool used in the crime.

138
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:31,258
Are you okay?

139
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,338
I'm fine.

140
00:14:34,898 --> 00:14:36,298
Maybe it's just a bit cold here.

141
00:14:37,658 --> 00:14:39,698
The bedroom only has personal belongings

142
00:14:40,058 --> 00:14:42,258
and there are only decorations outside.

143
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:44,858
She was probably spending the night,

144
00:14:44,938 --> 00:14:46,458
not staying here permanently.

145
00:15:06,978 --> 00:15:09,298
Have you been to a murder scene before?

146
00:15:09,938 --> 00:15:10,978
This is the first time.

147
00:15:12,418 --> 00:15:13,418
What did you see?

148
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:16,818
- These clothes inside...
- Wait a moment.

149
00:15:18,898 --> 00:15:20,658
Don't jump to conclusions just yet.

150
00:15:20,738 --> 00:15:22,298
We need to take everything into account.

151
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:31,378
Work suits.

152
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:33,058
Coats.

153
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:34,658
Dresses.

154
00:15:35,098 --> 00:15:36,098
As for the fourth wardrobe...

155
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:38,898
What clothes did it use to contain?

156
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:41,218
Possibly belonged to someone.

157
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:42,818
But they were taken away

158
00:15:43,498 --> 00:15:44,658
after the murder.

159
00:15:45,938 --> 00:15:46,618
Uh-huh.

160
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:49,978
Okay.

161
00:15:51,058 --> 00:15:52,698
Now let's talk about the evidence.

162
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:54,578
Remember, Vita.

163
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:57,378
As you're analyzing,

164
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,618
I want you to look for evidence
at the same time.

165
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:01,578
Or new leads.

166
00:16:02,538 --> 00:16:03,898
Such as smells.

167
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:06,178
Mixed with the scent of men's cologne.

168
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,458
That was what I wanted to tell you
from the beginning, Captain.

169
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:15,058
But you interrupted me before that.

170
00:16:15,578 --> 00:16:16,778
There might be two people

171
00:16:17,298 --> 00:16:18,778
who hung their clothes here.

172
00:16:19,298 --> 00:16:21,858
But I haven't said
how many people in total.

173
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:23,658
I just pointed out

174
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:26,978
that the fourth wardrobe
has the scent of men's cologne.

175
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:29,618
Vita,

176
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:33,338
don't let your imagination

177
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:35,218
dominate the evidence.

178
00:16:36,178 --> 00:16:37,618
You made conclusions too early.

179
00:16:38,218 --> 00:16:40,018
But I'm still collecting evidence.

180
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:43,218
That's where I feel

181
00:16:43,578 --> 00:16:45,498
you're not thorough enough in your work.

182
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:50,218
Don't let your feelings dominate
the evidence,

183
00:16:51,138 --> 00:16:52,058
understand?

184
00:16:53,898 --> 00:16:55,058
You can leave now.

185
00:17:06,898 --> 00:17:07,618
Ning.

186
00:17:08,898 --> 00:17:09,938
Yes, sir?

187
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:13,378
There's a scent in the wardrobe.

188
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,658
Could you smell it and tell me
which perfume it is?

189
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:19,418
Sure.

190
00:17:24,098 --> 00:17:27,378
(Kate DiCamillo
"The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane")

191
00:17:30,538 --> 00:17:32,018
Did you just ask Ning
to smell the scent?

192
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,258
Don't be surprised, Vita.

193
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:38,218
He has honed this skill over decades.

194
00:17:38,898 --> 00:17:40,018
Well, he relies on cross-dressing.

195
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:42,338
Don't undermine me, Da.

196
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:44,178
I'm investigating a case here.

197
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:45,338
Can you be more serious?

198
00:17:45,658 --> 00:17:47,018
Of course,

199
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:47,978
beauty.

200
00:17:48,178 --> 00:17:49,458
What is it?

201
00:17:50,298 --> 00:17:51,418
What's your problem?

202
00:17:53,858 --> 00:17:54,658
It's not funny.

203
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:56,498
Sorry, sir.

204
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:57,738
He started it.

205
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:00,618
I had a whiff just now.

206
00:18:00,698 --> 00:18:01,298
I think

207
00:18:01,378 --> 00:18:03,338
the scent is very unique.

208
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:07,498
I'm certain it can't be found in stores.

209
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:11,418
I believe some substance has been added

210
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:14,578
to make the scent so long-lasting.

211
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:17,178
It's pretty hard to guess.

212
00:18:18,578 --> 00:18:21,578
If I smell more ingredients,
I might be able to guess which it is.

213
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,738
I think I've smelled this fragrance
somewhere before.

214
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:28,218
Where?

215
00:18:31,218 --> 00:18:32,778
I can't remember where.

216
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:36,538
You should go and search in the market

217
00:18:36,618 --> 00:18:39,338
to see if you can identify the perfume.

218
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,138
Okay.

219
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:40,778
Da.

220
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:41,458
Yes?

221
00:18:41,698 --> 00:18:44,418
Send all the evidence from this room

222
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,098
to the forensic department.

223
00:18:46,218 --> 00:18:46,858
Yes, sir.

224
00:18:46,938 --> 00:18:47,778
And as for you,

225
00:18:49,418 --> 00:18:51,418
let me know when you figure out.

226
00:19:05,898 --> 00:19:07,218
The forensic team has confirmed

227
00:19:07,298 --> 00:19:10,338
that the time of death
was between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.

228
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:13,178
What about the surveillance footage?

229
00:19:15,898 --> 00:19:16,778
There's none.

230
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:20,618
To protect the residents' privacy.

231
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,258
You know,
those wealthy people's privileges.

232
00:19:26,618 --> 00:19:27,698
At the crime scene,

233
00:19:27,778 --> 00:19:31,098
there were no fingerprints
or shoe prints.

234
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:34,498
It shows that someone cleaned up
the scene after the crime.

235
00:19:38,618 --> 00:19:40,218
What about the social connections
of the victim?

236
00:19:41,298 --> 00:19:42,658
The victim, Miss Xin.

237
00:19:42,738 --> 00:19:44,178
Age 27. Daughter of the former Chairman

238
00:19:44,258 --> 00:19:47,778
of Zaiyongdanacai Group.

239
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:50,818
She was also the niece
of the current Chairman.

240
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,858
Three years ago,
she returned to Thailand.

241
00:19:53,938 --> 00:19:56,098
In the business field,

242
00:19:56,178 --> 00:19:57,418
she was exceptionally talented.

243
00:19:57,498 --> 00:19:59,938
She not only had great business skills,
but she was also, most importantly,

244
00:20:00,018 --> 00:20:01,298
she was very beautiful.

245
00:20:03,098 --> 00:20:03,938
Sorry.

246
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:07,858
The current Chairman is Mr. Jianggan.

247
00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:10,898
(Jianggan, Chairman of Zaiyongdanacai Group)
Age 65.

248
00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:12,698
And he's Miss Xin's uncle.

249
00:20:13,098 --> 00:20:15,058
Let's go back 20 years,

250
00:20:15,138 --> 00:20:16,298
when his older brother,

251
00:20:16,378 --> 00:20:17,978
Miss Xin's father,

252
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:20,458
committed suicide
under mysterious circumstances.

253
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:22,978
At that time, public opinion

254
00:20:23,058 --> 00:20:24,778
pointed to Jianggan,

255
00:20:25,218 --> 00:20:27,338
suspecting that he was behind it.

256
00:20:27,418 --> 00:20:28,658
But there was no concrete evidence
to prove it.

257
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:30,058
So the case was left unresolved.

258
00:20:30,618 --> 00:20:31,618
At that time,

259
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:34,338
a 7-year-old girl was left behind,
that is Miss Xin.

260
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,298
Later, Mr. Jianggan adopted Miss Xin.

261
00:20:38,978 --> 00:20:41,418
And it should be noted
that he doted on her very much.

262
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:43,898
When Miss Xin returned to Thailand,

263
00:20:43,978 --> 00:20:46,178
she took on many important positions.

264
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:50,698
Now Mr. Jianggan
rarely goes to the office

265
00:20:50,778 --> 00:20:53,618
as he has entrusted
most of the business to Mr. Yudacai,

266
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:56,618
who is his son-in-law.

267
00:20:56,698 --> 00:20:57,738
Age 31.

268
00:20:58,338 --> 00:21:02,578
He's currently the financial director
of Zaiyongdanacai Group.

269
00:21:03,018 --> 00:21:05,498
Initially, he held a small position
in the company.

270
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:09,018
But after marrying the daughter
of this family, Miss Sichun,

271
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,058
he quickly rose to his current position.

272
00:21:12,778 --> 00:21:15,578
It must be said that he is very capable,

273
00:21:16,098 --> 00:21:17,978
smooth-tongued, and skilled.

274
00:21:18,818 --> 00:21:20,898
In the upper-class circles,
there's a rumor

275
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:22,818
that Miss Sichun

276
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:24,338
and Miss Xin

277
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:26,018
didn't get along with each other.

278
00:21:26,098 --> 00:21:27,258
It's said

279
00:21:27,338 --> 00:21:30,658
during family anniversary events,

280
00:21:30,738 --> 00:21:33,938
they never appear together
and never take a group photo.

281
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:39,218
In the evening,

282
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,818
(Si Chon, eldest daughter of Zaiyongdanacai family)
I returned to my room to rest.

283
00:21:40,818 --> 00:21:41,418
(Si Chon, eldest daughter of Zaiyongdanacai family)

284
00:21:41,418 --> 00:21:44,538
(Si Chon, eldest daughter of Zaiyongdanacai family)
The maid and the butler can testify to that.

285
00:21:44,978 --> 00:21:47,098
But your cousin met
with an unfortunate fate.

286
00:21:47,178 --> 00:21:48,098
Aren't you upset?

287
00:21:48,938 --> 00:21:50,458
Why should I be upset?

288
00:21:51,098 --> 00:21:52,538
We don't know

289
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:55,218
what dirty things
she did behind our backs.

290
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,818
My father kindly took her in
and raised her.

291
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:00,498
He treated her like his own daughter.

292
00:22:00,578 --> 00:22:01,858
But only when she grew up

293
00:22:02,618 --> 00:22:04,498
did we realize
she was an ungrateful person.

294
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:06,178
And that's not all.

295
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:09,458
Father even helped erase
the stain on the family name for her.

296
00:22:10,978 --> 00:22:12,298
But she showed no gratitude.

297
00:22:14,498 --> 00:22:15,898
It's possible

298
00:22:16,578 --> 00:22:18,458
for a woman like that

299
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:19,698
to be targeted

300
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,618
for revenge or even murdered

301
00:22:23,778 --> 00:22:25,138
because of an affair.

302
00:22:25,538 --> 00:22:26,818
Why would you think that?

303
00:22:29,378 --> 00:22:30,418
I despise her.

304
00:22:33,698 --> 00:22:35,258
Only a woman

305
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:36,698
can understand.

306
00:22:38,098 --> 00:22:40,738
If she was killed because of an affair,

307
00:22:41,578 --> 00:22:42,978
I wouldn't be surprised.

308
00:22:43,898 --> 00:22:45,538
After all, that kind of woman

309
00:22:45,658 --> 00:22:48,578
only knows how to use men

310
00:22:50,258 --> 00:22:51,938
to achieve her goals.

311
00:22:52,778 --> 00:22:53,818
And men,

312
00:22:53,898 --> 00:22:54,858
they're fools,

313
00:22:54,938 --> 00:22:56,578
falling into the traps
set by beautiful women.

314
00:23:01,258 --> 00:23:02,178
Oh,

315
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:06,218
I want to remind you of one more thing.

316
00:23:06,658 --> 00:23:08,178
If you have any questions,

317
00:23:08,898 --> 00:23:10,618
ask us directly.

318
00:23:10,698 --> 00:23:11,978
Don't go to my father.

319
00:23:13,138 --> 00:23:15,018
I don't want you to bother him.

320
00:23:15,098 --> 00:23:17,058
He's already devastated

321
00:23:18,418 --> 00:23:20,218
by Xin's death.

322
00:23:21,178 --> 00:23:24,738
If I find out that any of you

323
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:28,058
worsened his health condition,

324
00:23:29,498 --> 00:23:31,018
I'll definitely file a complaint
at the police station

325
00:23:31,898 --> 00:23:33,858
and make each and every one of you pay.

326
00:23:36,978 --> 00:23:38,538
Next is Mr. Jiangkai,

327
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:41,578
he's the eldest son of this family.

328
00:23:42,018 --> 00:23:43,338
Age 38.

329
00:23:43,418 --> 00:23:45,858
He's currently serving
as the CEO of the group.

330
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,338
But he lacks business acumen

331
00:23:48,418 --> 00:23:51,858
and is always manipulated like a pawn.

332
00:23:52,258 --> 00:23:53,338
Let's take a look at the next person,

333
00:23:53,418 --> 00:23:54,498
Ms. Jindapa.

334
00:23:55,138 --> 00:23:56,578
She's Mr. Jiangkai's wife.

335
00:23:57,098 --> 00:24:01,338
She often manages Mr. Jiangkai's
subordinates and servants.

336
00:24:01,418 --> 00:24:03,618
After I returned home,
I read a book for a while.

337
00:24:03,698 --> 00:24:06,658
(Jintapa, sister-in-law of Zaiyongdanacai family)
I fell asleep around 10 p.m. that night.

338
00:24:07,258 --> 00:24:08,698
Do you remember

339
00:24:09,178 --> 00:24:10,538
what time did your husband come home

340
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:13,698
on the night of the incident?

341
00:24:15,658 --> 00:24:17,338
Lately, I have had trouble sleeping.

342
00:24:17,778 --> 00:24:19,138
The doctor prescribed medication for me.

343
00:24:19,218 --> 00:24:20,978
So I sleep soundly.

344
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:25,418
But Jiangkai has been working overtime
at the company lately.

345
00:24:25,858 --> 00:24:27,138
He's quite busy with work

346
00:24:27,218 --> 00:24:28,698
and only returns home very late.

347
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,658
So I really don't know.

348
00:24:35,218 --> 00:24:36,738
I think he's out to play golf today.

349
00:24:36,818 --> 00:24:38,418
I guess he'll come back quite early.

350
00:24:38,498 --> 00:24:41,058
You can ask him when he comes back.

351
00:24:41,138 --> 00:24:41,818
Okay.

352
00:24:52,218 --> 00:24:53,138
Hello.

353
00:24:53,538 --> 00:24:54,178
Hello.

354
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:56,738
These police officers are here
to inquire about the case.

355
00:24:57,178 --> 00:24:59,738
Just cooperate with them.

356
00:24:59,818 --> 00:25:02,338
So your sister's case can be resolved
as soon as possible.

357
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,298
Mr. Jiangkai,

358
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:04,578
I'd like to ask you.

359
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:08,418
Can you tell me what you did
on the night of the incident?

360
00:25:09,178 --> 00:25:11,858
(Kieng Krai, eldest son of Zaiyongdanacai family)
I probably left work after 3 a.m. that night.

361
00:25:11,938 --> 00:25:14,018
There is surveillance in the office.

362
00:25:14,098 --> 00:25:16,018
You can retrieve the footage
as evidence.

363
00:25:23,378 --> 00:25:24,578
Here's your vegetable juice.

364
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:29,618
Drinking vegetable juice
after exercise helps detoxify the body.

365
00:25:34,538 --> 00:25:36,498
Actually, she's just a distant relative.

366
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:38,658
I'm not very close to her.

367
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:43,058
Excuse me for a while.

368
00:25:45,178 --> 00:25:45,818
Hello?

369
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:48,498
What did you say?

370
00:25:49,098 --> 00:25:50,138
Are you crazy?

371
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:51,898
Hey.

372
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:54,458
I'll come over later.

373
00:25:58,258 --> 00:25:59,618
Sorry, officers.

374
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,458
There's an urgent matter at the office.

375
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:02,858
I have to deal with it quickly.

376
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:06,298
You can make an appointment
if you need my statement.

377
00:26:11,498 --> 00:26:14,098
Jiangkai is not capable
of doing business.

378
00:26:14,578 --> 00:26:17,618
He always wants me
to give him advice on everything.

379
00:26:18,098 --> 00:26:19,498
Unlike Xin,

380
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:21,418
she...

381
00:26:21,858 --> 00:26:24,018
she has had a strong personality
since childhood.

382
00:26:24,378 --> 00:26:27,338
Ever since our father brought
her back to this family,

383
00:26:28,858 --> 00:26:31,258
I truly doted on her.

384
00:26:37,258 --> 00:26:38,378
Take this tissue.

385
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,978
Officers, I would like to inquire

386
00:26:48,378 --> 00:26:49,978
about her body.

387
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:52,778
When can we bring her back
for the funeral ceremony?

388
00:26:52,858 --> 00:26:56,458
I want to bury her beside her parents.

389
00:26:58,458 --> 00:26:59,578
As for the last person,

390
00:27:00,178 --> 00:27:00,978
Mr. Sen.

391
00:27:01,818 --> 00:27:04,018
He's the youngest child of this family

392
00:27:04,098 --> 00:27:06,858
and the closest to this cousin,

393
00:27:06,938 --> 00:27:09,098
even better than his own sister,
Miss Sichun.

394
00:27:09,578 --> 00:27:11,938
The only thing he is interested in

395
00:27:12,018 --> 00:27:12,858
is women.

396
00:27:17,578 --> 00:27:18,218
Vita,

397
00:27:19,378 --> 00:27:20,938
any thoughts?

398
00:27:35,378 --> 00:27:37,938
I'm focusing on the people close
to the deceased

399
00:27:39,578 --> 00:27:40,378
because,

400
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:41,498
firstly,

401
00:27:42,418 --> 00:27:43,738
Xin was an intelligent person.

402
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,738
So the question is,

403
00:27:47,218 --> 00:27:50,138
why did she send a message to Sen

404
00:27:50,578 --> 00:27:52,178
instead of calling the police?

405
00:27:52,258 --> 00:27:53,018
(Help. Someone's after me. I'm at...)
Unless

406
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:55,738
she didn't want the police
to get involved

407
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:58,058
because the culprit
is someone close to her.

408
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:00,058
Secondly,

409
00:28:00,618 --> 00:28:02,778
repeatedly slashing the victim
with a knife

410
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:05,738
was not just about killing the victim.

411
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:08,658
(It might represent
some kind of hatred.)

412
00:28:09,018 --> 00:28:09,738
Thirdly,

413
00:28:09,818 --> 00:28:11,898
covering the body with a towel
in a dignified manner

414
00:28:11,978 --> 00:28:13,738
after brutally killing the victim

415
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:15,858
can be explained as

416
00:28:15,938 --> 00:28:17,858
the killer possibly feeling sorry
for the victim

417
00:28:17,938 --> 00:28:19,138
or trying to restore
the victim's dignity.

418
00:28:19,578 --> 00:28:21,298
The act of covering the body

419
00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:25,098
can be linked to the relationship
and subtle connection

420
00:28:25,178 --> 00:28:27,098
between the killer and the victim.

421
00:28:27,178 --> 00:28:29,178
Other than Miss Xin's family,

422
00:28:29,258 --> 00:28:30,418
according to my investigation,

423
00:28:30,498 --> 00:28:32,898
she did not have
any known romantic relationships.

424
00:28:34,138 --> 00:28:35,018
Could it be

425
00:28:35,858 --> 00:28:37,578
an undisclosed secret lover?

426
00:28:42,898 --> 00:28:45,018
When I entered Miss Xin's bedroom,

427
00:28:45,578 --> 00:28:47,778
there were two closets.

428
00:28:48,578 --> 00:28:50,258
One belonged to Miss Xin,

429
00:28:50,778 --> 00:28:53,578
while the other belonged
to a mysterious man.

430
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:55,618
We couldn't determine his identity.

431
00:28:55,698 --> 00:28:56,858
But he was certainly

432
00:28:56,938 --> 00:28:58,938
Miss Xin's secret lover.

433
00:29:00,978 --> 00:29:03,138
Why do we think he's her secret lover?

434
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:07,098
Perhaps they were boyfriend
and girlfriend.

435
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,698
It's already obvious.

436
00:29:08,778 --> 00:29:11,178
The condominium is far
from the city center.

437
00:29:11,258 --> 00:29:14,098
Most importantly, there are no
surveillance cameras in the building.

438
00:29:14,178 --> 00:29:17,818
I believe their relationship
must have had some hidden secrets.

439
00:29:24,658 --> 00:29:27,098
Who killed you, Xin?

440
00:29:29,498 --> 00:29:31,978
Where were you
between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. last night?

441
00:29:35,298 --> 00:29:36,218
I was asleep.

442
00:29:38,098 --> 00:29:39,498
We found a gas receipt in your car.

443
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:41,778
The time of refueling is at 11 p.m.

444
00:29:41,858 --> 00:29:44,018
I refueled the car before going home.

445
00:29:44,298 --> 00:29:46,618
Once I got home, I went straight to bed.

446
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:48,498
Mr. Sen,

447
00:29:53,618 --> 00:29:55,098
it's best if you tell the truth.

448
00:29:56,898 --> 00:29:58,898
After refueling, I went home.

449
00:29:59,578 --> 00:30:02,098
Okay, maybe I did some exercise
before going to bed.

450
00:30:02,498 --> 00:30:03,778
But from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.

451
00:30:03,858 --> 00:30:05,498
I was at home and I didn't go anywhere.

452
00:30:06,658 --> 00:30:09,018
Tell me honestly
what happened last night.

453
00:30:11,258 --> 00:30:12,618
Everything, in detail.

454
00:30:12,698 --> 00:30:14,178
Be honest with me

455
00:30:14,258 --> 00:30:15,458
and tell me everything.

456
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:17,098
- What exactly happened last night?
- Okay.

457
00:30:17,178 --> 00:30:18,538
Okay, fine.

458
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,458
I had a party at my place.

459
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:22,818
From what time to what time?

460
00:30:23,498 --> 00:30:24,698
From 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.

461
00:30:25,138 --> 00:30:27,018
Can anyone vouch for you?

462
00:30:35,338 --> 00:30:36,058
No.

463
00:30:39,618 --> 00:30:41,818
Please leave if you're only here
to talk about the case.

464
00:30:41,898 --> 00:30:44,178
I don't want our conversation
to be like this.

465
00:30:45,138 --> 00:30:47,458
What's wrong with our conversation?

466
00:30:48,338 --> 00:30:49,978
Everything we're discussing right now

467
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:54,138
is to find the killer, isn't it?

468
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:57,698
You know what? Your gaze right now

469
00:30:57,978 --> 00:30:59,658
is just like your colleagues.

470
00:31:01,258 --> 00:31:03,538
It's the look of a police officer trying

471
00:31:03,618 --> 00:31:05,058
to extract the truth from a suspect.

472
00:31:09,258 --> 00:31:11,778
I believe some substance
must have been added

473
00:31:11,858 --> 00:31:14,458
to make the scent last so long.

474
00:31:15,258 --> 00:31:18,178
Do you really think I'm a suspect
in Xin's murder?

475
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:21,618
You...

476
00:31:25,938 --> 00:31:29,258
The surveillance footage

477
00:31:29,338 --> 00:31:30,658
from Mr. Jiangkai's office

478
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:31,938
and Zaiyongdanacai family's home
can prove

479
00:31:32,018 --> 00:31:32,858
that neither Jiangkai, Jindapa,

480
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:34,378
nor Jianggan

481
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:37,218
is a suspect in the murder of Miss Xin.

482
00:31:37,618 --> 00:31:38,618
However,

483
00:31:38,698 --> 00:31:41,378
we need Mr. Sen's statement
to conclude this. Vita isn't here yet.

484
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:44,258
We'll continue when she comes back.

485
00:31:45,298 --> 00:31:45,978
Let's continue.

486
00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:47,578
Yes, sir.

487
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:49,138
So now we're left with two individuals,

488
00:31:49,218 --> 00:31:50,298
who are Miss Sichun

489
00:31:50,378 --> 00:31:51,938
and her husband,

490
00:31:52,698 --> 00:31:53,858
Mr. Yudacai.

491
00:31:53,938 --> 00:31:57,418
Currently, both of them
are still under suspicion.

492
00:31:58,338 --> 00:31:59,978
Speaking of Miss Sichun,

493
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:02,778
despite rumors of her bad temper,

494
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,258
after taking her statement,

495
00:32:05,338 --> 00:32:07,298
we found out
that she's a very filial daughter.

496
00:32:07,378 --> 00:32:08,858
She even threatened us and said,

497
00:32:08,938 --> 00:32:11,018
if her father's health deteriorates
because of this case,

498
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:12,858
she'll make a scene
at the police station.

499
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:17,858
This contradicts the image
of her being unreasonably hot-tempered.

500
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:19,778
As for Mr. Yudacai,

501
00:32:19,858 --> 00:32:22,178
although we haven't interrogated him yet,

502
00:32:22,258 --> 00:32:24,178
there is substantial evidence indicating

503
00:32:24,258 --> 00:32:24,978
that he was not at the crime scene.

504
00:32:25,058 --> 00:32:27,738
Through our questioning
of his secretary,

505
00:32:27,818 --> 00:32:32,058
Ming and I learned that he was away
on the morning of the incident.

506
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,898
At this time,
his plane would have landed.

507
00:32:36,978 --> 00:32:38,658
Ning has gone to the airport
to pick him up

508
00:32:38,738 --> 00:32:40,298
and bring him back
to the police station for questioning.

509
00:32:42,058 --> 00:32:43,258
(Police Investigators Team)

510
00:32:43,346 --> 00:32:44,066
Well, it's like this.

511
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:47,378
(Yuthachai, eldest daughter's husband)
The company had this important client

512
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:50,018
who wanted me to fly abroad
to discuss some cooperation.

513
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:51,458
I asked

514
00:32:51,818 --> 00:32:53,098
my secretary

515
00:32:53,178 --> 00:32:56,498
to arrange this flight two weeks ago.

516
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:57,858
So

517
00:32:57,938 --> 00:33:01,178
I really don't understand
why you brought me here.

518
00:33:01,618 --> 00:33:04,138
If you have so much time,
you should be looking for the killer

519
00:33:04,618 --> 00:33:06,338
instead of harassing me
and wasting time.

520
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:07,658
It's simply unnecessary.

521
00:33:14,978 --> 00:33:17,178
I have questioned his secretary.

522
00:33:17,898 --> 00:33:19,458
He was telling the truth, sir.

523
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:24,578
The flight was booked 14 days prior
as he said.

524
00:33:26,378 --> 00:33:27,818
Let him go home, Ning.

525
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:29,018
Mr. Yudacai, this routine inquiry

526
00:33:29,098 --> 00:33:31,458
is only part of the procedure.

527
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:33,458
However,

528
00:33:33,898 --> 00:33:35,098
we apologize
for any inconvenience caused today.

529
00:33:36,218 --> 00:33:37,658
That's all for today.

530
00:33:37,738 --> 00:33:38,698
You can go home now.

531
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:48,898
(Monitoring Room)

532
00:33:53,858 --> 00:33:54,618
Captain,

533
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:56,978
I found the scent of the perfume
in the wardrobe.

534
00:34:00,818 --> 00:34:03,698
Xin gave this perfume to me
on my birthday last year.

535
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:05,498
Is there any problem?

536
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:09,258
The same perfume scent

537
00:34:10,778 --> 00:34:13,458
was also found in the victim's wardrobe
at the crime scene.

538
00:34:13,978 --> 00:34:18,618
Unless you have an alibi for last night,

539
00:34:19,738 --> 00:34:22,018
you're currently the prime suspect.

540
00:34:22,698 --> 00:34:25,138
I already mentioned
that I was drunk and passed out.

541
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,058
Xin personally selected

542
00:34:27,338 --> 00:34:28,498
this fragrance.

543
00:34:28,578 --> 00:34:30,298
And it was customized exclusively
for me.

544
00:34:32,978 --> 00:34:35,178
When she gave me the perfume,

545
00:34:35,258 --> 00:34:37,938
she said she would only give it
to someone she trusted and loved.

546
00:34:38,018 --> 00:34:40,178
I can guarantee
that within the Zaiyongdanacai family,

547
00:34:40,258 --> 00:34:42,018
I'm the only one who has this perfume.

548
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:44,098
I don't know what you have discovered.

549
00:34:44,738 --> 00:34:46,618
But I'm sure you got the wrong person.

550
00:34:53,938 --> 00:34:55,618
I found the woman from the bar.

551
00:35:03,738 --> 00:35:05,218
I also obtained some new information.

552
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:07,818
After the party ended last night,

553
00:35:08,298 --> 00:35:09,698
you took a female model home.

554
00:35:10,538 --> 00:35:13,418
I just don't understand

555
00:35:13,498 --> 00:35:15,218
why you didn't let her testify for you.

556
00:35:17,098 --> 00:35:19,178
Why didn't you tell us honestly?

557
00:35:20,058 --> 00:35:21,898
Do you really want
to go to jail that badly?

558
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:32,098
Okay.

559
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,898
I just didn't want to mention this
in front of Vita, that's all.

560
00:35:40,298 --> 00:35:41,818
Are you satisfied now, Captain Pla?

561
00:35:46,698 --> 00:35:48,058
You can go now.

562
00:35:59,898 --> 00:36:01,698
Then I'm going to take a break.

563
00:36:24,538 --> 00:36:26,578
(Vita: I'll be home late tonight.)

564
00:36:30,978 --> 00:36:32,258
(Hello, Vita.)

565
00:36:32,338 --> 00:36:34,458
(Oh, I wanted to tell you)

566
00:36:34,538 --> 00:36:36,338
that I'll be home late today too.

567
00:36:36,418 --> 00:36:38,378
I'm meeting some friends.

568
00:36:38,818 --> 00:36:42,658
(Just letting you know
so you won't ask me when I'll be home.)

569
00:36:43,218 --> 00:36:44,618
Be careful on your way home.

570
00:36:46,818 --> 00:36:47,778
Bro...

571
00:36:49,338 --> 00:36:51,218
Are you okay, Vita?

572
00:36:51,298 --> 00:36:53,098
(Did someone bully you?)

573
00:36:53,738 --> 00:36:54,658
Wasu,

574
00:36:55,698 --> 00:36:57,538
I'm not a child anymore.

575
00:36:58,018 --> 00:36:59,458
(So what happened?)

576
00:36:59,538 --> 00:37:02,498
The last time you called me "brother"

577
00:37:02,578 --> 00:37:04,618
was on our parents' death anniversary.

578
00:37:05,178 --> 00:37:07,858
I wasn't there with you at that time.

579
00:37:08,538 --> 00:37:10,138
(It's about Xin's case.)

580
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:13,098
(You warned me not to get involved
with their family.)

581
00:37:14,338 --> 00:37:15,898
And now their daughter is dead.

582
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:21,218
Wasu.

583
00:37:22,258 --> 00:37:23,018
Wasu!

584
00:37:24,138 --> 00:37:25,618
Do you need me to come
and accompany you?

585
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:27,778
It's okay.

586
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:30,138
You can get back to what you were doing.

587
00:37:39,138 --> 00:37:40,138
(Message from Xin)
(Vita,)

588
00:37:40,618 --> 00:37:42,698
(I made some snacks.)

589
00:37:42,778 --> 00:37:45,258
(If you're free, come over and have some.)

590
00:37:45,338 --> 00:37:47,698
(Or I could send them over
to your workplace.)

591
00:38:00,338 --> 00:38:01,058
Coach.

592
00:38:02,858 --> 00:38:04,218
We might get off late tonight.

593
00:38:05,018 --> 00:38:06,778
It might be the same tomorrow too.

594
00:38:07,738 --> 00:38:10,218
But investigating the case involving
someone you know,

595
00:38:10,778 --> 00:38:12,338
are you okay with it?

596
00:38:13,538 --> 00:38:14,538
I'm okay.

597
00:38:16,738 --> 00:38:17,458
I understand

598
00:38:17,538 --> 00:38:20,738
we have to sacrifice a lot
as police officers.

599
00:38:22,778 --> 00:38:24,378
I'll get back to work now.

600
00:38:46,138 --> 00:38:48,898
Don't worry too much about Mr. Sen.

601
00:38:49,698 --> 00:38:51,178
He was just fooling around
with those women.

602
00:38:51,858 --> 00:38:53,138
It was nothing serious.

603
00:38:54,578 --> 00:38:55,858
He even said,

604
00:38:56,298 --> 00:38:57,978
even if he was with those women,

605
00:38:58,498 --> 00:39:00,178
he still thinks about you.

606
00:39:01,418 --> 00:39:02,858
What do you mean?

607
00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:05,498
You look quite worried.

608
00:39:05,578 --> 00:39:07,698
I was afraid you might be affected
by Mr. Sen and overthink it.

609
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,338
I don't really understand

610
00:39:09,778 --> 00:39:11,178
and I'm not interested.

611
00:39:12,698 --> 00:39:15,818
I think you should spend
more time studying the case

612
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:18,618
than engaging in meaningless gossip
about your colleague.

613
00:39:34,618 --> 00:39:36,498
Uncle Asa is Xin's father.

614
00:39:36,738 --> 00:39:39,418
At that time,
he faced financial pressure.

615
00:39:39,498 --> 00:39:42,898
And because of his wrong decisions,
the company went bankrupt.

616
00:39:43,658 --> 00:39:45,738
Feeling helpless,
he chose to commit suicide.

617
00:39:52,498 --> 00:39:54,178
As for Uncle's business,

618
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:55,858
my father took over
and rebuilt the business,

619
00:39:56,498 --> 00:39:58,258
leading to our current success.

620
00:39:59,138 --> 00:40:02,458
The rumors about our family fighting
for inheritance

621
00:40:03,658 --> 00:40:04,898
are just slanderous remarks.

622
00:40:05,538 --> 00:40:06,778
My father and Uncle Asa

623
00:40:06,858 --> 00:40:08,338
have a good relationship.

624
00:40:10,778 --> 00:40:13,698
Xin's mother was devastated
by the accident.

625
00:40:14,138 --> 00:40:15,218
Soon after that,

626
00:40:15,298 --> 00:40:18,258
she decisively followed her husband.

627
00:40:18,978 --> 00:40:22,418
That was when my father took Xin in
and raised her as his own daughter.

628
00:40:23,218 --> 00:40:24,498
But Xin didn't seem

629
00:40:24,578 --> 00:40:26,498
very happy about it.

630
00:40:27,178 --> 00:40:31,138
Only Sen and Xin were close
in our family.

631
00:40:31,218 --> 00:40:35,098
Everyone praises my father
for saving the company

632
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,898
and kindly adopting Xin.

633
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:42,098
But I think it might be just
a superficial gesture my father made.

634
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:44,698
He sent all the other children
to study in the UK

635
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:47,978
but he left Xin in Thailand.

636
00:40:48,418 --> 00:40:51,378
She could only apply for scholarships
to study in the United States.

637
00:40:51,938 --> 00:40:52,938
To be fair,

638
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:55,098
my father treated her well,

639
00:40:55,738 --> 00:40:58,498
providing her with the best education.

640
00:40:59,378 --> 00:41:02,098
But Xin knew it was my father's money,

641
00:41:02,178 --> 00:41:03,938
and she was hesitant to accept it.

642
00:41:04,738 --> 00:41:07,418
She was a stubborn child

643
00:41:07,818 --> 00:41:10,018
and never showed weakness to anyone.

644
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:12,378
After all, she has faced hardships
since childhood.

645
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:15,498
Xin graduated with an honors degree
in Management Studies.

646
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,818
But my father assigned her

647
00:41:18,218 --> 00:41:20,498
to work
in the Design Development Department.

648
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,258
Don't you find that strange?

649
00:41:22,338 --> 00:41:24,218
When she returned after graduation,

650
00:41:24,298 --> 00:41:27,738
my father assigned a high position
to her at the company.

651
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,338
It was a significant leap in her life.

652
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:34,778
After that, Xin wanted to move out.

653
00:41:35,898 --> 00:41:38,098
Not long after that,
she created her own brand.

654
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:40,138
Before she moved out,

655
00:41:40,218 --> 00:41:42,298
were there any unpleasant incidents?

656
00:41:42,978 --> 00:41:46,098
Minor quarrels and disagreements
were inevitable.

657
00:41:47,418 --> 00:41:50,178
But before she moved out,

658
00:41:51,018 --> 00:41:52,418
I overheard something by chance.

659
00:41:52,498 --> 00:41:53,738
But don't worry.

660
00:41:54,978 --> 00:41:57,538
I don't think they can trace it back to you.

661
00:41:58,658 --> 00:42:01,058
Let's suspend our plans for now.

662
00:42:01,498 --> 00:42:05,218
Besides, our relationship
has reached this point,

663
00:42:06,338 --> 00:42:07,858
don't you trust me?

664
00:42:08,898 --> 00:42:10,458
I don't know what's the reason.

665
00:42:10,538 --> 00:42:14,338
But she had always resented us
and had gone to such lengths to hurt us.

666
00:42:15,338 --> 00:42:16,658
Sir,

667
00:42:16,738 --> 00:42:20,498
I've never mentioned this
to anyone in my family.

668
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:25,898
I hope it can be of use to you
in finding the real killer soon.

669
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:28,258
So Miss Xin had a secret lover

670
00:42:29,018 --> 00:42:33,298
who conspired to take control
of your family's company.

671
00:42:34,258 --> 00:42:35,218
Ms. Jindapa,

672
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:39,618
can you guess
what the "suspension of plans"

673
00:42:39,698 --> 00:42:41,498
that Xin mentioned
on the phone refers to?

674
00:42:41,898 --> 00:42:43,258
I'm also investigating that.

675
00:42:43,338 --> 00:42:45,738
But unfortunately, she died.

676
00:42:46,258 --> 00:42:50,378
Actually, Xin was a kind person.

677
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:51,818
I don't believe

678
00:42:51,898 --> 00:42:54,658
it was her idea

679
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,338
to harm us.

680
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:02,578
I think she must have been influenced
by her secret lover.

681
00:43:03,298 --> 00:43:04,618
I believe that's the case.

682
00:43:14,418 --> 00:43:15,418
How did it go, Ning?

683
00:43:52,978 --> 00:43:53,778
Put this on.

684
00:43:55,658 --> 00:43:56,698
Why?

685
00:43:57,938 --> 00:43:59,298
We haven't trained today.

686
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,298
- But it's already past 1 a.m.
- I'll wait for you outside.

687
00:44:15,618 --> 00:44:17,618
You can't run for such a short distance?

688
00:44:25,698 --> 00:44:26,658
Take it easy for a moment.

689
00:44:31,858 --> 00:44:33,458
Can I ask you something?

690
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:36,338
Why do I feel like
you're not using your intuition

691
00:44:36,418 --> 00:44:39,258
to analyze this case as you did before?

692
00:44:40,698 --> 00:44:43,418
Maybe it's because I learned it
from you, coach.

693
00:44:45,818 --> 00:44:47,098
Or maybe it's because you don't want

694
00:44:47,578 --> 00:44:49,618
to accept the results of the analysis.

695
00:44:51,538 --> 00:44:53,698
Why can the evaluation
of the same person

696
00:44:56,138 --> 00:44:58,098
vary so much?

697
00:44:59,138 --> 00:45:00,818
In Sen's eyes,

698
00:45:02,538 --> 00:45:04,658
Xin was a good sister.

699
00:45:05,938 --> 00:45:08,058
But in the eyes of other family members,

700
00:45:10,658 --> 00:45:13,378
she was someone
who stopped at nothing for revenge

701
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:15,178
and was an ungrateful person.

702
00:45:18,338 --> 00:45:20,258
Humans have many faces, Vita.

703
00:45:22,338 --> 00:45:24,578
But it was simply impossible

704
00:45:25,618 --> 00:45:27,138
for Xin to have an illicit affair.

705
00:45:29,698 --> 00:45:32,498
"Why" is the only word in my mind now.

706
00:45:33,578 --> 00:45:35,778
Why can't I analyze anything?

707
00:45:37,578 --> 00:45:40,138
Why didn't Xin confide in me?

708
00:45:41,498 --> 00:45:44,058
Why have I lost the chance
to talk to her again?

709
00:45:45,018 --> 00:45:45,858
Why?

710
00:45:48,058 --> 00:45:50,658
Because your current state of mind
is not questioning,

711
00:45:51,818 --> 00:45:53,418
it's sadness, Vita.

712
00:45:56,698 --> 00:45:59,778
You've unknowingly
let your emotions affect your work.

713
00:45:59,858 --> 00:46:01,098
I can distinguish that clearly.

714
00:46:01,178 --> 00:46:02,098
I know.

715
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:06,698
When you understand your own feelings,
you'll be able to see clearly.

716
00:46:12,658 --> 00:46:13,818
It's still hurting, right?

717
00:46:15,778 --> 00:46:16,658
Right here.

718
00:46:17,738 --> 00:46:19,258
There's a void here.

719
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:22,298
But you have to accept it, Vita.

720
00:46:24,538 --> 00:46:25,698
Because this feeling

721
00:46:25,778 --> 00:46:27,578
may stay with you for a while.

722
00:46:29,538 --> 00:46:31,578
But the things you're doing for Xin

723
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:33,898
will slowly fill that void
until it disappears.

724
00:46:36,178 --> 00:46:37,858
How did you know

725
00:46:39,298 --> 00:46:40,898
there's a void here?

726
00:46:42,578 --> 00:46:43,978
Anyone who has lost a friend

727
00:46:44,938 --> 00:46:46,298
or loved one before

728
00:46:47,698 --> 00:46:49,258
would know.

729
00:46:54,258 --> 00:46:56,258
But I hope you can vent it, Vita.

730
00:46:56,858 --> 00:46:57,938
Release that pain.

731
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:02,058
Only then can you return
to your old self and perform well.

732
00:47:10,298 --> 00:47:11,658
Calm down, Vita.

733
00:47:14,738 --> 00:47:15,338
10

734
00:47:16,378 --> 00:47:17,058
9

735
00:47:18,178 --> 00:47:18,818
8

736
00:47:19,738 --> 00:47:20,538
7

737
00:47:21,978 --> 00:47:22,778
6

738
00:47:24,538 --> 00:47:25,458
5

739
00:47:26,538 --> 00:47:27,258
4

740
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:29,138
3

741
00:47:29,938 --> 00:47:31,018
Just cry it out.

742
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:31,818
2

743
00:47:59,858 --> 00:48:01,938
Ming, can I have a moment of your time?

744
00:48:05,098 --> 00:48:06,698
Aren't you afraid of wasting time?

745
00:48:06,778 --> 00:48:08,978
It's better to do something
more meaningful.

746
00:48:13,538 --> 00:48:14,658
I'm sorry.

747
00:48:16,138 --> 00:48:18,418
So many things happened yesterday.

748
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:20,178
Most of which

749
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,178
were emotionally overwhelming for me.

750
00:48:24,018 --> 00:48:25,178
I didn't know what to do.

751
00:48:25,258 --> 00:48:25,898
So I...

752
00:48:25,978 --> 00:48:26,738
Vita,

753
00:48:28,938 --> 00:48:32,098
I just want to know more
of your thoughts.

754
00:48:32,178 --> 00:48:33,458
We're friends.

755
00:48:34,418 --> 00:48:35,938
And perhaps we can share
our feelings more with each other.

756
00:48:41,538 --> 00:48:44,018
At the moment, I'm still upset
about Xin's situation.

757
00:48:44,218 --> 00:48:46,018
But I'm more focused on my work now.

758
00:48:46,658 --> 00:48:47,858
And I'm glad

759
00:48:48,778 --> 00:48:50,138
you're not angry with me.

760
00:48:54,618 --> 00:48:56,378
As for Sen's situation,
I didn't take it seriously.

761
00:48:58,818 --> 00:49:01,138
But if there's anything important,
I'll let you know.

762
00:49:03,538 --> 00:49:04,418
Let's go.

763
00:49:05,738 --> 00:49:06,538
You know,

764
00:49:07,338 --> 00:49:08,978
you have changed, Vita.

765
00:49:17,978 --> 00:49:18,978
This is bad.

766
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:20,178
Guys.

767
00:49:27,578 --> 00:49:31,258
This is a clue about Xin's ex-boyfriend.

768
00:49:36,978 --> 00:49:40,618
(Former CEO Zaiyongdanacai's daughter's
rendezvous while studying abroad)

769
00:49:55,178 --> 00:49:58,018
If you already knew about Xin's death,

770
00:49:58,658 --> 00:50:00,578
why weren't you honest with us?

771
00:50:01,138 --> 00:50:04,058
Am I being interrogated
as a murder suspect

772
00:50:04,138 --> 00:50:06,298
or just someone who knew her?

773
00:50:06,938 --> 00:50:09,618
I want you to go to the nightclub
and see if there are any new clues.

774
00:50:09,698 --> 00:50:12,058
Investigate whether Miss Xin

775
00:50:12,138 --> 00:50:13,818
really met Mr. Wasu.

776
00:50:15,378 --> 00:50:18,338
The smell is similar to the one
in Miss Xin's wardrobe.
