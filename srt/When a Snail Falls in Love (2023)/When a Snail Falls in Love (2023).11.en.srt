=Episode 11=

3
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,300
(An adaptation of the novel
"When a Snail Falls in Love" by Ding Mo)

4
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,680
(Pla, you told me that)

5
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,600
(you were meeting Vita's parents.)

6
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
(How does it go?)

7
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,720
I've met them.

8
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,880
Well, how should I put this?

9
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,000
No way, you didn't stand her up.

10
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
(Grandma!)

11
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,320
(Look!)

12
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,040
(When are you going to
make her your girlfriend?)

13
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,600
Grandma Lek.

14
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,200
(Beibo, go to sleep. Hurry up.)

15
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,160
Pla.

16
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,760
(Don't listen to this kid's nonsense.)

17
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,360
(Just do whatever you want.)

18
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,200
Grandma Lek.

19
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,400
I have something to ask you.

20
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,560
(It's about Vita, right?)

21
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,120
(I have an emergency tomorrow.
Meet me at Icon Siam at 9 a.m.)

22
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,600
(Noted.)

23
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,080
You have good taste, Director.

24
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,560
For putting me
in charge of this project.

25
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,200
I agree.

26
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,880
I'm counting on you, Mr. Sen.

27
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,760
No problem.

28
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,100
(Lena, barmaid)

29
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,760
Is it a huge project?

30
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,280
Yes. It's a huge one.

31
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,680
The largest project ever.

32
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,720
You're incredible.

33
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,440
Can I sit here?

34
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,400
Of course.

35
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
I haven't finished drinking yet.

36
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,280
Well, then take your time.

37
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,040
So you are bringing me
to pick a dress for Gan's wedding.

38
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,760
It's not necessary.

39
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,600
It's a waste of time.

40
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,080
No, it's not.

41
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,240
I wanted to know
what are you wearing too.

42
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,960
Then I can match with you.

43
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,400
How do you want me to dress, Captain?

44
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,200
To match with you.

45
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,560
Anything you like.

46
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,880
It depends on you.

47
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,880
Captain.

48
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,640
When is Gan's wedding?

49
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,800
Today.

50
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,560
Today?

51
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,320
That's why I bring you to pick a dress.

52
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,480
Do you like it?

53
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,880
I do.

54
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,760
We'll take this.

55
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,800
Okay.

56
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,600
Wasu, how do you feel
on your first day of class?

57
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,640
Delightful.

58
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,160
Wasu.

59
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,360
You're kneading too hard.

60
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,800
Mu.

61
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,520
Pastries are livings too.

62
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,680
I want you to

63
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,400
feel the texture of the dough.

64
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,160
Then, you knead slowly.

65
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,600
Do you get it?

66
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,200
Yes.

67
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,960
And,

68
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,280
I want to get to know you better too.

69
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,040
100 baht.

70
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,280
Thanks.

71
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,560
Mu.

72
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,680
I guess that customer is a cleaner.

73
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,000
He is acting weird. He stinks.

74
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,760
Pe,

75
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,720
don't be so rude to the customer.

76
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,080
Serve him. Quick.

77
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,760
Wasu,

78
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,520
what are you baking?

79
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,040
Luk Chup.

80
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,160
I guess the filling in the Luk Chup
must be sugary sweet.

81
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,520
Serve the customer. Go.

82
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,040
Hello, you...

83
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,080
(Dear, I can't make it.
The typhoon is here.)

84
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,920
(I don't think I can make it.)

85
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,360
What did you say?

86
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,720
(Dear, don't be mad at me.
I really can't make it.)

87
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,280
(Who knows there's a typhoon today.)

88
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,080
(Dear, I'm so sorry.)

89
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,320
The bean cake tastes good.

90
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,640
But Mu's is better.

91
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,480
It's you then.

92
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,200
Let's go.

93
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,120
This Luk Chup is made by my student.

94
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,640
Give it a taste.

95
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,720
Thanks.

96
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,640
Enjoy.

97
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,760
Pretty.

98
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,800
I wonder if that guy beside you

99
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,640
is your boyfriend?

100
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,360
The Luk Chup is hot.

101
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,160
Be extra mindful when you eat it.

102
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,360
The person who killed your brother

103
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,400
is Black Lion.

104
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,680
Luger.

105
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,560
I'll kill Vita

106
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,760
and her brother

107
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,480
to give my brother's soul comfort.

108
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,600
I want Black Lion to suffer.

109
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,400
Only then

110
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,920
will I allow him to die.

111
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,200
(Welcome)

112
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,320
Vita

113
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,640
is not answering the call.

114
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,640
It's okay.

115
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,480
By the way,
your girlfriend is so pretty.

116
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,600
She's not my girlfriend.

117
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,360
Let her go.

118
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,800
I like my victims in pairs.

119
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,480
Capture one of you
and release the other one?

120
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,840
That's not romantic.

121
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,960
Wow!

122
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,040
A handsome groom and a pretty bride,
a match made in heaven.

123
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,440
Give me an intimate pose.
I'll take a photo of you.

124
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,840
So beautiful.

125
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,800
No.

126
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
You misunderstood.

127
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,440
You are such a troublemaker.

128
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,920
The true couple is over there.

129
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,760
You're making so much trouble
when you're drunk.

130
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,320
I'm so sorry.

131
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,080
It's okay.

132
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,560
Captain.

133
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,040
Can I hold you for a second?

134
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,680
You look pretty tonight.

135
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,320
Mu, it's okay.

136
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,280
I'm here. Don't be scared.

137
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,200
Mr. Noi, do you take Ms. Gan
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

138
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,880
I do.

139
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,640
You may put the ring on her finger.

140
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,880
(Photos from an unknown number)

141
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,400
Captain.

142
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,400
How are Wasu and Mu?

143
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,320
The kidnapper sent me a photo

144
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,600
and an address.
He wants us to meet him there.

145
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,240
I'm not letting you go.

146
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,360
Vita.

147
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,000
We have to go now.

148
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,080
Vita, wait.

149
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,680
Vita.

150
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
Captain, we are running late.

151
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,400
Vita, get out of the car.

152
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,280
Captain, we are running late.

153
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,880
Oh, you can drive.

154
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,640
I drove a car before.

155
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,960
Are you ready?

156
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,480
Release the handbrake.

157
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,800
Sorry, I'm too anxious.

158
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,960
I guess I can't call you
a snail next time.

159
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,640
Let's go!

160
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,840
Yes, got it.

161
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,760
Han.

162
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,680
We got a problem here.

163
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,520
Calm down, Vita.

164
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,840
Stay focused.

165
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,720
I'm sorry.

166
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,120
What is it, Ning?

167
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,120
(Hello, Captain.)

168
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,320
Luger escaped from prison.

169
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,920
What?

170
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,680
Are you with Vita?

171
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,480
(We received a message from the prison.)

172
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,160
Eig broke out of prison last night.

173
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,720
This morning,

174
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,680
someone saw him at Khaosan Road.

175
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,320
It seemed like he is seeking revenge.

176
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,320
He has the stolen sniper rifle with him.

177
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,080
Mu's dessert house is at Khaosan Road.

178
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,800
I bet Eig kidnapped Wasu and Mu.

179
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,880
Are Mu and Wasu kidnapped?

180
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,800
Yes.

181
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,600
The kidnapper just sent me a photo.

182
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,000
Everyone, meet at the address
I sent forward.

183
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,280
Report to me as soon as you arrive.

184
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,560
(Okay. Got it!)

185
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,000
Let's go.

186
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,680
Go, Vita.

187
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,440
Okay.

188
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,560
The big surprise I have for you is

189
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,280
that

190
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,160
the Black Lion is falling into my hands.

191
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,000
And I, Eig...

192
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,240
I never owe anything to anyone.

193
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
And I know,

194
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,600
you have a feud with Black Lion.

195
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,400
And now,

196
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,360
this is the chance to kill him.

197
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,720
He's here for you.

198
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,880
Luger.

199
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,560
He'll come.

200
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,440
This is such a great opportunity.

201
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,480
No one wants to miss it.

202
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,080
Right?

203
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,360
Black Shadow.

204
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,880
Black Shadow?

205
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,000
Shut up.

206
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,280
Mu.

207
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,120
You?

208
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,920
Who are you to call my brother's name?

209
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,400
Is he your brother?

210
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,400
What happened to him?

211
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,800
Is he

212
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,160
dead?

213
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,760
Wretch!

214
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,280
Wasu.

215
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,960
Wasu.

216
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,680
Wasu.

217
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm fine, Mu.

218
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,680
It's okay. I'm fine.

219
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,120
I'm fine.

220
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,280
How about this?

221
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,600
Let's make a deal.

222
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,320
I volunteer to be your hostage.

223
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
I'll do anything you say.

224
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,640
I have only one request.

225
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,520
Release Mu.

226
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,200
She can't see your face.

227
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,480
She's not going to
say anything to the police.

228
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,120
Don't hurt her.

229
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,600
Let go! Let go of her!
Let go, you wretch!

230
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,480
What?

231
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,080
Look who is calling.

232
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,920
Vita

233
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,160
Your sister is calling.

234
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,880
I don't have to say much.

235
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,960
Later,

236
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,280
you can experience the pain
I've been through.

237
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,840
What are you doing?

238
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
What do you want to do? Don't hurt Vita!

239
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,320
Wasu! Wasu!

240
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,480
Vita.

241
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,480
What is it?

242
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,000
Stay calm.

243
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,880
Thanks.

244
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,280
A witness saw a guy who looked like Eig
who went to Mu's shop.

245
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,680
How is it, Ning?

246
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,160
(A witness saw a guy who looked like Eig
who went to Mu's shop.)

247
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,560
(He is in the shop for quite some time
and he's not out yet.)

248
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,640
(The shop is empty now.)

249
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,480
Get to the address that I sent you. Now.

250
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,920
Let me know when you arrived.

251
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,760
Okay.

252
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,320
It's urgent. Let's go!

253
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,560
Well, not much time left

254
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,720
for you.

255
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,760
Say your last words.

256
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,400
Mu.

257
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,760
If we get to leave here alive...

258
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,480
Mu.

259
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,200
Mu, it's okay. It's okay.

260
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,520
It's okay. Calm down.

261
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,960
If we can make it alive,

262
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,920
let's date.

263
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,400
Wasu, we can make it alive.

264
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,320
Okay.

265
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,200
We'll be fine.

266
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,040
Yes.

267
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,560
I'm so freaking touched.

268
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,720
Very touching.

269
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,800
Don't be afraid.

270
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,000
Both of you will die today.

271
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,080
You can fall in love in your next life.

272
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,120
What do you want to do?

273
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,880
Hey!

274
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,000
Wasu! Wasu!

275
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,120
Wasu!

276
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,280
Captain.

277
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,120
That's the building.

278
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,720
Judging from the wall in the photo,
I'm sure it's that building.

279
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,600
This is Mu's bracelet.

280
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,320
We are at the right place.

281
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,280
Follow me.

282
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,880
Be careful.

283
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,600
Vita.

284
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,800
Vita.

285
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,320
Hey, you.

286
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,200
Be careful.

287
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,320
Da.

288
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,200
Do you remember what I taught you?

289
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,960
Yes.

290
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,560
The sniper's partner is
the sniper's second pair of eyes.

291
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,120
That's right.

292
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,520
Keep an eye on it.

293
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,120
If you see anything,

294
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
report it to me.

295
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,920
Roger that.

296
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,560
Find a chance to save Wasu.

297
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,880
Leave here to me.

298
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,400
Black Lion.

299
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,760
I have a suggestion.

300
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,720
Do you want to know?

301
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,920
I have nothing to say to you.

302
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,840
Our lives are in the hands of Eig.

303
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,920
Why don't we work together
to get rid of Eig first?

304
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,640
Captain.

305
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,880
Don't be impulsive!

306
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,000
Vita.

307
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,520
When we move,

308
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,440
find a chance to save Wasu.

309
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,480
Okay.

310
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,360
I can do this.

311
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,280
If your colleagues are smart enough,

312
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,320
they should locate Eig by now.

313
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,440
If that's so, let's fight, Luger.

314
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,120
Wasu.

315
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,680
I got it.

316
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,960
Mr. Han, on the rooftop. The right side
of the unfinished building.

317
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,780
Black Lion.

318
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,940
Now, you can feel my pain.

319
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,720
Wasu!

320
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,120
Wasu!

321
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,080
Wasu!

322
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,320
Wake up!

323
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,640
Wasu.

324
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,560
Vita.

325
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,520
Untie me.

326
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,200
I have to save Mu.

327
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,800
Vita.

328
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
I'm fine.

329
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,000
I have to hurry and save Mu.

330
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
She was locked up.

331
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,080
Captain.

332
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,480
Then I'll assist Captain.

333
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,480
Go.

334
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,720
Ouch.

335
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,320
Mu! Mu!

336
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,880
Mu.

337
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,320
Mu.

338
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,480
Mu.

339
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,800
Mu.

340
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,680
Mu.

341
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,520
Mu.

342
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,160
Mu.

343
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,840
Mu.

344
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,280
Mu, wake up. Mu.

345
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,480
Mu.

346
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,400
Mu.

347
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,480
Mu.

348
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,880
Mu.

349
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,880
Mu.

350
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,000
Mu.

351
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,600
Mu, we had a deal.

352
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,960
Mu, we're going to survive. Mu.

353
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,680
Mu.

354
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,960
Mu.

355
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,280
Mu.

356
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,640
Mu, wake up. Mu.

357
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,760
Mu.

358
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:01,920
Mu.

359
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,960
Mu.

360
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,240
Mu.

361
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,200
Mu.

362
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,680
How do you feel?

363
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,320
Mu. How do you feel, Mu?

364
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,120
Mu, calm down. Calm down.

365
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,040
Wasu. I'm Wasu.

366
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,080
I'm Wasu.

367
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,400
I'm Wasu.

368
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,400
I'm Wasu.

369
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,400
Wasu.

370
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,160
I'm Wasu.

371
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,920
Wasu.

372
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,000
Yes, I'm Wasu.

373
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,680
You're fine. We're fine.

374
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,000
We're fine. It's okay.

375
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,960
How do you come here?

376
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,040
Calm down.

377
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,800
We... Wasu.

378
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
Yes, I'm here.

379
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Why... Why do you smell like blood?

380
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,680
Are you injured?

381
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,320
No, I'm fine.

382
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,800
Ning.

383
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,680
How is it going on your end?

384
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Mr. Han's shooting skill is amazing.

385
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,120
Calling HQ.
We have a gunshot injury here.

386
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,000
Requesting to dispatch an ambulance
to the scene. Over.

387
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,840
Da, give me the wind direction
and wind speed. Quick.

388
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,200
Target lock.

389
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,200
50 degrees to the right.
Distance is 500.

390
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,080
Two milliradians from head to pelvis.

391
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,360
The wind is blowing from right to left.
Wind speed is six miles per hour.

392
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,560
1/4 milliradian to the right.

393
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,800
Is the shot bad?

394
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,800
Just a little scratch.

395
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,800
Visit the hospital or clinic
every week to clean the wound.

396
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,520
Okay.

397
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,120
Alright.

398
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:14,760
Goodbye.

399
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,640
Okay, thanks.

400
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,800
Does your wrist hurt?

401
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,400
Oh.

402
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,720
Is it okay to leave Ming alone
at the police station?

403
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,800
What could go wrong?

404
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,680
She texted
every ten minutes for updates.

405
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,760
One more step.

406
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,440
A tough day for everyone.

407
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,200
You guys did well.

408
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,160
I'm worried.

409
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,800
Ugh, anyone going back
to the police station?

410
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Well, it seems like
someone doesn't want to go back.

411
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,000
Da, I'm worried about you.

412
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,120
I'm worried about you too.

413
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,600
Oh my, don't tell me you...

414
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:15,840
Let's go.

415
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,600
Let's go back to the police station.

416
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,160
Ugh, stop pushing us.

417
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,240
Let's go, let's go.

418
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,200
Watch out, you're a rusty person.

419
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,800
Let's take a look at this.
Three years ago,

420
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,120
there were several young girls
died of poisoning.

421
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,480
We found the third victim when
we conducted an on-site investigation.

422
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,160
Then we found the suspect's hair.

423
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,200
He is a researcher
in a pharmaceutical factory.

424
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,360
His name is Thana.

425
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,800
But one thing is strange.

426
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,880
No victims were found

427
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,800
in the last six months until yesterday.
