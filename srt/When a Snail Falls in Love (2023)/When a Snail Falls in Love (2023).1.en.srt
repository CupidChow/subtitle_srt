1
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,680
(I am now at the exhibition showcase
of the sacred Naga Gem.)

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,720
(Antiques Museum)
(Our source says it was stolen once.)

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,200
But today, a shocking event took place.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,840
(This antique miraculously
showed up in front of the museum.)

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,200
(There were no witnesses as to
who brought it back there.)

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,000
(It's speculated that a certain public
figure might have done it out of guilt.)

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,120
(Or, perhaps it was out of the fear
for the mystery of the Naga Gem.)

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,280
(Mission commences)

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,720
(Vita, new officer)
Come on, Wasu. Stop complaining.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,200
That's all for now.
I'm heading to the exhibition.

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,280
Thank you for the kind donation
to our museum, Mr. Eig.

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,600
And thank you for the support so far.

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,000
We couldn't have pulled it off

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,360
(Ek, supporter of the exhibition)
without your help.

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,040
We're helping each other out.

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,840
A national treasure is very
much like everyone's treasure.

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,240
I'm glad that it is back now.

18
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,720
But there's something strange.

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,640
This is a precious item.

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,720
What were the people thinking
when they were returning it?

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,400
But this is good news.

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,480
We must be extra cautious from now on.

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,440
Do not lose it again.

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,280
Yes.

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,640
The security system is air-tight.

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,120
This is quite something.
I'm glad to see it.

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
I hope everything goes well

28
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,400
for the event.

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,080
Pass.

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,200
Let's go.

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,680
I'm so sorry!

32
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,240
Sorry.

33
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,000
It's okay.

34
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,600
Keep an eye on that man.

35
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
Where is the ladies' room?

36
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,120
That way.

37
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,200
Thank you.

38
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,600
(This is security.)

39
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,600
(How can I help you?)

40
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,480
I spotted a suspicious man in the lobby.

41
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,640
He wears a black suit
and a black baseball cap.

42
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,480
He carries a 40 cm long brown bag.

43
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,720
I suspect he carries
dangerous arms inside.

44
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
(Hold on.)

45
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,160
His behavior was very suspicious.

46
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,240
He wasn't looking at the antiques

47
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,680
but watching the surveillance
and security guards.

48
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,120
Judging by the angle
in which he swung his arm,

49
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,720
the weight of the bag he
was carrying was over 1.5 kg.

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
It has to be important.

51
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,520
If my guess is right,

52
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,640
there is a bomb inside the bag.

53
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,800
(The security system of the museum
is of the highest standards.)

54
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,360
(We check it every day.)

55
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,960
(So spare me your lies.)

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,200
You are ruining my plan.

57
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,360
If I were the bad guy,
you'd be dead by now.

58
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,200
Stay here.

59
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,800
Believe me.

60
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,600
Everyone will be safe.

61
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,600
Naga Gem!

62
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,720
Everyone, duck!

63
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,560
Down!

64
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,000
Down!

65
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,600
Cut it out!

=Episode 1=

68
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,380
(An adaptation of the novel
"When a Snail Falls in Love" by Ding Mo)

69
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,640
Move this way!

70
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,680
Safety first!

71
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,560
Which way?

72
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,560
Over there!

73
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,680
(Tell the boss)

74
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,840
(I know how to get the stuff.)

75
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,880
(I need you to get a demolition expert.)

76
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,240
(Do not disclose my identity to them.)

77
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,640
I've finally found you,

78
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,200
S19.

79
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,040
I will contact him.

80
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,120
(And remember, get a new guy.)

81
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,280
(Finish him off after the job is done.)

82
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,440
I don't want loose ends.

83
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,160
You want to raise the price?

84
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,200
Go on, it's in my pocket.

85
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,240
Eig, real name, Sawangsusi.

86
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,040
A core member of the Naga Gang.

87
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,120
You're a suspect in
many illicit activities,

88
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,960
including smuggling and stealing
antiques and human trafficking.

89
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,360
But I am arresting you
for stealing the antique.

90
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,440
As for the other charges,

91
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,720
you will have concurrent sentences

92
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,600
once the investigation is over.

93
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,880
Let go of me!

94
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,160
- Let go of me!
- Stop it!

95
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,880
Get off of me!

96
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,840
The police will be here soon!

97
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,320
Go!

98
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,640
Go! Leave now!

99
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,640
Run!

100
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,160
Let go!

101
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,680
Let go!

102
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,520
If you hadn't helped,

103
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,040
I would've died.

104
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,080
Enough of that.
What about my commission?

105
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,480
I hope it's worth
the risk of helping you.

106
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,080
What are you doing?

107
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,600
It's a male around 30 years old,

108
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
six feet tall,

109
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,480
wearing a black outfit.

110
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,640
He wore a black baseball cap.

111
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,800
And...

112
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,560
He wears size-9 shoes!

113
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,960
What about his physique and look?

114
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,840
He looks fit

115
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,120
and

116
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,520
quite handsome.

117
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,160
But I think he's been
professionally trained.

118
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,720
He is a dangerous man, officer.

119
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,920
This is him, officer! This is the man!

120
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,200
Arrest him, officer!

121
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,400
(Pla, Head of Special Investigation Officer)
Hello, Captain.

122
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,480
(Pla, Head of Special Investigation Officer)
Did anyone get hurt?

123
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,560
A woman bumped into another person
while escaping and fell.

124
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,360
Another woman died from a gunshot.

125
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,120
Get back to your work.
I can take it from here.

126
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,840
Yes.

127
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,600
You're a police officer?

128
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,040
I see.

129
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,760
Smoke bombs.

130
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,240
It worked as a warning
but it was non-lethal.

131
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,160
If you wanted to lure the criminal,
that was a bit over the top!

132
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,920
Did you not see
the kids here today? What if...

133
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,840
This is a police operation.
It's none of your business.

134
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,920
I am warning you...

135
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,280
Seeing that your intention was good,

136
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,080
I won't charge you
with obstruction of justice.

137
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,320
But if you run into similar
situations again, please stand down.

138
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,400
You caused us a lot of trouble today.

139
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,960
You could have gotten hurt.

140
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,480
The police's duty is to protect
the people and stop crimes.

141
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,680
I am a police officer!

142
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,600
(Badin, Special investigation officer)

143
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,680
The police's duty

144
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,760
is to protect the people

145
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,720
and stop crimes.

146
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,720
The police's duty is to protect
the people and stop crimes.

147
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
I don't need you to tell me that!

148
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,560
I am a police officer.

149
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,360
I am a police officer too!

150
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,160
Of, you came to Ratchaburi for work.

151
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,000
I thought it's because you missed me.

152
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,840
Come on, Grandma.

153
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,600
I did come here to visit you.

154
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,040
Pla.

155
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,560
How long are you staying this time?

156
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,880
I must get back to my work.

157
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,960
I don't know
why you came back to Ratchaburi.

158
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,840
But it's probably because of
the Naga case you've been working on.

159
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,080
I saw the news.

160
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,800
There was a commotion at the museum.

161
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,040
The case went cold for some time.

162
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,480
But some new leads came up.

163
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,160
I had to see to it myself.

164
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,680
But the gang doesn't have a leader now.

165
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,040
Grandma, don't worry.

166
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,920
Can't you let the elite unit
take care of this case?

167
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,480
I want to finish them off.

168
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,600
I want to do it myself.

169
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,640
Those villains

170
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,640
don't even fear death.

171
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,800
Maybe they came back

172
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,440
not just to stir up
trouble at the museum,

173
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,120
but to take revenge as well.

174
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,480
I promise

175
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,480
I will take care of myself.

176
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,200
Besides,

177
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,640
I have a capable team.

178
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,280
Sometimes, they are
better than the elite unit.

179
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,320
If they weren't cut out for the job,

180
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,840
I wouldn't have put them in the team.

181
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,280
Don't worry.

182
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,920
Beibo.

183
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,600
Let's prepare the food, my child.

184
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,480
(Records of Vita)

185
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,520
(Physical performance: 50.1,
critical thinking 98.9)

186
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,840
(TA, Special investigation officer)
This is the PIT.

187
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,960
(The suspect's car is about to arrive.)

188
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,320
Got it. Thanks, I'm on my way.

189
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,760
Let's go, Mr. Han. We've got work to do.

190
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,160
The suspect we need to interrogate
is about to arrive, Mr. Han.

191
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,560
Mr. Han?

192
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,240
(Royal Thai Police)

193
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,240
Sir? What are you reading, Mr. Han?

194
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,700
(Mr. Han, Special investigation officer)

195
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,720
Mr. Han!

196
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,120
Get moving!
The suspect is about to be here!

197
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,920
The suspect we need to interrogate
is about to be here, get moving!

198
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,120
Come on, Mr. Han! Wake up!

199
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,080
(Nick, Special investigation officer)
Our men were ambushed!

200
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,760
It must be the Tiger Gang.

201
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,960
They came looking for trouble because
one of them was getting interrogated.

202
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,320
No, it's not the Tiger Gang.

203
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,560
It's a junior from the police academy.

204
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,720
Her intellect is peerless.

205
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,360
Her performance is outstanding.

206
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,360
And more importantly,

207
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,680
she is cute!

208
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,240
She's just my cup of tea.

209
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,800
Let me make it clear to you.

210
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,760
No one from our unit is
allowed to go for this girl.

211
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,680
Are you talking about
the new guy that's coming to our unit?

212
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,840
Yeah, Mr. Han.

213
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Let me put it this way.
I'd let her interrogate me every day!

214
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,960
Please punish me
with those strong and long legs.

215
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,440
I should do it with mine, Ning.

216
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,960
Officer Da, don't be so mean.

217
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,080
My sweet Vita...

218
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,880
Yes?

219
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,800
Oh, she's here.

220
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,800
Second Lieutenant Vita Wasongkanachai,
reporting in for duty.

221
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,720
Oh, you're here to deliver a file.

222
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,240
Over there.

223
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,240
Mr. Han, here you go.

224
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,880
Hey.

225
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,160
Who was the one daydreaming
about just now?

226
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,200
Vita.

227
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,840
Vita is standing right there.

228
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,800
What?

229
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,320
You scored 50.1 for
physical performance?

230
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,400
Is she cut out for it, sir?

231
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,760
That score is over 50,
so she passed the test.

232
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,280
In any case, she is only
here for the desk work. Right?

233
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,400
Come on, Mr. Han.

234
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,960
The suspect is about to be here.

235
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,880
Let's go.

236
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,680
Let's go.

237
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,320
Hold this.

238
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,600
Let's go!

239
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,160
The door is unlocked.

240
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,440
Over there!

241
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,520
Seal the entrance!

242
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,400
Hurry!

243
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,560
Close it!

244
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,440
This way!

245
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,000
Stop right there!

246
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,000
(Ming, new officer)

247
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,920
Second Lieutenant Marika Thansongpom,
reporting in for duty.

248
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,840
A new female officer.

249
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,960
Yeah.

250
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,880
The outstanding and witty officer,

251
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,760
the beauty of the police force,
that was you, Ms. Marika.

252
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,040
Can I call you Little Fairy?

253
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,680
I'm flattered.

254
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,160
The assailants are after something else.

255
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,120
So much trouble on
your first day of work.

256
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,080
All thanks to this guy. Troublemaker!

257
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,760
Mr. Han!

258
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,120
I'm here to bring my man back.

259
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,680
How bold of you

260
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,600
to walk into
a police station for a thug.

261
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,480
You have a death wish?

262
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,840
Shut it!

263
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,960
Old man,
I'll put a bullet between your eyes!

264
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,440
I don't work for you.

265
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,520
What are the odds?

266
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,640
You are under arrest!

267
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,840
Put the guns down.

268
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,520
Put the guns down!

269
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,280
What do we do next?

270
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:44,880
On the ground!

271
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,720
Yes! We're doing it!

272
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,520
Vita, how did you know
the Tiger Gang would come in here?

273
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,640
I found this thing

274
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,400
when I walked past the fence.

275
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,520
I didn't know what it was,

276
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,840
so I asked the guard to get rid of it.

277
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,200
Guard.

278
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,480
Hello.

279
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,200
How may I help you?

280
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,160
I found this on the ground.

281
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,960
Could you get rid of this?

282
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,400
Yes.

283
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,640
It's too dangerous for vehicles.

284
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,960
Okay, I'll get rid of it.

285
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,880
But when I heard the tires get punctured
and the suspect escaped,

286
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,600
it means these caltrops
were purposely left there.

287
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,160
But the suspect's movement
was too obvious.

288
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,360
He ran aimlessly while escaping.

289
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,880
If he wanted to escape,

290
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,960
judging by the layout
of the police station,

291
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,960
it would've been easier
to run for the front gate.

292
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,640
The problem is,

293
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,320
why?

294
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,400
The answer is simple.

295
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,320
The suspect was stalling us
by distracting us.

296
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,360
So, explain this to me.

297
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,040
Why this place?

298
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,880
There are officers everywhere.

299
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,560
Wouldn't it be more sensible
to intercept halfway?

300
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,240
Why would they take
the more risky route?

301
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,480
Try to recall.

302
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,160
Aside from rescuing one of them,

303
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,840
what is here

304
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,280
that is worth such a great risk

305
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,160
for them?

306
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,280
Report.

307
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,040
We examined the perps.

308
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,960
They came to steal the evidence against
the Tiger Gang from the evidence room.

309
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,960
They wanted to sabotage the evidence.

310
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,960
And they...

311
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,920
Enough.

312
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,800
You may go now.

313
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,680
Yes.

314
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,600
See? The newcomer is good.

315
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,720
Don't just stand there.

316
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,560
(Ittidech, National Police Chief)
Don't you have work to do?

317
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,200
Chief, haven't you heard?

318
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,120
The suspect was trying to escape,
but I used my impeccable skill

319
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,120
to take him down.

320
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,360
Of course I know. That was big news.

321
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,320
Yeah.

322
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,240
But I also know

323
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,120
whom the credit goes to.

324
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,440
Yes.

325
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,360
Not bad, newcomers.

326
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,960
- Yes.
- Yes.

327
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,960
Why are there two of you?

328
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,800
We discussed this.

329
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,960
We only want one new guy here!

330
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,560
Yes.

331
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,000
The analytic scores are outstanding,

332
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,000
but the scores for physical performance

333
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,360
didn't reach Captain Pla's requirement.

334
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,280
I'm afraid that you can't get a job here.

335
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,200
I'll assign you to a different unit.

336
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,240
Captain Pla?

337
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,360
Yes.

338
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,320
I'm the chief here,

339
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,120
but

340
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,120
Captain Pla leads the operation unit.

341
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,680
He gets to make the final decision.

342
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,520
If he were here,

343
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,960
I'd let you talk to him in person.

344
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,640
But he's on leave.

345
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,600
(No Pass)

346
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,080
That means...

347
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,960
I request an audience with him.

348
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,840
If you can wait for him,

349
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,560
so can I.

350
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,480
What else should I wait for?

351
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,440
To wait until

352
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,040
I'm unable to unveil the truth.

353
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,640
What truth?

354
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,800
You smell of soap.

355
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,440
There are water stains on your collar.

356
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,560
It means you just took a shower
before coming here.

357
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,960
The timing of that shower is suspicious.

358
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,640
But it's insignificant compared
to the mark of a ring at your pocket.

359
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,920
The mark of a ring at your pocket

360
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,720
comes from repeatedly putting the ring
into the pocket and taking it out.

361
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,360
There are only a handful of reasons
for a man to take off his wedding ring.

362
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,040
Based on these behaviors

363
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,960
and the schedule
delivered by your secretary

364
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,160
which shows that your schedules
are packed every day except today,

365
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,200
here's the question.

366
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,760
Where were you just now?

367
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,080
Is this it?

368
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,720
(69 Motel)

369
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,800
Impressive, Ms. Vita.

370
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,560
An analysis with the right evidence

371
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,400
can give you the right answer.

372
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,320
But, you might also end up
with a wrong answer.

373
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,760
An investigation needs
more than just evidence.

374
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,240
You must know how to read people.

375
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,360
You still have a lot to learn.

376
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,360
Hey, Vita!

377
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,840
I overheard
your conversation with the Chief.

378
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,600
Seriously? You thought
the chief was cheating on his wife?

379
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,680
Oh my, that was hilarious.

380
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,360
But forget it,
I can't eat lunch while laughing.

381
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,160
The chief really loves his wife.

382
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
I'll leave it at that.

383
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,320
There is nothing in this
police station that I don't know.

384
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,880
The chief has to meet up
with our informants every day.

385
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,080
He wears and takes off the ring

386
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,000
so the informants don't know
too much about his personal life.

387
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,360
Just last night, the chief had to
work overtime at the office

388
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,160
and go out to
meet the informant at a hotel.

389
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,640
How insensible of you, Vita.

390
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,760
(PASS)

391
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,360
So why would he give me the approval?

392
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,920
Perhaps it's because
you're an officer with great potential.

393
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,520
Yeah, that's it.

394
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,960
The chief is very observant.

395
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,440
Who were you talking to, Vita?

396
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,960
Oh, you were talking to yourself.

397
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,800
Vita.

398
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,280
Came for a jog before going to work?

399
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,520
I need to work even harder.

400
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,560
The chief was very
kind to have let you stay.

401
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,960
But that Captain Pla

402
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,760
is just too strict. He is all about
the physical performance scores.

403
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,360
But with that said,

404
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,200
I think he must have a reason for this.

405
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,720
You knew him?

406
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,560
Come on.
We're going to be late for work.

407
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,560
Go on without me.
I'm taking another lap!

408
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,760
Help!

409
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,680
(Sen, successor of Zaiyongdanacai family)
Help!

410
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,360
Xin!

411
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,560
Xin!

412
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,360
Keep the head raised.

413
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,960
Keep the head raised.

414
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,680
Okay.

415
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,480
(Sin, Sen's cousin, in charge of jewelry business)
Lay down for a little.

416
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,720
Please stay still.

417
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,040
Put pressure on the wound for me.

418
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,240
Aren't you doing it already?

419
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,760
Help me put pressure on it!

420
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,720
Now!

421
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,480
Keep it pressed.

422
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,880
Do not let go.

423
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,080
What now?

424
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,760
Keep pressing it. Do not let go!

425
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,320
Yes, I won't let go.

426
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,960
There has been an attempted murder
at the park next to The Place Apartment.

427
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,840
Hold on.

428
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,960
Murder?

429
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,760
Yes. This is an emergency.

430
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,600
Let's go.

431
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,160
Vita, what are you doing here?

432
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,640
I called the police.

433
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,320
But I didn't think they'd send the PIT.

434
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,400
Their family has a friendly
relationship with the police.

435
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,520
Whatever, save that for later.

436
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,840
How is the wounded?

437
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,520
She is at the hospital.

438
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,080
She was cut by a saw blade.

439
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,880
We know the gist of it.

440
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,760
This has happened before.

441
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,080
Sorry. Here's the file.

442
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
Last month,

443
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,920
we found saw blades
at several locations of the park.

444
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,360
The policeman patrolling the area
thinks it's the cynical's doing.

445
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,080
We had our doubts,
but there was nothing we could do.

446
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,360
At first,
we weren't in charge of this case.

447
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,120
But why did Vita say
it was an attempted murder

448
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,760
and not a normal accident?

449
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,000
Did you know

450
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,280
someone was hurt by the saw blade?

451
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,240
I didn't say anything.

452
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,760
No, I didn't know.

453
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,400
But judging by the crime scene,

454
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,120
a seal tape was used
to alter the pathway.

455
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,600
There are tools
unrelated to the case itself.

456
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,920
The culprit opened up a new path
so the victim would step on the blades.

457
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,760
The culprit sanded of the place
where the saw blade was hidden.

458
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,760
But the blade was sharpened.

459
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,960
And more importantly,

460
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,320
there are the second and third blades.

461
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,480
Judging by the spot where she fell,

462
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,960
the second and third blades
would have cut her neck.

463
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,480
That lady was very fortunate.

464
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,760
Her arm saved her from death.

465
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,120
As expected from one with
top scores in critical thinking.

466
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,320
What a show-off.

467
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,840
You've shown off long enough. Go back.

468
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,320
Ming, take your friend back.

469
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,840
You'd be a trouble for us
if you passed out afterward.

470
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,280
Mr. Han.

471
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,640
What is it?

472
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,360
I must remind you.

473
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,000
If the captain saw this,
we'd all be in trouble.

474
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,480
Right?

475
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,160
Hurry up.

476
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,680
So...

477
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,080
Let's head back, Vita.

478
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,080
Why you...

479
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,400
You're the problem.

480
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,680
What if I stay here as a witness?

481
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,880
Then, you can explain it to the captain.

482
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,840
But let me be clear with you,

483
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,280
Captain Pla is not
as kind as Chief Indesh.

484
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,160
Let's go.

485
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,760
Okay.

486
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,360
Let's go. Move!

487
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,960
That's how the professional works.

488
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,320
Is this the protrusion?

489
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,960
This is the first blade.
The second blade is there.

490
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,720
They have our phones, right?

491
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,840
See? The second and third blades.

492
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,440
(Da, how did it go?)

493
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,280
It's the same MO as last time.

494
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,280
The culprit could be the same person.

495
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,720
(There was no
surveillance camera in the area.)

496
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,640
Write down what I'm about to say.

497
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,520
Yes.

498
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,880
To catch the culprit.

499
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,960
We must think like the culprit.

500
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,160
All the crime scenes,

501
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,360
be it the condominium or the mall,

502
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,480
there is only one connection
between them. They are owned by CIY.

503
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,840
Every crime scene is a property of CIY.

504
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,800
If it were to cause civil unrest,
this won't be the link.

505
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,160
But if someone is out for revenge...

506
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,640
Every revenge plot has a reason.

507
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,800
After going through news threads about
CIY, I found something interesting.

508
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,240
In a case where the employee
pressed charges against the company,

509
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,320
became disabled due to a leg injury
from a construction accident.

510
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,840
He asked for millions in damages.

511
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,560
But the court ruled it
an accident due to negligence.

512
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,360
CIY won the lawsuit

513
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,280
and he got nothing in return.

514
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,760
The thing
that ruined the employee's life

515
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,280
- was something similar to a saw blade.
- Was something similar to a saw blade.

516
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,560
All the set up to lure
people into this direction.

517
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,840
The culprit used a weapon similar
to the tool that crippled him

518
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,760
for revenge and to serve
as a reminder that he was hurt.

519
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,720
He may not have a specific target,

520
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,880
but he wants CIY to suffer
the same pain he went through.

521
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,400
So, our target is...

522
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,200
A man with a disability.

523
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,320
And one with a facial profile
that matches the news.

524
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,960
Officer Ning.

525
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,120
- It's an employee that sued CIY.
- Where and whom?

526
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,320
Why didn't you say something?

527
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,440
Da?

528
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,760
It was an CIY employee

529
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,320
that pressed charges
against the company.

530
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,480
How did you know?

531
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,960
The captain just told me on the phone.

532
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,840
Vita just came up with the analysis.

533
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,840
Whatever, we'll talk later.

534
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,280
We must move out now.

535
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,400
Okay. Let's go.

536
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:03,920
Hold on.

537
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,480
Report!

538
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,000
Where is the captain?

539
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,240
He's on the way, but he wants us to get working
before the culprit slips away.

540
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,080
Okay, let's go.

541
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,040
Report!

542
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,400
I can go with you now, right?

543
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,080
Fine, everyone is coming.
We'll talk about it when we're there!

544
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,600
This is the block.

545
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,840
The suspect is in unit 605.

546
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,760
What are you doing?

547
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,520
What are you doing?

548
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,720
Oh no, the elevator is busted.

549
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,880
We'll take the stairs.

550
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,280
Stay here

551
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,760
and wait for the captain.

552
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,320
Hurry!

553
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,480
It's okay.

554
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,880
"Notice for the residents.

555
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,560
The elevator will undergo maintenance

556
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,040
and but will still be powered.

557
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,240
For the ease of checking
the system and your safety,

558
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,920
all residents

559
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,760
must not use the elevators."

560
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,880
(Do Not Enter)

561
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,800
Which unit is it?

562
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,280
Da?

563
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,520
Hallway, clear!

564
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,560
Clear!

565
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,200
(Ming, I'm at the old block
on the west side.)

566
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,440
The suspect just...

567
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,320
(Vita, what about the suspect?)

568
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,440
(Da, how is it going?)

569
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,000
We are searching for Somcho,
the suspect.

570
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,480
He's nowhere to be found.

571
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,400
Bad news, Vita is in trouble.

572
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,160
She just called and said
she was on the west side elevator.

573
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,360
(She mentioned something about
the suspect before hanging up abruptly.)

574
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,160
You brought a newcomer with you?

575
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,520
Miss.

576
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,000
You didn't press the button.

577
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,560
Which floor?

578
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,440
The same as you.

579
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,240
(Unit 410-423)

580
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,120
The rich only care about making money.

581
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,840
They oppress honest laborers like us.

582
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,400
I know you want to take revenge on CIY.

583
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,800
There are other ways
to fight those people.

584
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,680
But what you do now

585
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,800
is wrong.

586
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,840
Spare me your fancy words.

587
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,680
I've lost faith in

588
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,920
the complicated procedures of the court.

589
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,440
You are a police officer.

590
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,560
That makes you one of them.

591
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,320
You don't see lowlifes like us.

592
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,600
You'll see.

593
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,320
You'll see how your death

594
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,560
will make waves.

595
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,440
How can my death help?

596
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,160
In ten minutes, you will be arrested.

597
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,840
Some news outlets might say
you've been mistreated and oppressed.

598
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,400
But you will be forgotten soon.

599
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,960
They move on with their high lives.

600
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,120
But you ruined your own future.

601
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,360
Are you giving your life for that?

602
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,040
Who says I'm dying alone?

603
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,560
You're coming with me.

604
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,560
You say they look down on you.

605
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,160
What about you?

606
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,760
What do you see in yourself?

607
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,120
Turn yourself in.

608
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,360
Take me as your hostage.

609
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,160
I'll help you.

610
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,560
I promise.

611
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:15,120
I hope you start fighting
for your rights again.

612
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,400
You won't be alone this time.

613
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:27,840
Put down the weapon!

614
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,600
Come on.

615
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,920
- Calm down.
- Stand back!

616
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,040
Or she dies!

617
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,600
I've thought it through.

618
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,320
This is the only way

619
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,200
to get the justice I seek.

620
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,120
I'm sorry

621
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,600
it has to end this way.

622
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,640
You're safe now.

623
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,920
(Last night at 8:14 PM,)

624
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,880
(the local police received
a call from Ms. Mary.)

625
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,200
(She claimed her 16-year-old daughter
has been kidnapped by Naga.)

626
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,280
(There were no signs of fighting
at the crime scene.)

627
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:50,960
(Except for)

628
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,120
(traces of Naga.)

629
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,560
(Don't you think it's odd?)

630
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,320
(When we were at her house,)

631
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,280
(we didn't find any amulets or statues
of the Naga deity.)

632
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,120
(But she claims she worships the Naga.)
