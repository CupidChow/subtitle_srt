3
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,300
(An adaptation of the novel
"When a Snail Falls in Love" by Ding Mo)

4
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,400
Hey.

5
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,760
You still don't want to wake up?

6
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,840
Ming, Da is still unconscious?

7
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,800
Wake up, Da.

8
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,600
Da.

9
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,600
I bought flowers for you.

10
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,520
Wakey-wakey.

11
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,560
Give me. I'll put it in a vase.

12
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,320
God knows when he'll wake up.

13
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,120
Ming needs to look after Da now.

14
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,280
Other than us,

15
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,440
we only have Mr. Han and Ning left.

16
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,840
We won't have enough manpower

17
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,400
so should we talk to Chief

18
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,640
and ask him to assign more people to us?

19
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,760
No need.

20
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,320
Let's clean up the mess first.

21
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,760
What do you mean?

22
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,080
Do you remember
the day when Eig was killed?

23
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,520
We were hunting down a criminal
who pretended to be a doctor.

24
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,760
We got the security footage.

25
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,280
Before he killed the victim,

26
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,560
he made a call.

27
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,800
And that someone might be working
at the police station.

28
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,000
You're saying that...

29
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,560
I passed the call log to
the relevant department.

30
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,520
If the owner of
the number turns out to be one of us,

31
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,320
there's a traitor

32
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,920
in our force.

33
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,400
And we need to identify him.

34
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Hi.

35
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,720
Wasu.

36
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,520
You're so early.

37
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,360
I want to be the first person

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,920
you meet today.

39
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,120
Well, I was the first person Mu saw
this morning.

40
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,240
Hey, Bo.

41
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,600
Nice to meet you.

42
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,520
How are you?

43
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,200
I just came back from my hometown.

44
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,880
Who would have thought

45
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,520
that so many things

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,400
could happen within a month?

47
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,080
Are you free tonight?

48
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,040
Do you want to join my friend's party?

49
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,480
I heard there will be

50
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,880
many famous desserts.

51
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,520
Sure, why not?

52
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Wonderful.
I'll pick you up in the evening.

53
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,960
I'm... I'm waving at you.

54
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,400
Okay.

55
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,440
Miss Mu, what's troubling you?

56
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,080
Well...

57
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,320
I'm not used to a big scene.

58
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,320
You'll be fine, Miss Mu.

59
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,960
Once Pe is here,

60
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,480
ask him to pick your outfit.
You'll be more confident.

61
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,760
All right?

62
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,680
Okay.

63
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,440
(P.I.T.)

64
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,520
This number comes
from the police station, yes.

65
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,520
But it is connected to a storeroom.

66
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,200
It used to be the office for P.I.T.

67
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,960
but after Chief
got you guys a bigger space,

68
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,480
it became a storeroom.

69
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,240
Can I look at the security footage?

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,840
The security camera on the corridor
broke down last month.

71
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,880
We asked someone to look into it

72
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,680
but it's still broken.

73
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,600
I see.

74
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,280
All right.

75
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,360
Come in.

76
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,840
I shall get going.

77
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,280
I checked.

78
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,720
Ming and Da were out

79
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
that day.

80
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,040
Mr. Han was in his office all day long

81
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,400
and everyone on the team has an alibi.

82
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,400
(Sen sent a message.)

83
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,480
Who is that?

84
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,080
You may go.

85
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,280
Are you upset, Pita?

86
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,720
You have the right to do and see
whoever you want.

87
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,400
Jealousy

88
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,360
is an uncontrollable negative sentiment
when one assumes

89
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,960
that his loved one isn't giving him
enough attention.

90
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,120
If it's all in your head,

91
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,560
why can't you control your emotions?

92
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,720
That's because

93
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,920
you're important to me, Vita.

94
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,920
I can't control myself.

95
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,000
You may go.

96
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Okay.

97
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,680
It's good to be self-aware.

98
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,280
I will be back soon.

99
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,400
Let's end it here.

100
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,080
Sorry, Sen.

101
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,360
Don't be, Vita.

102
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,560
It's not your fault.

103
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,920
I know I can't force it.

104
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,680
And I know he never leaves your mind.

105
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,520
I'm here to bid you farewell.

106
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,240
I have to go to Mumbai
for my family business.

107
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,960
Can you do something for me
before I leave?

108
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,800
Yes?

109
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,280
Promise me

110
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
that you'll be happy.

111
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
All right?

112
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
Ah!

113
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,720
Call me if you miss me.

114
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,560
The timezone is not that far apart.

115
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,160
I want to see the Chief.

116
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,920
Go in, Captain Pla.

117
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,120
Go in, Captain Pla.

118
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,800
The mysterious poison case
has finally been solved.

119
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,560
Both culprits are arrested

120
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,240
and two selfless officers

121
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,360
rescued the hostages.

122
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,320
They exaggerated it.

123
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,360
Either way,

124
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,360
it has restored the people's faith
in the police.

125
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,000
Your team did very well

126
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,880
in this serial murder case.

127
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,440
Credit where credit's due.

128
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,440
I applied for a promotion for you.

129
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,560
Soon enough,

130
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,960
you can be a vice chief
in another province.

131
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,440
Thanks, sir.

132
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,440
However,

133
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,280
I'd like to revisit the Luger case.

134
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,680
I would like that too

135
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,440
but you need to present new evidence.

136
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,760
I will

137
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,840
have it soon.

138
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,960
Did you have a breakthrough?

139
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,480
Eig died under mysterious circumstances.

140
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,080
I have reasons to believe

141
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,560
that we have a mole here.

142
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,440
If there's a traitor,

143
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,360
he'd surely give himself away.

144
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,280
Let's not act rashly and alert him.

145
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,480
Be careful not

146
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,040
to leak this to anyone.

147
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,920
Yes, sir.

148
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,240
Hello?

149
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,280
How do you feel today?

150
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,520
I'll pay you a visit later.

151
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,280
My wife has been feeling unwell.

152
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,440
She's in the hospital now.

153
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,000
I shall make myself scarce.

154
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,320
I wish her a speedy recovery.

155
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,880
Don't tell anyone

156
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
about my wife.

157
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,160
Noted.

158
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,800
Hello?

159
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,560
Any update?

160
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,000
Sir.

161
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,720
We went through all the past cases
associated with Luger

162
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,160
but we found nothing new.

163
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,280
No, there will be something.

164
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm an officer for several decades now

165
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,320
and trust me, there must be something.

166
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,480
Trust us, Captain.

167
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,320
I trust all of you.

168
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,760
Hello.

169
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,440
Let's have a meal together.

170
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,400
I'm waiting for you at Veeyam Restaurant
near the station.

171
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,880
See you in thirty minutes.

172
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,760
Okay.

173
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,240
I'll be there.

174
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,000
What happened?

175
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,760
Nothing.

176
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,160
I have to be away for a while.

177
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,480
Captain, these documents might
be relevant to the case.

178
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,280
Put them on my desk.

179
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,640
You're so much more approachable now,
Captain.

180
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,360
Is that so?

181
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,840
(Sawasdee Sweets)

182
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,200
Mu.

183
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,920
The organizer is very happy with
the desserts we supply.

184
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,280
They love them.

185
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,640
That's wonderful.

186
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,680
Indeed.

187
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,360
I'll help you out during the event, Mu.

188
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,800
Thank you.

189
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,720
Hi, Wasu.

190
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,080
It's been a while.

191
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,080
- What have you been up to?
- The same old thing.

192
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,240
Wow.

193
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,120
You must be a professional now.

194
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,920
No, not as good as you.

195
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,360
Hi.

196
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,480
Are you talking to me?

197
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,120
I'm not sure if Wasu
mentioned me or not.

198
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,640
We used to work together.

199
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:40,960
Here.

200
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,720
Oh, come on.

201
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,240
We're not old enough to reminisce
about the old days.

202
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,360
Sorry.

203
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,280
Wasu, this is my company card.

204
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,800
Call me if you need anything.

205
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,720
I'll check that place out.

206
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,200
Go ahead.

207
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,800
Wasu.

208
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,240
I'll go and find a seat now.

209
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,720
The heels are killing me.

210
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,360
Okay.

211
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,160
Come.

212
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,080
We're going there.

213
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,200
How do you feel now?

214
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,760
It's hurting.

215
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,320
It'll be better after some rest.

216
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,680
Wasu! Hey!

217
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,880
I'll join you later.

218
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,680
I just saw a friend. I'm going
to talk to him and I'll be back.

219
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,480
Okay.

220
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,640
I'm here to supply the desserts.

221
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,320
Really?

222
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,080
Is that so?

223
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,960
I'll see you later.

224
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,080
Sure.

225
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,080
It's been a while and now, you don't
remember me at all?

226
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,960
Of course, I remember you.

227
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,280
How long has it been?

228
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,400
Ten years.

229
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,080
Are you taken now?

230
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,440
Who's texting you now?

231
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,400
It's about work.

232
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,480
You're always on your phone
when you're with me.

233
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,920
It's about work.

234
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,640
Really?

235
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,920
Your eyes are glued to the screen

236
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,040
that you hardly see me at all.

237
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
No.

238
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,760
I don't have a girlfriend.

239
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,560
Are you sure?

240
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,400
Yes.

241
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,680
I'll be frank with you.

242
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,040
I have a girlfriend already.

243
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,120
She's a captain in P.I.T.

244
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,680
Do you want her number?

245
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,720
Hello.

246
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,640
Hi.

247
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,080
I have a reservation under Pla.

248
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,680
Mr. Pla.

249
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,080
Come with me.

250
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,240
Here.

251
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,120
I think I was led to the wrong table.

252
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,320
No, you weren't.

253
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,320
Captain Pla, is it?

254
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,320
I'm Rine.

255
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,320
Okay.

256
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,960
Miss Rine, is it?

257
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,000
Yes.

258
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,800
You know what?

259
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,640
This meal

260
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,080
is on me.

261
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,960
I'm busy now.

262
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,320
Sorry.

263
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,160
Pla, wait!

264
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:23,920
Pla.

265
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,080
Wait.

266
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,480
Can we talk?

267
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,280
Sorry.

268
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,360
I...

269
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,400
I'm taken.

270
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,480
Hold on.

271
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,000
Ask your girlfriend to come here.

272
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,640
What's up, Wasu?

273
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,120
(Come to Veeyam Restaurant now.)

274
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,360
(Hurry.)

275
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,120
Veeyam Restaurant.

276
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,680
Veeyam Restaurant?

277
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,520
It just opened.

278
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,360
It's fancy.

279
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,280
Should we try it?

280
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,080
Yes.

281
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,840
Sure.

282
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,640
But I'm broke.

283
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,800
Ouch.

284
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,560
Then why did you...

285
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,320
Calm down.

286
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,880
Hi.

287
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,680
Watch where you're going, miss.

288
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,800
Geez.

289
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,720
Hi. May I help you?

290
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,200
Captain.

291
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Wasu...

292
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,400
If you can prove that you're taken,

293
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,800
I'll let you go.

294
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,440
If not, you

295
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,680
have to be my boyfriend.

296
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,800
I...

297
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,440
Vita...

298
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,400
Do you know?

299
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,400
Your mother already warned me

300
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,520
that you would try to get out
by pretending that you're taken.

301
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,640
Vita.

302
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,160
He is...

303
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,800
Mu?

304
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,760
Okay, I'm on my way.

305
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,200
Captain.

306
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,000
You owe me an explanation

307
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,480
about this.

308
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,440
Vita.

309
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,960
I will always have your back.

310
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,760
Sorry.

311
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,120
Don't be so uptight.

312
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,760
Hi, everyone.

313
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,480
I'm Ning, single and ready to mingle.

314
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,760
Read the room!

315
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,880
She's with Captain now?

316
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,880
(I will keep the secret.)

317
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,680
(Okay.)

318
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,720
They make good escargots here.

319
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,880
Try it.

320
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,720
No, thanks.

321
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,120
Snails are too cute

322
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,720
to be eaten.

323
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,160
Oh, my.

324
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,600
You

325
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,160
are such an adorable guy.

326
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,680
In my eyes,

327
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,400
snails are the cutest creature.

328
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,800
I will not eat them.

329
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,480
Sorry, I have to use the loo.

330
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,560
Me too.

331
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,240
I'll be back.

332
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,560
Too cute

333
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,000
to be eaten.

334
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,680
Stop teasing, Han.

335
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,560
Captain is also very cute.

336
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,520
Hush.

337
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,240
- Eat, Ning.
- Yes.

338
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,640
Yes, sir.

339
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,120
You must be Officer Vita.

340
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,280
The desserts from the party
aren't as good as yours.

341
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,480
Yours are much better.

342
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,120
I see it now.

343
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,600
Captain Pla

344
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,040
must have told Vita to hide
their relationship status

345
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,480
so that he can date other women.

346
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,040
What a jerk!

347
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,000
How could he do that to my sister?

348
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,240
Captain Pla isn't like that.

349
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,920
You're too gullible, Mu.

350
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,240
Men are like this, I tell you.

351
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,720
I know them.

352
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,360
- My friends are like that.
- Wasu.

353
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,800
Can I leave?

354
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,000
What happened?

355
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,880
I want some privacy.

356
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:56,920
I...

357
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,640
Sorry.

358
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,600
Did I annoy you with my rant?

359
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,880
Please let me go.

360
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,640
No, but you...

361
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,960
Mu, what's the matter?

362
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,960
Wasu.

363
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,240
No need to get out.

364
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,880
I can walk.

365
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,520
Thanks.

366
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,320
I asked your colleague.

367
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,200
She said that you're single.

368
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,640
Thanks.

369
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,760
Vita.

370
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,800
Miss Rine said that I am single.

371
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,720
Is that true?

372
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,400
Is the woman outside
the captain's girlfriend?

373
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
No.

374
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,600
It's not Ming.

375
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,800
I knew it.

376
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,880
Your mother told me

377
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,680
that you love

378
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,800
crab roes

379
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,960
but not crab meat.

380
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,280
Have some.

381
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,240
Our captain sure has an acquired taste.

382
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,320
Ning.

383
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,840
(I didn't know you like crab roes.
We should have Chinese next time.)

384
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,840
Here, I peeled it for you.

385
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,320
Have some, Pita.

386
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,320
Pita?

387
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,040
It must be your first time hearing this.

388
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,640
Don't be surprised.

389
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,720
Only his family
gets to use this pet name.

390
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,160
You'll get used to it soon.

391
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,920
Vita?

392
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,080
Calm down.

393
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,320
Enough!

394
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,120
You...

395
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,160
Stop it.

396
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,280
Let go of me.

397
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,480
I can let go of you but you
cannot slap her.

398
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,400
Captain, did you do this
on purpose to...

399
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,280
To make you jealous?

400
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,960
You were

401
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,280
jealous, weren't you?

402
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,840
I guess

403
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,840
I care too much about you

404
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,280
that I lost control of myself.

405
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,080
Captain pulled a trick.

406
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,720
How cunning.

407
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,560
- What?
- Whose kid is this?

408
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,480
Come.

409
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,600
Hold on.

410
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,680
You and he

411
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,280
even have a child now?

412
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,560
This can't be real.

413
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,120
I'll tell his mother!

414
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,080
We're the police. We'll handle this.

415
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,880
Thanks.

416
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,760
Thank you.

417
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,640
Sorry.

418
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,080
I asked everyone and no one
has seen the baby's mother.

419
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,240
Thank you.

420
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,200
I'll go back to my work then.

421
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,920
Poor guy.

422
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,720
I checked the security footage

423
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,640
and didn't see his mother enter
this restaurant either.

424
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,280
He came here alone.

425
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,800
Does he have something we can use
to identify his name?

426
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,560
He has an anklet.

427
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,280
Oh, well.

428
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,280
What's your name, little boy?

429
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,280
They are holding hands now.

430
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,200
Ning!

431
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,240
They are.

432
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,360
What's wrong, Vita?

433
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,600
Watch where you're going.

434
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,960
My boy!

435
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,200
My son!

436
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,640
Miss. Miss.

437
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,760
That's my baby.

438
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,200
Let go of me.

439
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,840
Miss.

440
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,960
What makes you think that he's
your child?

441
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,120
That's my baby!

442
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,040
No.

443
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,320
This isn't your baby.

444
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,680
Ming.

445
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,800
Let me deliver it.

446
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,360
How eager of you.

447
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,920
You just want to see Linda, don't you?

448
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,320
You know me.

449
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,640
However,

450
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,800
I do need

451
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,000
your expertise here.

452
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,400
Captain said

453
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,720
that this is urgent.

454
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,440
Don't worry.

455
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,320
What takes others three days to finish,

456
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,160
I'll only need three hours.

457
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,000
- No problem at all.
- Go, Ning.

458
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,640
You have wasted one minute already.

459
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,680
- Okay.
- Don't get carried away by Linda.

460
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
Yes.

461
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,680
How old is your baby?

462
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,640
Three.

463
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,640
No.

464
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,800
One.

465
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,080
How old is he?

466
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,880
Miss.

467
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
Give me back my child. He's hungry.

468
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,640
I need to feed him.

469
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,560
Please.

470
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,280
- He needs his milk now.
- Calm down, miss.

471
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,000
Miss.

472
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,440
How are you going to feed him?

473
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,080
Breastfeed?

474
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,080
I don't think so.

475
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,600
Because the stain
on your cardigan tells me

476
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,920
that it's baby formula.

477
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,960
If you're lactating,
it won't leave stains

478
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,360
in this pattern

479
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,040
and position.

480
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,040
You fed him baby formula.

481
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,240
He didn't like it so he struggled

482
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,880
and pushed the bottle away.

483
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,600
That's why there are wet spots
on your sleeves.

484
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,760
When I asked you how old your child is,

485
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,440
you hesitated between three

486
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,800
and one.

487
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,880
No mother

488
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,240
will forget her child's age.

489
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,920
Miss.

490
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,400
You can remain silent.

491
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,560
The result of the maternity test
will be out soon.

492
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,120
We will have the answer soon.

493
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,800
Don't look at me.

494
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,600
I'm a single man who doesn't know
how to look after a baby.

495
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,480
Me too.

496
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,000
Why won't he drink milk?

497
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,520
Captain.

498
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,800
Can we ask that impostor to feed him?

499
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,400
She's better
than all of us here, clearly.

500
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,240
No.

501
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,240
I agree with the captain.

502
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,080
We cannot trust the woman yet.

503
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,480
I'm giving up.

504
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,800
Vita.

505
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,880
Save me.

506
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,440
I'm...

507
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,520
Captain.

508
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,040
You should have used this
secret weapon earlier.

509
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,680
It's not mine.

510
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,880
It's Vita's.

511
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,600
Mine?

512
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,400
So sweet.

513
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,920
Vita, marry him already.

514
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,640
He's father material.

515
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,520
Let's stop.

516
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,440
We should buy some baby formula.
Let's go.

517
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,360
After you, Han.

518
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:55,920
Me?

519
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,520
Yes.

520
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,320
Wait.

521
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,320
Choo, choo.

522
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,920
That should cheer the baby up.

523
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,920
Choo, choo.

524
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,960
Do you like it?

525
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,240
Smile.

526
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,240
How is that my bubble gun?

527
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,480
I was supposed to invite you to a picnic

528
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,000
so I brought it with me.

529
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,080
However...

530
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,080
Right?

531
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,720
Right?

532
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,440
Let me play with it.

533
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,120
Bubbles!

534
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,720
We're back.

535
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,680
This is so cute.

536
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,040
Officer Ning,

537
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,440
Miss Linda is here.

538
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,800
Okay.

539
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,520
(Linda, medical examiner)
Oh.

540
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,240
Hey.

541
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,200
Han.

542
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,080
Let me do this.

543
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,000
Thank you for coming here, Miss Linda.

544
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,480
I owe you a meal.

545
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:04,880
Here, please.

546
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,760
Look at your desperate face.

547
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,080
Here.

548
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,720
Sample A and Sample B confirm

549
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,240
that they are not biologically related.

550
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,040
That means the woman you met
before the restaurant

551
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,920
is not the child's mother.

552
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,360
We have entered the baby's DNA

553
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,360
into the database of parents
who lost their babies.

554
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,200
We discovered

555
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,800
that the baby's parents
are in another province.

556
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,840
I have contacted them

557
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,200
and they are very relieved.

558
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,440
However, the baby's mother is still

559
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,600
reeling from shock after she lost
the baby two weeks ago.

560
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,600
The baby's father has to look after
the baby's mother

561
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,120
so he can't be here to pick the baby up.

562
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,720
Can you make the trip
to bring the baby home?

563
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,400
Sure.

564
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,480
Thanks.

565
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,120
- Then...
- Wow.

566
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,200
My job here is done. Bye.

567
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,880
As for the meal...

568
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,840
I'm just doing my duty.

569
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,600
I didn't do it for you.

570
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,000
So hot but so cold.

571
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,160
Ning.

572
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,560
Ming, don't add insult to injury.

573
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,840
What do you want?

574
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
I shall call you

575
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,200
Watermelon.

576
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,840
Linda!

577
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,000
Who's going to drive him home?

578
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,560
We should

579
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,920
let his parents do it.

580
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,320
Right? You want that, don't you?

581
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,240
A glass of warm milk.

582
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,760
It's from a famous place.

583
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,480
I queued up very early this morning
to buy it.

584
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,080
It's good for your health.

585
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,360
What's wrong?

586
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,480
What's bothering you?

587
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,360
Nothing.

588
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,400
You keep saying nothing.

589
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,840
I don't know what happened.

590
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,240
I can't read your mind.

591
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,720
Mu.

592
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,400
Is that you, Mu?

593
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,280
Po?

594
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,800
It's you.

595
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,480
So you own this

596
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,600
dessert place?

597
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,240
Hi.

598
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,160
I'm Wasu,

599
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,720
Mu's boyfriend.

600
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,920
I'm Po,

601
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,880
Mu's childhood friend.

602
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,240
Nice to meet you.

603
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,120
Hi.

604
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,560
Nice to meet you too.

605
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,640
Do you mind?

606
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,920
I'd like to speak with Mu in private

607
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,360
because we haven't seen

608
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,280
each other for a while.

609
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,240
Sure.

610
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,040
Just pretend that I'm not here.

611
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,760
Wasu.

612
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,000
Just go back first.

613
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,920
Okay.

614
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,600
Let's hang out after I finish work.

615
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:05,800
Mu.

616
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,720
You used to make desserts for me.

617
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,760
I miss them.

618
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,160
So how is your dessert place doing?

619
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,400
If it's doing well,

620
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,000
will you consider opening a branch?

621
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,640
It's extra revenue.

622
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,440
Hey.

623
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,720
It's for you.

624
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,480
Han.

625
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,280
How did the interrogation go?

626
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,680
Did she confess?

627
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,280
Not at all.

628
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,760
She keeps mumbling

629
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,600
that he's her baby.

630
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,920
When she isn't mumbling,

631
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,080
she sings.

632
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,080
It's torture, Han.

633
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,080
While Captain gets to go

634
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,840
on a family trip with the baby
and his girlfriend.

635
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,440
We have to do all the work.

636
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,120
I'm exhausted.

637
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,760
Missing Da, Han?

638
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,480
Hush.

639
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,680
Sorry, Ming.

640
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,920
Think before you speak. Let's go.

641
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,920
Sorry.

642
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,560
(Boonyavej Private Hospital)

643
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,320
Da.

644
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,840
Captain and Vita made their relationship

645
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,640
public.

646
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:14,000
So Ning lost 1,000 baht to us.

647
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,160
Poor him.

648
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,480
You know, when we were eating
at a restaurant yesterday,

649
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,560
a woman appeared,
searching for her baby.

650
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,200
It turns out

651
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,720
that the woman isn't the mother
of the baby.

652
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,320
Da.

653
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,160
When you're gone,

654
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,680
the team is a mess.

655
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,160
Peek-a-boo!

656
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,160
If you won't eat it,

657
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,920
I will.

658
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,120
You're home now, Watermelon.

659
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,360
So you are the death of Grandma Lek.

660
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,880
You must be a naughty kid, Pita.

661
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,200
Me?

662
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,720
Yes.

663
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,640
Pla is the most mischievous.

664
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,040
Grandma Lek.

665
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,640
No, I'm not mischievous.

666
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,480
Beibo is the mischievous one.

667
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,840
Pla!

668
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,040
You're talking behind my back again.

669
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,360
No.

670
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,240
Pla, you have a son now?

671
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,200
It's not mine. Don't make things up.

672
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,200
So you have this baby with another man

673
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,960
and asked Pla to raise him?

674
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,120
Hey! Watch your mouth.

675
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,400
Or is it that another woman
has this baby with you

676
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,240
and you asked Vita to raise him?

677
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,320
What are you talking about?

678
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:27,880
Pla.

679
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,560
You...

680
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,880
Grandma.

681
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,560
All right.

682
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,600
Don't just stand there.

683
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,800
Come inside.

684
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,400
Let me whip up some food.

685
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,280
Shake it gently.

686
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,720
Don't use boiling water.

687
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,320
Okay.

688
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:54,680
You two are as clueless as new parents.

689
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,560
You will be a good mother, Vita.

690
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,040
Oh, Grandma Lek.

691
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,760
All right. I'll stop teasing.

692
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,880
Why not spend a night here?

693
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,120
It's going to be dark soon
if you leave now.

694
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,480
Besides,

695
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,960
Watermelon looks tired.

696
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,440
Maybe he didn't get enough
sleep last night.

697
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,760
You two should rest too.

698
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,320
I'll look after Watermelon.

699
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,120
All right?

700
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,000
Okay.

701
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,520
I will sleep with Vita today.

702
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,240
Pla,
since you'll leave with her tomorrow,

703
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,920
just let me borrow Vita for one day.

704
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,880
Okay.

705
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:53,760
What's the matter?

706
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,280
Tell me.

707
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,760
I don't understand.

708
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,800
Why do you like Pla?

709
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,040
What does cheating have anything
to do with it?

710
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,280
I was just thinking

711
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,640
if you would cheat on him.

712
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,000
Like

713
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,440
I know Pla very well.

714
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:34,240
He works so hard that he
will neglect his girlfriend.

715
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,520
Sooner or later,

716
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,520
you will cheat on him.

717
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,760
I just want to find out

718
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,800
how likely that is.

719
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,360
Sigh.

720
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,760
It will never happen.

721
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,560
Pita is...

722
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,320
He

723
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,000
has a strong sense of justice.

724
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,640
He's responsible,

725
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,720
resilient,

726
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,800
and...

727
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,120
Very handsome.

728
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,680
Marry him then.

729
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,520
I will be your bridesmaid.

730
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,160
Make sure you toss the bouquet to me.

731
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,640
What are you on about?

732
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:22,920
Enough.

733
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,120
Sleep now.

734
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,040
Marry him, huh?

735
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,200
Sweet dreams.

736
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,320
Sweet dreams.

737
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,960
She needs her medications.

738
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,000
I don't think

739
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,640
she's mentally stable enough
to go through the interrogation.

740
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,000
This child trafficking case
is related to the Luger case.

741
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,480
It's time to revisit that case.

742
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,480
Yes, finally!

743
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,760
A lot of tourists went missing.

744
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:41,040
Other police stations also have
similar reports.

745
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,240
The higher-up treats this seriously

746
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,080
and wants us to get to the bottom of it.
