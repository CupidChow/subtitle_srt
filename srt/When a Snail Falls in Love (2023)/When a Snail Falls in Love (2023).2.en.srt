"When a Snail Falls in Love" by Ding Mo)

00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:41,091
This is

00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:42,131
Naga Temple.

6
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:45,731
(A tourist once saw the Naga here.)

7
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:47,411
(But that tourist)

8
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:50,091
(made a wish
and did not return to honor it.)

9
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:53,011
(The Naga Gem disappeared
from the altar,)

10
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:55,491
(and there were crawling marks
heading toward the exit.)

11
00:01:55,571 --> 00:01:56,451
(Where is my child?)

12
00:01:56,891 --> 00:01:57,811
(Where is my child?)

13
00:01:58,131 --> 00:01:59,011
(Where is my child?)

14
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:01,331
(Where is my child?)

15
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:03,011
(Where is my child?)

(Police Investigators Team)

17
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:15,451
She's going to get a hard time

18
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:16,891
from the captain.

19
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:19,091
Vita! Vita!

20
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:23,251
You only scored 50
on your physical exam,

21
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:24,651
and you want to be a police officer?

22
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:26,171
Dream on.

23
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:27,131
Report!

24
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:30,651
Violence cannot solve everything.

25
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:34,611
A lot of problems can be solved
using your brain wisely and analytically.

26
00:02:34,691 --> 00:02:35,331
Ning.

27
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:37,131
Say no more, Captain Han.

28
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:38,211
Yes.

29
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,291
You

30
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:40,771
are not fit for our department.

31
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:42,811
Get out of here now!

32
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:44,091
Captain.

33
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:45,931
Yes, new girl?

34
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,491
I was referring to the captain himself.

35
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:51,731
Nice acting.

36
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:55,331
- Sorry.
- Get to work.

37
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:01,571
Second Lieutenant
Marika Thansongpom (Ming).

38
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:04,811
Thank you for letting me
join this department.

39
00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:06,691
Don't mention it.

40
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,811
Now, it's all up to you.

41
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,051
We look forward to your performance.

42
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:15,811
I think I'll assign Officer Han

43
00:03:16,891 --> 00:03:17,931
to guide you.

44
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,611
I'm counting on you, Han.

45
00:03:20,971 --> 00:03:21,851
Yes.

46
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,651
I can help too.

47
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:27,691
I'll assist Mr. Han.

48
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:29,371
Captain,

49
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:30,691
did you hurt your hand?

50
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,211
Oh, it's not a big deal.

51
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:33,491
That doesn't look all right.

52
00:03:34,491 --> 00:03:35,331
I'm fine.

53
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:37,451
I was bitten by a dog.

54
00:03:39,411 --> 00:03:40,571
Listen up, everyone.

55
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:43,771
Focus on your jobs.

56
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:45,611
Don't meddle in matters

57
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:46,611
unrelated to this department.

58
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:48,051
Is that clear?

59
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:49,291
- Yes.
- Yes.

60
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:04,891
What is it?

61
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:07,171
Why did you use your vacation time…

62
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:08,931
Come in.

63
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:11,251
Captain.

64
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:13,051
Oh, Vita.

65
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,091
You're here too.

66
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:16,531
Captain.

67
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:19,131
This is my family's
ancestral trauma medicine.

68
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:20,611
I was bit by a dog when I was young too.

69
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:22,771
This works very well.

70
00:04:26,211 --> 00:04:27,171
A dog?

71
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:31,971
Yes. Some wild dog bit the captain.

72
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,971
It must be a ferocious dog
for biting his hand.

73
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:38,691
Stay put.

74
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:41,371
Sorry.

75
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,131
It was me.

76
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:48,051
It was an emergency.

77
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:54,131
Thank you, Ming.

78
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,011
All right.

79
00:04:58,611 --> 00:05:00,931
That's settled. You guys can leave now.

80
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:03,411
It was my fault for biting you…

81
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:04,211
Enough.

82
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:13,411
But I helped you catch the perpetrator.

83
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:18,051
Okay.

84
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:20,211
I'll cut to the chase.

85
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:23,651
Welcome to our department.

86
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,331
Wait and see.

87
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:33,851
I'll make you regret it.

88
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:41,291
I won't give you a chance to.

89
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:48,011
You got what you wanted.

90
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:51,011
What else do you want?

91
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,931
I want to talk to you about the museum.

92
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:00,091
(Police Investigators Team)

93
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,331
Is Vita here?

94
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,571
She's inside.

95
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:06,691
Thank you.

96
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,251
The museum case
is none of your business,

97
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,331
and I don't need you to get involved.

98
00:06:16,411 --> 00:06:18,451
I'm just trying to prove myself.

99
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:19,931
Do you not understand what I said?

100
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:22,291
I don't need your interference.

101
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:24,091
Get out.

102
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:33,451
I've compiled all the information,

103
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:35,571
but I don't know where to start.

104
00:06:35,651 --> 00:06:39,371
I've gone through all the news
about the missing Naga Gem case.

105
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:41,691
But before I do anything else,
I need to know this.

106
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:46,051
Why are you investigating this case
in your free time?

107
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:49,371
This clearly falls under
the responsibility of the local police.

108
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:53,211
I'm guessing
it's a personal matter for you.

109
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,931
But not a case for the department.
Am I right?

110
00:06:56,451 --> 00:07:00,051
There must be a connection
between you and the perpetrator.

111
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:02,291
Okay.

112
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:05,171
Today, you've shown me

113
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:09,491
your ability to speculate.

114
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:11,451
But you need to know

115
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:14,571
that I want subordinates
who can protect themselves.

116
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:17,091
I don't mind,

117
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:19,851
even if your analyzing skills
are only at Ming's level.

118
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:21,051
I don't care.

119
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:25,931
But you need to get at least 85
on your physical exam.

120
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:26,971
In two months,

121
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:30,811
I trust their analytical skills
will improve as well.

122
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:32,291
They might even surpass yours.

123
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:35,131
If Ming gets three months
to prove herself,

124
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:36,411
I deserve the same.

125
00:07:37,451 --> 00:07:38,851
You think

126
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:40,331
you can increase your score

127
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:43,731
by 35% in three months?

128
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:44,691
Yes.

129
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:47,731
If I fail,

130
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:49,251
I'll resign.

131
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:50,171
Fine.

132
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:52,371
You better keep your promise.

133
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:55,331
Now, can you leave?

134
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:04,811
How did it go?

135
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:07,291
Let's get back to work.

136
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:10,691
So that means you get to stay, right?

137
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:13,171
I'm on probation.

138
00:08:13,931 --> 00:08:15,531
But I'll be here for good

139
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:17,091
after three months.

140
00:08:18,371 --> 00:08:21,251
Vita always has me picking her up.

141
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:24,851
Even if I'm on a date,
one call, and I have to go.

142
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:28,251
She has always been like that.
Cute and lovable.

143
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:32,211
- Really?
- Oh, sorry. I forgot to introduce myself.

144
00:08:32,531 --> 00:08:34,611
(Wasu, business man)
Wasu Wasongkanachai.

145
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:36,091
It's nice to meet you all.

146
00:08:36,811 --> 00:08:38,771
Same surname? Is he her husband?

147
00:08:39,331 --> 00:08:40,371
He's right there.

148
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,931
Ask him yourself.

149
00:08:42,011 --> 00:08:43,371
Are you a couple?

150
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:44,531
- Brother.
- Little sister.

151
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:48,171
It's my little sister's
first day of work.

152
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:50,971
So I came to check on her.

153
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:52,451
I'm usually busy with work,

154
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:54,291
but I'm on annual leave right now.

155
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:57,411
Either way, since I'm here,

156
00:08:57,491 --> 00:09:00,651
I'll wait for you
so we can go home together, Vita.

157
00:09:00,731 --> 00:09:02,291
You can't get in, can you?

158
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:04,451
Wait here.

159
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:09,331
Turns out they were just siblings.
What a waste of time.

160
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:12,051
I could've read ten files.

161
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:23,091
Go home.

162
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:33,491
Chief.

163
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:46,651
Too heavy, don't you think?

164
00:09:49,851 --> 00:09:51,131
I think it's quite light.

165
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:54,011
I meant your actions.

166
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:55,931
You wanted to give her a chance.

167
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,811
Why are you so harsh to her?

168
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:04,731
Chief,

169
00:10:05,091 --> 00:10:07,851
excessive sugar intake
is not good for your health.

170
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:14,851
I know you think

171
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:16,691
I'm not giving her a chance.

172
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:20,611
But the fact is, if she complained

173
00:10:20,691 --> 00:10:22,971
to the higher-ups,

174
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:25,651
I wouldn't be able to refuse her.

175
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:28,811
This is a good chance
to make her accept reality.

176
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:31,251
To make her quit by herself.

177
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:33,971
She can't handle it.

178
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,771
I think she can.

179
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:37,971
She has skills.

180
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,211
Don't forget

181
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:41,091
we were all rookies once,

182
00:10:41,331 --> 00:10:42,731
standing on the same starting line.

183
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:50,931
I am Second Lieutenant Badin Unga.

184
00:10:51,371 --> 00:10:52,851
I'm a trainee officer.

185
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:55,931
I specialize in analysis,
assessing and determining criminal intent,

186
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:57,771
and criminal psychological profiling.

187
00:10:59,131 --> 00:10:59,971
Yes.

188
00:11:01,251 --> 00:11:01,931
Everyone has a chance

189
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:03,811
to stand on the starting line.

190
00:11:05,171 --> 00:11:08,051
But some of them could have their lives
in danger the minute they started.

191
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:11,451
Especially those
who can't protect themselves like Vita.

192
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:15,611
Naga!

193
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:19,811
We got a new case.

194
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:22,771
A kidnapping by Naga.

195
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:24,891
(Wan, 14, female,
white top, jeans, carrying a bag)

196
00:11:44,811 --> 00:11:47,411
Last night at 8:14 PM,

197
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:50,171
the local police received
a call from Ms. Mary.

198
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:54,451
She claimed her 16-year-old daughter
has been kidnapped by Naga.

199
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:58,011
There were no signs of fighting
at the crime scene.

200
00:11:58,611 --> 00:11:59,451
Except for

201
00:12:02,091 --> 00:12:02,851
traces of the Naga.

202
00:12:04,411 --> 00:12:05,891
- Really?
- Yes.

203
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:07,331
Where? Let me see it.

204
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:11,811
Only traces of the Naga were found.

205
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,411
I talked to Ms. Mary.

206
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:17,491
She's quite famous
in the underground lottery circle.

207
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:21,531
She once prayed to the Naga

208
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:25,971
and said that she would give them
her daughter if she won the lottery.

209
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:30,691
But she refused
to honor her wish after she won.

210
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,931
She angered the Naga,
and that's why her daughter was taken.

211
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:41,811
Report.

212
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,971
Recently, we've had
a lot of cases related to the Naga.

213
00:12:46,051 --> 00:12:49,451
I looked up similar cases
from the past five years.

214
00:12:49,531 --> 00:12:51,211
Could this case be…

215
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,091
(Don't say it.)

216
00:12:54,771 --> 00:12:55,611
(Don't say it.)

217
00:12:57,091 --> 00:12:58,571
Any other thoughts?

218
00:12:58,651 --> 00:12:59,811
Yes.

219
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:01,771
This case concerns religion.

220
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:04,731
Should we contact Ms. Mary?

221
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,731
We'll contact her

222
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:09,131
after we gather more information.

223
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:13,211
Or a psychiatrist.

224
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,371
She's so convinced. There might be
something wrong with her mentally.

225
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:22,891
If there are no issues,

226
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:24,611
then get the materials ready.

227
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:26,611
We'll leave
for the crime scene in an hour.

228
00:13:27,091 --> 00:13:28,011
- Yes.
- Yes.

229
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:37,771
Mr. Han.

230
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:41,291
Why didn't anyone react
when Ming said that?

231
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:42,931
Why did the captain change the subject?

232
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:45,331
Newbie, the first thing you have to know

233
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:47,011
is that the captain's principle
is always to have evidence

234
00:13:47,091 --> 00:13:48,771
before making any assessments,

235
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:51,091
or you might go down the wrong path.

236
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:54,251
Ming is new, so the captain let it pass.

237
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:56,131
Why did everyone go quiet

238
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,651
after she said that?

239
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,411
You ask too many questions.

240
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:05,931
Hold on.

241
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,971
Didn't the captain say to get ready?

242
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:09,851
Yes, everyone's going

243
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:11,011
except Vita.

244
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:13,931
Captain wants her to stay behind.

245
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:16,931
Stay here.

246
00:14:17,011 --> 00:14:17,931
Let's go.

247
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:25,811
Come in.

248
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:32,211
Why won't you let me go to the scene?

249
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:36,011
Come here, Han.

250
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:40,811
Put that on.

251
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:47,691
Don't tell me there's something

252
00:14:48,611 --> 00:14:49,611
going on

253
00:14:50,011 --> 00:14:51,691
between these two.

254
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,291
Do you think so, Han?

255
00:14:54,731 --> 00:14:56,451
Stop talking nonsense and get to work.

256
00:14:57,491 --> 00:14:58,891
Let me stay a little longer, Han.

257
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:04,611
You can tell me
if there's anything upsetting you.

258
00:15:05,411 --> 00:15:07,611
No need to make that face.

259
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:09,371
Um…

260
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:13,131
The day you saved me…

261
00:15:14,651 --> 00:15:15,851
The perpetrator

262
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:18,411
crushed this part…

263
00:15:19,651 --> 00:15:21,171
It still hurts.

264
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:23,651
I think

265
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:25,851
you're a little too close.

266
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,211
Anything can happen at the crime scene.

267
00:15:36,091 --> 00:15:37,531
Even if it's only a 1% chance,
you can't make mistakes,

268
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:38,611
including myself.

269
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:43,731
How will you protect yourself

270
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:46,531
if the criminal attacks?

271
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:49,171
Suppose this is a knife.

272
00:15:53,531 --> 00:15:54,411
Ready?

273
00:16:02,611 --> 00:16:03,771
One more time.

274
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:09,691
If this was a real knife,

275
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:11,731
you would be dead now.

276
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:13,131
Is that all you got?

277
00:16:13,211 --> 00:16:15,331
You want to join us on the battlefield,

278
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:17,211
but you can't even protect yourself.

279
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:21,011
Hey! You…

280
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:24,011
Let go!

281
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,811
What can you do besides biting?

282
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:34,331
You can't just use that
in an actual fight.

283
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:36,171
- I…
- You lost.

284
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,371
You're not going anywhere.

285
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:43,811
Captain!

286
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:45,051
But earlier…

287
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:48,091
You are not to act

288
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:50,011
without my order.

289
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,131
Do you understand?

290
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:54,811
Yes.

291
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:00,811
Nothing left at the crime scene.

292
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:03,051
Nothing

293
00:19:03,531 --> 00:19:05,091
on the second floor, either.

294
00:19:31,131 --> 00:19:32,211
Vita.

295
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:40,651
We're holding a welcome ceremony

296
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:43,451
for the newcomers,

297
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:46,251
but we haven't gotten to it yet.

298
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:48,131
Please help us plan it

299
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:51,971
while we're away.
Make sure to be surprised.

300
00:19:55,851 --> 00:19:56,611
Here.

301
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:19,211
(Ms. Mary's Tailoring,
for all your refitting needs)

302
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,251
(Ms. Mary's Tailoring,
for all your refitting needs)

303
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:32,731
(Energetic life!)

304
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:33,811
(Leg lift exercise)

305
00:20:40,691 --> 00:20:41,851
(Five times each session,
gradually increase two-three times)

306
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:58,451
Hello?

307
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:01,851
Vita, you can head back first.
No need to wait for us.

308
00:21:02,811 --> 00:21:04,851
We won't be back for another while.

309
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,491
(Ms. Mary,
the mother of the missing teenager,)

310
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:09,331
cleaned the entire place.

311
00:21:09,411 --> 00:21:10,091
(Sound of congested nose)

312
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:16,731
(Sound of congested nose)

313
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:46,371
All right. Thank you.

314
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:47,011
Okay.

315
00:21:47,091 --> 00:21:47,731
We'll be in touch.

316
00:21:47,811 --> 00:21:48,451
Okay.

317
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:53,491
Captain.

318
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:55,251
Sorry for my immature suggestion

319
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,691
at the meeting today.

320
00:21:59,331 --> 00:22:00,131
It's okay.

321
00:22:00,531 --> 00:22:03,731
But I've learned a lot from you

322
00:22:03,811 --> 00:22:05,331
in these few hours.

323
00:22:05,931 --> 00:22:07,491
If I have your guidance,

324
00:22:08,211 --> 00:22:11,411
I'm sure it won't be long
before I master everything.

325
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:16,691
Officer Han
has much more experience than I do.

326
00:22:17,611 --> 00:22:20,651
You should learn from him.

327
00:22:21,891 --> 00:22:26,691
But can I come to you
if I have any questions?

328
00:22:27,251 --> 00:22:29,411
If you observe my work carefully,

329
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:31,651
you'll know.

330
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:35,091
Get back to work.

331
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:01,731
(Ms. Mary's ritual offerings)

332
00:23:03,811 --> 00:23:04,971
(Ms. Mary, Wan's stepmother)

333
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,091
(Wan, missing girl)

334
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:10,251
(Unplugged lamp)

335
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:17,491
(Naga traces on the second floor)

336
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,171
The traces are all over the place.

337
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:48,451
The only entrance
the culprit could've come in from is…

338
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:52,171
Surprise!

339
00:23:54,051 --> 00:23:56,411
Didn't think I would be here, did you?

340
00:23:57,931 --> 00:23:59,211
Who are you?

341
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:01,931
Ma'am, this is a serious case.

342
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:03,931
Please give us your cooperation.

343
00:24:05,131 --> 00:24:06,811
I really can't tell you.

344
00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:10,051
How about this?

345
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:11,851
Let's put the Naga traces aside for now.

346
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:13,731
Let's talk about the lottery ticket.

347
00:24:14,131 --> 00:24:15,811
You won two million!

348
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,131
Can you tell me your secret?

349
00:24:18,211 --> 00:24:20,851
I regret it.

350
00:24:21,811 --> 00:24:24,051
If I could turn back time,

351
00:24:24,691 --> 00:24:27,051
I would rather have my daughter back
than the money.

352
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:30,251
I just want Wan back.

353
00:24:34,051 --> 00:24:36,011
Tissue, ma'am.

354
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:40,251
Yesterday,

355
00:24:40,411 --> 00:24:43,651
I went to the Naga Temple to pray.

356
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:45,931
The deity told me

357
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:48,411
they had taken my daughter.
She is in good hands.

358
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:54,491
What now, ma'am?

359
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:56,531
I hope

360
00:24:56,611 --> 00:24:59,731
my daughter will be happy.

361
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:04,811
Hehe… Hahaha…

362
00:25:07,011 --> 00:25:08,371
I've thought it through.

363
00:25:10,771 --> 00:25:11,771
I think it's best

364
00:25:12,851 --> 00:25:15,131
we leave her be.

365
00:25:19,211 --> 00:25:20,131
Ma'am.

366
00:25:21,531 --> 00:25:24,451
How about this, ma'am?

367
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:28,291
Tell me an auspicious date
to buy a lottery ticket.

368
00:25:30,491 --> 00:25:32,731
- Just buy it whenever you want.
- Don't be like that, ma'am.

369
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:34,291
Please?

370
00:25:34,651 --> 00:25:36,131
Is Wan your stepdaughter?

371
00:25:38,331 --> 00:25:39,531
Sorry.

372
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:41,211
Yes.

373
00:25:42,451 --> 00:25:44,171
Ever since her father passed away,

374
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:47,251
we have grown closer to each other.

375
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:51,011
Just like real mother and daughter.

376
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,371
When did you start
buying lottery tickets, ma'am?

377
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:54,851
It's been a few years.

378
00:25:55,451 --> 00:25:57,611
I see a lot of people
buying lottery tickets around here.

379
00:25:58,371 --> 00:25:59,691
Do you talk to them?

380
00:26:00,211 --> 00:26:01,131
Or

381
00:26:01,731 --> 00:26:03,931
buy lottery tickets from them?

382
00:26:04,491 --> 00:26:05,531
Never.

383
00:26:06,491 --> 00:26:07,611
Wan and I

384
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,091
just moved here.

385
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:10,451
We don't know them well.

386
00:26:12,931 --> 00:26:15,251
Are you going to arrest me
for buying illegal lottery tickets?

387
00:26:17,851 --> 00:26:18,811
No.

388
00:26:20,051 --> 00:26:21,651
Just routine inquiry.

389
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:27,411
I see Wan likes to take photos.

390
00:26:29,211 --> 00:26:29,891
Yes.

391
00:26:30,731 --> 00:26:33,411
Wan loves taking family photos.

392
00:26:34,851 --> 00:26:36,971
But she hasn't taken one with you.

393
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:43,251
Do you think she'll still be happy

394
00:26:44,331 --> 00:26:46,131
after getting taken away by the Naga,

395
00:26:46,491 --> 00:26:48,291
just as she is in the photos?

396
00:26:50,771 --> 00:26:52,891
I'm sure she will be happier

397
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:56,491
with the deity than with me.

398
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:44,811
Let's check out the abandoned temple
where Ms. Mary made her wish.

399
00:27:44,891 --> 00:27:46,691
Maybe we'll find new clues there.

400
00:28:31,931 --> 00:28:33,771
This is the Naga Temple, Captain.

401
00:28:34,811 --> 00:28:35,731
This way.

402
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:46,811
Da.

403
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:47,651
Yes.

404
00:28:47,731 --> 00:28:48,931
Search the area.

405
00:28:49,491 --> 00:28:50,251
Yes.

406
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:51,331
Mr. Han.

407
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,851
Where do you think you're going?

408
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:24,211
Lie down!

409
00:29:24,771 --> 00:29:25,691
Trying to run?

410
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:26,931
I'm sorry…

411
00:29:28,131 --> 00:29:29,331
Look closely.

412
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:31,531
This is what happens
to those who try to escape.

413
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,091
Trying to run?

414
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:34,571
Trying to escape?

415
00:29:35,331 --> 00:29:38,611
I'll teach you a lesson.

416
00:29:40,491 --> 00:29:41,691
You're not going anywhere.

417
00:30:15,651 --> 00:30:16,531
Did you do this?

418
00:30:16,891 --> 00:30:17,771
Yes.

419
00:30:33,451 --> 00:30:35,571
Do you know how much I spent on them?

420
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:38,651
I'm sorry, sir. She tried to run,
so I taught her a lesson…

421
00:30:41,211 --> 00:30:42,091
Listen here.

422
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:47,251
Get them food and water.

423
00:30:48,451 --> 00:30:49,371
Make sure they have what they need.

424
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:53,691
Or you'll end up like him.

425
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:55,611
Take care of him.

426
00:30:55,691 --> 00:30:56,571
Yes, sir.

427
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:10,571
Listen up.

428
00:31:11,691 --> 00:31:14,571
All of you are sacrifices for the Naga.

429
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:18,451
Don't get any ideas about running away.

430
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:24,291
You won't be able to escape.

431
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:27,251
The curse of the Naga

432
00:31:27,731 --> 00:31:29,491
will follow you.

433
00:31:47,971 --> 00:31:48,891
All done?

434
00:31:49,571 --> 00:31:51,211
We'll be leaving now.

435
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:52,211
Let's go.

436
00:31:58,971 --> 00:31:59,971
Captain.

437
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,011
Well?

438
00:32:01,091 --> 00:32:02,771
We've searched the area.

439
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:04,091
This temple has been abandoned
for a long time.

440
00:32:04,611 --> 00:32:06,771
No signs of entry or exit.

441
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:08,611
It's empty?

442
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:09,491
Yes.

443
00:32:09,571 --> 00:32:13,651
The empty space outside the temple shows
a lot of people coming here to worship.

444
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,371
Among the evidence,

445
00:32:15,451 --> 00:32:18,091
we found the same candles we saw
at Ms. Mary's house.

446
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:21,011
It seems she did come here
to make her wish.

447
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,331
We're in the middle of nowhere
in the woods.

448
00:32:23,411 --> 00:32:25,331
But fortunately,
we also found two eyewitnesses.

449
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:28,811
They said
that Ms. Mary did come here at night.

450
00:32:29,611 --> 00:32:31,211
But no one saw

451
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:34,051
her come here last Wednesday.

452
00:32:35,091 --> 00:32:36,571
Don't you think it's odd?

453
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:39,131
When we were at her house,

454
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,971
we didn't find any amulets or statues
of the Naga deity.

455
00:32:43,531 --> 00:32:45,531
Not even a single Buddhist necklace.

456
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:48,811
But she claims she worships the Naga.

457
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:52,651
That is suspicious.

458
00:32:53,051 --> 00:32:54,291
It's quite strange.

459
00:32:57,251 --> 00:32:58,371
Let's pack up.

460
00:32:58,451 --> 00:33:00,171
We won't find anything else here.

461
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:01,611
- Yes.
- Yes.

462
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:06,171
What's with you?

463
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,491
Who are you?

464
00:33:12,131 --> 00:33:13,371
Do you really not remember me?

465
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:15,971
It's only been a few days.

466
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:20,771
Maybe I wasn't so dressed up that day.

467
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:24,211
Look.

468
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:26,491
(Instagram, Zensitive, 100,000 likes)

469
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,011
Do you remember now?

470
00:33:30,371 --> 00:33:31,691
You know who I am now.

471
00:33:31,771 --> 00:33:35,851
Your next question must be
why I am here.

472
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,771
You said you were looking for me

473
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:41,611
to make me think
that you put in the effort to find me.

474
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:45,291
You showed me the photo
to show off all the followers you have.

475
00:33:45,371 --> 00:33:47,971
You're doing all of this to impress me.

476
00:33:48,931 --> 00:33:49,651
Don't pursue me.

477
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:53,091
You're direct, Miss Vita.

478
00:33:54,811 --> 00:33:55,891
Well, then,

479
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,971
why don't we get something to eat?

480
00:33:59,051 --> 00:34:00,331
I want to take you out on a meal.

481
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:01,531
I don't like you,

482
00:34:02,531 --> 00:34:04,971
and I don't care why you're here.

483
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:07,251
Leave. Right now.

484
00:34:07,331 --> 00:34:09,491
Unauthorized personnel
shouldn't be here.

485
00:34:11,011 --> 00:34:12,251
Oh, unauthorized personnel.

486
00:34:12,891 --> 00:34:14,611
Maybe that's the case
for ordinary people.

487
00:34:15,211 --> 00:34:18,851
But as the heir to a family
that donates to your department,

488
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:21,611
I believe I have special privileges.

489
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:24,771
In my opinion,

490
00:34:24,851 --> 00:34:26,411
I should have the authority

491
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,851
to access every desk
and every word in every document.

492
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:32,411
I'm talking. Where are you going?

493
00:34:32,491 --> 00:34:33,531
I have work to do.

494
00:34:35,731 --> 00:34:36,771
What work?

495
00:34:37,091 --> 00:34:38,931
I don't see anyone in the office.
Anyone here?

496
00:34:40,051 --> 00:34:42,011
They all went
to the crime scene, didn't they?

497
00:34:42,091 --> 00:34:45,291
They haven't brought back the evidence yet.
How are you going to investigate the case?

498
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:48,371
Am I wrong?

499
00:35:06,331 --> 00:35:09,291
See? I'm familiar with the process.

500
00:35:10,931 --> 00:35:13,011
You probably haven't been here
in a long time.

501
00:35:13,091 --> 00:35:15,491
That's why you don't know
how things work in the police these days.

502
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:23,811
(Silver Sea, Crown Sausage,
customer hot-line: 1999)

503
00:35:25,051 --> 00:35:26,491
Silver Sea?

504
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,251
What happened?

505
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:35,611
Do you want to see
the surveillance footage?

506
00:35:37,491 --> 00:35:38,811
Call?

507
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:40,971
What age is this?

508
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:43,931
By the time you get the footage,
the culprit will be long gone.

509
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:44,691
Hello?

510
00:35:45,451 --> 00:35:47,731
Can you shut up for two minutes?

511
00:35:50,811 --> 00:35:53,411
I just want to remind you
that the factory is a very small operation.

512
00:35:53,931 --> 00:35:56,091
You need to submit an application
to Mr. Sanchai if you want anything.

513
00:35:56,171 --> 00:35:58,691
But it's okay
if you don't want to hear it.

514
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:01,891
- Too bad.
- Wait.

515
00:36:03,171 --> 00:36:03,811
You know

516
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:05,971
the owner of the factory?

517
00:36:07,171 --> 00:36:07,931
Yes.

518
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:09,811
He's one of my suppliers.

519
00:36:09,891 --> 00:36:10,691
But

520
00:36:11,011 --> 00:36:13,691
I didn't think you'd want to know.
After all, I'm unauthorized personnel.

521
00:36:14,051 --> 00:36:15,531
I should go back.

522
00:36:21,251 --> 00:36:22,291
Da.

523
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:26,091
I want the surveillance footage
the first thing we get back to the office.

524
00:36:26,171 --> 00:36:26,931
Yes.

525
00:36:27,571 --> 00:36:30,251
Do a thorough investigation on Ms. Mary.

526
00:36:30,651 --> 00:36:34,411
Track all her activity and behavior.

527
00:36:34,811 --> 00:36:38,291
Focus on her last month's activity.

528
00:36:38,611 --> 00:36:39,691
- Yes.
- All right?

529
00:36:43,171 --> 00:36:44,811
I'm back!

530
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,291
You're finally back.

531
00:36:48,411 --> 00:36:49,211
Yes.

532
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,171
Ning.

533
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:51,011
Ming.

534
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:52,771
Look into the lottery ticket for me.

535
00:36:52,851 --> 00:36:53,531
- Huh?
- Huh?

536
00:36:54,491 --> 00:36:57,211
Ms. Mary doesn't interact
with her neighbors often.

537
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:58,891
But the neighborhood

538
00:36:58,971 --> 00:37:00,411
should know about the lottery tickets.

539
00:37:00,491 --> 00:37:04,251
You said she was close
with those who bought lottery tickets.

540
00:37:04,331 --> 00:37:06,011
It shouldn't be too hard to investigate.

541
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:08,891
Even if she won the lottery,

542
00:37:08,971 --> 00:37:10,811
that's illegal.

543
00:37:10,891 --> 00:37:12,331
It's not
the government-approved lottery.

544
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,571
But think about it.

545
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:17,011
If she did win two million,

546
00:37:17,771 --> 00:37:19,331
why was the furniture we saw

547
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:21,011
still so old?

548
00:37:21,091 --> 00:37:23,451
It didn't seem like
she bought anything new

549
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:27,251
or items that could
improve her living condition.

550
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:28,851
I'm not judging her,

551
00:37:29,651 --> 00:37:31,291
but if a common family

552
00:37:31,371 --> 00:37:33,171
won that much money,

553
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,011
they would want to get a new car, house,

554
00:37:35,091 --> 00:37:36,411
or buy gold, at least.

555
00:37:36,491 --> 00:37:39,531
So you think that she's lying
about winning the lottery,

556
00:37:39,611 --> 00:37:41,011
Captain?

557
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:43,331
If she could lie about that,

558
00:37:43,851 --> 00:37:47,411
then she could lie
about what happened to her daughter.

559
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:48,211
Yes.

560
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:52,611
(Police Investigators Team)

561
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:55,691
Vita, why are you still here?

562
00:37:57,731 --> 00:37:58,611
I…

563
00:37:59,731 --> 00:38:01,451
Care to explain?

564
00:38:01,531 --> 00:38:03,531
Oh, don't be so mean.

565
00:38:04,091 --> 00:38:07,851
I came to see Miss Vita
to thank her for saving my family

566
00:38:07,931 --> 00:38:10,771
and pay a visit to Mr. Indesh,

567
00:38:10,851 --> 00:38:12,211
the chief.

568
00:38:13,811 --> 00:38:14,691
Da.

569
00:38:14,771 --> 00:38:15,491
Yes.

570
00:38:15,571 --> 00:38:17,931
Give the chief a call.

571
00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:20,611
- Tell him he has a visitor.
- Yes.

572
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:23,091
Tell him it's Sen
from the Zaiyongdanacai family.

573
00:38:23,171 --> 00:38:24,491
He'll know.

574
00:38:25,411 --> 00:38:26,971
Mr. Sen.

575
00:38:27,251 --> 00:38:28,891
I think you should go back.

576
00:38:29,571 --> 00:38:32,211
I can't, Miss Vita.
I have unfinished business.

577
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:33,771
I'm waiting to see the chief.

578
00:38:34,171 --> 00:38:36,651
The chief says he is on his way.

579
00:38:38,131 --> 00:38:38,771
Perfect.

580
00:38:38,851 --> 00:38:40,851
Feel free to wait around.

581
00:38:41,331 --> 00:38:42,451
As for you,

582
00:38:42,891 --> 00:38:43,691
pack your things

583
00:38:43,771 --> 00:38:44,571
and go home.

584
00:38:45,971 --> 00:38:46,931
Yes.

585
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:49,851
You're going home?

586
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:01,251
Come in.

587
00:39:02,571 --> 00:39:03,651
The surveillance footage.

588
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,211
That's fast.
It hasn't even been five minutes.

589
00:39:11,731 --> 00:39:13,251
Vita got it.

590
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,611
As soon as she learned that the evidence
at the crime scene had been destroyed,

591
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:17,491
she immediately
started looking for new clues.

592
00:39:18,771 --> 00:39:21,931
She said it was thanks
to that rich young master

593
00:39:22,771 --> 00:39:24,451
that we got the footage so quickly.

594
00:39:32,491 --> 00:39:34,331
Aren't you going to praise her?

595
00:39:34,851 --> 00:39:36,971
She made the same analysis
as you several times.

596
00:39:59,211 --> 00:40:00,251
Captain?

597
00:40:00,451 --> 00:40:01,371
Captain.

598
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:03,971
(Police Cadet Academy)

599
00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:14,851
Here.

600
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:18,251
Present for the new police officer.

601
00:40:22,011 --> 00:40:22,851
Don't look so confused.

602
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:26,771
I'm just celebrating
my only sister getting a new job.

603
00:40:30,331 --> 00:40:32,331
This is a great watch.

604
00:40:32,411 --> 00:40:34,211
- I have one too.
- Wasu.

605
00:40:35,731 --> 00:40:38,011
Don't bother me. I'm working.

606
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:42,171
Vita,

607
00:40:44,131 --> 00:40:45,371
aren't you going to take a break?

608
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:47,771
You've been sitting here
for almost an hour.

609
00:40:49,571 --> 00:40:50,411
What are you watching?

610
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:55,371
Just people moving around?

611
00:40:56,891 --> 00:41:01,811
I might be able to save
a girl's life by watching this.

612
00:41:05,611 --> 00:41:06,731
Okay.

613
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:08,131
But there isn't anything much.

614
00:41:08,211 --> 00:41:12,371
A person walks in from this image
and then walks out from another image.

615
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:14,611
Look at this person.

616
00:41:16,411 --> 00:41:17,251
Eh?

617
00:41:22,251 --> 00:41:23,331
Did you see that?

618
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:24,851
Yes.

619
00:41:24,931 --> 00:41:26,251
Beautiful.

620
00:41:27,771 --> 00:41:29,011
So beautiful.

621
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,651
I found a lead.

622
00:41:47,611 --> 00:41:48,291
Vita,

623
00:41:48,851 --> 00:41:49,611
did you forget something?

624
00:41:50,651 --> 00:41:52,371
Perfect timing.
I was just about to lock everything.

625
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,251
Has the Captain left?

626
00:41:56,491 --> 00:41:57,771
I don't know.

627
00:41:58,171 --> 00:42:00,051
He was watching
the surveillance footage.

628
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:02,451
Then, he suddenly went out
without saying anything.

629
00:42:03,331 --> 00:42:04,851
Is there something you want to tell him?

630
00:42:05,411 --> 00:42:06,211
Well,

631
00:42:07,211 --> 00:42:10,731
if we find a potential witness,

632
00:42:10,811 --> 00:42:13,131
do we need the captain's permission

633
00:42:13,211 --> 00:42:15,571
before we approach them?

634
00:42:16,011 --> 00:42:16,731
I

635
00:42:17,571 --> 00:42:21,531
saw a woman wearing beige
in the footage.

636
00:42:22,011 --> 00:42:24,731
She should have been present
at the time of the crime.

637
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,371
Actually,

638
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:30,891
we have to report everything
to the captain

639
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:32,931
and get his permission
before doing anything.

640
00:42:36,091 --> 00:42:38,371
But seeing how he left in such a hurry,

641
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:42,291
I don't think we'll be able
to reach him any time soon.

642
00:42:45,051 --> 00:42:47,651
If you think that person
might be a witness,

643
00:42:48,091 --> 00:42:49,691
I can help you investigate her.

644
00:42:51,371 --> 00:42:52,411
What about the captain?

645
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:54,651
You guys always think alike.

646
00:42:54,731 --> 00:42:57,091
He probably found the same thing as you.

647
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:01,931
I happen to have made a program today

648
00:43:02,011 --> 00:43:05,131
that can help us find the person
in the footage.

649
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:06,971
I'll help you find her.

650
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,011
Will it take long?

651
00:43:09,531 --> 00:43:10,491
Two hours.

652
00:43:12,971 --> 00:43:13,611
Okay.

653
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,771
I'll take it back
and work on it at home.

654
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:17,451
I'll help you lock up.

655
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:20,331
Take it easy.

656
00:44:04,891 --> 00:44:05,971
(Crown Sausage Factory)

657
00:44:31,051 --> 00:44:32,491
(Crown Sausage)

658
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:43,731
Why are you here?

659
00:44:44,691 --> 00:44:46,291
This factory was ordered
to shut down temporarily.

660
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:49,891
So these cars must be here
for other purposes.

661
00:44:49,971 --> 00:44:51,211
After watching the video,

662
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:53,251
you knew that they purposely
parked the cars here

663
00:44:53,331 --> 00:44:55,091
to block the camera on the other side.

664
00:44:55,171 --> 00:44:57,091
It's likely that these cars…

665
00:45:10,091 --> 00:45:11,091
You…

666
00:45:15,051 --> 00:45:16,131
Stop!

667
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,331
Where are you going?

668
00:45:20,771 --> 00:45:21,611
It's dangerous!

669
00:45:24,451 --> 00:45:25,531
What's wrong with you?

670
00:45:25,611 --> 00:45:27,251
That's my question. Why are you here?

671
00:45:28,211 --> 00:45:30,171
There are over 15 cars here.

672
00:45:30,251 --> 00:45:32,131
There should be
more than one person in each car.

673
00:45:32,211 --> 00:45:34,211
That means
there are more than 15 people.

674
00:45:34,811 --> 00:45:37,371
It would be dangerous for you
to infiltrate alone.

675
00:45:39,011 --> 00:45:39,891
You.

676
00:45:43,451 --> 00:45:45,171
I'm not here for the case.

677
00:45:45,251 --> 00:45:46,091
Then…

678
00:46:10,891 --> 00:46:12,051
Black Lion.

679
00:46:21,611 --> 00:46:22,251
Watch out!

680
00:46:27,371 --> 00:46:28,251
Vita!

681
00:46:55,211 --> 00:46:56,571
Who gave you permission to come here?

682
00:47:00,171 --> 00:47:01,771
I'm not here for work.

683
00:47:02,531 --> 00:47:04,291
I came to warn you.

684
00:47:04,371 --> 00:47:05,411
Warn me?

685
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:10,731
I'm still a police officer.

686
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,651
Ensuring the safety of the people

687
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:15,251
is my duty.

688
00:47:15,571 --> 00:47:16,971
That includes you.

689
00:47:17,051 --> 00:47:19,571
Are you saying you were protecting me?

690
00:47:20,651 --> 00:47:23,491
You, who could barely stand
after running 50 meters?

691
00:47:24,491 --> 00:47:26,411
I can walk faster than you.

692
00:47:27,131 --> 00:47:29,691
Even if I can't stop the enemy by force,

693
00:47:31,091 --> 00:47:32,171
I can use my analytical skills

694
00:47:32,251 --> 00:47:33,931
to prevent danger.

695
00:47:34,011 --> 00:47:35,171
Listen to me.

696
00:47:36,411 --> 00:47:37,411
I don't need it.

697
00:47:37,491 --> 00:47:39,091
Who is Black Lion?

698
00:47:40,051 --> 00:47:42,411
Why did you pause
when you heard that name?

699
00:47:43,011 --> 00:47:44,531
That name means something to you.

700
00:47:45,171 --> 00:47:48,371
Also, your left shoulder
was not wounded.

701
00:47:48,451 --> 00:47:52,531
It's possible that an old injury
recurred when you were dodging.

702
00:47:53,011 --> 00:47:55,091
Does that old injury
have anything to do with Black Lion?

703
00:47:55,171 --> 00:47:56,051
Enough!

704
00:47:59,851 --> 00:48:01,251
If you want to analyze,

705
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:03,091
go back and analyze the case.

706
00:48:04,371 --> 00:48:07,291
Or I'll cut your assessment period
down to two months.

707
00:48:10,651 --> 00:48:12,371
If you're referring to Ms. Mary's case,

708
00:48:12,451 --> 00:48:14,491
I found a key eyewitness.

709
00:48:47,051 --> 00:48:49,131
Nice going, Vita.

710
00:48:49,211 --> 00:48:52,211
You found a witness in a day.

711
00:48:52,291 --> 00:48:53,571
Impressive.

712
00:48:54,251 --> 00:48:55,531
It was Da.

713
00:48:56,251 --> 00:48:58,451
He helped me find Miss Mu.

714
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:01,891
That guy…

715
00:49:01,971 --> 00:49:04,411
I don't see him helping us, Han.

716
00:49:09,931 --> 00:49:11,611
Miss Mu, who was at the scene,

717
00:49:12,451 --> 00:49:13,531
is here.

718
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,500
(Mu, boss of the dessert shop)

719
00:49:32,931 --> 00:49:34,571
She is blind?

720
00:49:34,651 --> 00:49:36,371
What can she see?

721
00:49:55,611 --> 00:49:56,931
(The Naga Gang)

722
00:49:57,011 --> 00:49:58,811
(traffics underage girls)

723
00:49:58,891 --> 00:50:02,931
(and sells them into prostitution
across borders.)

724
00:50:03,371 --> 00:50:06,131
(The gang is a group
of believers who worship Naga.)

725
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:09,131
(Every one of them
carries the tattoo of Naga.)

726
00:50:09,531 --> 00:50:10,651
(Luger)

727
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,611
(was killed by Black Lion.)

728
00:50:13,171 --> 00:50:15,291
(His subordinates were captured.)

729
00:50:16,011 --> 00:50:17,771
(The Naga Gang case was closed.)

730
00:50:20,691 --> 00:50:23,131
(Could it be that the gang
is not completely eradicated?)

731
00:50:24,531 --> 00:50:25,531
Eig.
