3
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,300
(An adaptation of the novel
"When a Snail Falls in Love" by Ding Mo)

4
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,130
Vita.

5
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,530
Why don't you turn on the lights?

6
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,810
I don't want to attract attention.

7
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,410
What are you doing here?

8
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:08,569
I'm looking for answers.

9
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:10,889
What do you want to know?

10
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:17,929
If Mr. Han was investigating Luger's case,

11
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:20,009
why didn't we know about it?

12
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:23,169
I wouldn't be surprised if Ming and I didn't know.

13
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:25,769
But even Da and Ning never noticed anything.

14
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:27,089
Even you

15
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:29,289
were kept in the dark.

16
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,209
Isn't this strange?

17
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:33,729
Mr. Han may have been
given some secret mission.

18
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:37,369
After all, he's an experienced cop.

19
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:40,569
He's also a good fighter
in close-quarters combat.

20
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:43,609
Do you think it's that easy for
ordinary criminals to get close to him?

21
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:45,769
Could it be that it's done
by mercenaries?

22
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:53,609
This doesn't look like
his style of dressing.

23
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:12,729
Assignment of guns.

24
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:14,969
A power of attorney for me.

25
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:21,569
This is

26
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,489
a sketch of the masked man.

27
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:27,689
Was Mr. Han investigating the
human trafficking case himself?

28
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:30,969
What does it have to do
with a power of attorney?

29
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:41,729
Captain.

30
00:04:41,809 --> 00:04:42,449
Yes?

31
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:45,289
Come with me to the armory sometime.

32
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:46,129
Why, Mr. Han?

33
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:49,129
I would like to show you
a new Glock 19 in its third generation.

34
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:50,729
Okay.

35
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,289
Are you going home?

36
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:05,889
But it's late now.

37
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:07,689
Do you want to stay
at my place for the night?

38
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,209
My home is closer to the shooting club.

39
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:13,329
So you can get more rest.

40
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:30,649
You can sleep in my room tonight.

41
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:33,649
It's the first room
on the right upstairs.

42
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,640
Okay, Pita.

43
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:37,929
Alright.

44
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:41,889
Just get

45
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:44,689
the clothes from the wardrobe.

46
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:47,689
They might be a bit big,
so you'll have to make do with them.

47
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:49,889
Okay.

48
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:51,329
Get some rest after taking a shower.

49
00:05:51,929 --> 00:05:53,729
I'll just sleep in the guest room.

50
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:56,049
Alright.

51
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,289
Goodnight.

52
00:05:58,329 --> 00:05:59,329
Goodnight.

53
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:22,969
Captain, your shooting skills are good.

54
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,009
I need to be more accurate.

55
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:25,889
I nearly shot the hostage today

56
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:28,129
when I rescued him.

57
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:30,689
If I were more accurate,

58
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:32,209
the risk would be reduced next time.

59
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:35,849
Again.

60
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:40,089
Spread your legs a little wider.

61
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:43,489
I forgot again.

62
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,089
I think you need another pair of shoes.

63
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:47,689
Sometimes, it's the slightest difference

64
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:51,409
that can make all the difference
in a critical moment.

65
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:53,929
I'll try again.

66
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:54,820
Okay.

67
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:03,009
Do you know that what I am most proud of

68
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:05,969
is the title, Sharpshooter?

69
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:10,369
Then you must have
something up your sleeve.

70
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:12,609
Teach it to me.

71
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:15,169
Gosh, that's my secret skill.

72
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,289
I always put a bullet in the barrel
of my gun before I go on a mission,

73
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:23,689
which means I have an extra
bullet on top of a full magazine.

74
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:25,769
That's the one

75
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:27,249
that saved my life many times.

76
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:31,820
Wouldn't that be too dangerous?

77
00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:33,249
No.

78
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:35,209
I'm a man of good luck.

79
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:37,209
Why is it that whenever
I'm investigating the Luger case,

80
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,329
someone I love leaves me?

81
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,649
Last time, it was Badin

82
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:47,609
and this time, it's Mr. Han.

83
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:51,689
I'm afraid that the next time...

84
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:58,649
Do you think I should not
reopen the Luger case?

85
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:08,129
Are you afraid I will leave you?

86
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,409
I'll be fine.

87
00:09:15,249 --> 00:09:16,209
Vita.

88
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,169
I'll never let you leave me.

89
00:09:34,729 --> 00:09:35,809
I swear,

90
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,289
okay?

91
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:34,529
This is the second time
we've met, Miss Vita.

92
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:36,209
Hi, Aunt.

93
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:42,089
Mum,

94
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:43,649
good morning.

95
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:46,209
I will not approve

96
00:10:46,289 --> 00:10:48,009
of you marrying someone
who is also a cop.

97
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:50,009
You'd better quit as soon as possible.

98
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:53,409
The company can't reserve
a position for you for that long.

99
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:54,929
If they can't wait,

100
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:56,449
they don't have to wait, Mum.

101
00:10:57,169 --> 00:10:59,929
Vita and I will continue
to be cops no matter what.

102
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:02,049
Wait a minute.

103
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:09,009
And I

104
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,569
must marry Vita.

105
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:16,289
I hope to have your blessing.

106
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:20,609
But if you don't give us your blessing,

107
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:22,409
we won't bother you.

108
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:37,169
Pita.

109
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:47,409
Vita.

110
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:49,249
I'll give you a big surprise

111
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:50,929
when the Luger case is closed.

112
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:56,609
But you just surprised me
with a proposal, didn't you?

113
00:11:56,689 --> 00:11:58,369
That wasn't formal enough.

114
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,849
There will be a more formal one later.

115
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:14,969
This is the third generation of Glock 19
stored in the armory by Officer Han.

116
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:17,409
Thank you.

117
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:19,369
Help yourself then.

118
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:33,449
It's the same model as
the gun in Mr. Han's photo.

119
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:44,529
What is Mr. Han trying to tell me?

120
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:16,089
(Captain,)

121
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:19,569
(the envelope contained information
and clues about the Luger gang)

122
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:21,569
(that I've gathered in recent years.)

123
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:23,609
(I didn't tell you about it.)

124
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:25,409
(It includes some case files,)

125
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:27,449
(statements from the victims)

126
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:29,769
(and all the evidence
I could get my hands on.)

127
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:32,489
(If you had found
this envelope yourself,)

128
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:34,529
(I would have been killed.)

129
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:37,249
(You must be extra careful.)

130
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:39,049
(I suspect)

131
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:40,649
(that there are undercover agents)

132
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:43,569
(of the Luger gang lurking
within our police force.)

133
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:46,929
Who have you met in the last two weeks?

134
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:50,769
Officer Han.

135
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:53,489
Aren't you close?

136
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,049
What did he come to see you for?

137
00:13:57,889 --> 00:13:59,169
What did he badmouth me about?

138
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:01,809
No.

139
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:05,769
I just want to know what
Officer Han talked to you about.

140
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:08,409
He talked to me a lot.

141
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:12,489
About what?

142
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:14,049
You should know that.

143
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:15,489
Women,

144
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:16,569
drugs,

145
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:17,609
children

146
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:19,769
and more.

147
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:21,649
Are you his informant?

148
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:22,809
Yes.

149
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:24,369
Sort of.

150
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:27,649
Where did they take the girls?

151
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:29,009
Listen,

152
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:31,929
you'll never find those
women and children.

153
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:33,729
Why?

154
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:35,209
Naga

155
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:37,809
reaches every corner of darkness.

156
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:40,649
There are demons in his eyes.

157
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:51,809
I'd like to remind you

158
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:54,009
not to say such nonsense.

159
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:57,209
If you cooperate,

160
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:02,089
I can apply to the authorities for you
to be transferred to a better prison

161
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,929
or even submit an application
for a reduced sentence.

162
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:07,249
Think about it yourself.

163
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:14,129
Fine.

164
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:18,409
You'd like to know about Luger,

165
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:19,609
right?

166
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:35,729
What information did Officer Han
ask you to find out for him?

167
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:39,129
Mr. Han came to see me

168
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:42,569
because I know the drug dealers
who supply Luger with drugs.

169
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:45,649
So the girls are injected with drugs?

170
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:46,569
That's right.

171
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:48,289
Something like that.

172
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:51,649
Luger is best at using
the weaknesses of human nature.

173
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:52,849
The greed for money,

174
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:55,289
the greed for power

175
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:57,809
or the greed for position.

176
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:00,249
How do I find the drug dealers?

177
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:02,569
Let me out

178
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:04,409
and I'll take you there myself.

179
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:06,929
That's what Mr. Han promised me before.

180
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:08,849
Okay.

181
00:16:10,729 --> 00:16:12,129
But we have to agree on some conditions.

182
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:13,809
I know

183
00:16:14,969 --> 00:16:16,489
why you came to see me.

184
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:19,809
Mr. Han is dead, right?

185
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:23,049
I had warned him.

186
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:25,169
May I remind you

187
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:28,009
that you're going to have
a hard time finding them.

188
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:30,169
Even that old man is dead.

189
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:31,769
Tell me,

190
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:34,729
what can I do to find Luger?

191
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:38,409
It's hard to find Luger,

192
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:41,009
but it's possible to find Mai.

193
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:43,849
- Who is Mai?
- That drug dealer.

194
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:45,649
The stuff he makes

195
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:49,289
can make those insatiable women

196
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:51,889
feel like they're in heaven.

197
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,849
That's why Luger

198
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:56,249
chooses to purchase his stuff.

199
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:58,569
How can I get to see him?

200
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:07,009
Vita,

201
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:08,409
I'd like to ask you something.

202
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:12,689
Where is Captain?

203
00:17:13,889 --> 00:17:14,769
I don't know.

204
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,609
How could you not know?

205
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:20,089
You're with Captain all day, aren't you?

206
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:22,089
Tell us, Vita.

207
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:23,369
Da,

208
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:25,289
I'm not his superior.

209
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:29,249
You're not his superior,
but you're his girlfriend.

210
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,489
Do you really not know where he's been?

211
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:32,969
Hey.

212
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:34,689
What's wrong with you,

213
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:35,609
Ning,

214
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:36,889
Da?

215
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:38,769
Vita,

216
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:40,769
don't complicate things.

217
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:45,489
Has the captain gone off
on a mission alone again?

218
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:53,729
Vita.

219
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:57,689
- Vita.
- Vita.

220
00:17:58,329 --> 00:17:59,489
Tell us where Captain is.

221
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:00,649
We're serious.

222
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:04,049
(Missing Children Case File)

223
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:12,009
What are you doing?

224
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:14,969
We are asking Officer Vita

225
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:16,529
about the whereabouts of Captain.

226
00:18:16,969 --> 00:18:17,849
We're worried about him.

227
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:21,609
Captain Pla has asked me for leave.

228
00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:23,049
That's strange.

229
00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:24,769
He used to tell us about it,

230
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:26,609
but he didn't tell us this time.

231
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,289
You're not Chief,

232
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,920
so why should Captain report to you?

233
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:31,369
Well,

234
00:18:31,449 --> 00:18:32,769
I'm going out for a while.

235
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,649
Where are you going?

236
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:35,969
I...

237
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:38,969
I'm meeting the other two girls who were
kidnapped from the nightclub last time.

238
00:18:39,489 --> 00:18:40,889
They have new leads.

239
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:42,729
Shall I accompany you?

240
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:44,369
It's alright, Ming.

241
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:46,129
I can go by myself.

242
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:49,289
How about this, Ming?

243
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:52,089
Please sort out the information
I need and send it to my office later.

244
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:53,529
Okay.

245
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:55,169
Where are you going?

246
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:57,529
I have a date with my wife.

247
00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:00,089
I envy your wife.

248
00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:02,049
There is nothing to envy.

249
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:05,409
We're just an old married couple,
nothing special.

250
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:14,889
Did you meet this man before?

251
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:16,769
This man...

252
00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:19,049
I think

253
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:20,889
I saw him somewhere before.

254
00:19:24,018 --> 00:19:25,298
I remember now.

255
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:26,209
Where did you see him?

256
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:27,649
I think it was a factory.

257
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:29,049
But it's dark in there.

258
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:31,929
This man was also in the factory, right?

259
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:33,009
Yes.

260
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:37,049
And did you interact with each other
or see any of his actions?

261
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:40,489
I don't remember about it.

262
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,169
At the time, I thought
he was a bad guy too.

263
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:46,889
Alright.

264
00:19:47,249 --> 00:19:50,969
By the way, do you remember
the girl wearing pink camisole

265
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:52,849
who was caught with you?

266
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:54,849
I do.

267
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:56,169
She was dragged out.

268
00:19:56,849 --> 00:19:58,089
Where was she dragged?

269
00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:01,969
Well, didn't the police
take all of us victims out?

270
00:20:02,861 --> 00:20:05,929
But I can't find this girl
in the register.

271
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:10,769
Maybe she didn't want to go home
and ran away on her own.

272
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:19,009
What's wrong?

273
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,529
I think a car is following us.

274
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:26,529
Could it be them?

275
00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:28,809
Calm down.

276
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:33,369
You've been to the hospital
for a medical check-up, right?

277
00:20:33,969 --> 00:20:34,809
Yes.

278
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:38,089
Because some of us girls were raped

279
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:42,009
and some of us were forced
to be injected with drugs.

280
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:52,169
I think you should get in the car now.

281
00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:53,089
I'll send you home.

282
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:54,689
Thank you.

283
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:55,409
Okay.

284
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:16,249
Thank you.

285
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:33,329
Hello, Vita.

286
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:34,089
(Pita.)

287
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,169
(I met up with the two victims today)

288
00:21:36,249 --> 00:21:40,089
but there was a suspicious white car
that seemed to be following me.

289
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:41,089
What about now?

290
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:42,249
(I don't see it following me now.)

291
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:43,009
(Pita,)

292
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:43,929
could it be

293
00:21:44,649 --> 00:21:46,609
that the Luger gang had figured it out

294
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:48,489
(and sent someone to follow me?)

295
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:49,529
(I'm sure)

296
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:50,689
there's a mole in the station.

297
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:53,649
This unregistered girl

298
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:56,049
was lost by the police.

299
00:21:56,609 --> 00:21:57,609
Okay.

300
00:21:57,689 --> 00:21:59,009
You must be careful.

301
00:21:59,449 --> 00:22:00,449
Alright, Pita.

302
00:22:26,249 --> 00:22:27,209
Hi, mister.

303
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:28,129
Hi.

304
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:32,409
How is my wife doing now?

305
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:34,529
She's in good shape today.

306
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:37,489
Your wife is still up. Please go in.

307
00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:38,329
Thank you.

308
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:48,329
Don't worry. Let me help you.

309
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:54,929
Are you busy in the office?

310
00:22:56,689 --> 00:22:58,809
It's been the same
every day for decades.

311
00:22:58,889 --> 00:23:00,769
Then what are you doing here?

312
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:02,929
Why don't you go home and get some rest?

313
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:05,449
What are you doing here

314
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:07,409
at this late hour?

315
00:23:08,729 --> 00:23:10,209
Don't say that.

316
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:13,849
Now that there are young people
at the station,

317
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:16,289
so I can spare time to see you.

318
00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:19,969
Let me get you some food.

319
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:20,969
It's alright.

320
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:24,729
Just stay with me and talk to me.

321
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,249
What's wrong, Darling?

322
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:32,489
You have suffered so much for me.

323
00:23:32,969 --> 00:23:34,649
Just leave me alone.

324
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:40,689
I won't give up on you.

325
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:42,649
Hold on a little longer.

326
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:44,809
You're going to be transferred
to another hospital.

327
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:48,689
By then, everything will be fine.

328
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:03,609
Listen here,

329
00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:05,489
you're not my burden,

330
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,329
and yet you're my life.

331
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:09,249
I've been working hard
for you all my life.

332
00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:11,489
You must stay strong with me too.

333
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:13,809
One day,

334
00:24:13,889 --> 00:24:15,209
you'll be the same as before

335
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,129
and we can live happily ever after.

336
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:19,009
Cheer up.

337
00:25:00,329 --> 00:25:01,409
You're Mai, right?

338
00:25:01,489 --> 00:25:02,769
Who are you?

339
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:04,649
Are you supplying drugs to Luger?

340
00:25:06,329 --> 00:25:07,209
Darn it.

341
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:08,169
Who sold me out?

342
00:25:08,249 --> 00:25:09,409
Answer me!

343
00:25:12,689 --> 00:25:13,489
Come with me.

344
00:26:15,689 --> 00:26:17,769
I need help. I'll send you
the address later.

345
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:44,409
This is my henchman.

346
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:45,929
He is helping with the delivery.

347
00:26:46,449 --> 00:26:47,929
Of course you're fine.

348
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:20,809
Will Luger come to
collect the stuff in person?

349
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:23,929
I've only seen him a couple of times,

350
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:26,249
and usually one of his boys
would collect the stuff on his behalf.

351
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:33,449
Got it.

352
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,529
Black Lion is here.

353
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:50,049
You guys retreat first.

354
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:51,729
I'll take care of this.

355
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:54,889
But I'm worried he'll break in...

356
00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:00,849
Do you think

357
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,729
I can't handle it alone,

358
00:28:04,489 --> 00:28:05,129
huh?

359
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:08,329
Get lost!

360
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:28,849
I seldom see him.

361
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:30,489
It's usually his men who deal with me.

362
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:47,289
Help!

363
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:49,409
Help!

364
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:50,209
Where do you want to go?

365
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:51,249
Where do they take the girls they catch?

366
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:53,129
Let go of me!

367
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:54,249
To sell them.

368
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,489
A car will come tonight to
transport them to the ship.

369
00:28:59,849 --> 00:29:01,729
They sell both drugs and women.

370
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:03,409
The good-looking ones
go into prostitution,

371
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:05,969
the bad-looking ones
go into organ sales.

372
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:07,969
But I don't know much
about those things.

373
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:09,409
I am only in charge of delivery.

374
00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:17,569
Come on, take it.

375
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:19,929
- Take it.
- I don't want it.

376
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:21,289
- This is your share.
- I don't want it.

377
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:24,289
Take it, so you and I will have
nothing to do with each other anymore.

378
00:29:24,969 --> 00:29:25,769
Hey!

379
00:31:59,969 --> 00:32:01,329
It's been a long time, Black Lion.

380
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:03,969
How could it be you?

381
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:06,569
Did you kill Mr. Han?

382
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:09,329
Because that old man
always kept his eyes on me.

383
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:12,529
Where's that female cop
you're always with?

384
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:13,769
Don't touch her!

385
00:32:15,649 --> 00:32:17,809
If you had been so responsible,

386
00:32:18,329 --> 00:32:20,609
we might have had a different ending.

387
00:32:21,249 --> 00:32:22,089
Badin.

388
00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:24,409
Stop calling me that.

389
00:32:33,209 --> 00:32:35,289
You're still so full of yourself.

390
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:38,649
You had been taking care of me
since I joined the police force.

391
00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:40,449
You think

392
00:32:40,969 --> 00:32:42,529
I can't be a cop without you, don't you?

393
00:32:43,089 --> 00:32:44,569
I didn't think that way, Badin.

394
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:50,289
If it wasn't for you,

395
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:51,769
how could I be disfigured?

396
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:53,689
Look at me.

397
00:32:54,529 --> 00:32:55,489
Get up!

398
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:58,889
You didn't think I could be a good cop,

399
00:33:00,489 --> 00:33:02,409
so why did you leave me
in a den of thieves?

400
00:33:03,209 --> 00:33:05,649
Is this your way of punishing me?

401
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:07,729
I'd like to know why you would...

402
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:09,609
You want to ask me how I
managed to survive, don't you?

403
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:19,529
Darn it.

404
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:22,769
Badin!

405
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:30,449
I'm going in to get him.

406
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:31,849
Don't go. It could be a trap.

407
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:33,049
Sorry, Captain.

408
00:33:33,129 --> 00:33:34,409
I must catch him.

409
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:35,660
Badin!

410
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:54,089
Badin!

411
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:56,129
Run now!

412
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:13,969
Badin,

413
00:34:14,049 --> 00:34:15,529
listen carefully.

414
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:17,729
I never wanted to leave you behind.

415
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:19,849
When I woke up, they all
told me you were dead.

416
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,449
I didn't believe it then either.

417
00:34:22,209 --> 00:34:23,129
You're lying to me.

418
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:31,769
I'm not lying to you.

419
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,369
You've fooled everyone.

420
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:36,689
Everyone thought you were dead.

421
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:38,289
But you've become Luger.

422
00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:41,129
Why did you become Luger, Badin?

423
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:42,009
Isn't it good?

424
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:43,089
One dead man

425
00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:44,689
turns into another dead man

426
00:34:44,769 --> 00:34:46,809
and continues to languish in this world.

427
00:34:54,529 --> 00:34:56,809
Come on. Are you done, Badin?

428
00:34:58,009 --> 00:34:59,209
Let me check.

429
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:03,409
Add a plus symbol to the answer
to this question.

430
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:05,089
This is wrong

431
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:06,329
and this wrong too.

432
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:07,289
Badin.

433
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:10,449
You've got a few questions
wrong, my dear.

434
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:13,929
Pla did 50 or 60 questions

435
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:15,929
without getting a single one wrong.

436
00:35:20,209 --> 00:35:23,089
You are the unbeatable Black Lion.

437
00:35:23,969 --> 00:35:25,409
You're Captain Pla,

438
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:28,849
the elite officer
of the police force, aren't you?

439
00:35:29,409 --> 00:35:31,609
I'll do my best on this case, Chief.

440
00:35:31,689 --> 00:35:34,769
I've handed the case over to Pla.

441
00:35:34,896 --> 00:35:36,529
He's more experienced than you.

442
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:37,809
Can you understand that?

443
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:41,929
Yes.

444
00:35:49,209 --> 00:35:50,729
Is that all you've got?

445
00:35:59,169 --> 00:36:00,809
It's me you want to get back at.

446
00:36:01,249 --> 00:36:02,569
Let the girls go.

447
00:36:03,449 --> 00:36:05,009
They're innocent.

448
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:13,249
Do you still want to be
a good person at this moment?

449
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,689
Be a good person in your next life then!

450
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:28,209
Badin.

451
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:30,369
Badin.

452
00:36:33,209 --> 00:36:33,889
Badin.

453
00:36:36,049 --> 00:36:36,889
Hang in there.

454
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:42,249
Badin.

455
00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:43,889
What are you doing, Badin?

456
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,009
What are you doing?

457
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:56,769
Badin.

458
00:36:58,729 --> 00:37:00,649
I've lost to you again this time.

459
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:05,169
Why do you only practice
close quarters combat all day?

460
00:37:05,249 --> 00:37:07,009
Don't you practice shooting?

461
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:08,529
I'm a fighter, Captain.

462
00:37:08,609 --> 00:37:10,849
Guns are for incompetent cowards.

463
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:12,009
Is that so?

464
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:14,209
Shall we fight?

465
00:37:28,249 --> 00:37:29,409
How did you throw the punch?

466
00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:30,489
Where's your power?

467
00:37:30,569 --> 00:37:32,529
Do you remember how to
use your waist and back?

468
00:37:32,609 --> 00:37:34,369
Use your brain, Badin.

469
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:35,649
Get up.

470
00:37:52,409 --> 00:37:53,249
One day,

471
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,329
I will beat Black Lion.

472
00:37:59,689 --> 00:38:01,889
I've lived enough of this life, Captain.

473
00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:11,609
Lu... Luger

474
00:38:13,169 --> 00:38:14,849
deserves to die.

475
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:19,449
Badin.

476
00:38:21,409 --> 00:38:22,449
Hang in there, Badin.

477
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:25,609
The ambulance is on its way.

478
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:35,889
Cap... Captain.

479
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:45,369
Badin!

480
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:51,889
How could this happen?

481
00:38:51,969 --> 00:38:52,769
Don't die.

482
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:56,569
Wake up!

483
00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:50,449
Captain, is that Badin?

484
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,940
Vita.

485
00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:34,849
Pla.

486
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,649
Captain.

487
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:38,809
Let me introduce myself.

488
00:40:40,209 --> 00:40:41,729
Hi, Captain Pla.

489
00:40:42,129 --> 00:40:44,329
I'm Badin Unga, the Second Lieutenant.

490
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:45,649
I'm a trainee police officer.

491
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:47,649
I specialize in analysis,

492
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:51,489
determining criminal intent and
criminal psychological profiling.

493
00:40:55,449 --> 00:40:56,769
Congratulations

494
00:40:56,849 --> 00:40:58,169
on your graduation!

495
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,169
You look good in this uniform,

496
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:03,769
Badin Unga, the Second Lieutenant.

497
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:07,569
Don't forget to wear this uniform
to show off to Grandma Lek.

498
00:41:07,649 --> 00:41:08,529
Okay.

499
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:10,889
Please give me your guidance, Captain.

500
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:51,809
Badin.

501
00:42:16,009 --> 00:42:17,489
(The response to this news
has been good.)

502
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:18,969
(Thank you again)

503
00:42:19,049 --> 00:42:20,689
(for solving this mysterious case.)

504
00:42:21,729 --> 00:42:23,889
(I've promised the media)

505
00:42:24,249 --> 00:42:26,129
(an interview with you two.)

506
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:27,769
(Make the most of this opportunity)

507
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:30,249
(to restore the image of police force.)

508
00:42:31,529 --> 00:42:32,729
(I don't agree.)

509
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:35,009
(Although we know that Luger is Badin,)

510
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:39,369
(there are clues that some officers on
our force were in cahoots with Luger.)

511
00:42:39,449 --> 00:42:40,729
(It's not over yet.)
