=Episode 3=

3
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,400
(An adaptation of the novel
"When a Snail Falls in Love" by Ding Mo)

4
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,600
(Luger, the prime culprit)

5
00:02:17,886 --> 00:02:19,886
The cops are getting closer to Eig.

6
00:02:20,326 --> 00:02:22,366
Should we let him lay low
for a while, boss?

7
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,366
He already made a mistake
during the museum incident last time.

8
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:29,006
I think the best option

9
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:32,206
is to have him safely deliver
this batch of goods first

10
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:35,406
before letting him go into hiding
for a while, boss.

11
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:36,646
If he gets arrested,

12
00:02:36,886 --> 00:02:39,246
the cops might trace it back
to you, boss.

13
00:02:41,486 --> 00:02:42,166
Boss.

14
00:02:44,526 --> 00:02:45,326
Something happened, boss.

15
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,526
I saw Black Lion at the factory

16
00:02:47,606 --> 00:02:49,366
while we were moving the goods.

17
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:56,006
Get the men out of the factory

18
00:02:56,966 --> 00:02:59,206
and restore the site
to its original state

19
00:02:59,286 --> 00:03:00,206
Yes, boss.

20
00:03:00,286 --> 00:03:02,566
Did you just say Black Lion?

21
00:03:03,646 --> 00:03:05,206
That's an old friend of mine.

22
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:22,726
Da, did you send Miss Mu in a taxi?

23
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:26,126
Would Miss Mu be angry?

24
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,246
You even asked if she saw anything
at the scene.

25
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:30,646
But from the surveillance footage,

26
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:32,526
Miss Mu was walking like anyone else.

27
00:03:32,606 --> 00:03:33,726
She wasn't even using a cane.

28
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:35,246
From her appearance,

29
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:37,006
no one could tell she was blind.

30
00:03:37,286 --> 00:03:37,926
Da,

31
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:39,846
didn't you know Miss Mu is blind

32
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,446
when you were probing her?

33
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:44,086
That doesn't mean she couldn't hear.

34
00:03:44,686 --> 00:03:46,286
Did she hear any useful clues then?

35
00:03:47,046 --> 00:03:48,446
With cars coming and going,

36
00:03:48,526 --> 00:03:50,486
and people moving around,

37
00:03:50,766 --> 00:03:52,046
she doesn't even know who's who.

38
00:03:52,886 --> 00:03:54,766
How can this be Da's fault?

39
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:57,126
If anyone should be blamed,
blame the one who did the analysis.

40
00:03:57,806 --> 00:03:58,646
Mr. Han.

41
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:00,686
- Mr. Han.
- Mr. Han.

42
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:07,206
Vita.

43
00:04:07,926 --> 00:04:09,006
Use the time you spend analyzing

44
00:04:09,086 --> 00:04:12,886
to increase your fitness.
It'd be more useful for us.

45
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:14,366
That's right.

46
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:16,406
You need to apply your diligence
in the right place.

47
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,646
Whenever you're diligent,
it's always us who suffer.

48
00:04:20,606 --> 00:04:22,766
That was for the recruit
welcoming ceremony.

49
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:23,926
I asked her to do it.

50
00:04:24,246 --> 00:04:24,846
Is that so?

51
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:27,966
I'd say it was more
like a farewell ceremony.

52
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:29,166
I heard

53
00:04:29,246 --> 00:04:31,166
you made a three-month agreement
with the captain, right?

54
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:45,486
Da.

55
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:46,206
Yes.

56
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:50,086
Later, go to the factory
I visited last night

57
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,486
to investigate the site

58
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:53,366
and see if there are any new leads.

59
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:54,326
Yes.

60
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:55,486
Here's the address.

61
00:04:56,126 --> 00:04:57,166
Got it.

62
00:04:58,286 --> 00:04:58,966
Ning.

63
00:04:59,046 --> 00:05:00,046
Yes.

64
00:05:00,126 --> 00:05:01,886
I want you to investigate

65
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:07,006
the state police stations
that have had recent Naga Gang cases.

66
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:08,806
All right.

67
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:12,606
Then transfer all relevant information
to our station.

68
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,886
But there are about 20 police stations.

69
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:18,606
Yes.

70
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:22,886
And I want all the documents
on my desk this afternoon.

71
00:05:25,606 --> 00:05:26,366
Yes, sir.

72
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:30,006
Mr. Han.

73
00:05:31,646 --> 00:05:33,326
I don't think he can handle it alone.

74
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:35,086
Please give him a hand.

75
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,006
Okay.

76
00:05:37,926 --> 00:05:39,166
As for you,

77
00:05:39,246 --> 00:05:40,006
Vita.

78
00:05:40,086 --> 00:05:41,206
Take the measuring tape

79
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:43,126
and measure that place,

80
00:05:45,086 --> 00:05:46,326
near your desk.

81
00:06:00,086 --> 00:06:02,406
Why do you want me to measure that?

82
00:06:02,486 --> 00:06:05,046
We'll be adding a lot of documents
in the future.

83
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:08,286
So I want to buy a new cabinet.

84
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:17,966
Are you saying

85
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:20,686
that I'll be in charge
of those documents from now on?

86
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:22,686
No, it's not that.

87
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:27,446
What I'm trying to tell you is

88
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:29,046
that in three months,

89
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:31,086
you won't be sitting here anymore.

90
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,886
So I need to buy a new cabinet
to make use of the space.

91
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:39,366
Think about this yourself.

92
00:06:39,806 --> 00:06:41,526
Since you joined us,

93
00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:43,126
we've been on two missions.

94
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:46,406
And each time,
I had to risk my life to save you.

95
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:50,566
If you continue
with your current working style.

96
00:06:51,086 --> 00:06:52,366
We don't have to wait for three months.

97
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:55,566
The moment you run into a criminal,
you'd be dead before you know it.

98
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,846
I still have three months
to prove myself.

99
00:07:02,926 --> 00:07:04,606
I'll do my best to do my job.

100
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,806
I'll also uncover the truth
behind the museum incident

101
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:13,046
and figure out your connection
to that incident.

102
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:17,126
But I must thank you

103
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:19,686
for always extending
a helping hand in time.

104
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:23,006
But from the moment I decided
to become a police officer,

105
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:24,406
I was already prepared

106
00:07:24,886 --> 00:07:26,766
to sacrifice my life at any time.

107
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:28,446
Ming.

108
00:07:29,086 --> 00:07:29,966
Yes?

109
00:07:30,046 --> 00:07:31,406
Maybe you should measure it.

110
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:35,886
Are you deaf?

111
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:43,366
Don't forget.

112
00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:46,006
After you're done measuring it,
order a large-sized cabinet

113
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,766
to fill up that area completely.

114
00:07:56,846 --> 00:07:57,726
Captain,

115
00:07:58,446 --> 00:08:01,046
you've never given me the chance
to visit the crime scene.

116
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:03,006
If you keep evading me like this,

117
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:05,886
it's as if you've already
sentenced me to death.

118
00:08:10,926 --> 00:08:12,766
Can you hear what I said?

119
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:19,846
Captain!

120
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:20,846
What do you want?

121
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:23,646
Why are you only targeting me?

122
00:08:23,726 --> 00:08:25,206
Are you afraid?

123
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,006
Are you afraid something
might happen to me?

124
00:08:36,446 --> 00:08:38,726
Did something happen to you before?

125
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:41,046
Vita!

126
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:42,206
Just do what you're told!

127
00:08:49,726 --> 00:08:51,766
Who are you to probe into my past?

128
00:08:51,846 --> 00:08:53,486
Did something happen
to the captain in the past?

129
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,846
Actually, I don't have to wait
for the three-month period to end.

130
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:59,206
I can tell you to leave now.

131
00:08:59,286 --> 00:09:03,246
If my investigative methods
did cause trouble for everyone,

132
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:05,646
I'm willing to reflect on myself

133
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:07,606
and accept all decisions.

134
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:10,206
If you cause trouble again...

135
00:09:10,286 --> 00:09:11,886
You can punish me anyhow you see fit,

136
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:12,606
including...

137
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:16,446
Surprise!

138
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:18,726
This way, please.

139
00:09:19,366 --> 00:09:21,806
Put the blue ones there
and the pink ones here.

140
00:09:21,886 --> 00:09:22,846
Come on.

141
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:25,206
I want to make an appearance.

142
00:09:26,126 --> 00:09:29,726
Ding ding ding! Wow!

143
00:09:30,046 --> 00:09:32,246
I knew you'd cause trouble again.

144
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:34,206
But I didn't expect it to be so soon.

145
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:35,886
Hello, everyone.

146
00:09:36,446 --> 00:09:38,846
I find this place lifeless.

147
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:40,686
So I want to add some vitality
for you all.

148
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:45,846
I also consulted your superior's
superior's superior about this.

149
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:50,006
I plan to take Miss Vita out for lunch.

150
00:09:51,046 --> 00:09:51,766
Mr. Han!

151
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:53,366
Yes?

152
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:57,086
Help me out here.

153
00:09:59,726 --> 00:10:00,966
You can go now.

154
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:03,046
But you're going with Mr. Han.

155
00:10:03,126 --> 00:10:06,086
Please take Vita to the file room.

156
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,766
Today, you're not allowed
to go out for case investigation.

157
00:10:09,846 --> 00:10:12,886
Also, you can't participate
in the fieldwork of the operation team.

158
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:17,206
And she's prohibited
from contacting witnesses of this case.

159
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:20,646
I want her transferred
to the file room as a clerk.

160
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:23,046
Transfer?

161
00:10:23,126 --> 00:10:25,006
- Captain, I haven't had the chance...
- No need to argue.

162
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:26,886
In my opinion,

163
00:10:27,806 --> 00:10:30,646
you haven't proven
that you're fit to be a police officer.

164
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,646
You don't have that ability yet.

165
00:10:32,726 --> 00:10:35,446
You don't even have the basic etiquette
required for the job.

166
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:37,886
Go.

167
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,086
You're too harsh.

168
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,446
Vita, wait.

169
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:49,966
Pla,

170
00:10:50,806 --> 00:10:52,646
are you sure you want to block my way?

171
00:10:54,046 --> 00:10:55,206
The file room.

172
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,526
No entry for outsiders.

173
00:10:57,966 --> 00:10:59,726
If you want to go in,

174
00:10:59,806 --> 00:11:05,406
please seek permission
from my superior's superior's superior.

175
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:07,446
That's troublesome.

176
00:11:16,526 --> 00:11:18,566
Help me get rid of this trash.

177
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:20,526
Hey, that's mine!

178
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:26,726
Traces of Naga at Napi Temple.

179
00:11:30,846 --> 00:11:32,966
A large ship sank
in the Naga River basin.

180
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:37,126
Children missing in Naga Cave.

181
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:45,486
Perhaps I can find traces here
that match the crime scene.

182
00:11:49,326 --> 00:11:52,886
Luger, the leader of the Naga Gang
was executed by Black Lion.

183
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:57,366
That was what those people
called the captain.

184
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,086
The Naga Gang

185
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,766
traffics underage girls

186
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:07,126
and sells them into prostitution
across borders.

187
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:10,846
The gang is a group
of believers who worship Naga.

188
00:12:10,926 --> 00:12:13,966
Every one of them
carries the tattoo of Naga.

189
00:12:14,806 --> 00:12:15,886
Luger

190
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:17,966
was killed by Black Lion.

191
00:12:18,646 --> 00:12:20,486
His subordinates were captured.

192
00:12:21,286 --> 00:12:23,326
The Naga Gang case was closed.)

193
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:29,286
Could it be that the gang
is not completely eradicated?

194
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,686
Black Lion was in charge
of the operation.

195
00:12:46,486 --> 00:12:48,806
(Police Lieutenant Badin Unga died)

196
00:13:19,406 --> 00:13:21,086
Badin, let's play together.

197
00:13:22,446 --> 00:13:24,046
Stop sweeping.

198
00:13:24,486 --> 00:13:25,526
Go and play with your friends.

199
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:27,246
But I haven't finished sweeping yet.

200
00:13:27,326 --> 00:13:29,326
I'll do it later.

201
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:31,766
But I really want to sweep it.

202
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:33,766
All right then.

203
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:34,806
Let's go.

204
00:13:35,446 --> 00:13:36,166
Lock him up.

205
00:13:36,246 --> 00:13:37,286
Here, back to where it was.

206
00:13:37,606 --> 00:13:38,326
Crawl out.

207
00:13:46,486 --> 00:13:48,366
Finally, we found the key.

208
00:13:48,446 --> 00:13:50,206
Lead us to find the culprit.

209
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:54,766
Is it my brother's key?

210
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:55,766
No.

211
00:13:56,046 --> 00:13:57,366
It belongs to the bad person.

212
00:13:57,446 --> 00:13:58,806
What bad person?

213
00:13:58,886 --> 00:14:01,526
Searching for answers
is the duty of the police.

214
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:03,686
Are you ready to catch the bad person?

215
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:06,686
Yes, I'm ready.

216
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:33,326
I have a secret mission
for you to carry out.

217
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:37,126
(Naga Gang information)
Infiltrate Naga Gang as an undercover.

218
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:41,766
The mission is to wipe out
this criminal organization.

219
00:14:43,286 --> 00:14:44,166
Understand?

220
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:46,006
Yes, sir!

221
00:14:56,606 --> 00:14:58,886
(If it weren't for me,
you'd still be alive.)

222
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,366
For the sake of our unity,

223
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:05,526
let's welcome our two new members.

224
00:15:09,846 --> 00:15:11,006
Black Lion, come here.

225
00:15:41,926 --> 00:15:42,726
Vita,

226
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:44,886
I can't have lunch with you today.

227
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:47,366
Captain asked me
to go to the crime scene again.

228
00:15:52,806 --> 00:15:53,606
What's wrong?

229
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:55,966
Are you worried about Sen?

230
00:15:57,326 --> 00:15:58,566
Don't worry.

231
00:15:58,646 --> 00:15:59,846
He has already gone back.

232
00:16:01,246 --> 00:16:02,806
I just wanted to confirm something.

233
00:16:04,926 --> 00:16:06,006
But

234
00:16:06,686 --> 00:16:08,446
can you reveal it a little?

235
00:16:08,726 --> 00:16:11,446
What is it that only you

236
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:12,566
and the captain know?

237
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,166
It's better for you not to know.

238
00:16:15,246 --> 00:16:16,326
It's annoying.

239
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,606
How's the work in the file room going?

240
00:16:21,686 --> 00:16:23,446
I texted you. But you didn't reply.

241
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:26,126
I had to turn over my phone
because no phones are allowed inside.

242
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:28,766
They're afraid someone
might take photos and leak information.

243
00:16:29,926 --> 00:16:31,486
But I don't understand

244
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:33,566
why the captain assigned you
to work there.

245
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:35,886
How are you going
to prove your abilities?

246
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:37,126
Sure, I can.

247
00:16:38,846 --> 00:16:40,086
How so?

248
00:16:42,406 --> 00:16:43,446
I have help.

249
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:46,246
I'll be right back.

250
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:54,406
Hello, Wasu. Are you busy?

251
00:16:54,486 --> 00:16:56,486
I'm busy every day except today.

252
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:59,166
I just finished eating. I'm free now.

253
00:16:59,246 --> 00:17:01,246
Why? Do you want me to pick you up?

254
00:17:01,326 --> 00:17:02,246
(No.)

255
00:17:02,326 --> 00:17:05,326
(Actually, I need to investigate a case.
But I can't go by myself.)

256
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,046
Why can't you go by yourself?

257
00:17:08,726 --> 00:17:11,606
My boss gave me clerical work
and won't allow me to go out.

258
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:15,646
It looks like
you've caused trouble again, right?

259
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:17,646
(That's why you're grounded.)

260
00:17:17,726 --> 00:17:19,526
It's for the best and safer this way.

261
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,366
Then my sister can stay safe.

262
00:17:21,446 --> 00:17:23,966
(Why did you call me then?)

263
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:26,646
I want you to help me
with the investigation.

264
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:30,526
What? I'm a businessman,

265
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:32,606
not a police officer.
You're joking, right?

266
00:17:33,046 --> 00:17:35,366
How long have we been siblings?

267
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:37,926
Have you ever seen me joking?

268
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:40,766
(I just need you to find Miss Mu
and get a simple statement from her.)

269
00:17:43,086 --> 00:17:45,726
Vita, but I'm scared.

270
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:49,086
This is police work,
not my area of expertise.

271
00:17:49,206 --> 00:17:50,286
Please help me.

272
00:17:50,366 --> 00:17:52,166
If I could go,
I wouldn't need to ask for your help.

273
00:17:52,246 --> 00:17:54,766
Oh, Miss Mu can't see.

274
00:17:54,846 --> 00:17:56,686
So treat her nicely.

275
00:17:56,766 --> 00:18:00,286
Record everything she says
and send it to me. Got it?

276
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,726
You truly are a troublesome sister.

277
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:29,686
Vita,

278
00:18:30,366 --> 00:18:32,326
Sen won't give up, right?

279
00:18:33,206 --> 00:18:35,406
It's Miss Xin. His relative, right?

280
00:18:38,406 --> 00:18:40,166
Is she coming for the team?

281
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:43,926
You can get back to work.

282
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:46,006
- I'll take care of this.
- Hey, Vita.

283
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,326
Sen went home. So don't worry.

284
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:52,966
I come here to speak to you.

285
00:19:23,286 --> 00:19:26,006
Welcome to Mu Dessert House.

286
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:43,806
Hello.

287
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:47,006
I'm Wasu.

288
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:50,166
Vita's older brother.

289
00:19:50,526 --> 00:19:53,126
She's the petite policewoman.

290
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,446
I see.

291
00:19:59,606 --> 00:20:01,446
Do you still remember her?

292
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:13,166
Ah...

293
00:20:13,886 --> 00:20:15,206
I'm sorry.

294
00:20:15,286 --> 00:20:17,366
I was very rude.

295
00:20:19,206 --> 00:20:22,366
It's okay. Don't take it to heart.

296
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:26,606
Actually, I'm a little happy

297
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:30,806
to have someone treat me
like a normal person.

298
00:20:33,286 --> 00:20:35,526
Is there anything I can help you with,
Mr. Wasu?

299
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:37,846
The reason I came to see you

300
00:20:38,646 --> 00:20:41,566
is because Vita wants
to gather more details.

301
00:20:41,646 --> 00:20:43,926
So she asked me to come and see you.

302
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:46,446
I see.

303
00:20:47,406 --> 00:20:49,726
Do you have time to talk?

304
00:20:49,926 --> 00:20:50,726
Sure.

305
00:20:51,206 --> 00:20:52,126
This way, please.

306
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:53,926
All right.

307
00:21:02,246 --> 00:21:03,846
Mr. Wasu, please come this way.

308
00:21:08,806 --> 00:21:10,126
Since the incident,

309
00:21:10,806 --> 00:21:13,366
I haven't had the chance to thank you.

310
00:21:16,646 --> 00:21:17,446
This

311
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,566
injury is healing quickly too.

312
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:21,726
But it'll definitely leave a scar.

313
00:21:23,686 --> 00:21:25,726
Actually, there's no need
to treat me to a meal.

314
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:27,686
It's just part of my duty.

315
00:21:28,606 --> 00:21:29,926
Regardless of the reason,

316
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:32,206
you saved my life.

317
00:21:32,806 --> 00:21:33,806
Also,

318
00:21:33,886 --> 00:21:36,006
you've been bothered by Sen.

319
00:21:38,326 --> 00:21:39,846
I'll talk to him later

320
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,086
and ask him not to harass you anymore.

321
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,166
Do you have something
to discuss with me?

322
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:49,726
I just come to express my gratitude.

323
00:21:50,646 --> 00:21:51,886
If it's just to thank me,

324
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,206
a wealthy young lady like you
could send something

325
00:21:55,246 --> 00:21:57,206
instead of treating me to a meal.
There's no need for that.

326
00:22:01,966 --> 00:22:04,686
You really are as straightforward
as Sen described.

327
00:22:06,966 --> 00:22:09,446
Then I'll just be honest with you.

328
00:22:11,886 --> 00:22:13,606
I have something to ask of you.

329
00:22:18,406 --> 00:22:20,806
Could you join me for meals
more often in the future?

330
00:22:25,726 --> 00:22:27,926
I'm tired of the people around me.

331
00:22:31,446 --> 00:22:34,246
They only say things I want to hear

332
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:38,166
or things they think I want to hear.

333
00:22:39,086 --> 00:22:41,406
But no one tells the truth.

334
00:22:42,006 --> 00:22:43,726
You're completely different.

335
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,486
I can say we get along well.

336
00:22:48,966 --> 00:22:50,606
What do you think?

337
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:55,366
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

338
00:22:57,486 --> 00:23:00,446
Frequently having meals together
might not work

339
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:02,366
because work at the police station
is demanding.

340
00:23:04,406 --> 00:23:06,086
But if it's about being friends,

341
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:08,726
of course, we can.

342
00:23:12,046 --> 00:23:12,886
Okay.

343
00:23:17,126 --> 00:23:18,926
Is it true that you can't see?

344
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:32,606
Thank you.

345
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:36,646
Thank you.

346
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:39,526
Don't you like desserts?

347
00:23:42,886 --> 00:23:45,166
It's not that I don't like them,
it's just...

348
00:23:45,246 --> 00:23:47,046
I've been eating less sweets lately

349
00:23:47,686 --> 00:23:48,686
because it makes me gain weight.

350
00:23:50,206 --> 00:23:51,246
It makes you gain weight.

351
00:23:53,806 --> 00:23:55,366
I'm sorry.

352
00:23:56,366 --> 00:23:57,486
I was rude again.

353
00:23:58,966 --> 00:23:59,766
It's okay.

354
00:24:02,086 --> 00:24:04,646
Did I not provide enough information?

355
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:06,726
Miss Mu, the truth is,

356
00:24:06,806 --> 00:24:08,886
I don't know the situation well.

357
00:24:09,806 --> 00:24:11,446
But what

358
00:24:11,526 --> 00:24:14,206
did the police ask you this morning?

359
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,806
They asked

360
00:24:15,886 --> 00:24:19,326
if I overheard
any suspicious conversations.

361
00:24:19,406 --> 00:24:21,206
That's about it.

362
00:24:22,246 --> 00:24:25,326
But I didn't hear anything significant,

363
00:24:25,406 --> 00:24:28,486
only the sound of cars passing by,

364
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:30,486
and people walking.

365
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:31,686
That's all.

366
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:44,046
I have some questions to ask you.

367
00:24:44,846 --> 00:24:46,006
First question.

368
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:46,686
Okay.

369
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,886
Where did you go on that day?
*[using respectful female language "ka"]

370
00:24:53,286 --> 00:24:54,566
I'm sorry.

371
00:24:54,646 --> 00:25:00,046
I only read what was sent by Vita.
I don't usually use the "ka" expression.

372
00:25:00,446 --> 00:25:01,846
I was just teasing you.

373
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:04,526
On that day,

374
00:25:04,606 --> 00:25:08,166
I went to a baking equipment store
that I often visit.

375
00:25:09,126 --> 00:25:11,886
I'm familiar with the place.
So I didn't use my cane.

376
00:25:14,006 --> 00:25:17,846
- The baking store. Sorry about that.
- No problem, no problem.

377
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:19,526
She's familiar with it.

378
00:25:19,606 --> 00:25:21,246
So she didn't use her cane.

379
00:25:25,646 --> 00:25:27,526
- I'll continue with my question.
- Okay.

380
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:30,526
If it's a place you're familiar with,

381
00:25:31,206 --> 00:25:36,726
can you describe anything different
compared to previous visits?

382
00:25:37,846 --> 00:25:39,926
Usually, when I go to this shop,

383
00:25:41,446 --> 00:25:43,526
(I'd wait in front of the shop)

384
00:25:43,606 --> 00:25:47,206
(because the shopkeeper
helps bring out the items.)

385
00:25:47,966 --> 00:25:49,246
(But on that day,)

386
00:25:49,806 --> 00:25:53,486
I seemed to hear the sound
of a vehicle parking.

387
00:25:53,566 --> 00:25:57,846
(But parking is prohibited
in front of the shop.)

388
00:25:58,606 --> 00:26:00,646
Then I also heard

389
00:26:01,246 --> 00:26:06,646
(two different footsteps. It's probably
two people getting out of a car.)

390
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,246
I also heard something like

391
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:11,406
the sound of a rolling shutter.

392
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:19,846
Hold on a moment, Miss Mu.

393
00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:23,886
I couldn't note it down in time.

394
00:26:25,526 --> 00:26:26,246
Ah...

395
00:26:26,326 --> 00:26:26,966
Sorry about that.

396
00:26:27,046 --> 00:26:29,006
Can you go back

397
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:32,166
to the part where the vehicle
was parked?

398
00:26:32,886 --> 00:26:33,686
- Sure.
- Okay.

399
00:26:42,886 --> 00:26:43,526
(Wasu Message)

400
00:26:43,606 --> 00:26:45,326
(Miss Mu's information is very useful.)

401
00:26:45,406 --> 00:26:47,246
(Let's start with the first part.)

402
00:26:47,326 --> 00:26:50,166
(If you could talk to her face-to-face,
it would be better)

403
00:26:50,246 --> 00:26:53,326
(because there is too much information.)

404
00:26:53,406 --> 00:26:54,886
(I'm exhausted.)

405
00:26:58,246 --> 00:26:59,366
Miss Xin,

406
00:26:59,726 --> 00:27:00,686
you see...

407
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:02,886
I have to take my leave first.

408
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:03,926
I have some urgent matters
to take care of.

409
00:27:15,646 --> 00:27:17,286
Is there something on my face?

410
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,086
Sorry, I didn't mean to stare.

411
00:27:22,846 --> 00:27:24,206
But how did you know?

412
00:27:25,406 --> 00:27:27,886
Human eyes are powerful.

413
00:27:29,286 --> 00:27:31,526
But I lack that kind of power.

414
00:27:32,326 --> 00:27:34,966
So heaven gave me
another strong ability.

415
00:27:36,806 --> 00:27:39,286
I have a heightened sense of hearing
compared to ordinary people.

416
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,286
I also have a more sensitive
sense of smell.

417
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:52,086
And my sense of touch
is better than average.

418
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:55,366
In a way,

419
00:27:56,726 --> 00:27:58,446
it's a good thing.

420
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:03,726
Please wait a moment.
Vita should be here soon.

421
00:28:03,806 --> 00:28:04,606
Okay.

422
00:28:10,486 --> 00:28:11,446
Hello, Vita?

423
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:13,086
Did you find the shop?

424
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:14,606
(It's better to investigate on-site.)

425
00:28:15,406 --> 00:28:18,086
Miss Mu said she heard
the sound of a rolling shutter door.

426
00:28:19,566 --> 00:28:21,886
But they all use
retractable iron doors in this area.

427
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,286
There's only one abandoned house
that has a rolling shutter door.

428
00:28:30,366 --> 00:28:31,366
Vita,

429
00:28:31,806 --> 00:28:34,366
why did you go there
instead of coming here?

430
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:36,326
(Turn on your speaker.)

431
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:42,726
Okay, I've turned it on.

432
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:45,966
Miss Mu, thank you very much
for the information you provided.

433
00:28:46,526 --> 00:28:48,686
Your information has been very helpful.

434
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:50,086
You're welcome.

435
00:28:50,566 --> 00:28:53,126
(I have a few more questions.)

436
00:28:53,206 --> 00:28:54,846
(Wasu, please take notes.)

437
00:28:54,926 --> 00:28:55,806
Vita.

438
00:28:56,246 --> 00:28:58,486
Are you sure you heard
the sound of a rolling shutter door?

439
00:28:58,566 --> 00:28:59,486
Vita, wait a moment.

440
00:29:00,926 --> 00:29:02,366
Miss Mu, please wait for a moment.

441
00:29:07,206 --> 00:29:08,206
Vita, go ahead and ask.

442
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:13,646
- Wait, I'll put it in your hand.
- Okay.

443
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:22,446
All ready. Vita, go ahead.

444
00:29:39,366 --> 00:29:42,726
When you heard the two men's footsteps
getting back into the car,

445
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:46,006
were their footsteps slower,
as if carrying something heavy?

446
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,206
Or

447
00:29:50,006 --> 00:29:51,886
were there any footsteps
of a woman accompanying them?

448
00:29:52,526 --> 00:29:53,606
No.

449
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,326
The footsteps were quite normal.
They got into the car after that.

450
00:30:04,246 --> 00:30:05,606
(Sound of congested nose)

451
00:30:05,886 --> 00:30:07,366
(I remember something.)

452
00:30:07,446 --> 00:30:09,966
I heard that sound too.

453
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:19,886
(Sound of congested nose)

454
00:30:23,686 --> 00:30:25,926
Can you identify who made that sound?

455
00:30:26,006 --> 00:30:28,006
(I definitely remember this person)

456
00:30:28,606 --> 00:30:32,726
because this person's breathing sound
is a bit strange compared to others.

457
00:30:33,406 --> 00:30:35,406
(It might be difficult to differentiate
between ordinary people.)

458
00:30:35,486 --> 00:30:38,086
(But as someone who constantly perceives
the surroundings through hearing,)

459
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:39,326
I definitely remember.

460
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:41,006
(Wasu, write it down.)

461
00:30:43,046 --> 00:30:45,446
That day, Ms. Mary said she went out.

462
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:48,806
Thank you, Miss Mu.

463
00:31:30,566 --> 00:31:32,046
Mr. Wasu,

464
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:34,806
don't you want
to try our shop's dessert?

465
00:31:38,686 --> 00:31:39,406
Sure.

466
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:55,006
What do you think?

467
00:31:56,286 --> 00:31:56,926
It's delicious.

468
00:34:27,126 --> 00:34:30,006
If they can use
the neighbor's water pump.

469
00:34:31,566 --> 00:34:32,726
This means

470
00:34:33,126 --> 00:34:34,846
it's with Ms. Mary's consent.

471
00:34:44,046 --> 00:34:45,526
That means she's fully aware of it.

472
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:49,206
Vita,

473
00:34:49,646 --> 00:34:51,286
we're preparing to head out.

474
00:34:51,366 --> 00:34:52,326
(Is it about Wan's case?)

475
00:34:52,406 --> 00:34:53,166
Yes.

476
00:34:53,246 --> 00:34:55,486
The criminal is in the house next door.
A case of being deceived by appearances.

477
00:34:55,566 --> 00:34:57,286
- I have to go now.
- (I'm at the crime scene too.)

478
00:34:57,766 --> 00:34:58,406
Let's go.

479
00:35:10,366 --> 00:35:12,046
Vita, what are you doing here?

480
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,206
What's that picture for, Vita?

481
00:35:17,286 --> 00:35:20,646
The water pump and water pipe
connecting to the abandoned house

482
00:35:20,726 --> 00:35:22,606
can prove that the criminal
is in the house next to the victim.

483
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:24,326
- I'll report this to the captain.
- Forget that.

484
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:28,286
The main thing is to arrest
and bring the criminal to justice.

485
00:35:28,366 --> 00:35:29,166
Let's go quickly.

486
00:35:32,526 --> 00:35:33,326
Join us.

487
00:35:35,846 --> 00:35:37,246
What are you waiting for? Hop in.

488
00:35:38,486 --> 00:35:39,326
Let's go together.

489
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:41,326
Come on.

490
00:36:41,086 --> 00:36:42,926
I heard that Luger is coming
in person to handle it.

491
00:36:43,006 --> 00:36:45,246
We can finally see the real Luger.

492
00:36:45,646 --> 00:36:47,126
Are you serious?

493
00:36:48,966 --> 00:36:50,606
(I thought you were dead, Luger.)

494
00:37:06,926 --> 00:37:07,726
Open it.

495
00:37:23,966 --> 00:37:25,406
Darn, it! The cops are here.

496
00:37:25,486 --> 00:37:26,526
What should we do now, boss?

497
00:37:46,046 --> 00:37:46,886
Luger.

498
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:55,806
So it's you,

499
00:37:56,526 --> 00:37:57,406
Eig.

500
00:38:38,286 --> 00:38:39,326
Open it.

501
00:38:46,086 --> 00:38:46,846
Come here, guys.

502
00:39:09,086 --> 00:39:11,166
There's a basement here.

503
00:39:11,846 --> 00:39:13,606
Ming, go up and keep an eye on Ms. Mary.

504
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:14,846
Ning, watch Eig.

505
00:39:14,926 --> 00:39:16,166
Mr. Han, Da,

506
00:39:16,246 --> 00:39:17,206
you'll go down with me.

507
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:18,446
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

508
00:40:26,246 --> 00:40:27,366
Don't be afraid.

509
00:40:29,366 --> 00:40:30,486
Get up slowly.

510
00:40:44,486 --> 00:40:45,886
Help me.

511
00:40:52,046 --> 00:40:52,846
Help.

512
00:40:52,926 --> 00:40:54,006
Help!

513
00:40:55,766 --> 00:40:56,806
(Reporting, sir.)

514
00:40:57,926 --> 00:40:59,966
(The target is in the basement.)

515
00:41:01,006 --> 00:41:02,486
(We're taking them upstairs.)

516
00:41:02,566 --> 00:41:03,606
(End of report.)

517
00:41:07,086 --> 00:41:08,166
These scums.

518
00:41:46,486 --> 00:41:47,326
Mom!

519
00:41:53,566 --> 00:41:54,286
Mom!

520
00:41:54,966 --> 00:41:56,606
The police told me

521
00:41:56,686 --> 00:41:59,926
you offered me as a sacrifice
to the Naga.

522
00:42:00,926 --> 00:42:04,806
I wasn't forced. I did it willingly.

523
00:42:05,486 --> 00:42:06,726
I know

524
00:42:06,806 --> 00:42:08,166
since Dad passed away,

525
00:42:08,246 --> 00:42:10,126
you have had a hard life because of me.

526
00:42:10,766 --> 00:42:12,166
It's my fault.

527
00:42:12,246 --> 00:42:14,166
I'm sorry, Mom.

528
00:42:15,486 --> 00:42:17,246
It's my fault, my child.

529
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:26,646
I love you.

530
00:42:26,886 --> 00:42:28,726
I love you too.

531
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:30,686
I love you.

532
00:42:33,286 --> 00:42:34,326
Wan.

533
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:37,566
Wan!

534
00:43:08,726 --> 00:43:09,966
I can't believe it.

535
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,446
She may be the stepmother.

536
00:43:11,526 --> 00:43:13,166
But she sold her daughter for money

537
00:43:13,246 --> 00:43:15,646
and even gave them a hiding place.

538
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:18,286
Little trick.

539
00:43:18,366 --> 00:43:20,086
They used the Naga incident
as a cover-up

540
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:22,446
to scare many people
from passing through this area.

541
00:43:22,526 --> 00:43:24,006
This happens to provide them
with convenience.

542
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:27,206
Luckily, the captain
saw through her lies

543
00:43:27,286 --> 00:43:28,526
and subdued her first.

544
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:31,726
Or else she would have informed them.

545
00:43:32,886 --> 00:43:34,966
The rescued girls were injected

546
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:38,126
with a nerve-controlling substance,
believing that the Naga truly exists.

547
00:43:38,206 --> 00:43:40,526
I'm afraid it'll probably take
some time for them to recover.

548
00:43:41,846 --> 00:43:42,606
Da,

549
00:43:43,086 --> 00:43:45,166
summon Miss Mu
to record her statement tomorrow.

550
00:43:45,686 --> 00:43:49,166
She could hear. So she should be able
to prove Ms. Mary was there.

551
00:44:11,046 --> 00:44:12,486
You followed me here, didn't you?

552
00:44:13,366 --> 00:44:16,886
You knew all the leads I found.

553
00:44:16,966 --> 00:44:17,806
You...

554
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:24,606
You also saved me.

555
00:44:37,326 --> 00:44:41,366
This incident made me realize
that you're not physically fit at all.

556
00:44:41,926 --> 00:44:43,646
I thought you were too weak
to fight criminals.

557
00:44:44,246 --> 00:44:46,566
But I didn't expect you to be injured
by bamboos.

558
00:44:49,526 --> 00:44:51,286
I did say

559
00:44:52,126 --> 00:44:55,086
if my investigative methods
cause you trouble,

560
00:44:56,846 --> 00:44:58,726
I would accept any consequences.

561
00:44:59,806 --> 00:45:00,846
I apologize.

562
00:45:04,526 --> 00:45:06,366
You can punish me anyhow you see fit.

563
00:45:10,366 --> 00:45:11,366
Come on, let's have a meeting.

564
00:45:11,606 --> 00:45:12,486
Meeting.

565
00:45:23,806 --> 00:45:25,166
I just wanted to tell you

566
00:45:27,486 --> 00:45:29,286
that you did well this time.

567
00:45:33,886 --> 00:45:37,086
But you went against my orders
by investigating the case alone.

568
00:45:38,966 --> 00:45:40,006
But luckily,

569
00:45:40,606 --> 00:45:42,806
you still knew your limits
during the investigation.

570
00:45:42,886 --> 00:45:44,966
You didn't recklessly
enter the abandoned house.

571
00:45:45,566 --> 00:45:47,326
Or else you would
have fallen into their hands.

572
00:45:50,006 --> 00:45:51,486
So you have three months to do well.

573
00:45:53,806 --> 00:45:54,766
Do your best.

574
00:45:55,366 --> 00:45:56,806
Give it all.

575
00:45:57,926 --> 00:45:59,246
And tomorrow,

576
00:46:00,646 --> 00:46:01,846
we'll record the statement together.

577
00:46:03,206 --> 00:46:04,446
Thank you, sir.

578
00:46:05,166 --> 00:46:06,206
And...

579
00:46:08,206 --> 00:46:09,446
Your arm.

580
00:46:09,526 --> 00:46:10,486
I'll be fine.

581
00:46:10,886 --> 00:46:12,246
It was self-defense.

582
00:46:12,326 --> 00:46:13,526
It's unrelated to you.

583
00:46:15,886 --> 00:46:17,566
Meet me at the old training ground

584
00:46:18,406 --> 00:46:19,926
tomorrow morning at 7 o'clock.

585
00:46:21,086 --> 00:46:22,126
Yes, sir.

586
00:46:32,526 --> 00:46:33,366
Luger,

587
00:46:34,846 --> 00:46:36,526
are you really back?

588
00:46:43,286 --> 00:46:45,046
(The past is like a raging fire.)

589
00:46:45,486 --> 00:46:46,886
Don't put your hand in the fire.

590
00:46:46,966 --> 00:46:47,606
(Luger Case File. Case Closed)

591
00:46:47,686 --> 00:46:50,606
That person is not someone
you can mess with.

592
00:46:52,006 --> 00:46:53,926
If Luger is really still alive,

593
00:46:54,006 --> 00:46:57,326
I'll just kill him with my hands again.

594
00:46:58,606 --> 00:47:01,246
Have you noticed anything unusual

595
00:47:01,326 --> 00:47:03,406
after you gave the statement
at the police station?

596
00:47:04,206 --> 00:47:06,086
It seems like someone is watching me.

597
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:08,806
But it's just a feeling.

598
00:47:08,886 --> 00:47:10,206
It's probably nothing.
