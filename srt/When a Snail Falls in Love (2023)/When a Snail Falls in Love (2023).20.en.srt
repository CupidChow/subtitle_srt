(An adaptation of the novel
"When a Snail Falls in Love" by Ding Mo)

4
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:54,531
Vita.

5
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:01,611
I'm fine.

6
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:04,331
Vita,

7
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,491
save the girls.

8
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:10,771
Go!

9
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:12,051
Yes, sir.

10
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,811
There are others that need our help.

11
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,611
It's okay.

12
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:10,971
You're safe now.

13
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,051
Luger is Badin.

14
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:14,851
Yes.

15
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:30,611
Chief.

16
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:35,611
We…

17
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:40,691
We swore to serve as police officers.

18
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:42,331
It's always been

19
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:44,251
Badin's dream to be a policeman.

20
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:47,491
Badin was a young man with a dream,

21
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:49,771
but things have changed.

22
00:04:49,851 --> 00:04:51,611
He chose to become Luger

23
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:54,091
and took the lives of all those people.

24
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:56,251
This is what he deserved.

25
00:04:57,211 --> 00:04:58,411
I understand

26
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:00,451
this is hard on you.

27
00:05:00,771 --> 00:05:02,131
But as a police officer,

28
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:04,171
you should know

29
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:06,251
what you have to do next.

30
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:08,411
Yes.

31
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,251
I understand, Chief.

32
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,971
Before the warehouse incident ended,

33
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:36,931
I thought the Luger Group
would retaliate,

34
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:40,411
so I followed Captain Pla.

35
00:05:41,451 --> 00:05:43,331
I went to the warehouse
with my informant.

36
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:45,011
When we got inside,

37
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:46,891
we found all the kidnapped women.

38
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:49,651
When I was rescuing the hostages,

39
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:52,051
I accidentally revealed my identity.

40
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:54,291
It was chaotic.

41
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:56,491
I saw one of the assailants.

42
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:58,731
I later found out that he was Luger,

43
00:05:59,371 --> 00:06:00,291
also known as Badin.

44
00:06:01,051 --> 00:06:04,051
As I was attacked
and threatened by Luger…

45
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:10,091
When I was attacked by Badin,

46
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:12,931
Officer Vita appeared
from the other side.

47
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:14,931
I raised my gun.

48
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:19,051
And shot Badin in the back.

49
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:21,851
Badin died

50
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,451
on the spot.

51
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:30,251
Well?

52
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,291
No questions here.

53
00:06:32,131 --> 00:06:32,971
You?

54
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:34,251
All clear.

55
00:06:35,251 --> 00:06:37,651
I commend you and Captain Pla

56
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,211
for your bravery.

57
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:42,851
You completed the operation well.

58
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:45,731
Thank you.

59
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,051
Well done, Vita.

60
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:04,851
Dinner's on someone tonight.

61
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:06,651
You must be getting promoted.

62
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:19,571
Let's reserve a table for Vita.

63
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:20,411
Right away.

64
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:21,171
Right?

65
00:07:21,211 --> 00:07:22,371
Join us soon.

66
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:36,131
Pita.

67
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:07,971
You've only been gone
for a few days, Mr. Han.

68
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:10,971
But I feel as if years have passed.

69
00:08:13,931 --> 00:08:15,651
I found your murderer.

70
00:08:16,771 --> 00:08:18,731
You'll never guess who he is.

71
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:21,491
Or maybe you already knew.

72
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:26,851
He thought I abandoned him.

73
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:29,371
That's why he hated me.

74
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,331
But what hurts me most is that

75
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:36,371
he died again in front of me.

76
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:44,451
The first time Vita shot someone
was to save me.

77
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:48,771
She knows everything about him.

78
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:55,891
If I appeared before her like this,

79
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,891
I would be reminding her
of that awful scene again and again.

80
00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:09,851
I have to get over Badin soon,

81
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:11,291
right?

82
00:09:13,571 --> 00:09:14,851
If you were here,

83
00:09:15,491 --> 00:09:17,931
I'm sure you'd tell me
to go to Vita right now.

84
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:24,731
Mr. Han.

85
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:30,531
Goodbye.

86
00:10:01,971 --> 00:10:04,251
(Police Investigators Team)

87
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:19,211
How are you two doing?

88
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,731
The response to this newshas been good.

89
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:24,411
Thank you again

90
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,571
for solving this mysterious case.

91
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:30,651
I've promised the media an interview

92
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,651
with you two.

93
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:34,331
Make the most of this opportunity

94
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:36,691
to restore the image of police force.

95
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:37,851
I don't agree.

96
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:39,251
Why?

97
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:41,571
Although we know that Luger is Badin,

98
00:10:42,731 --> 00:10:47,171
there are clues that some officers on
our force were in cahoots with Luger.

99
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:48,491
It's not over yet.

100
00:10:49,411 --> 00:10:50,611
I'm leaving.

101
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:54,411
Captain.

102
00:11:05,691 --> 00:11:09,531
(Police Chief's Office)

103
00:11:16,811 --> 00:11:17,851
Vita, wait.

104
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:21,571
I'm counting on you

105
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:23,491
to handle the interview.

106
00:11:23,571 --> 00:11:24,251
But I…

107
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,571
Do your homework beforehand.

108
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:28,811
Yes, sir.

109
00:11:56,108 --> 00:11:58,744
(There's an interview at 2 p.m.)

110
00:12:17,851 --> 00:12:18,611
Wait.

111
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:19,131
What?

112
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:20,051
You can change your shoes
after coming inside.

113
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:21,051
Oh, okay.

114
00:12:23,011 --> 00:12:24,571
Sorry.

115
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:26,531
Here.

116
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:29,371
Finally home.

117
00:12:29,611 --> 00:12:31,371
Mu, I can't walk anymore.

118
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:34,611
I need you to carry me to the sofa.

119
00:12:34,651 --> 00:12:36,891
I can't carry you, Wasu.

120
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,651
All right. Come on. I'll hold you.

121
00:12:40,131 --> 00:12:40,891
Here.

122
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:42,571
The sofa's here.

123
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:43,331
Okay.

124
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:49,371
Let me hold you.

125
00:12:50,091 --> 00:12:51,731
Wasu!

126
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,891
Give me a kiss. Can I have a kiss?

127
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:55,451
Wasu, your sister is home!

128
00:12:56,731 --> 00:12:58,731
No. Why would Vita be home?

129
00:12:58,811 --> 00:12:59,811
She is.

130
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:02,611
I could smell that Vita
just took a shower.

131
00:13:04,411 --> 00:13:05,451
You can smell that?

132
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:09,331
I don't smell anything.

133
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:10,891
It's true.

134
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:12,211
Are you sure?

135
00:13:13,131 --> 00:13:14,291
You're sure she's home?

136
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,531
If not, you're getting punished.

137
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:18,651
She is.

138
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,811
Vi… Vita!

139
00:13:24,531 --> 00:13:25,851
You put on makeup.

140
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:29,811
I have to attend a media conference
at the police station later.

141
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:36,411
Make yourself at home, Mu.
I'll be going out in a bit.

142
00:13:43,611 --> 00:13:46,771
Vita sounds kind of down.

143
00:13:57,851 --> 00:14:01,331
Is the criminal that has been arrested
this time the real Luger?

144
00:14:01,771 --> 00:14:02,451
Of course.

145
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:06,011
Luger has been on the loose for years.
He has finally confessed to his crimes

146
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:10,531
after all the efforts of the police
to bring him to justice.

147
00:14:10,611 --> 00:14:12,531
The last time the Luger case was closed,

148
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:16,171
the police also said
that the real Luger was dead.

149
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:17,931
The previous Luger faked his death.

150
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:20,931
He used his men as a double.

151
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:23,931
We have full information on this matter
within the police department.

152
00:14:24,011 --> 00:14:25,771
In order to get him to lower his guard,

153
00:14:25,851 --> 00:14:27,931
we announced his death to the public,

154
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:30,931
reopened the investigation
on the Luger case

155
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,771
without his knowledge,

156
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:35,851
and ultimately captured all of them.

157
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:43,011
Could we have a recap of his capture
from Captain Pla and Officer Vita?

158
00:14:43,051 --> 00:14:45,091
Let's have Captain Pla answer that.

159
00:14:48,571 --> 00:14:50,211
Captain Pla, could you please answer?

160
00:14:53,611 --> 00:14:55,531
Why don't we have Officer Vita
answer instead?

161
00:15:03,331 --> 00:15:04,251
What's with that?

162
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:07,491
That's all for today's press conference.

163
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,611
Thank you, everyone.

164
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:15,971
They didn't give us any information.

165
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:32,611
Pita!

166
00:15:37,891 --> 00:15:39,171
I'm sorry, Vita.

167
00:15:53,731 --> 00:15:54,371
Pla,

168
00:15:54,731 --> 00:15:56,371
you didn't tell me you were coming.

169
00:16:06,971 --> 00:16:08,011
Grandma,

170
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:10,571
I'd like you to confirm something

171
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:13,971
regarding a case.

172
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:21,211
(Patient Pick-up Point)

173
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:23,971
Wait in the room with me
for a moment, Beibo.

174
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:27,131
Go with the nurse, dear.

175
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:28,211
Please.

176
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:28,971
All right.

177
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:30,891
Let's go, Beibo.

178
00:16:30,971 --> 00:16:32,211
Come this way.

179
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:33,571
Come.

180
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:50,411
Please do not touch
the body of the deceased.

181
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:07,291
Grandma Lek…

182
00:17:10,771 --> 00:17:12,971
The truth is, Badin is Luger.

183
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:21,051
I'm sorry, Grandma.

184
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,171
Grandma, no!

185
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,691
Please don't do this, Grandma!

186
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:25,611
Grandma…

187
00:17:25,691 --> 00:17:26,771
Grandma, please don't do this…

188
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:28,971
Grandma…

189
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:30,331
I'm sorry, Grandma…

190
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:40,891
I'm sorry, Grandma…

191
00:17:43,891 --> 00:17:45,931
Oh, my boy…

192
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:47,811
My boy…

193
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:09,291
I'm sorry for earlier, Pla.

194
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,051
That's the last thing I wanted to hear.

195
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,131
The two of you

196
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:16,131
have to come and visit me together.

197
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:25,171
You must come too, child.

198
00:18:30,491 --> 00:18:31,851
We'll be waiting.

199
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:37,011
The car is here, Captain.

200
00:18:38,891 --> 00:18:40,651
Take Beibo home, Grandma.

201
00:18:42,651 --> 00:18:43,411
Okay.

202
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:44,651
Come on, Beibo.

203
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:56,011
I'll take you home.

204
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:13,651
Vita.

205
00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:24,931
Pita.

206
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:28,491
Let's break up.

207
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:37,371
We should break up
because of what happened…

208
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:41,731
I'm sorry about Badin.

209
00:19:42,251 --> 00:19:44,011
But as an officer,

210
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:45,531
I had to do it.

211
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:52,211
I'm sorry to put you through the pain.

212
00:19:52,851 --> 00:19:54,131
I'm sorry, Vita.

213
00:20:27,011 --> 00:20:28,731
(Police Captain, Prach Singhadacha)

214
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:01,011
I understand your reason for resigning.

215
00:21:01,731 --> 00:21:03,451
Pla and Badin were close friends.

216
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:07,291
Badin was an excellent officer.

217
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:11,371
But I don't think

218
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:14,691
you should do this to punish yourself.

219
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:19,411
I don't want to put Captain Pla
in a difficult position,

220
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:23,171
and I don't want to drag the force down.

221
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,531
This is what I'll do.

222
00:21:26,931 --> 00:21:28,411
I'll keep your letter of resignation

223
00:21:28,611 --> 00:21:29,851
for now.

224
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:32,931
But I want you to think it over.

225
00:21:35,811 --> 00:21:37,491
(Letter of resignation,
submitted to Chief Indesh)

226
00:21:40,051 --> 00:21:40,891
In the meantime,

227
00:21:40,971 --> 00:21:44,211
I'll transfer you to do administrative work
at another precinct for now.

228
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:47,851
You can use this time to think it over.

229
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:50,531
But if you still insist

230
00:21:51,091 --> 00:21:52,731
on leaving,

231
00:21:53,931 --> 00:21:55,611
come and see me again.

232
00:21:58,851 --> 00:21:59,611
Understood.

233
00:22:44,611 --> 00:22:45,451
Excuse me.

234
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,611
I'm here to see Officer Vita.

235
00:22:47,691 --> 00:22:50,251
Police Investigators Team. Fifth floor.

236
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:04,411
I came to thank you.

237
00:23:04,971 --> 00:23:07,011
Thank you for saving my life

238
00:23:08,091 --> 00:23:09,331
at the club

239
00:23:09,411 --> 00:23:10,491
and at the warehouse.

240
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:13,691
You said you ran away from home.

241
00:23:14,451 --> 00:23:16,691
But why didn't you go home?

242
00:23:18,091 --> 00:23:19,611
I lied.

243
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:23,011
My parents are dead.

244
00:23:24,051 --> 00:23:25,491
I have no home to return to.

245
00:23:28,251 --> 00:23:30,651
I'm sorry about your parents' deaths.

246
00:23:33,131 --> 00:23:34,411
But you know

247
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:36,571
it's not good to lie.

248
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:38,931
I know.

249
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,771
But in my world,

250
00:23:43,611 --> 00:23:45,171
I've been alone for a long time.

251
00:23:47,851 --> 00:23:50,731
I just pretend to be strong

252
00:23:51,611 --> 00:23:53,971
and protect myself with lies.

253
00:23:58,491 --> 00:23:59,371
Your phone.

254
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,211
This is my personal number.

255
00:24:09,691 --> 00:24:10,531
If you're lonely

256
00:24:10,611 --> 00:24:11,691
and can't find anyone to talk to,

257
00:24:11,771 --> 00:24:12,491
you can call me.

258
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:16,291
Shouldn't I call 191
(Thailand Emergency Services)?

259
00:24:16,531 --> 00:24:18,331
If you call 191,

260
00:24:20,051 --> 00:24:21,491
you won't be talking to me.

261
00:24:30,411 --> 00:24:31,371
Is this your friend?

262
00:24:34,051 --> 00:24:34,731
Yes.

263
00:24:37,891 --> 00:24:38,771
Hello.

264
00:24:39,331 --> 00:24:40,491
Hello.

265
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:51,771
I wanted to ask.

266
00:24:53,131 --> 00:24:54,291
What's with your arm?

267
00:24:57,411 --> 00:24:59,731
I went to the hospital for a check-up.

268
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:01,811
I heard them say that

269
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:05,331
the other girls
still had toxins left in their bodies.

270
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:08,771
I'll leave you to your work. I'm off.

271
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:17,051
See you.

272
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:32,451
This feels weird.

273
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,291
We haven't been apart

274
00:25:34,531 --> 00:25:36,291
since we were in school.

275
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:38,571
Now that you're transferring
to another precinct,

276
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:40,491
it feels like I'm all alone.

277
00:25:41,891 --> 00:25:42,531
Hey,

278
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:45,091
I'm not moving to a different province.

279
00:25:45,571 --> 00:25:47,491
Just another precinct.

280
00:25:48,011 --> 00:25:49,171
Besides,

281
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:51,171
there are still so many people here.

282
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:52,691
You won't be lonely.

283
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:56,611
Da, where's the captain?

284
00:25:57,251 --> 00:26:00,131
The captain is out on a mission.

285
00:26:00,571 --> 00:26:01,931
He won't be here today.

286
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:05,771
He's avoiding Vita.

287
00:26:07,771 --> 00:26:08,491
Ning.

288
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:12,371
Well, I'll be going.

289
00:26:22,211 --> 00:26:22,851
Here.

290
00:26:37,531 --> 00:26:38,451
See you guys.

291
00:26:54,451 --> 00:27:01,171
(Police Investigators Team)

292
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:05,931
(Royal Thai Police)

293
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,411
You're the new police officer
here to report for duty, right?

294
00:28:14,451 --> 00:28:15,131
Yes.

295
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:16,811
Here.

296
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:19,411
This way.

297
00:28:21,651 --> 00:28:23,291
This is your workstation.

298
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,811
But it looks like
someone's still working here.

299
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:29,451
She transferred.

300
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:33,731
These are all the paperwork
you need to take over.

301
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:36,851
I'll take my leave.

302
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:38,131
Excuse me.

303
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,051
Where has she been transferred to?

304
00:28:41,571 --> 00:28:43,051
To the border.

305
00:28:45,651 --> 00:28:46,491
Please help yourself.

306
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:47,291
Okay.

307
00:28:55,331 --> 00:28:55,971
Hello.

308
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:58,051
The documents, Officer.

309
00:29:11,531 --> 00:29:12,411
It's nothing, Officer.

310
00:29:12,491 --> 00:29:13,691
I just dropped a file.

311
00:29:50,811 --> 00:29:51,771
(Hi!)

312
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:54,971
(Hello from Mumbai!)

313
00:29:55,531 --> 00:29:57,051
(You're heartless.)

314
00:29:57,091 --> 00:30:00,171
(I've called you hundreds of times,
and you didn't answer.)

315
00:30:00,531 --> 00:30:01,931
(It's my birthday today.)

316
00:30:01,971 --> 00:30:04,051
(Can I get a present from you?)

317
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:06,651
(I just want a smile from you.)

318
00:30:07,091 --> 00:30:09,291
(That's what I want.)

319
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:11,131
(Thanks, Vita.)

320
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:14,691
(I know
you're Captain Pla's girlfriend now.)

321
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,011
(But he isn't as handsome as me.)

322
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:19,091
(Sorry.)

323
00:30:19,171 --> 00:30:21,931
(Hope we can see
each other again soon, Vita.)

324
00:30:22,011 --> 00:30:23,651
(I hope you're happy.)

325
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:25,571
(Happy birthday to me.)

326
00:30:36,691 --> 00:30:40,171
(Don't forget we have a date today!)

327
00:30:40,211 --> 00:30:43,731
(Yes. I'm off work. I'm leaving now.)

328
00:30:52,331 --> 00:30:55,491
(I've called her several times,
but she isn't picking up.)

329
00:31:03,371 --> 00:31:04,331
(Police Lieutenant Badin Unga, dead)

330
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:06,051
Eig escaped!

331
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:08,011
The nurse had me answer a call.

332
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:08,891
Said it was an emergency.

333
00:31:09,211 --> 00:31:12,811
(This piece of candy paper must be
connected to the mole in the station.)

334
00:31:20,891 --> 00:31:21,571
Sir,

335
00:31:21,811 --> 00:31:23,691
follow that black car!

336
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:35,451
(Panacee Hospital Rama II)

337
00:31:40,451 --> 00:31:42,051
Sir! Sir, stop here!

338
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:19,331
No surveillance cameras.

339
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:33,371
Living donor KG-W450 is ready
for the lady in room C008.

340
00:33:37,211 --> 00:33:38,171
Lady?

341
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:31,011
C008?

342
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:30,011
Miss?

343
00:35:30,891 --> 00:35:31,731
Miss?

344
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:36,331
(They took my kidney…)

345
00:36:39,891 --> 00:36:40,811
Chief.

346
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:43,531
She's your wife, isn't she?

347
00:36:43,931 --> 00:36:45,651
Why did you take that woman here?

348
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:00,691
Honey,

349
00:37:00,771 --> 00:37:02,491
what's going on?

350
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:05,411
Nothing.

351
00:37:05,851 --> 00:37:07,371
Relax.

352
00:37:07,531 --> 00:37:08,971
You'll be all better

353
00:37:09,451 --> 00:37:10,651
after the surgery.

354
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:11,451
Okay…

355
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,891
Later, I'll take care of…

356
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:16,571
Don't worry about me.

357
00:37:17,811 --> 00:37:21,451
I'm proud of my police husband.

358
00:37:35,931 --> 00:37:36,851
Nurse!

359
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:38,331
Miss!

360
00:37:38,971 --> 00:37:40,011
Nurse!

361
00:37:40,251 --> 00:37:41,811
Call the police!

362
00:37:57,171 --> 00:37:58,011
All right.

363
00:37:58,251 --> 00:37:59,611
This is what happened.

364
00:37:59,691 --> 00:38:01,891
You came to visit my wife.

365
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:05,331
We talked about Pla.

366
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:06,811
You told me

367
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,731
you felt guilty

368
00:38:08,811 --> 00:38:10,971
for accidentally killing his friend.

369
00:38:12,011 --> 00:38:13,771
You grew so anxious

370
00:38:13,851 --> 00:38:15,611
until you lost your senses

371
00:38:16,451 --> 00:38:18,331
and shot this nurse

372
00:38:18,771 --> 00:38:19,851
using this gun.

373
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:21,451
What happened, sir?

374
00:38:22,331 --> 00:38:23,651
This woman suddenly went mad

375
00:38:23,731 --> 00:38:25,011
and lost control

376
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:27,851
and killed your colleague.

377
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,771
So I'm taking care of her.

378
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:32,731
Is… Is that true, sir?

379
00:38:37,971 --> 00:38:38,851
No!

380
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,091
Nurse,

381
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:54,251
is there no security here?

382
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:55,371
Not today.

383
00:38:55,411 --> 00:38:58,011
On special days like today,
when there are organ transplants,

384
00:38:58,091 --> 00:39:02,171
the hospital is only staffed by a limited number
of people who know what's going on.

385
00:39:05,931 --> 00:39:07,011
Organ transplants?

386
00:39:07,651 --> 00:39:09,971
Surgeries? What are you guys doing?

387
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:20,411
Turn left.

388
00:39:23,731 --> 00:39:24,651
This way.

389
00:39:31,051 --> 00:39:31,971
Nurse…

390
00:39:49,171 --> 00:39:50,611
Restore everything.

391
00:39:50,771 --> 00:39:51,971
Cancel the operation.

392
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:42,171
Chief.

393
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:43,531
Let Vita go.

394
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:47,291
So

395
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:49,411
you were the mole.

396
00:40:49,971 --> 00:40:51,571
In other words,

397
00:40:51,811 --> 00:40:52,931
you're Luger.

398
00:40:53,011 --> 00:40:53,731
Shut up!

399
00:40:53,771 --> 00:40:54,651
Chief.

400
00:40:56,091 --> 00:40:57,051
Put the gun down

401
00:40:57,531 --> 00:40:58,731
and surrender.

402
00:41:00,611 --> 00:41:02,251
I don't want anyone else to die.

403
00:41:03,771 --> 00:41:04,531
Mr. Han,

404
00:41:06,171 --> 00:41:06,931
Badin,

405
00:41:07,451 --> 00:41:08,971
and countless people died

406
00:41:09,531 --> 00:41:12,051
because you wanted to save your wife.

407
00:41:14,011 --> 00:41:15,251
I saved

408
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:16,851
Badin.

409
00:41:17,211 --> 00:41:20,091
I gave him a second shot at life.

410
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:23,331
(Sir, we have a man down here.)

411
00:41:23,651 --> 00:41:25,411
(It's not looking good. What do we do?)

412
00:41:29,331 --> 00:41:30,691
If I hadn't saved him,

413
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:32,571
he would've been long dead.

414
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:36,571
Why did you force Badin
to pretend to be Luger?

415
00:41:38,051 --> 00:41:39,971
You really want to know?

416
00:41:40,051 --> 00:41:42,051
It's all because of you.

417
00:41:43,891 --> 00:41:44,891
Me?

418
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:46,851
You think

419
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:50,211
you did all those things to help Badin.

420
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:52,371
But that's the case for him.

421
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:55,051
He's always lived in your shadow.

422
00:41:55,811 --> 00:41:56,571
Since he was a child

423
00:41:56,771 --> 00:41:58,251
until he became a police officer.

424
00:41:59,171 --> 00:42:00,611
I know him best.

425
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:03,531
He could get everything he wanted

426
00:42:04,051 --> 00:42:05,451
once he became Luger,

427
00:42:05,531 --> 00:42:06,691
including respect,

428
00:42:07,571 --> 00:42:09,091
obedience, and recognition.

429
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:10,091
Impossible!

430
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:12,771
I know Badin.

431
00:42:13,051 --> 00:42:14,291
That's not him.

432
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:16,731
He knows right from wrong.

433
00:42:16,811 --> 00:42:17,571
Yes.

434
00:42:18,691 --> 00:42:19,891
He did.

435
00:42:20,091 --> 00:42:21,931
But the day you abandoned him

436
00:42:22,011 --> 00:42:23,091
and left him to die,

437
00:42:23,411 --> 00:42:25,451
all of that disappeared.

438
00:42:25,531 --> 00:42:27,691
All that's left is the truth.

439
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:29,451
The truth is, you abandoned him.

440
00:42:29,531 --> 00:42:31,411
The truth is, no one loved him

441
00:42:31,971 --> 00:42:33,891
or knew him as much as I did.

442
00:42:35,051 --> 00:42:37,171
I'm giving you one last warning.

443
00:42:38,731 --> 00:42:40,411
Let Vita go.

444
00:42:41,451 --> 00:42:43,371
I don't want anyone else to die.

445
00:42:45,651 --> 00:42:47,251
What will you have me do?

446
00:42:47,491 --> 00:42:49,411
I've come this far.

447
00:42:49,491 --> 00:42:51,891
I've made my choice.

448
00:42:51,971 --> 00:42:52,931
I cannot turn back.

449
00:42:53,011 --> 00:42:54,811

450

Sorry.

558
00:49:01,251 --> 00:49:02,051
Thank you.

559
00:49:06,851 --> 00:49:07,491
Okay.

560
00:49:49,771 --> 00:49:51,451
Can't stay in your ward any longer?

561
00:49:51,931 --> 00:49:53,571
Well, I'm worried about you.

562
00:49:56,731 --> 00:49:57,571
You're awake!

563
00:49:57,891 --> 00:49:59,571
You're late, little snail.

564
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,171
Ouch…

565
00:50:11,731 --> 00:50:13,171
How's your injury?

566
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:16,771
It still hurts a little.

567
00:50:18,491 --> 00:50:21,011
Can you still move your left arm?

568
00:50:22,731 --> 00:50:23,491
What's wrong?

569
00:50:35,891 --> 00:50:38,451
I'm waiting for the way
when you can put this on me.

570
00:50:39,331 --> 00:50:39,971
That's

571
00:50:40,331 --> 00:50:43,371
the day I'll marry you.

572
00:50:46,051 --> 00:50:47,651
If that's the case, I'm always ready.

573
00:50:47,731 --> 00:50:48,491
Come on.

574
00:50:59,531 --> 00:51:02,651
But how did you know where I was?

575
00:51:08,091 --> 00:51:09,451
You know the answer.

576
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:11,691
This necklace is

577
00:51:12,171 --> 00:51:13,531
a signal transmitter.

578
00:51:15,411 --> 00:51:17,851
I can protect you on all fronts,

579
00:51:18,491 --> 00:51:20,051
no matter where you are.

580
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:23,171
I don't want to lose you.

581
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:36,051
It's her.

582
00:51:36,131 --> 00:51:36,811
What?

583
00:51:37,051 --> 00:51:40,131
I said, she is our daughter-in-law.

584
00:51:40,411 --> 00:51:42,331
Huh?
But didn't you say you didn't like her?

585
00:51:43,051 --> 00:51:45,171
I can feel and understand

586
00:51:45,251 --> 00:51:48,011
the way she looks at my son.

587
00:51:48,651 --> 00:51:52,851
The look in her eyes says
everything about love.

588
00:51:58,011 --> 00:51:58,811
Hold on.

589
00:51:59,011 --> 00:51:59,931
Where are you going?

590
00:52:00,211 --> 00:52:01,091
What?

591
00:52:01,611 --> 00:52:03,251
I'm not needed here.

592
00:52:05,651 --> 00:52:08,691
I'm going to find a wedding planner
to organise the wedding.

593
00:52:11,891 --> 00:52:12,931
Congratulations!

594
00:52:51,331 --> 00:52:52,611
You look pretty.

595
00:53:06,371 --> 00:53:08,251
The beautiful bride, Miss Vita,

596
00:53:08,331 --> 00:53:11,731
will now walk down the aisle
to her groom, Mr. Pla.

597
00:53:55,451 --> 00:53:57,411
Thank you, Mr. Wasu.

598
00:54:12,531 --> 00:54:13,411
Mr. Pla,

599
00:54:13,931 --> 00:54:17,571
do you take this fair lady, Miss Vita,

600
00:54:17,971 --> 00:54:19,651
to be your wife,

601
00:54:19,931 --> 00:54:21,531
for better, for worse,

602
00:54:21,731 --> 00:54:23,451
for richer, for poorer,

603
00:54:23,691 --> 00:54:26,491
in sickness, in health,

604
00:54:26,571 --> 00:54:28,011
forever stay by her side,

605
00:54:28,091 --> 00:54:29,531
until death do you part?

606
00:54:29,611 --> 00:54:30,531
I do.

607
00:54:31,211 --> 00:54:32,211
Miss Vita,

608
00:54:32,411 --> 00:54:37,131
do you take this handsome man, Mr. Pla,
to be your husband,

609
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:39,611
for better, for worse,

610
00:54:39,691 --> 00:54:41,451
for richer, for poorer,

611
00:54:41,771 --> 00:54:43,651
in sickness, in health,

612
00:54:43,931 --> 00:54:47,491
forever stay by his side,

613
00:54:47,571 --> 00:54:49,011
until death do you part?

614
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:53,331
I do.

615
00:54:54,171 --> 00:54:57,211
Will the bride and groom
please exchange rings?

616
00:55:39,251 --> 00:55:42,171
Do we want a kiss from the couple?

617
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:43,331
Yes!

618
00:55:43,371 --> 00:55:44,051
Let's give them some support!

619
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,171
Kiss!

620
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:45,931
Kiss!

621
00:55:46,491 --> 00:55:47,531
Kiss!

622
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:48,971
Captain, give us a kiss!

623
00:55:49,051 --> 00:55:49,811
Kiss!

624
00:55:49,851 --> 00:55:51,371
Kiss!

625
00:55:51,411 --> 00:55:52,451
Kiss!

626
00:55:52,531 --> 00:55:53,971
Kiss!

627
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:55,291
Kiss! Kiss…

628
00:56:16,531 --> 00:56:17,451
Ready.

629
00:56:38,491 --> 00:56:39,371
Withdraw.

630
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:45,451
Now, we ask all the single ladies

631
00:56:45,491 --> 00:56:48,491
to prepare to catch the bouquet.

632
00:56:48,691 --> 00:56:49,451
Please.

633
00:56:54,771 --> 00:56:55,691
One.

634
00:56:56,411 --> 00:56:57,251
Two.

635
00:56:58,211 --> 00:56:59,291
Three.

636
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:13,051
Kiss! Kiss…

637
00:57:28,931 --> 00:57:31,531
(Best wishes to the happy couple.)

638
00:57:31,571 --> 00:57:33,131
(I'm sorry I couldn't be there
to congratulate you in person.)

639
00:57:33,211 --> 00:57:35,171
(Signed, Sen.)

640
00:57:38,811 --> 00:57:39,491
All right.

641
00:57:46,411 --> 00:57:47,251
Let's put it on.

642
00:58:06,171 --> 00:58:07,891
Who are you looking for?

643
00:58:08,491 --> 00:58:11,371
Looks like that person
isn't at the party yet.

644
00:58:11,451 --> 00:58:13,411
Goodness, mister,

645
00:58:13,771 --> 00:58:15,811
the ceremony is already over.

646
00:58:15,891 --> 00:58:17,051
Where have you been?

647
00:58:17,571 --> 00:58:18,811
Oh, are you upset?

648
00:58:21,851 --> 00:58:22,691
Don't stay mad.

649
00:58:22,891 --> 00:58:26,571
Gosh, how thrifty.

650
00:58:26,851 --> 00:58:27,931
Will you accept this flower for now?

651
00:58:28,011 --> 00:58:29,771
I'll apologise to my superior later.

652
00:58:29,851 --> 00:58:32,811
So will you join
the after party with me?

653
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:35,371
I guess I could forgive you
for your superior's sake.

654
00:58:36,091 --> 00:58:36,731
Come.

655
00:58:37,011 --> 00:58:38,171
Please.

656
00:58:38,491 --> 00:58:39,571
(Here?)

657
00:58:41,091 --> 00:58:42,371
One, two.

658
00:58:42,411 --> 00:58:43,771
One, two.

659
00:58:43,851 --> 00:58:44,971
One more.

660
00:58:45,051 --> 00:58:45,891
One, two.

661
00:58:45,931 --> 00:58:47,211
Stand a little closer to each other.

662
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:49,251
A little closer. A little more.

663
00:58:49,331 --> 00:58:50,691
A little more. Closer.

664
00:58:51,051 --> 00:58:52,611
Okay. One more. Smile.

665
00:58:52,691 --> 00:58:53,971
One, two.

666
00:58:55,491 --> 00:58:56,971
Can I

667
00:58:58,491 --> 00:59:00,211
wear the lion hat?

668
00:59:01,051 --> 00:59:01,731
No.

669
00:59:02,451 --> 00:59:03,811
Keep wearing your snail.

670
00:59:04,411 --> 00:59:06,331
Please, Pita?

671
00:59:06,411 --> 00:59:09,051
I want to wear the lion hat.

672
00:59:09,611 --> 00:59:10,891
Okay.

673
00:59:16,491 --> 00:59:17,291
It suits you perfectly.

674
00:59:17,371 --> 00:59:18,051
No.

675
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:22,931
One, two, three.

676
00:59:34,451 --> 00:59:35,811
All right. Beautiful.

677
00:59:35,891 --> 00:59:37,971
Please take a seat.

678
00:59:38,051 --> 00:59:39,651
I'll go transfer the photos.
I'll be right back.

679
00:59:39,691 --> 00:59:40,531
Okay.

680
00:59:52,251 --> 00:59:53,451
It's amazing.

681
00:59:54,811 --> 00:59:56,331
When I had just graduated and joined

682
00:59:56,771 --> 00:59:58,771
the Police Investigators Team,

683
00:59:59,131 --> 01:00:00,931
I had to run laps here every day.

684
01:00:01,691 --> 01:00:04,691
Whenever I got tired
and couldn't run anymore,

685
01:00:05,451 --> 01:00:07,651
I would complain to the tree.

686
01:00:11,731 --> 01:00:12,891
One day,

687
01:00:12,931 --> 01:00:14,611
a kind man

688
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:16,771
gave me a bottle of water

689
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:18,931
and said…

690
01:00:19,371 --> 01:00:20,691
The police's duty is to protect

691
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,011
the people.

692
01:00:24,611 --> 01:00:26,251
How did you know?

693
01:00:27,611 --> 01:00:28,451
Are you…

694
01:00:28,531 --> 01:00:32,291
One, two. One, two.

695
01:00:32,371 --> 01:00:35,571
One, two. One, two.

696
01:00:35,651 --> 01:00:37,811
One, two. One, two.

697
01:00:41,691 --> 01:00:43,931
The police's duty is to protect
the people

698
01:00:44,291 --> 01:00:45,891
and stop crimes.

699
01:00:47,171 --> 01:00:49,771
The police's duty is to protect
the people

700
01:00:49,811 --> 01:00:51,371
and stop crimes.

701
01:01:02,011 --> 01:01:03,451
The police's duty

702
01:01:03,531 --> 01:01:06,291
is to protect
the people and stop crimes.

703
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,451
But you have to learn
to protect yourself

704
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:09,851
before you can protect the people.

705
01:01:13,451 --> 01:01:14,451
Yes, sir.

706
01:01:42,491 --> 01:01:44,651
I received word from Captain Pla

707
01:01:44,731 --> 01:01:46,771
that we're getting a newcomer today.

708
01:01:47,251 --> 01:01:49,091
More importantly,

709
01:01:49,451 --> 01:01:51,131
it's a female officer.

710
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:54,411
I looked her up.

711
01:01:54,491 --> 01:01:57,131
I heard she graduated top of her class.

712
01:01:57,251 --> 01:01:58,011
That's right.

713
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,371
Most importantly,

714
01:01:59,811 --> 01:02:01,011
she's hot.

715
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:01,891
Hot?

716
01:02:01,971 --> 01:02:02,931
Yes.

717
01:02:04,491 --> 01:02:05,731
So do you know

718
01:02:05,771 --> 01:02:06,451
her name?

719
01:02:06,531 --> 01:02:09,651
Second Lieutenant Visachon Sisiuri.

720
01:02:09,691 --> 01:02:11,611
Reporting for duty on my first day

721
01:02:11,651 --> 01:02:12,691
in the department.

722
01:02:22,691 --> 01:02:25,531
Your score for the physical

723
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,731
was only 50.1.

724
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:28,891
Just over the passing mark.

725
01:02:28,971 --> 01:02:29,691
Yes.

726
01:02:32,011 --> 01:02:34,491
And you're still determined
to become a police officer?

727
01:02:34,571 --> 01:02:35,331
Yes.

728
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:42,651
Officer Vita.

729
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:01,331
You need a coach
to help you improve your fitness.

730
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:04,491
Leave this task to me.

731
01:03:07,691 --> 01:03:08,731
Thank you.

732
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:11,771
Counting on you, Coach.

733
01:03:15,411 --> 01:03:16,411
The pleasure is mine.

734
01:03:22,011 --> 01:03:22,891
So clingy.

735
01:03:22,971 --> 01:03:23,811
Of course.

736
01:03:23,891 --> 01:03:24,971
We're newlyweds.

737
01:03:25,011 --> 01:03:26,171
Newlyweds.

738
01:03:26,211 --> 01:03:26,891
That's right.

739
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:28,731
That's why we're lovey-dovey.

740
01:03:29,451 --> 01:03:30,331
Hello, Wasu.

741
01:03:31,491 --> 01:03:34,131
Wasu, where are you? Everyone's here.

742
01:03:35,531 --> 01:03:36,411
Hello!

743
01:03:36,451 --> 01:03:38,011
- Hello!
- Hi!

744
01:03:38,051 --> 01:03:39,131
- Hi.
- Vita.

745
01:03:39,371 --> 01:03:42,331
(Mu and I are too busy with the shop.)

746
01:03:42,411 --> 01:03:45,211
We need to purchase extra supplies.
We won't be able to make it.

747
01:03:45,251 --> 01:03:46,051
Sorry.

748
01:03:46,091 --> 01:03:46,771
But

749
01:03:46,811 --> 01:03:49,091
we sent you guys a cake as an apology.

750
01:03:49,171 --> 01:03:50,851
This is from Mr. Wasu.

751
01:03:56,331 --> 01:03:58,811
What's this?
Congratulations? For what, Meili?

752
01:03:58,891 --> 01:04:00,011
Congratulations

753
01:04:00,091 --> 01:04:02,291
to Meili for scoring full marks.

754
01:04:03,491 --> 01:04:04,371
Well done!

755
01:04:04,411 --> 01:04:06,211
Meili, let me tell you something.

756
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:09,411
I made that cake for you myself.

757
01:04:09,491 --> 01:04:11,651
Fresh out of the oven.
I guarantee you'll love it.

758
01:04:11,731 --> 01:04:13,491
So next time we meet,

759
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,651
you have to let your uncle
give you a kiss.

760
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:18,171
Uncle is a liar.

761
01:04:18,251 --> 01:04:19,771
I won't let you kiss me.

762
01:04:21,811 --> 01:04:24,291
You only wrote the words on the cake.

763
01:04:24,371 --> 01:04:25,971
Miss Mu made the rest.

764
01:04:26,011 --> 01:04:27,371
Isn't that right, Miss Mu?

765
01:04:27,651 --> 01:04:28,691
Yes.

766
01:04:29,171 --> 01:04:30,531
Clever girl.
Can't hide anything from you.

767
01:04:31,331 --> 01:04:32,171
Actually…

768
01:04:32,211 --> 01:04:33,171
First of all,

769
01:04:33,251 --> 01:04:34,811
all your updates
on your social media accounts today

770
01:04:34,851 --> 01:04:36,571
have been about work, work, work.

771
01:04:36,651 --> 01:04:38,931
How could you find time to bake a cake?

772
01:04:39,011 --> 01:04:39,891
Secondly,

773
01:04:39,931 --> 01:04:43,011
Miss Mu must've prepared
the cake already, right?

774
01:04:44,611 --> 01:04:45,971
Thirdly,

775
01:04:46,211 --> 01:04:47,531
you came home late

776
01:04:47,971 --> 01:04:48,931
because of work,

777
01:04:50,131 --> 01:04:54,131
so you only managed to write
on the cake, isn't that right?

778
01:04:57,091 --> 01:04:58,531
I give up.

779
01:04:58,611 --> 01:05:00,291
You're good,

780
01:05:00,331 --> 01:05:01,571
little detective.

781
01:05:02,571 --> 01:05:04,011
(We have to go.)

782
01:05:04,091 --> 01:05:06,571
(You guys enjoy the cake.)

783
01:05:06,651 --> 01:05:08,171
(All right. Bye, everyone.)

784
01:05:08,291 --> 01:05:10,731
Bye…

785
01:05:11,011 --> 01:05:11,811
Bye.

786
01:05:11,851 --> 01:05:12,571
Bye.

787
01:05:20,891 --> 01:05:23,171
Wait.
Our daughter is playing the princess.

788
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:24,131
She'll be coming out soon.

789
01:05:25,531 --> 01:05:27,531
Help! Help!

790
01:05:27,571 --> 01:05:28,731
That's a boy.

791
01:05:28,811 --> 01:05:30,411
Is she a supporting character?

792
01:05:30,851 --> 01:05:32,611
So what is our daughter playing?

793
01:05:32,731 --> 01:05:33,891
That's the question.

794
01:05:34,691 --> 01:05:38,131
Save me, Prince! Save me!

795
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:40,411
Save me, Prince!

796
01:05:41,571 --> 01:05:43,011
Stop, evil dragon!

797
01:05:43,091 --> 01:05:44,451
Release the princess!

798
01:05:47,731 --> 01:05:49,291
Meili is the prince!

799
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:13,051
Vita,

800
01:06:13,571 --> 01:06:17,011
I think there's something
about the boy playing the princess.

801
01:06:17,771 --> 01:06:18,491
What do you mean?

802
01:06:19,091 --> 01:06:19,971
Handsome boy,

803
01:06:20,971 --> 01:06:21,491
come here.

804
01:06:21,531 --> 01:06:22,291
Yes.

805
01:06:24,611 --> 01:06:25,571
You…

806
01:06:26,731 --> 01:06:27,691
What is it, Meili?

807
01:06:28,571 --> 01:06:32,491
Dad, don't be mean to Wu.
He's a good boy.

808
01:06:32,731 --> 01:06:34,411
Yes, I know.

809
01:06:35,371 --> 01:06:38,731
When I grow up,
I'm going to marry Meili.

810
01:06:40,811 --> 01:06:42,491
A little too mature for his age.

811
01:06:42,691 --> 01:06:45,811
I need a word with your parents.

812
01:06:45,891 --> 01:06:49,611
My dad told me I should go after
a girl I like when I meet her,

813
01:06:49,691 --> 01:06:52,651
or I'll regret it in the future.

814
01:06:56,451 --> 01:06:57,451
Here, Meili.

815
01:06:57,531 --> 01:06:59,691
You can have my favourite snack.

816
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:01,811
But I have a request.

817
01:07:01,891 --> 01:07:04,131
You have to go on three dates with me.

818
01:07:05,251 --> 01:07:06,371
No, Meili. Don't do it.

819
01:07:07,051 --> 01:07:08,131
Meili!

820
01:07:09,451 --> 01:07:10,451
You accepted just like that?

821
01:07:11,771 --> 01:07:13,051
Three times?

822
01:07:14,891 --> 01:07:16,091
That sounds

823
01:07:16,291 --> 01:07:17,211
familiar.

824
01:07:18,171 --> 01:07:19,331
Where's your father?

825
01:07:24,731 --> 01:07:25,651
Sen?

826
01:07:25,731 --> 01:07:27,251
Excellent, my son.

827
01:07:27,411 --> 01:07:28,451
Vita.

828
01:07:28,731 --> 01:07:29,611
Pla.

829
01:07:31,931 --> 01:07:32,811
Son, listen to me.

830
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,940
You have to win Meili over.
You have my support.

831
01:07:35,091 --> 01:07:36,211
Marry her and bring her home.

832
01:07:36,531 --> 01:07:39,731
Let this hope motivate us
and fight until we make it happen.

833
01:07:39,771 --> 01:07:40,531
Got it?

834
01:07:40,611 --> 01:07:41,491
Got it, Dad.

835
01:07:41,571 --> 01:07:42,211
Good boy.

836
01:07:42,371 --> 01:07:44,491
Meili, I love you.

837
01:07:45,331 --> 01:07:46,411
"I love you."

838
01:07:51,571 --> 01:07:53,051
Sen. That brat.

839
01:07:55,891 --> 01:07:56,851
That brat.

840
01:07:57,811 --> 01:07:58,891
You little brat!

841
01:07:59,971 --> 01:08:03,811
I will not let Meili marry your son!

842
01:08:05,011 --> 01:08:05,971
Right, Meili?

843
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:07,891
No.

844
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:10,091
Meili,

845
01:08:11,331 --> 01:08:12,971
don't tell me you like Wu.

846
01:08:13,411 --> 01:08:14,331
I do.

847
01:08:14,731 --> 01:08:15,651
Meili…

848
01:08:16,331 --> 01:08:17,371
I'm so sad.

849
01:08:17,411 --> 01:08:18,611
Don't like him.

850
01:08:19,091 --> 01:08:19,771
No.

851
01:08:23,051 --> 01:08:23,971
Naughty.

852
01:08:25,451 --> 01:08:26,531
Thank you.

853
01:08:32,971 --> 01:08:34,491
Our daughter is here.

854
01:08:35,171 --> 01:08:36,571
She's playing with the ball.
She won't see us.

855
01:08:36,651 --> 01:08:37,651
Meili!

856
01:08:38,691 --> 01:08:39,651
Don't go too far.

857
01:08:39,931 --> 01:08:40,851
Okay.

858
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,651
Thank you for picking up my ball.

859
01:09:05,131 --> 01:09:06,251
Don't mention it.

860
01:09:06,611 --> 01:09:08,771
I've been waiting for you here,

861
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:09,691
little girl.

862
01:09:10,371 --> 01:09:12,291
Waiting for me?

863
01:09:12,331 --> 01:09:13,891
Who are you?

864
01:09:13,971 --> 01:09:15,851
I'm your father's friend.

865
01:09:16,771 --> 01:09:18,171
I'm Luger.

866
01:09:18,531 --> 01:09:19,851
Luger.

867
01:09:20,851 --> 01:09:21,851
Thank you.
