3
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,300
(An adaptation of the novel
"When a Snail Falls in Love" by Ding Mo)

4
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,320
Captain.

5
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,520
I have a breakthrough.

6
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,320
Captain!

7
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Are you a flasher now?

8
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,760
How dare you dirty Vita's pristine eyes?

9
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,080
Look away, Vita.

10
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,480
You shouldn't see this.

11
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,360
I didn't know Vita would be here.

12
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm here to update you about the case.

13
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,520
Come in.

14
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,040
Sorry.

15
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,680
It's confidential information.
Outsiders are not allowed.

16
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,600
But Vita cannot be alone

17
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,240
with a perverted flasher like you.

18
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,600
Besides,
I helped Vita find the new lead.

19
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,440
Is that so?

20
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,760
No still means no.

21
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,200
My limited blazer! It cannot be wet
or come into contact with skin!

22
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,840
Just let me use it to cover up.

23
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,440
(Thank you for driving me here, Sen.)

24
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,520
(You must be tired now)

25
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,920
(so just go home.)

26
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,320
Sorry.

27
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,360
I don't usually have visitors

28
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,880
so it's messy in here.

29
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,240
You look so happy in this photo.

30
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,320
You

31
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,960
should smile more.

32
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,440
Like you did in the photo.

33
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,400
I'll smile like this

34
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,520
when you come to my wedding.

35
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,320
You have a girlfriend already?

36
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,760
- I...
- I...

37
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,560
Captain!

38
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,080
What is that noise?

39
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,520
It must be my neighbor's cat.

40
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,200
You mentioned a new lead.

41
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,920
What is it?

42
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,200
This is the security footage in front
of the club's entrance that night.

43
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,360
After Lina and Sen parted ways,

44
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,680
she run into a stranger who asked her
for directions.

45
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,000
She then left with him.

46
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,680
The stranger looks like Thana.

47
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,520
It's suspicious because

48
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,320
he was waiting for Lina
to take the bait.

49
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,800
Maybe the man's target
was Lina all along

50
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,360
and he approached her
by asking for directions.

51
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,760
Lina then fell for him

52
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,920
due to his good look

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,280
and sports car.

54
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,160
She thought she landed someone rich.

55
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,760
I...

56
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,600
I

57
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,280
should go back first.

58
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,280
I'll give you a ride.

59
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,840
Thanks.

60
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,320
Vita.

61
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,920
Vita.

62
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,120
How was your date with Sen?

63
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,680
We dined in a restaurant

64
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,520
and even ran into two of his exes.

65
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,960
It's amusing.

66
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,720
I also obtained a new lead

67
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,520
so it's a productive day.

68
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,400
You ran into two of his exes.

69
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,400
Shouldn't you be mad?

70
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,280
Why should I?

71
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,800
Anyway,

72
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,280
I went to see your doctor.

73
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,520
He said you could take the painkillers
if the wound is inflamed.

74
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,280
He told you to rest sufficiently

75
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,480
(I'm worried about you)
in case the condition worsens.

76
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,480
Thanks,

77
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,480
Dr. Vita.

78
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,640
(Ming)

79
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,000
(Ming,)

80
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,920
(I got a photo of Thana.)

81
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,080
Hello? Where are you?

82
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,440
I'm at Noah Bar.

83
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,840
Wait.

84
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,280
Why are you there?

85
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,840
Don't you know the killer

86
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,480
finds his victim in a club?

87
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,560
I know.

88
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,600
I checked Lina's record.

89
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,480
She spent a lot of money here,

90
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,520
which means
she often visited this place.

91
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,480
I want to see
if I can get some leads here.

92
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,080
Ming?

93
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,160
Da?

94
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,280
Hello?

95
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,080
Ming?

96
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,520
Ming?

97
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,960
Da, repeat that again?

98
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,120
Hey, hottie.

99
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
Here alone?

100
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,040
Why?

101
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,240
Me too.

102
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,040
Let's

103
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,800
drink together.

104
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,280
Do you know this woman?

105
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,320
No.

106
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,400
Why?

107
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,360
Is she your friend?

108
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,040
Never mind then.

109
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,160
Just leave me alone.

110
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,200
I'll be frank with you.

111
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,040
You are my type.

112
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,600
Drink with me

113
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,600
and I'll leave you alone.

114
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,480
Don't drink it.

115
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,480
He spiked the drink.

116
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,000
Dude.

117
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,520
Who are you?

118
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,760
(Chayan, businessman)
How could you accuse me of spiking the drink?

119
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,960
Drink it then.

120
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,520
You dodged a bullet.

121
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,920
One low-LBV cocktail, please.

122
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,640
Okay.

123
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,880
Thanks.

124
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,360
But how did you know

125
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,880
it was spiked?

126
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,120
If I said

127
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,160
I had noticed you
the moment you walked in,

128
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,600
but I was too shy to say hi,

129
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,520
and I saw what he did,

130
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,880
would you believe me?

131
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,080
A woman drinks alone for two reasons.

132
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,400
Either it's because you're lonely

133
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,000
or you simply enjoy the solitude.

134
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,720
You must be the latter.

135
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,040
I don't want to ruin your fun

136
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,160
so enjoy.

137
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,760
But be careful.

138
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Great timing.

139
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,040
Excuse me.

140
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,800
I believe you'll like this.

141
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,880
All right.

142
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,760
Let's get this place all fired up!

143
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,680
Let's welcome our exotic dancer, Pink!

144
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,840
Serve you right.

145
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,680
Should have just

146
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,920
minded your own business.

147
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,720
Mister?

148
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,080
That jerk.

149
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,600
Wait.

150
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,440
I'm fine. Don't go for him.

151
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,440
Are you all right?

152
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,720
It hurts a bit.

153
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,360
You're...

154
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,560
Ming.

155
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,880
I'll hail you a cab.

156
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,080
It's okay.

157
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
I can walk.

158
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,000
Walk then.

159
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Thanks, Ming.

160
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,720
I'm Chayan.

161
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,440
Okay.

162
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,680
Turn right.

163
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,280
You...

164
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,160
Are you sure you're all right?

165
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,600
I'm fine.

166
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,160
You should go to the hospital.

167
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,360
I'll be fine.

168
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,960
The cab is here.

169
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,800
Let me give you a lift.

170
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,040
To thank you for your timely rescue.

171
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,120
Please?

172
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,240
Let me help.

173
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,480
Okay.

174
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,160
Thanks.

175
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,680
Oh, you.

176
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,280
(Home now?)

177
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,400
(Worry about yourself.)

178
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,480
(Don't forget to put some ointment.)

179
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,000
(Thank you for helping out.)

180
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,000
(How lucky I am to have met you.)

181
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,800
(I shall not disturb your rest.)

182
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,920
(Sweet dreams.)

183
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,280
(A young 25-year-old woman
was found dead)

184
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,960
(inside the rubbish container behind
the abandoned building.)

185
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,920
In such a short period of time,

186
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,720
the murderer murdered
someone with the same method.

187
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,600
Regardless if he's the same
murderer as three years ago,

188
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,160
you need to solve the case quickly.

189
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,960
At least before the press links
these two cases.

190
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,840
Yes, sir.

191
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,760
We will get to the bottom of this.

192
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,560
Noted.

193
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,200
Noted.

194
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,480
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

195
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,000
Captain.

196
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,480
Something feels off.

197
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,000
Tell me.

198
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,800
The victims from both cases

199
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,560
died of cyanide poisoning.

200
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,040
There are two differences.

201
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,160
First, it's the knotting technique.

202
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,520
The second victim was tied
by a standard knot.

203
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,720
You can see the bending
and the twisting.

204
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,560
But the first victim was tied

205
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,000
by an elaborate knot.

206
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,120
It was more pleasing too.

207
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,600
Two, the location of the body.

208
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,080
The second victim was found
in the wilderness

209
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,360
while the first victim was left

210
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,840
under the sun.

211
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,720
If the killer is trying
to make a statement,

212
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,000
then these are two different statements.

213
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,600
You're right.

214
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,360
But with what we have now,

215
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,360
we cannot jump to the conclusion.

216
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,640
Investigate further.

217
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,360
I'm sure this has something

218
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,320
to do with Thana's case
from three years ago.

219
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,960
And our priority now

220
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,200
is to locate Thana.

221
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,720
Understood?

222
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,600
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

223
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,440
Before we proceed,

224
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,680
I have one question for you, Vita.

225
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,160
Where was Sen yesterday?

226
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,560
Does he have an alibi?

227
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,000
Yes.

228
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,520
I'm his alibi.

229
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,560
We had a video call

230
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,000
and he was in his bedroom.

231
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,000
A video call from his bedroom?

232
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,280
Vita.

233
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,560
Why wasn't I apprised of this?

234
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,080
Didn't I tell you
to report to me every hour?

235
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,280
We had a small video call.

236
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,040
Sen asked me to pick out
some clothes for him.

237
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,880
He was...

238
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,640
Enough.

239
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,520
I don't need the details.

240
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,760
Let's proceed.

241
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,120
As I was saying,

242
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,480
Sen helped me to retrieve
the security footage.

243
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,080
Therefore, I answered his video call

244
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,640
to thank him.

245
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,640
After that,

246
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,720
Captain sent Sen home.

247
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,840
I was then with Captain

248
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,440
until 3 a.m.

249
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,960
Sending Sen home

250
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,960
so that you two could hang out
till three in the morning.

251
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,320
Captain!

252
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:16,960
Yes.

253
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,640
Sen's name has been cleared.

254
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,560
Guys.

255
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,320
These two cases
involved potassium cyanide.

256
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,240
Naturally, they remind people

257
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,120
of the case from three years ago.

258
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,200
Tell me what you have got on Thana.

259
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,800
Captain.

260
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,800
The analysis of the vial found

261
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,880
in Thana's home is out.

262
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,000
It is the poison

263
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,960
that killed the first victim,

264
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,080
Miss Lina.

265
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,600
Yes.

266
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,600
In the security footage I showed
Captain yesterday,

267
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,280
we found a suspect who left with Lina.

268
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,400
He was standing next to the white sedan.

269
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,160
His cap covered his face.

270
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,680
How can we identify him?

271
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,360
By comparing the height, weight,
and facial structure

272
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,600
of the first and second photos,

273
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,880
he is likely to be the missing Thana.

274
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,120
No.

275
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,360
The culprit of these two cases

276
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,800
cannot be Thana.

277
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,040
The murderer

278
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,600
is trying to mislead us.

279
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,040
What makes you think that way?

280
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,320
Did you find anything new, Ming?

281
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,320
No.

282
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,440
My hunch tells me

283
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,000
that Thana is dead.

284
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,800
Hunch?

285
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,840
You know very well

286
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,280
that we cannot operate on hunches.

287
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,080
You need a break, Ming.

288
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,360
You are alive?

289
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,000
Then why didn't you come to find me

290
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,720
in the past three years?

291
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,640
Ming.

292
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Are you all right?

293
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,560
I'm fine.

294
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,200
Maybe I drank too much yesterday.

295
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,600
Thank you.

296
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,680
I'm feeling better now.

297
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,680
Then...

298
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,320
I'll wait for you inside.

299
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,360
(P.I.T.)

300
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,560
So Vita?

301
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,440
Is Ming all right?

302
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,680
She's fine.

303
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,560
She said that she drank too much
last night.

304
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,240
Da told me.

305
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,480
He told me that Ming went to investigate
alone last night.

306
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,680
Hello?

307
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,360
(Officer Vita, it's time to work.)

308
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,560
(Please supervise me already.)

309
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,040
Sorry, Vita.

310
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,000
That is part of your duty.

311
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,360
Hi, Mr. Sen.

312
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,120
We had a meeting and we came

313
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,480
to the conclusion that you are innocent.

314
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,960
You are a free man now.

315
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,240
Officer Vita no longer needs
to check on you.

316
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,880
Congratulations.

317
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,000
It's over already?

318
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,240
(I still have many secrets waiting
for Vita to discover.)

319
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,320
(Pass the phone to her.)

320
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,120
You're on speaker now.

321
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,720
(Vita.)

322
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,000
(Although I'm no longer a suspect,)

323
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,880
(don't forget about our promises.)

324
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,800
((Calling)
Like the date.)

325
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,720
(I'll arrive at the police station now.)

326
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,560
(In two minutes.)

327
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,280
A date?

328
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,560
Mr. Sen, you can't come in.

329
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,400
Of course, I can.

330
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,560
No.

331
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,200
I tried to stop him.

332
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,880
He did.

333
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,320
You're off-duty now. Let's go.

334
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,360
Captain.

335
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,440
Chief wants to see you.

336
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,920
Noted.

337
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,880
After you.

338
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,000
Mr. Han, keep your eyes trained on him.

339
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,160
Yes, sir.

340
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,800
Ouch.

341
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,960
Vita, are you ready?

342
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,880
(Chief's Office)

343
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,600
(Hi, this is Lieutenant Wachaleepak.)

344
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,160
Sir.

345
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,320
Take a seat.

346
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,240
What's the progress on the poison cases?

347
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,320
Thana is our prime suspect.

348
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,760
We are still investigating.

349
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,160
Okay.

350
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,840
I might be too harsh on you late
but I ask

351
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,120
for your understanding.

352
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,320
I understand.

353
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,360
You have to face the press.

354
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,200
I brought you here today

355
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,880
to talk about Eig.

356
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,520
I want Ming and Han
to stand guard on shifts

357
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,960
until he wakes up.

358
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,520
As for you,

359
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,280
I want you to solve
the poison case first.

360
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,840
And then, you can continue your work
on Luger.

361
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,680
I hope you don't mind

362
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,320
this arrangement.

363
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,400
I don't.

364
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,600
If there's nothing else, I'll get back
to my work.

365
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,880
Will you tell me where I'm going now?

366
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,760
We, Vita.

367
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,200
Us.

368
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,640
We...

369
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,520
Where are we going?

370
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,240
It won't be a surprise

371
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,720
if I tell you now.

372
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,400
(Give me a status update
when you're there.)

373
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,600
(A status update? But Sen
is no longer a suspect.)

374
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,240
(I know. But I want to make sure
that we made the right judgment.)

375
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,920
(Send me your location so that I know
where you are.)

376
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,160
(Okay.)

377
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,800
(Antiques Museum)

378
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,200
Sen.

379
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,840
If I may ask,

380
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,840
why here?

381
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
I don't know.

382
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,800
You're always busy with your work

383
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,760
so I wanted

384
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,640
to bring you here for a change.

385
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,320
Surprised?

386
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,120
I am.

387
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,600
I'm glad to see your smile, Vita.

388
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,840
Vita?

389
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,080
Vita!

390
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,920
I'm glad to see your smile.

391
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,040
Why do you like this spot so much?

392
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,680
Because this is where we first met.

393
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,400
Captain?

394
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,640
Captain Pla.

395
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,360
Why are you here?

396
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,640
What brought you here?

397
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,200
I need to talk to you.

398
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,520
What's the matter, Captain?

399
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,800
Exactly,
what could possibly be this urgent?

400
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,600
You just want to ruin our second date.

401
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,080
Sen.

402
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,320
Calm down.

403
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,760
I'm sure it's an emergency.

404
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,440
He is not one to drive all the way here

405
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,760
to pull a prank

406
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,400
or to ruin someone's date.

407
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,840
Right?

408
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,680
Yes.

409
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,640
So...

410
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,760
Tell us then.

411
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,360
If you're not here
to ruin my date with Vita,

412
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,240
you'd better have a good excuse.

413
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,000
If you lie,

414
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,920
Naga will know.

415
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,280
It's about our work

416
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,840
so you have no right to know.

417
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,680
Sorry.

418
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,280
I have to go, sorry.

419
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,200
Yes, Ming?

420
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,520
I'll be right there.

421
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,720
Eig is awake.

422
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,000
We have to be at the hospital.

423
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,120
Okay.

424
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,760
Comfortable now?

425
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,320
Yes.

426
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,840
Feeling unwell?

427
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,440
No.

428
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,240
So?

429
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,760
How did your second date with Sen go?

430
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,760
It's weird.

431
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,680
My heart

432
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,760
was beating so fast.

433
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,400
Really?

434
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,520
Is that date that amazing?

435
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,040
What?

436
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,560
Nothing.

437
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,440
Rest a bit.

438
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,040
I've been there before.

439
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
Okay.

440
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,480
(Wasu, I...)
Can you check Google Maps?

441
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,160
If we take a shortcut,

442
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,760
we can arrive before Ming does.

443
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,840
Okay.

444
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,680
(Boonyavej Private Hospital)

445
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,400
Thanks.

446
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,760
Something's wrong with that doctor.

447
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,440
Excuse me.

448
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,960
Where did he go?

449
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,640
Something's afoot.

450
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,280
Let's meet up with Ming.

451
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,680
I can't reach her number.

452
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,760
Eig?

453
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,160
Eig?

454
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,480
Eig!

455
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,280
Eig!

456
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,280
He's dead.

457
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,720
Where were you?

458
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,000
You're supposed to look after Eig here.

459
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,040
A nurse told me to answer a call,

460
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,000
saying it was an emergency.

461
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,680
When

462
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,120
I was there, the caller hung up.

463
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,760
Police officers, please wait outside.

464
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,200
Are you a rookie, Ming?

465
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,760
Are you?

466
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,960
No matter what, you should know

467
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,800
that you cannot let Eig
out of your sight.

468
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,720
You know how important he is
to locating Luger.

469
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,520
What is this rookie's mistake?

470
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,240
I thought we had the lead now
so I could finally avenge Badin.

471
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,200
I guess it's just a pipe dream, Vita.

472
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,160
You did your best.

473
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,400
If we can find Eig,

474
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,960
we can find the second

475
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,080
or third Eig.

476
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,440
One day, Luger will be ours.

477
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,400
I don't know how long I can last.

478
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,080
Badin haunts me every night.

479
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,640
You have me.

480
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,680
Contact Ning.

481
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,800
Tell him to come to the hospital
to gather evidence.

482
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,680
Then, inform the regional police.

483
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,560
Check the security cameras.

484
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,800
Tell him to find the murderer
at all costs.

485
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,360
Noted.

486
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,720
All right.

487
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,640
Let's focus on the poison cases.

488
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,880
Let's visit the second victim's home.

489
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,080
Okay.

490
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,400
They don't look like lovers.

491
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,800
So they were here for business.

492
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,520
They had intercourse.

493
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,840
I don't think so.

494
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,520
The condom is still intact.

495
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,520
Bring it back for fingerprint analysis.

496
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,880
Who are you?

497
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,440
You just broke into someone's room.

498
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,560
Police officers?

499
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,440
Sorry, sir.

500
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,720
I am in charge of this place

501
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,640
and I didn't know
that you would be working here.

502
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
If there's nothing else,

503
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,560
I'll leave you be.

504
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,760
You came at a great time.

505
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,280
May I know

506
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,520
how close you are to the victim?

507
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,840
I hardly saw her.

508
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,720
Maybe just once per month.

509
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,600
So I'm not close to her at all.

510
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,280
Pink was... How do I put it?

511
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,800
I'll be honest with you then.

512
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,400
She was a party animal

513
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,760
and she came back late at night.

514
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,680
When she was back, she played
loud music and disturbed others.

515
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,200
More importantly,

516
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,160
she always came back with different men

517
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,080
and they were loud.

518
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,440
Did you see or hear

519
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,280
anything last night?

520
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,360
Last night?

521
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,840
What do you want, old man?

522
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,040
Lower your voice.

523
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,600
Think about your neighbors.

524
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,040
Listen.

525
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,400
We'll be done in an hour.
Just put up with it.

526
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,240
That's what she said.

527
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,640
You heard noises but you didn't

528
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,040
see the man's face.

529
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,640
Yes.

530
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,800
Can you come to the police station
to leave your statement?

531
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,000
You might have heard

532
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,440
the voice of the suspect.

533
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,120
Of course.

534
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,480
What a shame. She died

535
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,760
at such a young age.

536
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,480
I should get going then.

537
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,160
Wait.

538
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,040
Police officers.

539
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,880
Just by curiosity,

540
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,680
did you find anything inside?

541
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,760
We're still investigating.

542
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,400
I see.

543
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,240
Okay.

544
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,600
Good luck.

545
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:30,840
Captain.

546
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,480
Do you need help, Mr. Officer?

547
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,440
I have told you everything.

548
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,480
Have you?

549
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,520
What about

550
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,520
the hidden camera in her room

551
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,360
that you used to spy on her?

552
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,600
You!

553
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,120
Leave now.

554
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,840
What do you mean
I installed the hidden camera?

555
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,000
This is a false accusation!

556
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,160
Only someone who works here

557
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,200
can install that camera.

558
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,520
Isn't that right,

559
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
mister?

560
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,560
If I switch on this laptop,

561
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,840
I will be able to see the video feed
of her room,

562
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,760
delivered to you by this camera.

563
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,280
Let's talk,

564
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,080
peeping tom.

565
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,200
Come with us.

566
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,640
Captain.

567
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,360
Look.

568
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,600
It looks like mud.

569
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,000
Captain.

570
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,800
Over here.

571
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,400
Judging by the footprintBased on the shoe prints, it's deduced

572
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,120
that the suspect's shoe size is size 42.

573
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,760
It's similar to our suspect, Thana.

574
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,960
It wasn't rainy
during the night of the crime.

575
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,040
There shouldn't be any mud
on the asphalt.

576
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,440
It must

577
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,120
be from somewhere else.

578
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,560
Or perhaps the suspect's hideout.

579
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,240
If we analyze the mud,

580
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,240
we might be able to identify
the suspect's hideout.

581
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,760
I can see sand and laterite

582
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,120
in the mud.

583
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,720
This narrows down possible locations

584
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,520
and we can deduce the suspect's
itinerary that day.

585
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,280
We hit the jackpot.

586
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,720
In that case,

587
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,080
I'll bring the mud sample back
for analysis.

588
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,880
Thanks, Vita.

589
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,760
Let's go.

590
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,040
(Thana, murderer with serial murder cases)
What's the matter, Ming?

591
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,720
Why didn't you hold my hand?

592
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,560
What's holding you back?

593
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,040
Because my heart

594
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,360
will beat like crazy.

595
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,000
You're so cute.

596
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,880
(Sorry about the departure.)

597
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,960
(Just know that I will always love you.)

598
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,080
(We're visiting Thana's alma mater)

599
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,080
(for our investigation.)

600
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,680
(I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.)

601
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,120
(Chemistry Faculty)

602
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,680
He's a junior of mine.

603
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,760
I don't know a whole lot
about his private life

604
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,680
but I'm sure he isn't a killer.

605
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,120
He is friendly

606
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,520
and is a star football player
on the university team.

607
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,320
When he was said to be the prime suspect
in all those murders,

608
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,080
everyone was shocked, including me.

609
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,440
When did you last see him?

610
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,120
Uhm...

611
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,400
Before he went missing,

612
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,080
he bought some ingredients from me.

613
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,280
I sold them to him.

614
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,400
Thana worked in a pharmaceutical company

615
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,600
so this is common in our line of work.

616
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,600
You'll understand, won't you?

617
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,160
It never occurred to us that we should
ask why he needed those ingredients.

618
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,520
All right.

619
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,640
Since you are close to him,

620
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,160
has he ever manifested

621
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,480
murderous tendency?

622
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,960
Not that I know of.

623
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,120
No?

624
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,480
No.

625
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,960
So Thana made his own poison.

626
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,720
And he procured the ingredients
from Professor Chay.

627
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,240
Yes.

628
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,640
We have confiscated

629
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,680
the poison he made.

630
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,840
But Professor Chay does not know who
he was seeing before his disappearance.

631
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:42,960
Perhaps

632
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,440
like what the professor said,

633
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Thana isn't close to anyone.

634
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,280
So even his classmates

635
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,400
don't know much

636
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,080
about his personal life.

637
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,720
Let's go.

638
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,640
I'm hungry.

639
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,560
Let's eat in the cafeteria.

640
00:46:59,080 --> 00:46:59,880
Okay.

641
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,160
It's this way.

642
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,440
Turn left, go down,
and walk past Block 2.

643
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,440
You'll find it.

644
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,920
You've been here before?

645
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,040
No.

646
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,320
Never.

647
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,440
If I didn't know that you graduated
from a police academy,

648
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,560
I would have thought that you graduated
from here.

649
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,520
You even know
how to get the cafeteria coupon.

650
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,160
Come on.

651
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,800
Every cafeteria is like this.

652
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,440
Oh, Ming.

653
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,960
Thana and you were...

654
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:31,840
Wait.

655
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,560
Yes?

656
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:35,920
Hey.

657
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,480
(Ming, where are you?)

658
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,880
(I'm in the cafeteria
at Bangkok University.)

659
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,000
(I'm nearby.)

660
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,800
Let's eat together later.

661
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,640
Okay.

662
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,720
Hi, Ming.

663
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,840
Hi.

664
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,360
- This is...
- Oh.

665
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,240
It's my colleague,

666
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,360
Da.

667
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,520
Nice to meet you, Da.

668
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,960
Nice to meet you.

669
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:15,960
Wait.

670
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,520
What were your trying to ask just now?

671
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,600
Nothing.

672
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,080
That can wait.

673
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,320
You're

674
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,520
not coming back to the station with me?

675
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,440
I forgot to tell you.

676
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,000
I took a half-day leave.

677
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,560
Should we go now?

678
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,600
Yes.

679
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,720
After you.

680
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,040
We found many chemical components

681
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,760
from the mud sample.

682
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,800
The mud comes from this area.

683
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,320
It is an abandoned industrial zone
on the outskirt.

684
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,920
Several years ago, a chemical plant
exploded here

685
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,880
so a lot of workers moved out.

686
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,640
Only one retirement home left.

687
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,120
Thana must be

688
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,720
the serial killer.

689
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,040
He has been at large for three years.

690
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,240
Pursue this lead.

691
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:25,480
I want to apprehend the culprit
before the press conference.
