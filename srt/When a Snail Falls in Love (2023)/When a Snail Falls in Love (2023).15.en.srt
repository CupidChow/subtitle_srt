00:01:39,326 --> 00:01:41,366
(Police Investigators Team)

5
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,606
Have you brought Thana over, Ning?

6
00:01:54,686 --> 00:01:55,446
He's inside.

7
00:01:57,726 --> 00:01:58,366
Captain.

8
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,246
Thank you

9
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:01,926
for what happened yesterday.

10
00:02:30,326 --> 00:02:31,686
Tell me.

11
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:33,926
What do you mean

12
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:35,286
by the real culprit?

13
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:37,326
Three years ago,

14
00:02:37,846 --> 00:02:39,926
I was set up by the real killer.

15
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:42,326
He planted my hair at the crime scene

16
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:43,526
and threatened me.

17
00:02:43,606 --> 00:02:44,686
He forced me to turn myself in.

18
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:46,446
Have you seen the real culprit?

19
00:02:46,526 --> 00:02:47,366
No.

20
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:48,966
He gave me a call

21
00:02:49,206 --> 00:02:50,446
and asked me to turn myself in.

22
00:02:50,926 --> 00:02:53,606
Why didn't you turn yourself in
if you didn't commit the crime?

23
00:02:53,686 --> 00:02:55,766
I thought of turning myself in then.

24
00:02:57,726 --> 00:02:59,406
However, he asked me out.

25
00:03:00,326 --> 00:03:01,446
I'm here.

26
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:02,166
Where are you?

27
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:03,806
Have you brought the items I ordered?

28
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:05,566
Yes.

29
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:08,046
You must keep your promise

30
00:03:08,326 --> 00:03:10,086
and clear my suspicion.

31
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:11,166
Okay.

32
00:03:11,486 --> 00:03:13,006
Put down the items.

33
00:03:17,526 --> 00:03:18,246
Save me.

34
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:37,606
It sounded like

35
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,126
there are two culprits.

36
00:03:56,206 --> 00:03:57,846
Do you think
that the woman is beautiful?

37
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:02,006
She was beautiful.

38
00:04:02,086 --> 00:04:03,246
However, to me,

39
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:05,366
the most beautiful woman is Ming.

40
00:04:09,606 --> 00:04:10,926
He might be lying.

41
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:11,686
No.

42
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:14,366
He acts like a normal person.

43
00:04:22,606 --> 00:04:24,566
He was imprisoned for three years,

44
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:26,126
forced to be a scapegoat.

45
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,286
That's unbelievable.

46
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,806
It's possible.

47
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,006
There's a lot

48
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:34,846
of strange things in this world.

49
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:36,646
For instance, me.

50
00:04:37,446 --> 00:04:38,526
As a police officer,

51
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,446
who would know

52
00:04:42,086 --> 00:04:43,166
that one day, my lover

53
00:04:43,686 --> 00:04:46,126
would be a murder suspect?

54
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:57,766
However, the culprit threatened me
that if I refuse to be his scapegoat,

55
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,166
he'd kill Ming.

56
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,046
I had no choice.

57
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:10,366
Captain.

58
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:18,366
I'll leave this to you, Vita.

59
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:27,726
Captain.

60
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:29,526
We found the third victim.

61
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:39,206
(Royal Thai Police)

62
00:05:39,286 --> 00:05:41,246
The female corpse
that was found this morning

63
00:05:41,326 --> 00:05:44,086
is the third victim
of the serial murder case, right?

64
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:46,566
The police is doing our best
to investigate the case now.

65
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:49,646
In fact,
this should be the sixth victim.

66
00:05:49,686 --> 00:05:51,486
In addition to
the three victims three years ago.

67
00:05:51,846 --> 00:05:56,486
There's still no evidence that the crime
is committed by the same culprit.

68
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:58,006
Please confirmed this then.

69
00:05:58,046 --> 00:06:02,406
It's rumoured that the police
managed to arrest the suspect, Thana.

70
00:06:02,726 --> 00:06:05,926
However, during Thana's
detainment, another victim was killed.

71
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,246
Does this mean that the police
has arrested a scapegoat?

72
00:06:09,806 --> 00:06:12,086
We're still investigating the case.

73
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,086
When can you arrest the real culprit?

74
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:15,966
Does the police have any leads now?

75
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,966
Our Police Investigators Team
are investigating the case.

76
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:20,766
We'll surely bring
the real culprit to justice.

77
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:22,486
That's all for today.

78
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:23,286
Thank you.

79
00:06:24,286 --> 00:06:27,046
(Royal Thai Police)

80
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:28,326
(Thai police arrests the wrong culprit,
a third victim appears, serial killer at large)

81
00:06:28,406 --> 00:06:30,926
Everyone is panicking
and blaming the police.

82
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:31,926
Are you aware of this?

83
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:33,526
Yes.

84
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:35,206
I'm informed

85
00:06:36,326 --> 00:06:39,246
that you were in a fight
with Luger's men yesterday.

86
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:40,646
I told you.

87
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:42,406
Solve this case first.

88
00:06:43,926 --> 00:06:45,166
How did you know?

89
00:06:46,686 --> 00:06:48,406
Do you think
that you can keep this from me?

90
00:06:51,246 --> 00:06:53,086
It's all my fault.

91
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:55,886
Release Thana.

92
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,046
We need to reduce
the public opinion pressure.

93
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:03,166
In two days,

94
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:06,046
find me the real culprit.

95
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:07,366
Noted.

96
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,326
Does he look similar to the culprit?

97
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:23,246
Yes.

98
00:07:24,326 --> 00:07:25,686
According to his figure and behaviour,

99
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,526
he must be the real culprit.

100
00:07:27,806 --> 00:07:31,366
Did the culprit say anything
about your imprisonment?

101
00:07:31,646 --> 00:07:33,646
He wanted me to be his scapegoat.

102
00:07:33,726 --> 00:07:36,046
One day, if he has reached a dead end,

103
00:07:36,326 --> 00:07:37,686
he'd kill me

104
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,966
to make it seem like I committed
suicide to escape punishment.

105
00:07:41,646 --> 00:07:43,126
How do you prove

106
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:46,006
that you're not lying?

107
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:47,686
When you barged into the room,

108
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:49,566
you saw me being tied up.

109
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:51,926
That woman said

110
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:53,686
that the one who captured her isn't me.

111
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:55,886
You might be feigning this up.

112
00:07:55,966 --> 00:07:58,006
Perhaps you changed your voice.
Then, you took your own photo

113
00:07:58,086 --> 00:07:59,366
and sent it to Ming.

114
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:01,126
How do you explain it then?

115
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:05,886
It's the works of the real culprit.

116
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:07,846
He knew that Ming is my ex-girlfriend.

117
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:10,526
He wanted
to lure her there and kill her.

118
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:14,126
But when we were there,

119
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,446
we didn't see anyone else.

120
00:08:19,246 --> 00:08:21,046
Maybe he saw you

121
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,206
and escaped in advance.

122
00:08:25,206 --> 00:08:26,086
I can't take this anymore.

123
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,126
I need to rest.

124
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:30,686
In the past three years,

125
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,366
he's been feeding me tranquilisers.

126
00:08:35,206 --> 00:08:37,726
Please stop asking me
the same questions again and again.

127
00:08:41,246 --> 00:08:41,886
Okay.

128
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:44,046
I can let you rest.

129
00:08:44,606 --> 00:08:47,686
However, there'll be doctor
and nurses to look after you.

130
00:08:48,286 --> 00:08:49,166
Also, remember

131
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:54,406
that we still need
to talk about this regardless.

132
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:24,406
Do you want to meet him?

133
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:31,206
Never mind.

134
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:33,606
It's over now.

135
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,646
(Sen's message)
(Let's meet here, Vita.)

136
00:10:23,686 --> 00:10:25,806
(I'll share the location with you.)

137
00:10:26,486 --> 00:10:28,886
(I don't have time
for your nonsense today.)

138
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:35,366
(If you don't come,
I'll go to the police station.)

139
00:11:11,446 --> 00:11:12,846
Vita.

140
00:11:13,726 --> 00:11:16,246
I'm here, my darling.

141
00:11:30,046 --> 00:11:31,126
Shush.

142
00:11:33,846 --> 00:11:34,406
Sen.

143
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:36,006
Hey!

144
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:55,846
Butler.

145
00:12:09,366 --> 00:12:10,126
Miss Vita.

146
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:12,326
This is my inner thoughts.

147
00:12:14,086 --> 00:12:16,046
(I need to be honest with you.)

148
00:12:18,206 --> 00:12:22,126
(You're the most special woman.)

149
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:27,526
(You changed my world and myself.)

150
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:28,846
You reshaped me.

151
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:32,326
You reshaped me.

152
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:33,646
(Lastly, I want to say)

153
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,566
(I want to say)

154
00:12:42,806 --> 00:12:43,646
Pla...

155
00:12:44,846 --> 00:12:46,046
Pla loves Vita.

156
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,406
(Pla loves Vita)

157
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:48,526
Pla?

158
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:53,486
(Pla loves Vita)

159
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:56,806
Thank you so much.

160
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:58,766
(Pla loves Vita)
For amending the spelling error.

161
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,406
(Please edit it to the name I sent you.)

162
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:03,766
Okay, Mr. Pla.

163
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:09,886
(Delete Sen loves Vita.
Change it to Pla loves Vita.)

164
00:13:10,326 --> 00:13:11,806
I've revised it, Mr. Pla.

165
00:13:11,846 --> 00:13:13,526
(Thank you.)

166
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,286
Three times.

167
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:19,366
I have three dates with Vita
and you appeared three times.

168
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:22,366
Am I dating Vita or you, Pla?

169
00:13:26,846 --> 00:13:27,806
Do you want to marry me then?

170
00:13:29,446 --> 00:13:30,286
Calm down.

171
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:35,166
Are you pursuing me?

172
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:39,606
Isn't that obvious enough, Vita?

173
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:44,806
There's no need to.

174
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:48,966
I like you too.

175
00:14:02,846 --> 00:14:03,646
Vita.

176
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:08,966
Love is so lovely, isn't it?

177
00:14:12,806 --> 00:14:14,766
Even if I can't stay by your side,

178
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:17,446
I'm happy as long as you're happy.

179
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:18,566
Captain.

180
00:14:19,006 --> 00:14:20,526
I can only borrow
the boat to you for one day.

181
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,886
You need to return it to me.

182
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:24,686
Thanks.

183
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:32,646
Don't worry about Sen.

184
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,646
One day,

185
00:14:35,646 --> 00:14:37,126
he'll meet his Miss Right.

186
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:39,166
As for us,

187
00:14:42,326 --> 00:14:44,166
I won't disappoint you.

188
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,166
I'll make you happy every day.

189
00:14:49,406 --> 00:14:50,086
Okay?

190
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,086
People are watching us.

191
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,606
There are boats passing by too.

192
00:15:37,006 --> 00:15:38,166
There are people watching us.

Okay.

213
00:17:13,526 --> 00:17:14,926
You can go in first.

214
00:17:15,406 --> 00:17:16,046
Okay.

215
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:45,966
Everyone's here, right?

216
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:47,366
Please start with the reporting.

217
00:17:47,486 --> 00:17:48,126
Okay.

218
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:49,366
Mr. Han and I

219
00:17:49,846 --> 00:17:52,286
have sent Thana to the hospital.

220
00:17:52,846 --> 00:17:54,886
Did you find any substance in his body?

221
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:58,486
The dosage of tranquiliser that's enough
to knock him out is detected.

222
00:17:59,006 --> 00:17:59,686
Captain.

223
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:02,206
Do we really have to release Thana?

224
00:18:02,286 --> 00:18:02,926
That's right.

225
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:04,926
We have to release him today.

226
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:06,766
The Chief has stressed

227
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:10,886
that detaining Thana will only confirm
that the police got the wrong man.

228
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:11,766
Ning.

229
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:12,526
Yes.

230
00:18:12,886 --> 00:18:13,966
Report the third victim's conditions.

231
00:18:14,646 --> 00:18:15,486
Okay, Captain.

232
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:16,326
Here you go.

233
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:20,206
The victim's name is Jiang.
She's 24 years old.

234
00:18:20,286 --> 00:18:22,686
Same as the previous victims,
she died of cyanide poisoning.

235
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:24,406
The only difference is her occupation.

236
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:26,326
She works as
the cleaner of a nursing home.

237
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:27,686
Nursing home.

238
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:29,886
I have something to say.

239
00:18:39,806 --> 00:18:40,926
Look over here.

240
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:45,646
According to my previous speculations,

241
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:49,566
the first and second victims
were killed by different culprits.

242
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:51,326
Now, I have the evidence.

243
00:18:51,406 --> 00:18:53,286
Jiang and Lina

244
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,406
have similar situation,

245
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:56,926
including the locations
where we found their bodies

246
00:18:56,966 --> 00:18:58,126
and the knotting method.

247
00:18:58,366 --> 00:19:00,006
As for the second victim,

248
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,766
which is Pink,

249
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:03,526
she brought the culprit back home.

250
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,246
Her body was found in a remote location.

251
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:08,246
The first and third victim

252
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:10,086
were found in the wilds.

253
00:19:10,406 --> 00:19:12,566
There's no evidence showing
that they brought the culprit home.

254
00:19:12,806 --> 00:19:14,086
This tells us...

255
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,366
The culprit wants to be seen.

256
00:19:16,686 --> 00:19:17,526
You're right.

257
00:19:17,726 --> 00:19:18,966
Back to the knotting method,

258
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:21,486
theoretically, by definition,

259
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:23,126
have an important trait.

260
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:26,926
Most serial killers
are compulsive in some way.

261
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:32,446
The position and the way
the tie knots are the same,

262
00:19:32,886 --> 00:19:35,566
Their ways of killing
their victims are similar too.

263
00:19:36,086 --> 00:19:37,566
As such,

264
00:19:37,606 --> 00:19:41,526
it's highly likely that we have
two suspects working alternately.

265
00:19:42,046 --> 00:19:43,006
Is that possible?

266
00:19:43,086 --> 00:19:46,566
During the second murder,

267
00:19:46,926 --> 00:19:51,286
the culprit might not have enough time,
so he didn't do the special knot.

268
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:52,366
I don't think so.

269
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:53,966
Captain.

270
00:19:54,246 --> 00:19:56,326
I want to go to the nursing home.

271
00:19:56,686 --> 00:19:58,126
Please share the location with me.

272
00:19:59,286 --> 00:20:00,006
Okay.

273
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,886
I'll send it to you later.

274
00:20:02,086 --> 00:20:02,686
Okay.

275
00:20:03,366 --> 00:20:04,366
Vita.

276
00:20:05,046 --> 00:20:06,086
I'll go with you.

277
00:20:09,406 --> 00:20:10,326
Sorry to disturb.

278
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:13,526
Someone is looking for
Ming from the Police Investigators Team.

279
00:20:14,406 --> 00:20:15,166
Who is it?

280
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:16,286
What is the person's name?

281
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:17,966
He said that he's Chayan.

282
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:19,926
Chayan.

283
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:25,446
Who's Chayan?

284
00:20:27,446 --> 00:20:29,166
He's my friend.

285
00:20:29,246 --> 00:20:29,806
But

286
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:31,526
I've asked him to wait outside.

287
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:33,526
You can go home first.

288
00:20:34,286 --> 00:20:37,366
Please meet non-work related
people outside the police station.

289
00:20:38,006 --> 00:20:38,846
Do you understand?

290
00:20:41,926 --> 00:20:42,766
Yes.

291
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:54,366
Captain.

292
00:20:54,606 --> 00:20:55,526
Officer.

293
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:56,246
Yes.

294
00:20:56,246 --> 00:20:59,806
This is the latest poisoning case files
from the local police station.

295
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:01,766
I was just going to call to ask for it.

296
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:02,526
Thank you.

297
00:21:02,606 --> 00:21:03,286
Okay.

298
00:21:05,846 --> 00:21:07,366
Here you go, Captain.

299
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:10,766
Let's talk in my office.

300
00:21:12,126 --> 00:21:12,766
Sure.

301
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:14,126
This way please.

302
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:18,686
I'm sorry.

303
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:21,566
Did I come at the wrong time?

304
00:21:22,086 --> 00:21:23,086
It's okay.

305
00:21:23,126 --> 00:21:24,886
I'm the one who called you over.

306
00:21:27,046 --> 00:21:29,286
I was worried about you,
after what happened yesterday.

307
00:21:31,846 --> 00:21:33,446
I need to apologise.

308
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:36,446
I invited you over, but now
I need to investigate on the case.

309
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:38,806
No worries.

310
00:21:38,886 --> 00:21:39,646
I totally understand.

311
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,766
Where are you going?

312
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:46,806
Well, we're actually
going to the nursing home

313
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,566
that you're sponsoring.

314
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:53,726
Is there anything?

315
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:59,126
Is there a worker named Jiang,
who's 24 years old?

316
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:00,286
Yes.

317
00:22:00,326 --> 00:22:03,966
Her body was found
in the wilds yesterday.

318
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:07,646
Let's get going now.

319
00:22:13,926 --> 00:22:16,446
You didn't find
any fingerprints and evidence, right?

320
00:22:16,486 --> 00:22:17,086
Yes.

321
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,366
Similar to the previous victims,

322
00:22:18,646 --> 00:22:20,566
the culprit was careful,
as he must have been wearing gloves.

323
00:22:21,366 --> 00:22:25,326
Besides, it's in the wilds,
hence it's hard to analyse the DNA.

324
00:22:25,406 --> 00:22:27,366
It's the location
where the body was dumped,

325
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,406
but it's not the crime scene.

326
00:22:29,486 --> 00:22:31,606
The culprit parked his car
outside the restricted area

327
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:33,726
due to road maintenance.

328
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,326
The culprit dragged
and dumped the victim there.

329
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:38,486
The distance is
about 100 metres, Captain.

330
00:22:42,686 --> 00:22:43,886
28cm.

331
00:22:46,886 --> 00:22:49,046
Thana's shoe size is size 42.

332
00:22:49,926 --> 00:22:51,926
Is Vita right about this,

333
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:55,686
that there are
two culprits in this case?

334
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,526
I'm sorry, Chayan.

335
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,886
The police cars are all out for duty.

336
00:23:03,206 --> 00:23:04,726
Thus, I have to trouble you.

337
00:23:06,766 --> 00:23:07,766
It's all right.

338
00:23:08,046 --> 00:23:09,526
It's my pleasure to help.

339
00:23:10,206 --> 00:23:14,246
I'm actually planning to go there too.

340
00:23:16,046 --> 00:23:17,686
Yet I didn't expect this incident.

341
00:23:21,006 --> 00:23:22,166
Do you know the victim?

342
00:23:22,846 --> 00:23:24,686
I saw her,

343
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:27,166
but I never talked to her.

344
00:23:30,246 --> 00:23:33,526
Are you going for volunteer work today?

345
00:23:33,606 --> 00:23:36,486
I thought you always go on Fridays.

346
00:23:36,686 --> 00:23:37,966
Recently,

347
00:23:38,206 --> 00:23:39,926
a lot of senior citizens
are moving into the home.

348
00:23:39,966 --> 00:23:41,326
They need help to move their things.

349
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,526
So, I'm going to help them.

350
00:23:44,686 --> 00:23:45,526
Vita.

351
00:23:45,806 --> 00:23:48,886
Do you know?
The senior residents of the nursing home

352
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:52,606
are dumped by their families.

353
00:23:53,126 --> 00:23:54,326
Chayan

354
00:23:54,606 --> 00:23:56,806
gathers them there

355
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:58,326
and looks after them.

356
00:23:58,526 --> 00:23:59,446
He cares about them.

357
00:23:59,526 --> 00:24:01,286
He even encourages them.

358
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,846
It's really heartwarming.

359
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:06,886
This reminds me of my grandmother.

360
00:24:11,646 --> 00:24:12,686
Thank you.

361
00:24:27,606 --> 00:24:28,486
Hold on.

362
00:24:28,606 --> 00:24:29,246
What's wrong?

363
00:24:45,086 --> 00:24:48,126
I like how Mr. Chayan
ties your shoelace.

364
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:50,726
Can you teach me how to tie it later?

365
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:53,526
My grandmother
taught me that when I was little.

366
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:55,486
It's just a normal knot.

367
00:24:57,526 --> 00:24:59,166
It's my first

368
00:24:59,246 --> 00:25:00,806
seeing such a beautiful knot.

369
00:25:04,606 --> 00:25:05,606
Do you want to tie it
on your other shoe?

370
00:25:05,926 --> 00:25:06,566
Sure.

371
00:25:06,726 --> 00:25:07,486
To have the same knot on both shoes.

372
00:25:07,886 --> 00:25:09,366
Come on, let's have a seat there.

373
00:25:13,726 --> 00:25:14,446
Hello.

374
00:25:14,486 --> 00:25:15,126
Vita.

375
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:17,166
The culprit is a size 44.

376
00:25:17,526 --> 00:25:18,806
Size 44.

377
00:25:18,886 --> 00:25:19,526
What's the matter?

378
00:25:22,686 --> 00:25:24,966
I'm at the nursing home now.

379
00:25:25,286 --> 00:25:26,806
If there's anything, contact me.

380
00:25:27,246 --> 00:25:27,846
Okay.

381
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:30,646
Now it looks the same.

382
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:35,966
Are the home having
new residents regularly?

383
00:25:36,046 --> 00:25:36,726
Yes.

384
00:25:36,806 --> 00:25:41,366
Our nursing home has
the best facilities in the city.

385
00:25:41,486 --> 00:25:44,646
When the senior citizens are left alone,

386
00:25:44,726 --> 00:25:46,686
they want to move in to our home.

387
00:25:46,766 --> 00:25:48,766
Whenever there's a spot,

388
00:25:48,846 --> 00:25:52,566
the senior citizens in the queue
would move in right away.

389
00:25:53,046 --> 00:25:53,806
Well.

390
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:59,966
Can you share with me the entry log
and death list of the residents?

391
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:02,126
Death list?

392
00:26:02,206 --> 00:26:02,966
That's right.

393
00:26:06,646 --> 00:26:07,366
Okay.

394
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:08,446
I'll pass the list to you later.

395
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:09,486
Thanks.

396
00:26:10,086 --> 00:26:12,446
(Dalan Nursing Home Resident Name List)

397
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:30,126
Hello, Wasu.

398
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:32,926
(Come to Mu Dessert House later.
She has made desserts for you.)

399
00:26:33,086 --> 00:26:33,886
(That's all.)

400
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:44,806
Captain.

401
00:26:45,366 --> 00:26:48,086
Let's meet at Mu Dessert House later.

402
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:48,886
Okay.

403
00:26:48,966 --> 00:26:52,126
(Mu Dessert House)

404
00:26:53,886 --> 00:26:54,686
Mu.

405
00:26:55,126 --> 00:26:55,886
What's the matter?

406
00:26:59,006 --> 00:27:00,726
In your last birthday,

407
00:27:01,646 --> 00:27:03,846
I haven't given you a birthday gift.

408
00:27:05,286 --> 00:27:06,166
So,

409
00:27:06,486 --> 00:27:07,926
this is a belated birthday gift.

410
00:27:09,846 --> 00:27:10,646
Here you go.

411
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:12,206
Thank you.

412
00:27:12,286 --> 00:27:12,966
You're welcome.

413
00:27:16,086 --> 00:27:18,446
Are you telling me
to use the gent's perfume?

414
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:21,446
That's not what I mean.

415
00:27:21,526 --> 00:27:24,086
This is a couple perfume.

416
00:27:24,566 --> 00:27:25,806
Oh.

417
00:27:27,686 --> 00:27:28,726
Let me do it.

418
00:27:37,086 --> 00:27:39,926
I can use it with this bottle, right?

419
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:44,046
That's right.

420
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,126
Thank you.

421
00:27:47,206 --> 00:27:47,966
It's okay.

422
00:27:50,846 --> 00:27:51,926
Do you like it?

423
00:27:53,246 --> 00:27:54,126
Yes.

424
00:27:59,726 --> 00:28:00,886
Wasu.

425
00:28:00,926 --> 00:28:04,326
Serve the mango sticky rice
to Vita and Captain later.

426
00:28:05,006 --> 00:28:05,646
Okay.

427
00:28:06,126 --> 00:28:06,926
Well.

428
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:10,966
I'll keep it for you.

429
00:28:13,606 --> 00:28:14,246
Let's go inside.

430
00:28:14,286 --> 00:28:14,926
Okay.

431
00:28:18,366 --> 00:28:19,806
I've checked on it.

432
00:28:19,886 --> 00:28:22,646
After Chayan started
to manage the nursing home,

433
00:28:22,726 --> 00:28:25,886
the death rate
has doubled these three years.

434
00:28:25,966 --> 00:28:31,366
I compared the death rate of
the nursing home with the others.

435
00:28:31,446 --> 00:28:32,326
I found out

436
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:34,526
that after Chayan started working there,

437
00:28:35,686 --> 00:28:38,086
the death rate of
the nursing home increased by 80%.

438
00:28:39,206 --> 00:28:40,686
Okay, have a seat.

439
00:28:44,966 --> 00:28:46,806
Are you saying
that someone is drugging them?

440
00:28:47,366 --> 00:28:48,486
That is possible.

441
00:28:48,886 --> 00:28:52,366
All the bodies were cremated,
so we couldn't prove it.

442
00:28:55,806 --> 00:28:56,766
Bodies?

443
00:28:57,206 --> 00:28:59,166
Death rate?

444
00:29:00,126 --> 00:29:01,006
Hey.

445
00:29:01,286 --> 00:29:04,966
Did you send Vita on
a dangerous mission again?

446
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:06,726
Wasu.

447
00:29:06,766 --> 00:29:07,806
Stop the nonsense.

448
00:29:08,326 --> 00:29:10,086
We're discussing about a case.

449
00:29:10,526 --> 00:29:11,126
He's right.

450
00:29:11,966 --> 00:29:13,406
Don't worry.

451
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:16,966
I won't put my girlfriend in danger.

452
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:19,326
You better don't.

453
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:24,606
Wait a minute.

454
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:27,606
Girlfriend?

455
00:29:29,486 --> 00:29:30,206
You brat.

456
00:29:30,286 --> 00:29:30,966
Wasu.

457
00:29:31,046 --> 00:29:31,646
That's right.

458
00:29:32,006 --> 00:29:32,806
We're in a relationship.

459
00:29:33,406 --> 00:29:36,246
We're a couple now, so we can
stay this close to each other.

460
00:29:36,286 --> 00:29:36,966
Yes.

461
00:29:37,406 --> 00:29:39,206
Do you want to sit on my lap?

462
00:29:41,886 --> 00:29:42,566
Vita.

463
00:29:45,206 --> 00:29:46,806
When do you start dating him?

464
00:29:47,326 --> 00:29:49,766
Why didn't I know?

465
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:52,686
Two days ago.

466
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:55,126
Wasu.

467
00:29:56,206 --> 00:29:57,326
Help me serve the desserts.

468
00:29:58,086 --> 00:29:58,766
Okay.

469
00:30:00,206 --> 00:30:01,246
I'll do it.

470
00:30:05,926 --> 00:30:08,606
I knew it the moment
they stepped into the shop.

471
00:30:10,126 --> 00:30:12,446
Are you keeping this from me too?

472
00:30:13,366 --> 00:30:16,526
I didn't expect you to be this slow.

473
00:30:19,566 --> 00:30:23,286
Back then, when Captain Pla
and Vita came to our shop,

474
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:24,606
they sat far away from each other.

475
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:28,886
However, today,

476
00:30:29,446 --> 00:30:31,126
Vita, Captain Pla...

477
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:32,006
- What?
- What?

478
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:33,326
They're sitting close to each other.

479
00:30:42,846 --> 00:30:43,806
All right, fine.

480
00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:45,446
It's okay.

481
00:30:46,446 --> 00:30:47,486
You can date each other.

482
00:30:47,566 --> 00:30:48,206
However,

483
00:30:48,286 --> 00:30:50,286
please keep your distance.

484
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:52,926
One step at a time.

485
00:30:52,966 --> 00:30:54,086
The first requirement

486
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:56,446
is to know each other's parents.

487
00:30:56,486 --> 00:30:57,446
Do you understand?

488
00:30:57,526 --> 00:30:59,686
I've never seen Captain's family.

489
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:03,486
But I know that he's the third child

490
00:31:04,126 --> 00:31:05,846
and his mother is not around,

491
00:31:05,886 --> 00:31:07,406
as she's overseas.

492
00:31:07,486 --> 00:31:08,766
If that so,

493
00:31:09,966 --> 00:31:12,726
we need to meet his parents.

494
00:31:13,966 --> 00:31:15,366
What about my parents?

495
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:19,606
That is me!

496
00:31:21,366 --> 00:31:22,366
Wasu.

497
00:31:22,766 --> 00:31:24,166
Please help me out in the kitchen.

498
00:31:27,326 --> 00:31:28,366
Okay, I'm coming.

499
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:35,006
Vita.

500
00:31:36,366 --> 00:31:37,206
Did you see it?

501
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:38,246
This is called inseparable like shadows.

502
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:44,806
Well.

503
00:31:45,846 --> 00:31:47,806
Let's talk about the case.

504
00:31:48,766 --> 00:31:49,406
Okay.

505
00:31:49,926 --> 00:31:51,766
I heard from Ming

506
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:55,606
that Chayan started volunteering at
the nursing home three years ago.

507
00:31:55,686 --> 00:31:59,086
The death rate has increased since then.

508
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:01,046
He's a size 44 too.

509
00:32:01,126 --> 00:32:02,086
Most importantly,

510
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:04,766
I saw how he tied Ming's shoelaces.

511
00:32:04,846 --> 00:32:08,166
It's the same knotting method as
we found on the first and third victims.

512
00:32:08,246 --> 00:32:10,566
This knotting method
needs to be learned.

513
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,086
Based on the evidence,

514
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:16,366
Chayan must be the culprit who killed
Lina and the nursing home worker.

515
00:32:17,606 --> 00:32:19,046
If that so,

516
00:32:19,086 --> 00:32:20,926
your hypothesis is right.

517
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:25,526
I thought that there are
more than one culprit too.

518
00:32:26,326 --> 00:32:27,926
There are two culprits.

519
00:32:29,086 --> 00:32:33,246
Although Thana is in the police
station when the cleaner was killed,

520
00:32:33,846 --> 00:32:35,806
when Pink was murdered,

521
00:32:36,086 --> 00:32:38,246
he didn't have an alibi.

522
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:40,326
This means

523
00:32:40,646 --> 00:32:43,606
that Chayan and Thana
committed the crime alternately.

524
00:32:46,726 --> 00:32:48,046
I think

525
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:53,326
that we need
to return to the nursing home.

526
00:33:02,286 --> 00:33:05,406
(Do as I say, otherwise
you know what I'd do.)

527
00:33:14,966 --> 00:33:15,886
Thank you.

528
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:49,086
You betrayed my trust

529
00:33:49,406 --> 00:33:50,766
because of a woman.

530
00:33:52,646 --> 00:33:53,566
I didn't betray you.

531
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:55,326
Why didn't you kidnap her then?

532
00:33:57,526 --> 00:33:59,046
The police is suspecting us now.

533
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:00,766
I'm waiting for the right timing.

534
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:09,366
If I tell Ming

535
00:34:09,446 --> 00:34:13,126
that your encounter is staged

536
00:34:14,526 --> 00:34:17,006
and the nursing home you brought her to

537
00:34:17,366 --> 00:34:20,526
is the place where we kill for joy.

538
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:23,646
That you get close
to her so as to kill her,

539
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:25,486
do you think
that she'd want to see you again?

540
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:34,646
Are you going
to kill me to keep your secret?

541
00:34:38,686 --> 00:34:39,446
Come on then.

542
00:34:40,086 --> 00:34:40,846
I dare you.

543
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:43,286
You just need 15 seconds.

544
00:34:43,966 --> 00:34:46,526
I won't be able
to tell the truth anymore then.

545
00:34:46,846 --> 00:34:48,846
Ming wouldn't know

546
00:34:48,926 --> 00:34:52,406
that we killed those women together.

547
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:56,046
Come on.

548
00:34:58,726 --> 00:34:59,446
I dare you.

549
00:35:02,926 --> 00:35:03,686
Screw it.

550
00:35:14,526 --> 00:35:15,086
Hey.

551
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:23,366
What did I tell you?

552
00:35:24,486 --> 00:35:26,486
Don't ever hesitate.

553
00:35:27,086 --> 00:35:28,126
If you hesitate,

554
00:35:28,486 --> 00:35:30,326
you'll die.

555
00:35:35,006 --> 00:35:36,886
Since you didn't act according to plan,

556
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:39,766
I'll do it on your behalf.

557
00:35:41,486 --> 00:35:42,646
Since the both of us

558
00:35:43,566 --> 00:35:45,846
are partners for life.

559
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:54,446
Do you know the man in the photo?

560
00:35:54,526 --> 00:35:56,366
He's Mr. Chayan's friend.

561
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:59,446
He sent the bodies for cremation.

562
00:36:02,526 --> 00:36:03,326
Thank you.

563
00:36:04,446 --> 00:36:06,526
That answered my question.

564
00:36:07,046 --> 00:36:11,326
Why did Thana hold back his
killing desire for these three years?

565
00:36:11,406 --> 00:36:15,686
They used these senior citizens
to fulfill their desire to kill.

566
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:20,046
Ming.

567
00:36:30,486 --> 00:36:32,086
Is Ming in danger then?

568
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:36,606
Hello, Ning.

569
00:36:37,046 --> 00:36:37,726
I have an emergency.

570
00:36:38,286 --> 00:36:40,006
Find out Chayan's address

571
00:36:40,046 --> 00:36:41,366
and contact Ming.

572
00:36:41,406 --> 00:36:42,846
Inform me at once if you have any news.

573
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:52,966
I'm acting

574
00:36:53,806 --> 00:36:55,046
like a stalker.

575
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:58,886
I can just tell her
that I'm worried about her.

576
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:19,926
Vita.

577
00:37:35,046 --> 00:37:36,046
Chayan.

578
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:45,926
Who are you?

579
00:37:50,246 --> 00:37:51,246
Thana.

580
00:37:54,326 --> 00:37:56,806
Why do you have Chayan's phone?

581
00:37:56,886 --> 00:37:58,046
What did you do to him?

582
00:37:58,606 --> 00:38:00,046
You're so cruel, Ming.

583
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:01,486
It's hard for me to escape.

584
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:03,966
Yet you didn't visit me at all.

585
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:05,806
Let bygones be bygones.

586
00:38:06,406 --> 00:38:07,926
I know that you're not the culprit.

587
00:38:08,006 --> 00:38:09,366
You're still alive.

588
00:38:09,406 --> 00:38:10,526
I'm happy for you.

589
00:38:10,606 --> 00:38:13,486
But we both need
to start anew, don't we?

590
00:38:14,286 --> 00:38:16,086
Is this the start you're talking about?

591
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:19,326
Chayan.

592
00:38:21,046 --> 00:38:22,166
What have you done to him?

593
00:38:32,846 --> 00:38:33,726
Chayan.

594
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:35,366
Chayan.

595
00:38:37,926 --> 00:38:41,046
(Captain Pla)

596
00:38:42,126 --> 00:38:42,806
Chayan.

597
00:38:45,726 --> 00:38:47,086
Wake up, Chayan.

598
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:48,726
Chayan.

599
00:38:49,966 --> 00:38:50,806
Chayan.

600
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,126
You're the culprit, right?

601
00:38:57,486 --> 00:38:58,726
What do you think then?

602
00:39:03,886 --> 00:39:04,606
Leave.

603
00:39:05,526 --> 00:39:06,406
Let go of Chayan.

604
00:39:06,726 --> 00:39:08,646
This has nothing to do
with him. It's between us.

605
00:39:08,726 --> 00:39:10,206
Between us?

606
00:39:10,686 --> 00:39:12,966
It should be between the three of us.

607
00:39:14,726 --> 00:39:16,686
When the third victim was killed,

608
00:39:16,966 --> 00:39:18,446
I was detained in the police station.

609
00:39:18,526 --> 00:39:19,526
Think about it.

610
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:21,086
Who would be the killer?

611
00:39:30,486 --> 00:39:31,286
When I was little,

612
00:39:31,326 --> 00:39:33,166
I always knew that I was different.

613
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:34,406
Well.

614
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:39,566
I enjoyed seeing the animals
being poisoned to death.

615
00:39:40,486 --> 00:39:41,966
My parents also said

616
00:39:43,126 --> 00:39:45,126
that I liked to do abnormal things.

617
00:39:45,526 --> 00:39:46,926
Until I met Chayan.

618
00:39:48,046 --> 00:39:49,366
He's the son of my dad's friend.

619
00:40:16,726 --> 00:40:17,966
Do you want to have a try?

620
00:40:19,406 --> 00:40:20,766
You discovered my little secret.

621
00:40:20,846 --> 00:40:22,006
You either be my partner

622
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,566
or end up like the hamster.

623
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:24,966
Think about it.

624
00:40:36,566 --> 00:40:37,526
Is

625
00:40:38,886 --> 00:40:40,646
this true, Chayan?

626
00:40:42,846 --> 00:40:44,286
Thanks to the man you love,

627
00:40:44,886 --> 00:40:47,246
he brought me to the nursing home.

628
00:40:50,006 --> 00:40:51,806
It's so boring to kill these old people.

629
00:40:52,406 --> 00:40:53,566
But it's better than none.

630
00:40:53,646 --> 00:40:54,366
Am I right?

631
00:40:56,006 --> 00:40:58,046
You both are hopeless psychos.

632
00:40:58,126 --> 00:40:59,046
That's right, Ming.

633
00:41:00,206 --> 00:41:01,206
We're psychos.

634
00:41:01,646 --> 00:41:04,326
We can't live like a normal person.

635
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:06,806
We can't control our desire to kill.

636
00:41:08,726 --> 00:41:11,486
Why do you approach me, Chayan?

637
00:41:12,126 --> 00:41:14,846
You should tell her yourself, Chayan.

638
00:41:15,446 --> 00:41:16,166
Run, Ming.

639
00:41:16,246 --> 00:41:17,246
He has lost his mind.

640
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,486
The women we killed

641
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:28,486
did not fulfill our desire to kill.

642
00:41:30,486 --> 00:41:32,286
Until we met you, Ming.

643
00:41:32,486 --> 00:41:35,406
We're both obsessed with you.

644
00:41:36,086 --> 00:41:39,406
We long to kill you with our own hands.

645
00:41:42,406 --> 00:41:43,726
So, Chayan...

646
00:41:45,566 --> 00:41:46,326
Come here.

647
00:41:47,366 --> 00:41:48,966
He approached you.

648
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,326
He does anything for you.

649
00:41:50,446 --> 00:41:52,566
That's part of our plan.

650
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:54,686
He killed the third victim for me.

651
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:02,606
Hey.

652
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:04,166
Are you vomiting?

653
00:42:05,446 --> 00:42:06,446
Let's take a closer look.

654
00:42:10,966 --> 00:42:12,086
That's enough.

655
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:15,806
Take a deep breath.

656
00:42:18,606 --> 00:42:20,486
Come on, let's wrap this up.

657
00:42:36,646 --> 00:42:37,726
The next victim

658
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:39,526
is you, Ming.

659
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:41,606
Run, Ming.

660
00:42:42,006 --> 00:42:42,846
Don't worry about me.

661
00:42:42,926 --> 00:42:43,806
Shut up.

662
00:42:45,686 --> 00:42:48,286
How dare Chayan betrayed me!

663
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,286
He betrayed my trust,

664
00:42:51,806 --> 00:42:53,086
because he has fallen in love with you.

665
00:42:53,726 --> 00:42:55,046
He loves you too dearly.

666
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,126
He wanted to leave with you.

667
00:42:57,886 --> 00:43:00,726
What about me?
Do I not love you then, Ming?

668
00:43:01,766 --> 00:43:02,526
Ming.

669
00:43:03,086 --> 00:43:03,846
Shoot him.

670
00:43:05,206 --> 00:43:07,206
My life has been a living hell

671
00:43:07,606 --> 00:43:09,086
when I committed the crime with him.

672
00:43:09,806 --> 00:43:11,366
If I can die in your hands,

673
00:43:12,446 --> 00:43:13,246
I have no other regrets.

674
00:43:13,646 --> 00:43:14,486
Don't hesitate.

675
00:43:15,006 --> 00:43:15,646
Fire the gun.

676
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:16,686
Fire the gun.

677
00:43:19,646 --> 00:43:20,366
Fire the gun, Ming.

678
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:22,766
Aim it right.

679
00:43:24,086 --> 00:43:24,886
If you miss the target,

680
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:26,406
he'd die.

681
00:43:28,726 --> 00:43:29,606
Fire the gun, Ming.

682
00:43:32,366 --> 00:43:34,406
Remember, you're a police officer.

683
00:43:35,966 --> 00:43:36,886
Also, remember

684
00:43:37,566 --> 00:43:38,526
that I love you.

685
00:43:40,006 --> 00:43:40,966
Let me go.

686
00:43:50,326 --> 00:43:51,446
Don't be scared, Ming.

687
00:43:53,926 --> 00:43:55,886
I won't shoot you to death.

688
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:04,006
I'm going to poison you.

689
00:44:07,046 --> 00:44:08,286
Just do it.

690
00:44:09,366 --> 00:44:11,806
Do whatever you want.

691
00:44:26,566 --> 00:44:28,126
Follow me, Vita.

692
00:44:29,966 --> 00:44:31,046
Run.

693
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:31,806
Come on.

694
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,246
Someone is here.

695
00:44:33,846 --> 00:44:35,366
Seems like I need to use the gun then.

696
00:44:42,486 --> 00:44:43,286
Follow me.

697
00:44:45,966 --> 00:44:46,686
Da.

698
00:44:47,006 --> 00:44:49,486
Wake up, Da.

699
00:44:53,046 --> 00:44:54,646
Don't fire the gun.

700
00:44:55,766 --> 00:44:56,966
Goodbye, Ming.

701
00:45:10,046 --> 00:45:11,006
Chayan.

702
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:12,846
Chayan.

703
00:45:14,126 --> 00:45:15,366
Chayan.

704
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:18,206
Wake up, Chayan.

705
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:19,886
Ming.

706
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:23,046
In this world,

707
00:45:23,966 --> 00:45:26,886
there are people
who love you more than I do.

708
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:29,526
No, Chayan.

709
00:45:29,606 --> 00:45:31,686
Don't cry for me.

710
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:35,686
Chayan.

711
00:45:36,406 --> 00:45:39,606
Wake up, Chayan.

712
00:45:54,286 --> 00:45:55,006
Da.

713
00:45:55,366 --> 00:45:56,046
Da.

714
00:46:05,206 --> 00:46:05,886
Da.

715
00:46:05,966 --> 00:46:08,126
Wake up, Da.

716
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,286
Do you remember
the day when Eig was killed?

717
00:46:17,366 --> 00:46:19,966
We were hunting down a criminal
who pretended to be a doctor.

718
00:46:22,006 --> 00:46:23,766
We got the security footage.

719
00:46:24,246 --> 00:46:25,526
Before he killed the victim,

720
00:46:25,606 --> 00:46:26,926
he made a call.

721
00:46:27,246 --> 00:46:30,486
I passed the call log to
the relevant department.

722
00:46:31,126 --> 00:46:31,966
What do you mean?

723
00:46:32,046 --> 00:46:34,686
If the owner of
the number turns out to be one of us,

724
00:46:34,846 --> 00:46:36,606
there's a traitor

725
00:46:36,886 --> 00:46:37,526
in our force.

726
00:46:38,686 --> 00:46:39,926
If there's a traitor,

727
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:41,726
he'd surely give himself away.

728
00:46:42,206 --> 00:46:43,966
Let's not act rashly and alert him.
