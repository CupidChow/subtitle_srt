3
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,300
(An adaptation of the novel
"When a Snail Falls in Love" by Ding Mo)

4
00:01:39,363 --> 00:01:42,843
(New York, US, Wasu's College Days)

5
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:47,704
(Three years ago)

6
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:51,323
I'm going to be late.

7
00:01:52,443 --> 00:01:53,323
Where is it?

8
00:01:54,803 --> 00:01:56,963
Xin, did you see my wallet?

9
00:01:59,643 --> 00:02:01,443
What's the fuss
so early in the morning, Wasu?

10
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:05,483
Isn't it in the pocket
of the pants you wore yesterday?

11
00:02:05,923 --> 00:02:06,923
I don't think so.

12
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:08,083
I don't put my wallet there.

13
00:02:12,963 --> 00:02:13,883
Where is it?

14
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:18,683
Did you find it, Xin?

15
00:02:21,803 --> 00:02:22,683
Isn't this it?

16
00:02:28,123 --> 00:02:29,883
Thank goodness. Where did you find it?

17
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:31,563
The usual place.

18
00:02:31,643 --> 00:02:32,243
Where was it?

19
00:02:32,243 --> 00:02:33,243
The pocket.

20
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,283
You know me

21
00:02:34,443 --> 00:02:36,123
better than I do.

22
00:02:41,723 --> 00:02:43,883
I have work in the suburbs today,

23
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:44,683
but…

24
00:02:58,723 --> 00:02:59,563
I…

25
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:02,643
I'll just borrow this amount.

26
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:03,683
Take it.

27
00:03:03,763 --> 00:03:05,003
You might need it.

28
00:03:07,443 --> 00:03:08,323
Thank you.

29
00:03:09,043 --> 00:03:11,323
I'll pay you back

30
00:03:11,403 --> 00:03:12,523
when I have the money.

31
00:03:19,243 --> 00:03:20,363
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:20,443 --> 00:03:22,243
I had to borrow from you again.

33
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:26,363
I think I need to work more shifts

34
00:03:26,443 --> 00:03:29,523
or find a job that pays better.

35
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:32,883
Maybe I should go back
to the Thai restaurant.

36
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:33,643
Wait.

37
00:03:34,203 --> 00:03:34,883
What's wrong?

38
00:03:34,963 --> 00:03:35,563
Don't go back.

39
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:36,563
It's a Thai restaurant.

40
00:03:36,643 --> 00:03:37,403
Don't do it,

41
00:03:38,443 --> 00:03:39,483
okay?

42
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:40,443
Okay.

43
00:03:40,923 --> 00:03:42,443
Just kidding.

44
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:47,963
When I have a job and become rich,

45
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:49,523
I'll propose

46
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:51,443
to you.

47
00:03:53,963 --> 00:03:54,923
After that,

48
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,043
we'll have a house like that.

49
00:04:00,203 --> 00:04:02,243
We'll live together.

50
00:04:02,803 --> 00:04:03,483
You, me, the kids.

51
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,163
I think we should have…

52
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:08,123
Ten kids.

53
00:04:11,203 --> 00:04:12,323
I'm going to work.

54
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:13,963
Go on.

55
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:19,083
Okay. I'm off.

56
00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:36,483
(Present, Thailand)

57
00:04:52,923 --> 00:04:53,643
Mr. Wasu.

58
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:58,003
We need to take your statement.

59
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,843
(Police Investigators Team)

60
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:03,763
("The Miraculous Journey
of Edward Tulane")

61
00:05:03,843 --> 00:05:04,763
Vita found this book

62
00:05:04,843 --> 00:05:07,283
on the bookshelf in your room.

63
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:13,803
It's the same book
as the one in this photo, right?

64
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,703
(Former CEO Zaiyongdanacai's daughter's)

65
00:05:18,704 --> 00:05:19,923
(rendezvous while studying abroad)

66
00:05:21,323 --> 00:05:22,563
I'll ask again.

67
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:23,883
It doesn't matter
how many times you ask.

68
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:27,883
My answer is the same.

69
00:05:30,203 --> 00:05:32,203
I didn't do it.

70
00:05:32,763 --> 00:05:34,443
We dated.

71
00:05:36,243 --> 00:05:39,323
But I haven't been
in contact with her for a long time.

72
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:41,363
Moreover,

73
00:05:41,443 --> 00:05:42,483
I was sleeping

74
00:05:44,003 --> 00:05:45,083
when she was killed.

75
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,723
Before Vita came back.

76
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,203
Am I being interrogated
as a murder suspect

77
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:55,843
or just someone who knew her?

78
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,723
I don't like it.

79
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,043
You're questioning me
as if I'm the murderer.

80
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,003
If you already knew about Xin's death,

81
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:15,483
why weren't you honest with us?

82
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,083
Actually you knew

83
00:06:18,163 --> 00:06:19,483
the victim.

84
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:33,323
I'm going out for a smoke break.

85
00:06:33,403 --> 00:06:34,203
Okay, Han.

86
00:06:45,763 --> 00:06:46,683
Vita.

87
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:50,803
Do you have an alibi
for Wasu on the night of the murder?

88
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,243
Wasu and I live under the same roof,

89
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:55,763
but it was late that night
by the time I got back from work.

90
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,563
I didn't notice if he was home.

91
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:00,683
I can't be certain.

92
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:02,283
What about his shoes?

93
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,443
Did you see the shoes
he took off at the entrance?

94
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:07,043
That might prove that he was home.

95
00:07:07,123 --> 00:07:08,643
I didn't pay attention.

96
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:10,243
Besides,

97
00:07:10,323 --> 00:07:13,683
that alone can't prove he was home.

98
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:15,723
We need something more convincing.

99
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,843
According to the statement Mr. Han took,

100
00:07:19,163 --> 00:07:22,203
he frequents a nightclub.

101
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,563
The nightclub happens to be

102
00:07:24,643 --> 00:07:27,243
the same one on Miss Xin's itinerary.

103
00:07:27,763 --> 00:07:29,523
She often sets up meetings there.

104
00:07:30,043 --> 00:07:31,123
Looking at it from another angle,

105
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:32,803
it's possible that…

106
00:07:35,323 --> 00:07:36,243
Go on, Ming.

107
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:39,323
Looking at it from another angle,

108
00:07:39,843 --> 00:07:41,203
it's possible that

109
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:43,163
Wasu is lying.

110
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:45,403
Maybe after they broke up,

111
00:07:45,643 --> 00:07:49,163
Wasu and Miss Xin continued
to meet up at that club.

112
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:55,603
Vita,

113
00:07:57,003 --> 00:07:59,283
have you seen this bookmark before?

114
00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:08,763
No smell.

115
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:13,243
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

116
00:08:25,163 --> 00:08:26,963
Captain, the thing you wanted…

117
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:29,883
Where did that come from?

118
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:33,123
It's Wasu's bookmark.

119
00:08:35,523 --> 00:08:36,763
Let me see it.

120
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:37,923
Let's see…

121
00:08:55,923 --> 00:08:58,443
The smell is similar to the one
in Miss Xin's wardrobe.

122
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:00,363
That's right.

123
00:09:00,603 --> 00:09:04,603
This bookmark is made
of rare Bombay rosewood.

124
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,083
The aroma is more subtle,

125
00:09:06,603 --> 00:09:09,043
but it will release
a sandalwood fragrance

126
00:09:09,523 --> 00:09:11,363
when exposed to heat
or stored in a hot environment.

127
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:15,923
This is the mysterious wood incense
we were looking for.

128
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:18,123
Does that mean Wasu is…

129
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:27,163
Requesting permission to question Wasu.

130
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:29,243
Vita,

131
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:30,603
as an officer,

132
00:09:30,763 --> 00:09:34,723
you should know that when a suspect
is a family member of ours,

133
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:36,083
we shouldn't…

134
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:37,043
I know.

135
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:40,483
As an officer,
you should not be involved in the case.

136
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:44,603
All the evidence so far
is pointing to your brother.

137
00:09:45,203 --> 00:09:47,483
I'm worried
you might not be sensible enough.

138
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:49,243
I'm not in over my head.

139
00:09:49,443 --> 00:09:50,643
On the contrary,

140
00:09:50,843 --> 00:09:53,723
I am very calm and composed.

141
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:58,923
Requesting permission
to interrogate him myself.

142
00:10:00,163 --> 00:10:01,563
I know him best.

143
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:03,443
He will shut everyone out.

144
00:10:03,523 --> 00:10:05,563
Only I can get him to talk.

145
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:10,363
And I want to prove to you
that I have changed.

146
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:33,203
Vita.

147
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,283
Why didn't you tell me

148
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:40,323
you and Xin used to date?

149
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:45,563
Sorry.

150
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:51,643
I don't know. For some reason,
I didn't want to bring it up.

151
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,363
Maybe

152
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:57,003
I was too upset.

153
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:00,363
It was an ugly breakup.

154
00:11:02,043 --> 00:11:03,123
I wanted to forget everything

155
00:11:06,803 --> 00:11:08,883
between Xin and me. That we dated,

156
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:11,843
and the time
we lived together in New York.

157
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:15,403
She arranged everything for me.

158
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:16,323
Xin,

159
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,723
did you see my wallet?

160
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:28,963
Thanks.

161
00:11:32,923 --> 00:11:34,083
Wasu,

162
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:36,363
there's nothing there.

163
00:11:36,923 --> 00:11:38,403
There never was. No money.

164
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:41,203
No future for us.

165
00:11:41,443 --> 00:11:42,443
I know

166
00:11:43,043 --> 00:11:45,123
how hard you are trying.

167
00:11:45,843 --> 00:11:47,243
The past few years

168
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:49,243
have made me really happy.

169
00:11:49,323 --> 00:11:51,483
But now, it just feels like

170
00:11:51,963 --> 00:11:52,883
you are

171
00:11:53,283 --> 00:11:55,043
bringing me
more suffering than happiness.

172
00:12:06,403 --> 00:12:09,523
If the future you've prepared for me

173
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:13,323
will make your life difficult,

174
00:12:14,723 --> 00:12:15,763
I think…

175
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:18,283
I think we should break up.

176
00:12:32,963 --> 00:12:34,843
(I was furious.)

177
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:40,243
I decided to step out of her life.

178
00:12:41,163 --> 00:12:43,243
I haven't seen her since.

179
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:47,483
I thought she was just like all the other women
who only cared about money.

180
00:12:48,163 --> 00:12:50,203
That she wouldn't
go through hardships with me.

181
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:52,123
Your friend, Zorn,

182
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:54,163
told me

183
00:12:55,003 --> 00:12:56,963
you've been hanging out
with some other guy,

184
00:12:59,163 --> 00:13:00,643
and it looks like

185
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:02,563
he's richer than me.

186
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:12,483
Yes.

187
00:13:13,123 --> 00:13:15,723
But that's not the reason
we're breaking up, Wasu.

188
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:16,563
Really?

189
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,243
Fine. That's not the reason.

190
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,203
Can't you understand what I'm saying?

191
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:24,763
That's not why we're breaking up!

192
00:13:44,643 --> 00:13:46,483
(I only found out afterwards)

193
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:50,403
that she wasn't seeing that guy.

194
00:13:53,043 --> 00:13:54,163
So why

195
00:13:54,843 --> 00:13:57,523
didn't you ask to get back together?

196
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:03,603
I was ashamed.

197
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:07,723
Did you know this?

198
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,523
Actually, she came from a very wealthy family.

199
00:14:11,803 --> 00:14:14,803
But she has been
working hard on her own.

200
00:14:15,443 --> 00:14:16,563
And me?

201
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:21,683
I was only her burden,
dragging her down.

202
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:25,323
That's when I decided

203
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:27,363
I would promise

204
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:32,363
never to walk into her life ever again.

205
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:39,403
Where did you get this bookmark?

206
00:14:50,363 --> 00:14:53,923
Xin gave me that

207
00:14:55,243 --> 00:14:58,163
on the day we became official.

208
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:01,283
At that time,

209
00:15:01,883 --> 00:15:03,243
she even told me

210
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:10,403
that this bookmark

211
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:16,483
was for the love of her life.

212
00:15:20,843 --> 00:15:22,043
This is

213
00:15:24,403 --> 00:15:25,723
a rare bookmark.

214
00:15:26,483 --> 00:15:28,883
As far as I understand,
it's very special.

215
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,643
She only gave it

216
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:35,923
to you

217
00:15:36,883 --> 00:15:38,083
and Sen.

218
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,443
Vita handled it
very sensibly and calmly.

219
00:16:02,683 --> 00:16:03,483
But

220
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,643
are you sure she's all right, Captain?

221
00:16:06,523 --> 00:16:11,163
I think she has learned how to handle
her personal emotions at work.

222
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:14,523
Is there a problem?

223
00:16:15,563 --> 00:16:16,523
No.

224
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:18,123
I just think

225
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:21,043
you trust her a lot.

226
00:16:27,563 --> 00:16:29,883
Just as I trust all of my team members.

227
00:16:31,683 --> 00:16:33,163
You're up, Ming.

228
00:16:34,003 --> 00:16:34,643
Yes.

229
00:16:35,043 --> 00:16:37,363
I want you to go to the nightclub
and see if there are any new clues.

230
00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:40,643
Investigate whether Miss Xin

231
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:42,123
really met Mr. Wasu.

232
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:45,443
Can we just access
the club's surveillance footage?

233
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:48,883
It's better to go undercover.

234
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:52,643
Follow the procedure as we always do.

235
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:54,443
- Yes.
- Yes.

236
00:17:03,243 --> 00:17:04,843
Good job, Vita.

237
00:17:05,923 --> 00:17:08,603
But I would like you to withdraw
from the case for now.

238
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:13,123
If the higher-ups find out
that you're involved,

239
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:15,123
they might take disciplinary action
against our department.

240
00:17:15,483 --> 00:17:16,283
Understood.

241
00:17:18,243 --> 00:17:19,323
If there's nothing else,

242
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:20,523
I'll take my leave.

243
00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:33,123
Captain,

244
00:17:33,683 --> 00:17:36,083
are you sure she's okay?

245
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:39,203
We don't have to worry about her.

246
00:17:40,163 --> 00:17:40,923
Get to work.

247
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:12,603
Aren't you hungry?

248
00:18:14,203 --> 00:18:16,163
You should eat something.

249
00:18:20,243 --> 00:18:21,563
I'm not hungry.

250
00:18:25,123 --> 00:18:26,563
I want to be alone for a bit.

251
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:29,723
Don't forget to eat.

252
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:33,843
Okay.

253
00:18:40,403 --> 00:18:43,403
(Icon Siam)

254
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:47,883
It's…

255
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:49,603
Good.

256
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:51,283
I guess.

257
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:52,763
But not that color.

258
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:53,803
Right. No.

259
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:55,483
We need something hotter.

260
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,763
Change.

261
00:19:00,123 --> 00:19:01,763
Goodness. That's too covered up.

262
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,283
You're going to a club.

263
00:19:03,363 --> 00:19:04,243
Roll up your sleeves.

264
00:19:04,363 --> 00:19:04,923
Like this?

265
00:19:05,403 --> 00:19:06,283
Sleeves down.

266
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:09,563
Pull the zipper down.

267
00:19:09,643 --> 00:19:10,603
Pull it up.

268
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:13,443
Oh, it's too covered up.
Go and get changed.

269
00:19:15,883 --> 00:19:16,723
Cool.

270
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:17,683
Fashionable.

271
00:19:18,603 --> 00:19:19,403
Three thumbs up.

272
00:19:19,963 --> 00:19:21,323
Huh? From who?

273
00:19:21,403 --> 00:19:22,763
Me, Captain, and Han.

274
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,483
It's a thumbs-down here.

275
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,243
From who?

276
00:19:25,323 --> 00:19:26,163
Chief.

277
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:28,043
Change.

278
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:29,803
Can I take a selfie with her?

279
00:19:29,883 --> 00:19:31,523
That's too much.

280
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:38,243
Done?

281
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:41,283
Change it. Not this outfit.

282
00:19:44,763 --> 00:19:47,763
Wow! Oh my gosh!

283
00:19:47,843 --> 00:19:50,203
Is it too late for me to go after you?

284
00:19:50,643 --> 00:19:51,403
Sure.

285
00:19:52,523 --> 00:19:53,843
Talk to my fist first.

286
00:19:55,003 --> 00:19:56,203
Don't you think this dress

287
00:19:56,723 --> 00:19:57,883
shows too much skin?

288
00:19:58,483 --> 00:20:00,723
The one earlier with the collar is fine.

289
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:03,163
Is it cold in Thailand?

290
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:04,843
This is how she should dress.

291
00:20:04,923 --> 00:20:07,443
This is what you wear
if you work as a call girl in a club.

292
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:09,403
This will attract attention.

293
00:20:09,483 --> 00:20:11,163
Trust me. I'm a veteran.

294
00:20:11,963 --> 00:20:14,203
Go in and order a drink as usual.

295
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:17,283
Find out the number of cameras inside.

296
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,843
Pay attention to the regulars

297
00:20:20,363 --> 00:20:21,523
and the head of security.

298
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:23,923
But be careful
of the head of the security.

299
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:26,043
Don't let him find out
that we're the police.

300
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:29,283
Don't forget
about the regular employees too.

301
00:20:29,363 --> 00:20:31,363
We need to get familiar
with the layout of the venue.

302
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:36,643
It'll make it easier
when we search and collect evidence.

303
00:20:39,923 --> 00:20:40,803
Are you

304
00:20:41,963 --> 00:20:42,883
ready?

305
00:20:44,563 --> 00:20:45,283
Yes.

306
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:47,203
Okay.

307
00:21:02,523 --> 00:21:03,323
Thanks.

308
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:12,123
Ming.

309
00:21:15,683 --> 00:21:16,483
What did you say?

310
00:21:16,563 --> 00:21:17,243
Nothing.

311
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:19,563
Just testing to see
if you could hear me.

312
00:21:21,123 --> 00:21:22,283
I can hear you loud and clear.

313
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:24,083
Okay.

314
00:21:25,803 --> 00:21:27,043
Take care of yourself.

315
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:49,003
A Kiss of Death.

316
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,283
All right. I'll be right back.

317
00:21:50,603 --> 00:21:51,363
(Kiss of Death?)

318
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,923
(That's a cocktail
with high alcohol content.)

319
00:21:54,643 --> 00:21:56,043
(We're here on a mission.)

320
00:21:56,123 --> 00:21:57,883
You shouldn't get something so strong.

321
00:21:58,003 --> 00:21:58,763
Hey.

322
00:21:59,043 --> 00:22:01,123
We need to sell it.

323
00:22:01,523 --> 00:22:02,883
(Ning taught me that.)

324
00:22:02,963 --> 00:22:04,443
(Who would chat me up)

325
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,123
(if I ordered orange juice?)

326
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,883
Nine security cameras total.

327
00:22:12,323 --> 00:22:13,243
Two at the door.

328
00:22:14,123 --> 00:22:15,843
Five in the center of the dance floor.

329
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:18,403
Two on the way to the toilet.

330
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:22,683
Da,

331
00:22:23,763 --> 00:22:24,883
I'm hanging up.

332
00:22:25,203 --> 00:22:26,083
I'm going to the washroom.

333
00:22:26,163 --> 00:22:26,923
Okay.

334
00:22:27,003 --> 00:22:27,643
(On call)

335
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:28,443
(Call ended)

336
00:22:48,723 --> 00:22:49,283
Miss.

337
00:22:50,843 --> 00:22:54,283
The shareholder of the club
suspects you're secretly taking pictures.

338
00:22:54,363 --> 00:22:56,283
He wants to check your phone.

339
00:22:57,483 --> 00:22:58,803
I'm a customer.

340
00:22:58,883 --> 00:23:00,203
I was just taking selfies.

341
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:02,563
He just wants to be sure.

342
00:23:02,643 --> 00:23:04,123
It's not a big deal. I'll just check it.

343
00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:04,883
Hey.

344
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:06,883
You're just a security guard.

345
00:23:08,043 --> 00:23:09,243
Mind your business.

346
00:23:12,003 --> 00:23:12,603
Wicked girl!

347
00:23:12,723 --> 00:23:13,323
I'm so sorry!

348
00:23:13,443 --> 00:23:15,363
What's wrong with you?
Watch where you're going!

349
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:16,963
I… I'm sorry! I'll clean it up.

350
00:23:17,043 --> 00:23:17,883
That's enough!

351
00:23:18,483 --> 00:23:19,163
Enough!

352
00:23:19,563 --> 00:23:20,243
It's fine.

353
00:23:22,363 --> 00:23:23,723
I'm sorry. I'll clean it for you.

354
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:24,723
I said no need.

355
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:25,843
I'll clean it up myself.

356
00:23:25,923 --> 00:23:26,763
I'm sorry.

357
00:23:26,843 --> 00:23:28,003
- Dang it.
- I'm sorry.

358
00:23:29,563 --> 00:23:30,243
Miss.

359
00:23:30,483 --> 00:23:31,523
I'll help you. Come with me.

360
00:23:31,963 --> 00:23:32,683
It's okay, Ming.

361
00:23:32,963 --> 00:23:33,603
Vita?

362
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:35,323
We have to get out of here right now.

363
00:23:36,723 --> 00:23:37,723
Why are you here?

364
00:23:37,923 --> 00:23:39,363
No time to explain.

365
00:23:39,443 --> 00:23:40,683
I've already gotten

366
00:23:40,803 --> 00:23:42,043
what you wanted. Come on.

367
00:23:45,803 --> 00:23:46,683
Vita!

368
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:49,203
Didn't the captain tell you
to stay away from this case?

369
00:23:49,563 --> 00:23:50,683
I know.

370
00:23:50,923 --> 00:23:52,603
But I have doubts about Wasu,

371
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:54,043
so I came to gather evidence myself.

372
00:23:54,563 --> 00:23:57,283
All you had to do
was saying that Wasu was asleep in his bed.

373
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:58,923
That would've given him an alibi.

374
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:01,003
But you chose to tell the truth.

375
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,003
Never mind.
I already have the information.

376
00:24:03,683 --> 00:24:06,003
What do you mean
you have the information?

377
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,323
Ming, I don't have time
to explain everything.

378
00:24:08,403 --> 00:24:10,443
We need to leave. Right now.

379
00:24:11,723 --> 00:24:12,403
Come on.

380
00:24:14,243 --> 00:24:14,883
Let's go.

381
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,003
Miss.

382
00:24:18,683 --> 00:24:19,963
Where are you going?

383
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:22,003
You're not off the clock yet.

384
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,323
My boss wants you

385
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:25,163
to keep him company.

386
00:24:25,283 --> 00:24:27,523
Oh, I'd love to go too.

387
00:24:27,603 --> 00:24:29,963
But I really need to go.

388
00:24:33,363 --> 00:24:35,203
What's the hurry?

389
00:24:37,523 --> 00:24:38,643
Let go of my friend!

390
00:24:39,123 --> 00:24:40,163
Miss,

391
00:24:40,723 --> 00:24:44,003
you have fair skin.
My boss will like you.

392
00:24:44,523 --> 00:24:46,723
He likes it when there's more than one.

393
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,243
Where are you going?

394
00:24:56,803 --> 00:24:57,443
Vita!

395
00:24:59,323 --> 00:25:00,083
Vita!

396
00:25:00,243 --> 00:25:02,563
You came here in disguise
to steal information, didn't you?

397
00:25:03,403 --> 00:25:04,403
If the captain finds out about this,

398
00:25:04,483 --> 00:25:05,323
you'll be in big trouble.

399
00:25:05,603 --> 00:25:07,443
I'm in trouble either way,

400
00:25:07,643 --> 00:25:09,003
but maybe

401
00:25:09,683 --> 00:25:11,283
I can make up for it.

402
00:25:11,683 --> 00:25:12,483
What do you mean?

403
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:18,843
There they are.

404
00:25:19,323 --> 00:25:21,283
So you know each other.

405
00:25:23,243 --> 00:25:24,563
Well, then,

406
00:25:24,803 --> 00:25:26,843
you can bring your phone
to my boss yourself.

407
00:25:44,763 --> 00:25:45,723
Not bad.

408
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:50,043
More?

409
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:51,723
Come here!

410
00:25:51,803 --> 00:25:53,003
Get over here!

411
00:25:55,843 --> 00:25:57,163
Get over here and stay here.

412
00:26:12,043 --> 00:26:13,123
Who are you?

413
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,963
All of you, come out!

414
00:26:26,723 --> 00:26:27,483
Kill him!

415
00:27:15,323 --> 00:27:15,923
Retreat!

416
00:27:16,003 --> 00:27:16,763
- Go!
- Fall back.

417
00:27:17,363 --> 00:27:18,283
Fall back.

418
00:27:23,603 --> 00:27:24,243
Sir,

419
00:27:24,523 --> 00:27:25,163
I…

420
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,043
Back to the station.

421
00:27:26,283 --> 00:27:27,443
We need to talk.

422
00:27:38,243 --> 00:27:38,923
Come on.

423
00:27:51,723 --> 00:27:53,683
What do you take my orders for, Vita?

424
00:27:54,283 --> 00:27:55,483
You said you knew.

425
00:27:55,763 --> 00:27:56,723
You understood.

426
00:27:57,723 --> 00:27:58,763
You copied.

427
00:27:59,323 --> 00:28:00,843
But you still disobeyed me.

428
00:28:03,003 --> 00:28:04,243
Captain, Vita…

429
00:28:04,323 --> 00:28:05,443
And you, Ming.

430
00:28:06,563 --> 00:28:07,523
Your mission.

431
00:28:07,963 --> 00:28:09,843
I told you to follow the procedure.

432
00:28:10,243 --> 00:28:11,763
Why did you help Vita?

433
00:28:11,843 --> 00:28:13,003
It was my own idea.

434
00:28:15,243 --> 00:28:17,643
Ming was carrying out the mission
as you ordered.

435
00:28:17,923 --> 00:28:18,883
It was me.

436
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,603
I got in the way.

437
00:28:21,803 --> 00:28:23,043
Why did you do that?

438
00:28:23,883 --> 00:28:26,643
The process was taking too long.

439
00:28:27,723 --> 00:28:29,363
The undercover mission took too long.

440
00:28:29,523 --> 00:28:30,883
Day one, observation.

441
00:28:31,563 --> 00:28:32,763
Day two, analysis.

442
00:28:33,203 --> 00:28:34,443
Day three, in-depth investigation.

443
00:28:34,723 --> 00:28:36,043
Day four, reveal her identity.

444
00:28:36,243 --> 00:28:38,683
By the time you're done,
the evidence will all be gone.

445
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:42,243
So you're saying I'm moving too slowly

446
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:43,803
for your liking.

447
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:47,403
Vita's digging her own grave.

448
00:28:47,683 --> 00:28:50,243
Who would dare
to talk to the captain like that?

449
00:28:50,483 --> 00:28:51,163
Oh, shoot.

450
00:28:51,923 --> 00:28:52,563
Walk faster.

451
00:28:57,003 --> 00:28:57,963
I respect you.

452
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:01,163
I never meant to pick on your ways.

453
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:03,523
But I disagree.

454
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,203
So you ignored the procedure

455
00:29:08,203 --> 00:29:11,443
to find the evidence
to prove your brother's innocence?

456
00:29:13,763 --> 00:29:15,643
All the documents and files,

457
00:29:15,723 --> 00:29:17,163
including the security camera footage.

458
00:29:17,243 --> 00:29:19,363
There were no signs
of Wasu meeting with Miss Xin

459
00:29:19,683 --> 00:29:22,523
anywhere in the club,
including the toilets.

460
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:32,323
It's okay if you think I'm inefficient.

461
00:29:32,643 --> 00:29:34,043
I have to thank you

462
00:29:34,643 --> 00:29:36,883
for helping us acquire
the security footage.

463
00:29:37,163 --> 00:29:38,603
But your fault is

464
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,683
trusting in only yourself

465
00:29:42,163 --> 00:29:43,763
and not anyone else.

466
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,923
You completely disregarded the team.

467
00:29:47,283 --> 00:29:48,723
I've repeated this several times

468
00:29:48,803 --> 00:29:50,403
since you joined my team.

469
00:29:51,243 --> 00:29:52,763
We are a team. We need to work together.

470
00:29:54,523 --> 00:29:56,523
We need to trust each other.

471
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,523
As for your brother,

472
00:29:59,963 --> 00:30:01,443
his name has already been cleared.

473
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,843
You have Ning and Mr. Han
to thank for that.

474
00:30:05,323 --> 00:30:07,723
They did
a thorough investigation on him.

475
00:30:08,363 --> 00:30:10,363
His witness is his watch.

476
00:30:10,723 --> 00:30:14,163
His watch recorded his heart rate
at the time of Miss Xin's death.

477
00:30:14,243 --> 00:30:15,683
It proved that he was sleeping.

478
00:30:18,643 --> 00:30:20,803
Have you been wearing
that watch all this while?

479
00:30:22,523 --> 00:30:23,163
Yes.

480
00:30:25,803 --> 00:30:27,283
I'm letting you go this time.

481
00:30:28,763 --> 00:30:32,083
But I think you owe everyone
on the team an apology.

482
00:30:42,243 --> 00:30:43,243
Vita.

483
00:30:47,283 --> 00:30:48,123
Last time,

484
00:30:48,403 --> 00:30:49,923
when you interrogated Wasu,

485
00:30:50,523 --> 00:30:51,963
the captain even praised you.

486
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:55,443
He said you had learned how to handle
personal emotions at work.

487
00:30:56,403 --> 00:30:57,643
But as a matter of fact,

488
00:30:58,643 --> 00:31:00,003
no superior

489
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:03,603
would've allowed a subordinate
that was related to a suspect to do that.

490
00:31:04,923 --> 00:31:06,723
But he trusted you and let you do it.

491
00:31:08,763 --> 00:31:09,483
I think

492
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:11,323
you really disappointed him

493
00:31:12,323 --> 00:31:14,323
this time.

494
00:32:42,203 --> 00:32:44,203
I think you should eat something.

495
00:32:45,123 --> 00:32:46,883
I'm not hungry.

496
00:33:26,563 --> 00:33:28,683
I have you and your colleagues to thank

497
00:33:31,403 --> 00:33:33,683
for clearing my name.

498
00:33:46,603 --> 00:33:48,003
I promise you

499
00:33:48,603 --> 00:33:50,763
we'll catch the culprit.

500
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,003
How are things

501
00:34:00,763 --> 00:34:02,843
between you and the captain?

502
00:34:04,283 --> 00:34:05,043
Between us?

503
00:34:07,443 --> 00:34:08,203
What do you mean?

504
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:18,923
Mr. Wasu,

505
00:34:19,883 --> 00:34:21,083
that's all for today.

506
00:34:21,883 --> 00:34:25,123
No matter what,
we will not let a criminal go free.

507
00:34:25,603 --> 00:34:27,723
Nor will we wrong a good man.

508
00:34:30,883 --> 00:34:31,763
Captain Pla.

509
00:34:33,163 --> 00:34:34,643
I have a request.

510
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:50,963
I don't think

511
00:34:51,643 --> 00:34:53,043
my sister

512
00:34:53,603 --> 00:34:54,963
is meant to be a police officer.

513
00:34:55,683 --> 00:34:56,523
So,

514
00:34:56,723 --> 00:34:59,403
about that three-month deal
you guys made,

515
00:34:59,483 --> 00:35:02,163
please go easy on her.

516
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,523
I just want her to live a simple

517
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,243
and happier life.

518
00:35:06,763 --> 00:35:07,443
But the truth is,

519
00:35:07,843 --> 00:35:11,443
it's not for you or me to decide

520
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:13,283
if she can be a good cop.

521
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:16,643
Much depends on whether
she can pass the test or not.

522
00:35:17,723 --> 00:35:20,123
I'm her brother.

523
00:35:21,163 --> 00:35:23,523
I hope you understand

524
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:26,403
my concerns.

525
00:35:27,243 --> 00:35:29,123
As a police officer,

526
00:35:30,123 --> 00:35:32,283
I trust my eye,

527
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,163
and I trust

528
00:35:34,923 --> 00:35:37,443
that Vita can make the best decision for herself.

529
00:35:41,363 --> 00:35:43,203
Do you still love Xin?

530
00:35:50,843 --> 00:35:52,483
It doesn't matter anymore,

531
00:35:53,283 --> 00:35:55,243
Vita.

532
00:35:55,843 --> 00:35:57,443
It's in the past.

533
00:36:00,403 --> 00:36:01,763
You must be tired.

534
00:36:02,723 --> 00:36:03,843
Get some rest.

535
00:36:33,883 --> 00:36:34,803
Vita,

536
00:36:36,883 --> 00:36:37,883
sometimes,

537
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,083
I hope you never fall in love.

538
00:36:48,603 --> 00:36:50,323
It's too hard to fix it

539
00:36:57,003 --> 00:36:58,323
when things go wrong.

540
00:36:59,003 --> 00:37:00,803
Vita is a funny one.

541
00:37:00,883 --> 00:37:01,803
Look at this.

542
00:37:01,883 --> 00:37:03,883
She even signed the card
and included her title.

543
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:06,803
You would think this was
an apology letter from the department.

544
00:37:07,283 --> 00:37:08,403
I thought I was meticulous,

545
00:37:08,483 --> 00:37:09,563
(To Lieutenant Pagong Zonglongleang)
but I think Vita beat me.

546
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:10,603
Vita Wasongkanachai of PIT)

547
00:37:11,003 --> 00:37:12,683
When you go back to your stations,

548
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,203
you'll even see flower baskets.

549
00:37:16,123 --> 00:37:18,203
I don't understand her.
This is too formal.

550
00:37:19,243 --> 00:37:20,123
I received them too.

551
00:37:21,243 --> 00:37:22,563
That's how Vita is.

552
00:37:22,643 --> 00:37:24,123
She's not good at expressing herself.

553
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:25,483
So she chose this way.

554
00:37:25,563 --> 00:37:26,363
Ming!

555
00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:27,523
Why are you here?

556
00:37:27,923 --> 00:37:29,123
This is the men's toilet.

557
00:37:29,843 --> 00:37:30,563
Sorry.

558
00:37:30,843 --> 00:37:31,443
Unfortunately,

559
00:37:32,363 --> 00:37:34,163
there's no water in the women's toilet.

560
00:37:35,363 --> 00:37:38,283
It might be too official

561
00:37:38,403 --> 00:37:39,243
and even clumsy,

562
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:42,603
but I think she knows her mistake now.

563
00:37:42,683 --> 00:37:44,603
That's how she is.

564
00:37:44,683 --> 00:37:47,363
She's slow
when it comes to these things.

565
00:37:53,443 --> 00:37:54,083
What was that about?

566
00:37:55,043 --> 00:37:56,003
She's bold.

567
00:38:08,363 --> 00:38:09,123
What is it, Vita?

568
00:38:09,883 --> 00:38:12,843
As instructed,
I've apologized to everyone.

569
00:38:14,643 --> 00:38:16,003
Da told me.

570
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,603
No need to be so formal next time.

571
00:38:20,043 --> 00:38:22,603
I heard you even signed the card.

572
00:38:23,003 --> 00:38:24,043
People to people.

573
00:38:24,123 --> 00:38:25,723
Not department to people.

574
00:38:27,163 --> 00:38:29,643
I still owe you an apology.

575
00:38:29,723 --> 00:38:31,603
Thank you for helping me and Ming

576
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:32,803
and

577
00:38:33,123 --> 00:38:34,283
Wasu.

578
00:38:34,363 --> 00:38:39,203
Well, helping your brother was our duty.

579
00:38:39,323 --> 00:38:40,043
Plus,

580
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:42,963
that makes one less suspect for us.

581
00:38:43,403 --> 00:38:44,323
I suppose it's a good thing.

582
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:47,003
Also,

583
00:38:47,723 --> 00:38:49,923
thank you for the sandwich.

584
00:38:50,363 --> 00:38:51,523
It was delicious.

585
00:38:52,443 --> 00:38:53,683
So

586
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,083
I made you sandwiches

587
00:38:55,523 --> 00:38:56,843
today too.

588
00:39:06,483 --> 00:39:07,203
This is

589
00:39:07,483 --> 00:39:09,003
my own recipe.

590
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:11,243
I included all the things
I know you like.

591
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:12,923
Please enjoy it.

592
00:39:13,243 --> 00:39:14,923
I'll leave now.

593
00:39:16,243 --> 00:39:16,963
Thanks.

594
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,723
So she can cook too.

595
00:39:43,443 --> 00:39:44,163
(Evidence)

596
00:39:44,283 --> 00:39:45,283
In that case,

597
00:39:45,563 --> 00:39:48,883
Wasu has been eliminated as a suspect.

598
00:39:51,843 --> 00:39:53,963
Let's go back to the case itself.

599
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:57,003
We found something strange.

600
00:39:57,283 --> 00:40:00,723
The relationship
between Miss Xin and this man.

601
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:07,283
Miss Xin kept a low profile.

602
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,483
Almost no one knows about her.

603
00:40:09,803 --> 00:40:11,403
She didn't often meet with people.

604
00:40:11,483 --> 00:40:13,083
But every month,

605
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:16,443
she went to Ratchaburi for a project.

606
00:40:17,883 --> 00:40:18,523
That's right.

607
00:40:18,723 --> 00:40:20,683
The project sponsors

608
00:40:20,883 --> 00:40:23,043
of the project Da is referring to

609
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:25,043
are this man and Miss Xin.

610
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:28,163
This is Songticha,
president of the Gemstone Weaving Association.

611
00:40:28,443 --> 00:40:31,003
The project was launched with the intention
of increasing the income of locals.

612
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:32,963
(Vita's meeting minutes,)
On the surface, however,

613
00:40:33,043 --> 00:40:34,203
(jewelry auction, time, venue, purpose)
it's clear that the real profit

614
00:40:34,363 --> 00:40:36,843
comes from the decoration
of the Thai traditional costume fashion show.

615
00:40:37,323 --> 00:40:39,363
Most of the clients
and interested parties

616
00:40:39,963 --> 00:40:41,283
are foreigners.

617
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:43,083
How often did she go there?

618
00:40:43,603 --> 00:40:46,563
According to the information,
almost every week.

619
00:40:47,123 --> 00:40:47,803
Every week?

620
00:40:48,003 --> 00:40:48,843
Yes.

621
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:50,883
The event will only be held
in the middle of the year.

622
00:40:52,403 --> 00:40:53,763
There are still months to go.

623
00:40:54,763 --> 00:40:56,963
There's no need to go every week
if it's just for work.

624
00:40:57,363 --> 00:40:59,603
If they claim it is for work purposes,

625
00:40:59,683 --> 00:41:01,283
I think there must be
something else going on.

626
00:41:02,003 --> 00:41:04,403
What would need her
to go there so often?

627
00:41:04,683 --> 00:41:08,963
I investigated the financial transactions
between the Zaiyongdanacai family and Miss Xin.

628
00:41:09,043 --> 00:41:11,803
Ms. Jindapa once sent
tens of millions to Miss Xin.

629
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:13,723
But the huge sum of money disappeared.

630
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:16,883
I tried digging deeper,
but I couldn't find anything else.

631
00:41:17,283 --> 00:41:19,723
But we know
that it was a private account,

632
00:41:20,363 --> 00:41:22,723
not an account of a company
or any institution.

633
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:24,963
Are you saying that the missing money

634
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:27,363
is related to her weekly trips
to Ratchaburi?

635
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,123
I don't know for sure.

636
00:41:29,203 --> 00:41:30,403
But I think it's suspicious.

637
00:41:31,243 --> 00:41:33,483
But every payment has to go somewhere.

638
00:41:33,563 --> 00:41:35,443
And such a large sum of money.

639
00:41:35,523 --> 00:41:37,163
It must be someone she trusts very much.

640
00:41:41,723 --> 00:41:42,723
Vita,

641
00:41:44,403 --> 00:41:45,723
did you learn anything?

642
00:41:47,843 --> 00:41:51,643
There's a mention
of an upcoming auction in her itinerary.

643
00:41:52,003 --> 00:41:53,683
If nothing had happened to Miss Xin,

644
00:41:53,763 --> 00:41:56,443
she would be on her way
to Ratchaburi today.

645
00:41:57,443 --> 00:41:58,923
Anything else?

646
00:42:02,843 --> 00:42:06,323
She mentioned a ruby, and the president
of the Gemstone Weaving Association,

647
00:42:06,403 --> 00:42:10,963
Songticha, happens to be
the organizer of this auction.

648
00:42:11,043 --> 00:42:12,323
The venue is in Ratchaburi.

649
00:42:13,203 --> 00:42:14,843
The missing money

650
00:42:15,163 --> 00:42:16,643
and a gem auction.

651
00:42:17,403 --> 00:42:18,723
Not a clue.

652
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:22,563
But I think there's
something fishy about this auction.

653
00:42:23,003 --> 00:42:24,043
I can't draw any conclusions yet.

654
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,323
I'll have to go and see it in person.

655
00:42:28,443 --> 00:42:29,163
Da.

656
00:42:29,403 --> 00:42:30,043
Yes.

657
00:42:30,123 --> 00:42:31,163
Get me a van.

658
00:42:31,243 --> 00:42:31,963
All right.

659
00:42:32,643 --> 00:42:33,443
Captain,

660
00:42:33,803 --> 00:42:35,003
do you need a helper?

661
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:38,123
The event information states
that the attendees must be

662
00:42:38,203 --> 00:42:40,123
a couple, married or otherwise.

663
00:42:40,803 --> 00:42:41,683
A couple?

664
00:42:42,243 --> 00:42:42,923
Yes.

665
00:42:47,243 --> 00:42:48,003
Vita.

666
00:42:49,723 --> 00:42:50,963
You'll be

667
00:42:51,323 --> 00:42:52,883
my lover.

668
00:42:57,123 --> 00:42:57,923
Yes, sir.

669
00:43:02,683 --> 00:43:04,403
(Someone died in our family!)

670
00:43:04,483 --> 00:43:06,003
(And we're still fighting
among ourselves!)

671
00:43:09,123 --> 00:43:10,763
(You went to Ratchaburi last night.)

672
00:43:10,923 --> 00:43:12,843
(Just come.
Don't ask so many questions.)

673
00:43:14,443 --> 00:43:17,003
(Then, please proceed in order.)

674
00:43:17,363 --> 00:43:19,443
(You've already questioned us.)

675
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:20,883
(What else do you want to know?)

676
00:43:22,563 --> 00:43:23,763
(Mr. Bowen and Miss Nicha.)

677
00:43:23,843 --> 00:43:26,203
(The two guests
that were just added last week, yes?)

678
00:43:27,323 --> 00:43:28,323
(Is there something wrong, boss?)

679
00:43:28,843 --> 00:43:29,643
(I'm not sure.)

680
00:43:30,043 --> 00:43:30,843
(Something isn't right.)
