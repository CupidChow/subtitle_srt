3
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,300
(An adaptation of the novel
"When a Snail Falls in Love" by Ding Mo)

4
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:45,975
Sister-in-law.

5
00:01:46,342 --> 00:01:47,342
Where's Sen?

6
00:01:48,015 --> 00:01:49,895
Is he not coming home again?

7
00:01:51,135 --> 00:01:53,055
Because of the case yesterday, right?

8
00:01:53,775 --> 00:01:57,095
He's been close with Xin since infancy,
he pegs her as his sister.

9
00:02:00,055 --> 00:02:01,335
He probably almost forgot

10
00:02:01,895 --> 00:02:03,935
who his real sister is.

11
00:02:04,695 --> 00:02:06,055
They're not biological siblings,
after all.

12
00:02:06,615 --> 00:02:07,735
Why must he be so upset?

13
00:02:11,175 --> 00:02:12,655
Why didn't Yu come back
for dinner today?

14
00:02:13,855 --> 00:02:15,335
Because Xin has dead

15
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:17,375
and he has to take over all affairs

16
00:02:17,535 --> 00:02:19,175
of the jewelry association.

17
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:22,255
Besides, Ratchaburi Auction
is approaching.

18
00:02:22,335 --> 00:02:24,335
He has to help out as well.

19
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:27,735
Brother,

20
00:02:27,735 --> 00:02:31,215
as the CEO, you have so much free time.

21
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:34,295
Yu has done everything for you.

22
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:36,615
Because I trust your husband.

23
00:02:37,295 --> 00:02:39,655
He's the financial director.

24
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:41,935
So, who else should do it,
except for him?

25
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:45,535
But he volunteers for the event

26
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:47,135
of the jewelry association.

27
00:02:48,215 --> 00:02:49,935
Perhaps he's worried

28
00:02:50,415 --> 00:02:51,615
that you would

29
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:53,735
mess the whole event up.

30
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:55,815
So, he has to handle it himself.

31
00:02:57,855 --> 00:03:00,015
Because your husband is capable

32
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:01,375
of just about anything.

33
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:04,175
Just not his work,
he's really good at something else.

34
00:03:04,255 --> 00:03:04,935
Brother.

35
00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:05,895
Did I say that wrong?

36
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:07,055
What are you trying to get at?

37
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:09,175
- Oh, he likes philandering, doesn't he?
- You're going overboard.

38
00:03:09,215 --> 00:03:09,855
Stop it!

39
00:03:10,695 --> 00:03:12,255
Someone died in our family!

40
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:14,055
And we're still fighting
among ourselves!

41
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:21,615
Sen.

42
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:22,735
Come and eat.

43
00:03:23,175 --> 00:03:24,775
Xin has left us.

44
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:26,735
Do you think I'm in the mood to eat now?

45
00:03:27,095 --> 00:03:29,535
Look at you and Dad
have such a good appetite.

46
00:03:30,055 --> 00:03:31,375
What do you mean?

47
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:33,775
Like what it sounds.

48
00:03:38,615 --> 00:03:40,895
Please enjoy your dinner,

49
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:42,055
everyone here.

50
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,095
This brat.

51
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:01,735
(Incoming call: Captain Pla)

52
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:09,295
Hello.

53
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:12,095
Where do we meet and when?

54
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,135
You reached Ratchaburi last night?

55
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,935
Just come.
Don't ask so many questions.

56
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,975
(There will be a car to pick you up later.)

57
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:20,975
That's it for now.

58
00:04:46,615 --> 00:04:47,295
Thank you.

59
00:04:47,335 --> 00:04:47,975
You're welcome.

60
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:52,935
What took you so long?

61
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:55,215
Did the car drive way too slowly?

62
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,295
No one can be faster than you.

63
00:04:57,735 --> 00:04:59,455
Why did you come early last night?

64
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:01,535
Was there something
you need to deal with first?

65
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:04,735
So many questions.

66
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,135
Come with me.

67
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:19,615
You asked me why I was here earlier.

68
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,055
Look over there.

69
00:05:21,615 --> 00:05:23,375
I need to cozy up to Mr. Yuthaichai.

70
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,935
So, who are you to him?

71
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:29,815
A new rookie in the business
who wants to approach him.

72
00:05:30,135 --> 00:05:31,935
What about me? Who am I?

73
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:39,695
Hello.

74
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:40,495
Hello.

75
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:43,895
Good morning.

76
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:45,335
Mr. Bowen.

77
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:46,455
Mr. Yuthaichai,

78
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:48,695
this is Nicha, my subordinate.

79
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,455
Nicha, this is Mr. Yuthaichai.

80
00:05:51,535 --> 00:05:54,255
He's the chairman
of this upcoming auction

81
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:56,735
and Miss Sichun's husband.

82
00:05:57,335 --> 00:05:59,255
He's from the Zaiyongdanacai Group.

83
00:05:59,975 --> 00:06:01,015
Most importantly,

84
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:04,695
Mr. Yuthaichai is a prominent figure
in the business.

85
00:06:04,735 --> 00:06:06,735
We have a lot to learn from him.

86
00:06:08,015 --> 00:06:09,935
You flatter me, Mr. Bowen.

87
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:13,615
I didn't expect you

88
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:15,215
to have such a glamorous gem.

89
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:16,815
And that explains

90
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:18,375
why you bring her along.

91
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:19,735
Of course, I must.

92
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,335
Because Nicha attends the event

93
00:06:21,935 --> 00:06:24,055
as my girlfriend.

94
00:06:29,175 --> 00:06:32,535
If so, Miss Nicha and Mr. Bowen,
please enjoy.

95
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:36,295
Tomorrow is the opening day
of the jewelry auction.

96
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:36,855
Yes.

97
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,095
I'm afraid that the preparation
might be lacking.

98
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:42,015
Because this is the greatest event
in recent years.

99
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:42,855
I know.

100
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:43,575
Well.

101
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:44,775
Please call me at any time

102
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:46,335
if you need help.

103
00:06:48,255 --> 00:06:49,255
Please don't let us keep you.

104
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:51,335
Thank you.

105
00:06:57,695 --> 00:06:58,535
Coach.

106
00:06:58,535 --> 00:06:59,255
Yes?

107
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:00,735
Yuthaichai has left.

108
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:01,815
I know.

109
00:07:07,815 --> 00:07:08,655
Well,

110
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:11,855
is there anything I need to know
about Yuthaichai?

111
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,935
Last night,
while I was investigating him,

112
00:07:15,015 --> 00:07:17,575
he was talking
with someone named, Songticha.

113
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:20,775
He's the president of
the Gemstone Weaving Association.

114
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:23,295
And I caught some information.

115
00:07:26,815 --> 00:07:27,455
What's your deal?

116
00:07:27,455 --> 00:07:30,135
Sorry, I'm truly sorry.

117
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,295
Let me wipe for you. I'm sorry.

118
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:34,335
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:34,815 --> 00:07:36,215
Here, boy.

120
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,375
Come over here.

121
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:38,295
Give me a massage.

122
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:39,255
Come on.

123
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:42,535
Put the cloth aside
and give me a massage.

124
00:07:42,615 --> 00:07:43,615
Come here.

125
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:54,375
(Santicha, President of Gemstone Weaving Association)
You two can leave now.

126
00:08:03,415 --> 00:08:04,295
President Zhang.

127
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:06,895
You can rest assured about this matter.

128
00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:09,815
(Mr. Zhang, businessman)
Although Xin has dead,

129
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:11,255
however,

130
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:13,415
our business will continue as usual.

131
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:17,095
But I heard that the police
had started to look into Xin's death.

132
00:08:18,735 --> 00:08:20,495
Will they trace to us?

133
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:22,255
No.

134
00:08:23,015 --> 00:08:24,455
Those stupid police officers

135
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:27,015
are still cornered in the investigation
of the Zaiyongdanacai family's account.

136
00:08:27,735 --> 00:08:30,535
However, as a sign of good faith,

137
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,895
I'll only take five percent of
the commission from the money laundered

138
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:37,975
in this event.

139
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:42,335
Why did you ask me here for

140
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:44,055
today?

141
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:47,855
Mr. Songticha, could you please
explain this to the president?

142
00:08:48,255 --> 00:08:49,695
I'll, Mr. Yuthaichai.

143
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:51,495
Here's the thing.

144
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:55,015
I'm the president
of the jewelry association.

145
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:58,055
If I set my sights on
a particular piece of jewelry,

146
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,375
the price of that jewelry
naturally soars.

147
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:01,775
This time,

148
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:06,775
a ruby weighs 24.70 carats
caught my attention.

149
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:10,975
I've had a diamond-cutting center
to polish the ruby

150
00:09:11,055 --> 00:09:13,295
and fabricated
its historical background.

151
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:15,855
All we have to do

152
00:09:15,895 --> 00:09:19,255
is to bid for the piece with your money

153
00:09:19,335 --> 00:09:20,935
Mr. Yudachai will handle this.

154
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:23,775
Next,

155
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:27,735
I'll let Mr. Yuthaichai win the bid.

156
00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:29,215
As for the rest,

157
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:33,535
you just have to wait for the money
to turn into a legitimate income.

158
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,335
I can't wait to see it.

159
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:38,735
No problem, President.

160
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:50,775
Isn't this money laundering?

161
00:09:51,695 --> 00:09:52,815
Do you still remember

162
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:54,815
what Ning said in the meeting room?

163
00:09:56,935 --> 00:10:01,175
I've checked the transactions between
the Zaiyongdanacai family and Miss Xin.

164
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:04,735
I found that Ms. Jindapa has transferred
tens of millions to Miss Xin.

165
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:07,335
But the money disappeared.

166
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:10,135
The money Ms. Jindapa transferred

167
00:10:10,455 --> 00:10:12,415
to Xin

168
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:14,535
is currently with Yuthaichai.

169
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,055
And he's laundering the money

170
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:18,135
to turn illicit money
into legitimate income?

171
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:19,015
That's right.

172
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:21,015
I still haven't found out

173
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:23,895
where Xin got that money

174
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:25,215
from

175
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:29,135
and whether her death
is related to the money.

176
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:33,975
In that case, Yuthaichai
is the first suspect.

177
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:34,815
Correct.

178
00:10:36,055 --> 00:10:37,415
Let's go and check in first.

179
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:41,335
We need to talk in detail
about Yuthaichai.

180
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:43,055
All right.

181
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,615
It's you.

182
00:11:06,335 --> 00:11:07,175
(Kan, Pla's friend in senior high school)
What's your relationship

183
00:11:07,175 --> 00:11:08,135
(Kan, Pla's friend in senior high school)

184
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,055
(Kan, Pla's friend in senior high school)
with him?

185
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:12,095
I'm his girlfriend.

186
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:13,455
Girlfriend?

187
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:17,535
I can't breathe now.

188
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,615
Didn't you say you wouldn't date girls
in this lifetime?

189
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:23,135
And that's the reason
you broke up with me.

190
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,415
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:25,575
But I have plans later.

192
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:27,215
Let's meet some other time.

193
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:28,935
Wait.

194
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:31,375
You liar.

195
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:32,695
Jerk.

196
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:33,775
Gan.

197
00:11:34,175 --> 00:11:34,895
Listen.

198
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:35,935
We'd never been together before.

199
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:37,575
Nothing has happened between us.

200
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:40,095
This is a public place.
Keep your voice down.

201
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,375
Are you getting married soon?

202
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:46,415
Congratulations.

203
00:11:48,495 --> 00:11:49,415
Dear.

204
00:11:49,495 --> 00:11:51,095
Shall we go?

205
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:58,135
Hey.

206
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,255
Take this.

207
00:12:21,095 --> 00:12:23,055
(Thai National ID Card. Miss Nicha)

208
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,975
Who's that?

209
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:27,895
Nicha?

210
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:29,655
Your alias.

211
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:31,375
I mean

212
00:12:31,455 --> 00:12:32,535
that woman named Gan.

213
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:34,455
Was she your girlfriend?

214
00:12:35,335 --> 00:12:36,775
It has nothing to do with work.

215
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:38,615
You don't need to know.

216
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:46,135
So, we're not getting away with this

217
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:48,615
until I answer you?

218
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:50,015
Yes.

219
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,895
I'm just curious.

220
00:12:57,975 --> 00:13:00,935
Gan was my friend
in secondary school back then.

221
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:03,055
When we met again,

222
00:13:03,135 --> 00:13:04,335
she said she liked me,

223
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:06,335
but I didn't.

224
00:13:06,455 --> 00:13:09,695
She requested me
to date her for one day.

225
00:13:10,535 --> 00:13:12,855
I said yes as I thought
there was nothing to lose.

226
00:13:13,655 --> 00:13:16,495
But I didn't expect
that she couldn't move on

227
00:13:17,135 --> 00:13:19,455
and was still hung up on me.

228
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,735
So, I made up an excuse

229
00:13:22,015 --> 00:13:23,335
and told her
that I never thought of dating.

230
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,455
Only then she gave up.

231
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:27,695
Until

232
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:30,495
she saw us together today?

233
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:31,295
Yes.

234
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:33,255
Any problem?

235
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:36,015
No.

236
00:13:39,855 --> 00:13:41,215
I'm just surprised

237
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:46,175
that you have a history with her.

238
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,215
Yeah.

239
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:49,895
I'm a person, not a robot.

240
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:51,535
Unlike you,

241
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,895
an emotionless cold-blood person.

242
00:13:57,015 --> 00:13:58,175
I do have feelings.

243
00:13:58,535 --> 00:13:59,815
I'm just slow to warm up.

244
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:01,975
Wasu often says that about me.

245
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:06,695
Well, jokes aside.

246
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:10,895
In the upcoming jewelry auction,

247
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:15,295
only married couples
can participate in it.

248
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:17,335
So, to pass ourselves off a couple,

249
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:18,455
I hope

250
00:14:18,895 --> 00:14:20,975
you can call me something else.

251
00:14:23,935 --> 00:14:25,855
You can call me "Wen."

252
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:26,615
Okay.

253
00:14:27,615 --> 00:14:28,415
You...

254
00:14:29,055 --> 00:14:32,135
Don't you have any questions like
"Why Wen"?

255
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:35,295
It's normal for us

256
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,175
to use affectionate terms

257
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:39,455
since we're pretending to be lovers.

258
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,135
We're going to bug them this time.

259
00:14:43,735 --> 00:14:45,255
This is the thing you need.

260
00:14:45,295 --> 00:14:46,735
Take them with you wherever you go.

261
00:15:03,095 --> 00:15:05,695
I'm sorry to disturb you.

262
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:14,255
What's the matter?

263
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:18,255
I'm sorry to barge in just now.

264
00:15:18,655 --> 00:15:21,215
I forgot to give you
the invitation card.

265
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:27,775
Here you go.

266
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,015
Thank you.

267
00:15:30,215 --> 00:15:31,695
Who's there, Wen?

268
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:37,175
Mr. Yuthaichai.

269
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:40,615
Well,

270
00:15:41,015 --> 00:15:42,335
you guys talk.

271
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:43,695
I'll go inside.

272
00:15:45,055 --> 00:15:45,775
Thanks.

273
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:54,935
I'm sorry about that.

274
00:15:58,335 --> 00:15:59,135
It's okay.

275
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:02,735
Well, I've put you in the VIP seats.

276
00:16:03,615 --> 00:16:04,775
Well,

277
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,535
enjoy.

278
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:08,375
Thanks.

279
00:16:35,055 --> 00:16:35,735
How's my performance?

280
00:16:37,975 --> 00:16:38,735
Not bad.

281
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,535
I think Yuthaichai

282
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:47,735
keeps testing me.

283
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:50,335
We ought to be careful later.

284
00:16:51,655 --> 00:16:52,535
Yes, sir.

285
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:03,214
Oh, right.

286
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,335
Mr. Bowen and Miss Nicha

287
00:17:05,335 --> 00:17:07,975
are the VIPs who just joined
two weeks ago, right?

288
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:10,175
Yes.

289
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:12,295
Is there something wrong, boss?

290
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:14,655
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:16,015
Come on, boy.

292
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:17,735
I'm not sure.

293
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:19,095
Something isn't right.

294
00:17:20,335 --> 00:17:22,255
Based on what I found about them,

295
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:24,295
they have a clean background.

296
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,375
Are you worried that they might
have something up their sleeves?

297
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:31,095
Continue to look them up.

298
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:34,055
Inform me if you find anything.

299
00:17:34,535 --> 00:17:37,055
Make sure this high-valued auction
goes off without a hitch.

300
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:40,055
Keep an eye on them.

301
00:17:40,535 --> 00:17:41,335
Yes.

302
00:17:42,015 --> 00:17:44,175
I think I have seen them with guns.

303
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:47,735
But many businessmen
carry guns these days,

304
00:17:48,095 --> 00:17:49,815
especially those
from out of the capital.

305
00:17:50,415 --> 00:17:51,375
On top of that,

306
00:17:51,815 --> 00:17:53,575
there's a shooting range nearby here.

307
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:00,375
- Keep an eye on them.
- Okay.

308
00:18:01,095 --> 00:18:01,695
Go ahead.

309
00:18:01,775 --> 00:18:02,535
Yes.

310
00:18:11,975 --> 00:18:15,375
We're going to take statements
from all related people.

311
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,815
Are you ready?

312
00:18:18,415 --> 00:18:21,255
Then, please proceed in order.

313
00:18:22,695 --> 00:18:25,015
Where's Mr. Yuthaichai,
Miss Sichun's husband?

314
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:31,535
He went to attend a jewelry exhibition
seminar in Ratchaburi.

315
00:18:31,935 --> 00:18:33,855
But I have a question.

316
00:18:35,175 --> 00:18:37,255
You've already questioned us.

317
00:18:38,015 --> 00:18:38,935
What else do you want to know?

318
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:41,535
We have some questions
needed to be answered.

319
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:43,575
This is the police procedure.

320
00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:45,815
I'm sorry to trouble you with this.

321
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:53,215
Well, this way, please.

322
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:13,655
Hello.

323
00:19:14,015 --> 00:19:14,935
(Hello, Vita.)

324
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,895
We're taking statements at the residence
of the Zaiyongdanacai family.

325
00:19:17,975 --> 00:19:20,175
But Mr. Yuthaichai isn't here.

326
00:19:20,255 --> 00:19:21,495
(He went to Na'en Resort for a seminar.)

327
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:22,775
- Did you see...
- Excuse me.

328
00:19:26,935 --> 00:19:28,175
What a coincidence.

329
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:30,295
Are you here for a walk?

330
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,255
I'm waiting for Wen.

331
00:19:32,695 --> 00:19:34,575
Nicha? Wen?

332
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:36,095
Vita.

333
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:39,215
I heard about Xin's incident.

334
00:19:39,295 --> 00:19:40,855
She's your family member.

335
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:43,935
My condolences.

336
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:45,575
Thank you.

337
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:48,015
The whole family is upset about that

338
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:51,135
and we hope the murderer
can be brought to justice soon

339
00:19:51,535 --> 00:19:52,535
so that Xin can rest in peace.

340
00:19:53,935 --> 00:19:55,615
Scars are all over her body.

341
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,695
The murderer is so cruel.

342
00:19:57,775 --> 00:19:58,815
That's ridiculous.

343
00:20:00,175 --> 00:20:02,615
I can understand your feelings well.

344
00:20:03,575 --> 00:20:06,415
When was the last time you saw Miss Xin?

345
00:20:08,255 --> 00:20:10,215
Is this an interrogation?

346
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:11,055
Why

347
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,615
does your question sound strange?

348
00:20:12,695 --> 00:20:13,495
Nicha.

349
00:20:14,575 --> 00:20:15,535
What are you doing here?

350
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:16,935
Hey, Mr. Yuthaichai.

351
00:20:17,735 --> 00:20:19,735
Miss Nicha is inquisitive.

352
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:23,215
If her question has offended you,

353
00:20:23,295 --> 00:20:24,175
please forgive her.

354
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:26,095
She's been watching this news recently.

355
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:28,455
Besides, she admires Miss Xin very much.

356
00:20:31,335 --> 00:20:33,135
Please answer me, Mr. Yuthaichai.

357
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:34,175
That's enough, Nicha.

358
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,135
We should let Mr. Yudachai rest.

359
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,895
I apologize.

360
00:20:40,975 --> 00:20:42,775
I've gone overboard.

361
00:20:43,935 --> 00:20:44,775
It's fine.

362
00:20:44,855 --> 00:20:46,455
We shall talk next time.

363
00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:48,575
I'll get going, then.

364
00:20:51,975 --> 00:20:52,935
What were you doing?

365
00:20:59,095 --> 00:21:02,935
Mr. Yuthaichai seems suspicious.

366
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:04,655
But I couldn't really say.

367
00:21:05,415 --> 00:21:08,375
But the more suspicious one is you.

368
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:12,535
No one would start a conversation
with a deceased.

369
00:21:12,615 --> 00:21:14,215
And you texted me

370
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:16,415
saying you were out for a walk
to find clues.

371
00:21:17,935 --> 00:21:20,575
But I caught you questioning someone.

372
00:21:22,495 --> 00:21:23,655
I'm very sorry.

373
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,655
I didn't think it through.

374
00:21:28,215 --> 00:21:30,455
Although I find him suspicious,

375
00:21:30,535 --> 00:21:33,175
however, the evidence about
the day of the crime we have

376
00:21:33,255 --> 00:21:35,055
proved that Yuthaichai wasn't there.

377
00:21:36,415 --> 00:21:37,615
I don't know what I should do

378
00:21:38,815 --> 00:21:40,015
or maybe I'm too hasty.

379
00:21:42,855 --> 00:21:44,855
Do you pick at your fingernails
whenever you're thinking?

380
00:21:47,695 --> 00:21:48,535
Yes.

381
00:21:49,815 --> 00:21:51,375
I'll change this.

382
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:58,255
Don't let anyone notice this habit.

383
00:21:58,335 --> 00:21:59,775
They will make use of this.

384
00:22:04,775 --> 00:22:07,095
If he's the one we're looking for,

385
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:10,775
then his alibi isn't perfect.

386
00:22:11,535 --> 00:22:13,495
In other words, there must be flaws.

387
00:22:14,455 --> 00:22:15,775
Have you figured something out?

388
00:22:15,855 --> 00:22:18,455
If the evidence he rendered is forged,

389
00:22:18,535 --> 00:22:20,575
it means that something's wrong
with the airline.

390
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:22,495
I'll inform Da and Ming

391
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:23,815
to go to the airline

392
00:22:24,335 --> 00:22:27,655
to look up all the information
of Yuthaichai's flights.

393
00:22:28,175 --> 00:22:29,055
What about me?

394
00:22:30,135 --> 00:22:31,495
Before anything is found,

395
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:32,615
you

396
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:35,135
can only observe him secretly.

397
00:22:35,215 --> 00:22:36,695
Don't start any investigation
for the time being.

398
00:22:38,055 --> 00:22:38,895
Okay?

399
00:22:39,575 --> 00:22:40,375
Yes.

400
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:41,535
The event starts tomorrow.

401
00:22:41,855 --> 00:22:42,935
So today,

402
00:22:44,335 --> 00:22:46,655
we just need to observe the participants

403
00:22:46,735 --> 00:22:47,535
and that's all.

404
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:49,175
Yes.

405
00:22:58,695 --> 00:22:59,735
Where are you going, Coach?

406
00:23:00,175 --> 00:23:00,935
Go jogging.

407
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:06,575
I think you need some exercise too.

408
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:09,255
You have to maintain discipline

409
00:23:09,895 --> 00:23:10,935
even when you have an outstation task.

410
00:23:12,335 --> 00:23:13,015
Yes.

411
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,135
See you this evening.

412
00:23:21,615 --> 00:23:22,415
Yes.

413
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:45,215
Da.

414
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:48,935
Did Captain seek assistance
from the local police at Ratchaburi?

415
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,335
No, just the two of them.

416
00:23:51,775 --> 00:23:54,895
Normally, Captain
keeps his action confidential.

417
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,295
Besides, Ratchaburi is his spot.

418
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:57,975
Really?

419
00:23:58,055 --> 00:23:59,415
Did they work separately?

420
00:23:59,495 --> 00:24:01,215
When I called Vita,

421
00:24:01,335 --> 00:24:04,295
I heard names like Bowen or Wen.

422
00:24:05,775 --> 00:24:07,055
Bowen is Captain.

423
00:24:07,135 --> 00:24:09,335
It's his undercover name,

424
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:10,455
and Wen is the nickname.

425
00:24:12,095 --> 00:24:14,695
Hello, revered officers.

426
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:16,735
I don't think you're expected today.

427
00:24:17,655 --> 00:24:21,135
I came here to inquire about
the progress of Miss Xin's case.

428
00:24:21,215 --> 00:24:22,415
If you're here for that...

429
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:23,335
What do you want?

430
00:24:23,815 --> 00:24:26,335
I only want to hear it from Vita.

431
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:28,055
You're here for Vita,

432
00:24:28,055 --> 00:24:28,575
Yes.

433
00:24:28,575 --> 00:24:29,175
aren't you?

434
00:24:29,255 --> 00:24:30,015
I can wait for her.

435
00:24:30,495 --> 00:24:31,935
You're here just to wait for Vita?

436
00:24:31,935 --> 00:24:32,375
Yes.

437
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:33,095
No problem.

438
00:24:33,175 --> 00:24:34,335
As a businessman,

439
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:37,895
I have one whole day to wait for her.

440
00:24:39,415 --> 00:24:40,455
Are you sure?

441
00:24:40,535 --> 00:24:41,135
Yes.

442
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:42,815
I'm afraid it'll be a long wait.

443
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:44,095
About two...

444
00:24:44,175 --> 00:24:44,895
to three

445
00:24:44,975 --> 00:24:45,895
days.

446
00:24:47,415 --> 00:24:48,215
Why?

447
00:24:48,295 --> 00:24:50,135
Unfortunately, she went out
for Miss Xin's case.

448
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:51,375
- So...
- Where's she?

449
00:24:51,935 --> 00:24:53,615
Captain told us not to tell.

450
00:24:53,695 --> 00:24:55,015
They went together.

451
00:24:55,095 --> 00:24:55,695
Together.

452
00:24:55,775 --> 00:24:56,735
Together.

453
00:24:56,815 --> 00:24:57,855
And they'll stay in one room.

454
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:00,295
Don't tell me

455
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,255
they're together means...

456
00:25:01,455 --> 00:25:03,695
Don't tell you? Well, we won't tell you.

457
00:25:03,775 --> 00:25:04,575
We won't tell.

458
00:25:05,775 --> 00:25:08,055
One man's meat is another man's poison.

459
00:25:10,415 --> 00:25:11,255
How pathetic.

460
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:12,375
Well done.

461
00:25:14,975 --> 00:25:18,495
The one who went, "Surprise!"

462
00:25:18,855 --> 00:25:19,735
What did he come here for?

463
00:25:19,815 --> 00:25:21,615
- No idea.
- No idea.

464
00:25:22,735 --> 00:25:23,575
Ignore him.

465
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:24,695
Ming, Da.

466
00:25:25,055 --> 00:25:26,655
Go to the airline

467
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:30,015
to look up all the flights
Yuthaichai took

468
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,975
and find out where he was
on the night of the incident.

469
00:25:34,095 --> 00:25:34,575
Ning.

470
00:25:34,655 --> 00:25:35,255
Yes.

471
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:36,255
Come with me.

472
00:25:36,815 --> 00:25:37,655
What are you laughing about?

473
00:25:38,655 --> 00:25:39,255
Go to work.

474
00:25:39,335 --> 00:25:40,415
Let's go.

475
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:41,215
Yes.

476
00:25:52,975 --> 00:25:54,695
Sir, you can stop here.

477
00:25:57,855 --> 00:25:58,455
Grandma Lek.

478
00:25:58,535 --> 00:25:59,375
Pla.

479
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:01,095
Are you all right?

480
00:26:01,735 --> 00:26:02,655
I'm good.

481
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:03,895
I miss you very much.

482
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:10,415
Who's there?

483
00:26:22,175 --> 00:26:23,535
Why are you here?

484
00:26:24,855 --> 00:26:26,135
Give me back the phone.

485
00:26:27,135 --> 00:26:27,855
What phone?

486
00:26:34,935 --> 00:26:36,175
You should use the tracking device
in the case,

487
00:26:36,255 --> 00:26:37,775
not put it in my back.

488
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:39,135
What's wrong with you?

489
00:26:39,535 --> 00:26:41,935
You said you went jogging

490
00:26:42,015 --> 00:26:43,015
but it turns out you came here.

491
00:26:44,255 --> 00:26:46,095
What are you investigating?

492
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:49,335
Must you know everything?

493
00:26:50,615 --> 00:26:51,655
You should go back to the hotel now.

494
00:26:52,135 --> 00:26:53,455
Grandma, let's go inside.

495
00:26:53,975 --> 00:26:55,175
Are you here with your girlfriend?

496
00:26:55,575 --> 00:26:56,655
- No.
- No.

497
00:26:59,215 --> 00:27:00,895
Let's go inside.

498
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:02,735
Vita, come on in.

499
00:27:04,455 --> 00:27:05,255
Come on, girl.

500
00:27:09,655 --> 00:27:10,495
Grandma.

501
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:13,575
I wouldn't have known that you were sick

502
00:27:14,095 --> 00:27:14,975
if Beibo hadn't told me.

503
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:17,855
Don't worry.

504
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:21,495
I'm all good. Just a cold.

505
00:27:21,895 --> 00:27:24,735
You don't have to come here.
You came last night too.

506
00:27:24,815 --> 00:27:26,855
I must tell Beibo not to phone you,

507
00:27:26,935 --> 00:27:29,775
she has disturbed you.

508
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:31,375
Please don't.

509
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:33,015
I planned to come back too.

510
00:27:33,295 --> 00:27:34,615
Because tomorrow is his...

511
00:27:41,135 --> 00:27:43,855
I'm sorry to cause you trouble.

512
00:27:43,935 --> 00:27:45,535
Not at all.

513
00:27:45,615 --> 00:27:47,735
You're his wife,
so I see you as my granddaughter.

514
00:27:47,815 --> 00:27:48,935
- No.
- No, Grandma.

515
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:52,975
She is my teammate.

516
00:27:53,055 --> 00:27:53,935
And his trainee.

517
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,095
If so,

518
00:27:56,935 --> 00:27:58,255
I shall take my leave.

519
00:27:59,735 --> 00:28:00,815
Are you going back so soon?

520
00:28:01,335 --> 00:28:02,335
Yes.

521
00:28:02,415 --> 00:28:03,495
I think

522
00:28:04,295 --> 00:28:07,015
Coach should have his private time.

523
00:28:09,095 --> 00:28:11,015
Wait. Hold on.

524
00:28:11,095 --> 00:28:14,335
This is the first time Pla brought
a girl back.

525
00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:15,935
He hasn't come back home
for a long while.

526
00:28:17,535 --> 00:28:19,815
Just stay here for one night, all right?

527
00:28:20,455 --> 00:28:22,695
Vita, can you stay here
to keep me company?

528
00:28:24,935 --> 00:28:26,735
Grandma, I...

529
00:28:34,455 --> 00:28:37,295
So, the stain on your clothes yesterday
is the color of the dyed cloth?

530
00:28:38,335 --> 00:28:39,775
I thought...

531
00:28:39,855 --> 00:28:40,815
What?

532
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:43,695
Well...

533
00:28:43,775 --> 00:28:45,935
Pla helped me
to dye the cloth yesterday.

534
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:48,015
He has done this many times.

535
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:49,615
Still, he always ended up messy.

536
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:56,855
I'll go and prepare some dishes.

537
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:57,975
My future granddaughter-in-law.

538
00:28:58,055 --> 00:28:58,655
Grandma.

539
00:28:58,735 --> 00:28:59,895
It's not that, Grandma.

540
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:01,655
I'll help you to cook.

541
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,775
By the way, where's Beibo?

542
00:29:04,855 --> 00:29:06,615
School should be over by now, right?

543
00:29:06,695 --> 00:29:08,495
She went camping

544
00:29:08,695 --> 00:29:09,695
and she'll be back tomorrow.

545
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:12,535
She'll be back just in time for the day.

546
00:29:12,935 --> 00:29:13,615
Okay.

547
00:29:15,335 --> 00:29:16,415
Let's go.

548
00:29:35,015 --> 00:29:36,215
(Thai Limited Airways)

549
00:29:38,295 --> 00:29:38,935
Hello.

550
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:43,055
How may I help you?

551
00:29:43,135 --> 00:29:44,855
Could you provide us
with the security-camera footage?

552
00:29:45,295 --> 00:29:46,015
Yes.

553
00:29:46,775 --> 00:29:47,495
Here you go.

554
00:29:47,615 --> 00:29:49,335
Thank you for your cooperation.

555
00:29:49,415 --> 00:29:50,335
You're welcome.

556
00:29:51,575 --> 00:29:52,255
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

557
00:29:53,055 --> 00:29:55,175
We've got the footage.

558
00:29:55,535 --> 00:29:58,175
He did come to retrieve
the flight ticket before departure.

559
00:29:58,735 --> 00:30:00,935
Captain may have mistaken him this time.

560
00:30:03,055 --> 00:30:05,575
I think we should confirm this

561
00:30:05,655 --> 00:30:07,975
with the counter staff or cabin crew.

562
00:30:08,335 --> 00:30:09,375
Agree.

563
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:11,575
You're getting
more meticulous now, Ming.

564
00:30:20,935 --> 00:30:21,935
Grandma.

565
00:30:22,015 --> 00:30:23,375
Wait, let me help you.

566
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:26,495
No, I can do it myself.

567
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,175
You're the guest.
I can't trouble you with this.

568
00:30:29,255 --> 00:30:31,695
But do you mind sleeping on the floor?

569
00:30:32,095 --> 00:30:33,055
What?

570
00:30:33,455 --> 00:30:35,935
I'll take the mattress
to another room for you.

571
00:30:36,015 --> 00:30:37,735
The owner of this room

572
00:30:37,815 --> 00:30:39,295
doesn't like others sleeping here.

573
00:30:40,135 --> 00:30:40,975
Grandma.

574
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:41,655
I...

575
00:30:41,735 --> 00:30:43,295
I'm afraid I can't stay tonight.

576
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,055
I need to go back to the hotel.

577
00:30:45,615 --> 00:30:46,895
Thank you so much, Grandma.

578
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:48,495
I'll put it back for you.

579
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:02,775
This should be the owner
of this room, right?

580
00:31:02,855 --> 00:31:05,895
Yeah, that's my naughty grandson.

581
00:31:06,935 --> 00:31:09,695
He rarely comes back
after he leaves for Bangkok.

582
00:31:14,815 --> 00:31:18,015
It seems that he has wanted to become
a police officer since he was little.

583
00:31:18,815 --> 00:31:20,415
Yes, that's his dream.

584
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:23,935
It's finally come true,
even though it's a bad dream.

585
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,735
I'll go and rustle up
some dessert for you.

586
00:31:29,815 --> 00:31:30,695
Sure.

587
00:31:41,815 --> 00:31:42,975
2015?

588
00:31:43,775 --> 00:31:45,455
Isn't this the year
when Luger's case occurred?

589
00:31:49,335 --> 00:31:50,575
(Closure Report of Luger's Case in 2015
Executed by: Black Lion)

590
00:31:51,295 --> 00:31:53,215
Do you know you're not allowed
to enter this room?

591
00:31:57,495 --> 00:32:00,055
I was helping Grandma to tidy up

592
00:32:00,135 --> 00:32:01,015
and about to come out.

593
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:04,455
Grandma is preparing some dessert.

594
00:32:05,415 --> 00:32:06,895
She asks for your help.

595
00:32:07,695 --> 00:32:08,455
Sure.

596
00:32:18,175 --> 00:32:18,855
This one.

597
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:27,135
I can't recall that.
We had several flight routes that day.

598
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:29,175
I don't really remember anything.

599
00:32:30,135 --> 00:32:31,415
Can I look at the ticket?

600
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,095
Yes, it's our flight.

601
00:32:40,415 --> 00:32:43,815
I was serving in both First Class
and Business Class that day.

602
00:32:44,335 --> 00:32:47,895
No one was in the First Class.

603
00:32:48,335 --> 00:32:49,535
Are you sure?

604
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:50,655
Yes.

605
00:32:51,495 --> 00:32:53,775
Perhaps this passenger bought the ticket

606
00:32:53,855 --> 00:32:57,135
but didn't take the flight
due to something urgent.

607
00:33:00,215 --> 00:33:01,175
If so,

608
00:33:01,255 --> 00:33:03,455
can we check the security camera footage
in the cabin?

609
00:33:03,855 --> 00:33:04,975
I'm sorry.

610
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:08,015
For privacy and safety
of our passengers,

611
00:33:08,295 --> 00:33:10,335
we didn't install cameras.

612
00:33:13,495 --> 00:33:15,655
But the VIP lounge

613
00:33:15,735 --> 00:33:16,895
might have cameras.

614
00:33:17,655 --> 00:33:18,255
Okay.

615
00:33:18,695 --> 00:33:19,775
Thank you.

616
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:20,775
Thank you.

617
00:33:21,975 --> 00:33:22,935
- We're off, then.
- We're off, then.

618
00:33:25,535 --> 00:33:26,255
Ming.

619
00:33:26,695 --> 00:33:29,375
We're going to burn
the midnight oil tonight.

620
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:31,415
Are you ready?

621
00:33:33,495 --> 00:33:34,255
Yes.

622
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:51,535
Frankly, you look good in this.

623
00:33:51,615 --> 00:33:52,735
The color is amazing.

624
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:55,135
Nice.

625
00:33:59,135 --> 00:33:59,775
Thank you.

626
00:34:01,335 --> 00:34:02,895
Grandma prepares this for you.

627
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:04,495
Go and get changed.

628
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:07,175
All right.

629
00:34:15,495 --> 00:34:17,695
The pajamas suit you well.

630
00:34:17,775 --> 00:34:18,575
Look at the color.

631
00:34:19,055 --> 00:34:21,175
Nice. Amazing color.

632
00:34:22,215 --> 00:34:23,015
Thanks a bunch.

633
00:34:24,055 --> 00:34:27,535
But you don't have to praise me
if you didn't mean that.

634
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,335
Vita.

635
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:39,375
Actually,

636
00:34:40,175 --> 00:34:42,175
I know you're curious about
what happened to Badin.

637
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,535
Since you're here now,

638
00:34:47,415 --> 00:34:48,735
why don't you ask?

639
00:34:48,935 --> 00:34:51,415
You should know whose house
this is by now.

640
00:34:52,335 --> 00:34:53,615
Don't you want to ask me something?

641
00:34:58,415 --> 00:34:59,935
Grandma Lek is very kind.

642
00:35:01,455 --> 00:35:03,255
I can sense that you're relaxed

643
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,255
in this place.

644
00:35:07,295 --> 00:35:09,015
If this is your wound,

645
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,295
I won't press you any harder.

646
00:35:17,335 --> 00:35:18,655
Tomorrow, I'll go and visit Badin.

647
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,375
Do you want to come with me?

648
00:35:22,655 --> 00:35:23,575
Can I?

649
00:35:26,615 --> 00:35:28,335
Sleep early.

650
00:35:29,095 --> 00:35:30,415
You'll sleep upstairs.

651
00:35:30,935 --> 00:35:31,975
I'll sleep on the sofa.

652
00:35:33,855 --> 00:35:34,735
Yes, Coach.

653
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:58,575
Badin.

654
00:35:58,855 --> 00:36:00,055
I want to break into it and seize him.

655
00:36:00,055 --> 00:36:00,895
It might be a trap.

656
00:36:01,735 --> 00:36:02,815
Badin!

657
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:05,015
Run!

658
00:36:12,175 --> 00:36:12,735
No.

659
00:36:15,135 --> 00:36:15,975
Don't go in.

660
00:36:18,775 --> 00:36:19,495
Badin!

661
00:36:24,775 --> 00:36:25,415
No.

662
00:36:27,015 --> 00:36:27,735
Be patient.

663
00:36:30,695 --> 00:36:31,495
Badin.

664
00:36:31,575 --> 00:36:32,055
Badin.

665
00:36:32,135 --> 00:36:32,615
Coach.

666
00:36:32,695 --> 00:36:33,295
No.

667
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:34,135
Coach.

668
00:36:34,215 --> 00:36:34,935
Badin.

669
00:36:35,015 --> 00:36:35,775
Don't go in.

670
00:36:35,855 --> 00:36:36,735
I said don't go in.

671
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:38,535
No. No!

672
00:36:39,135 --> 00:36:40,095
Coach.

673
00:37:28,855 --> 00:37:30,495
Just like what Captain predicted.

674
00:37:31,175 --> 00:37:33,375
He didn't take the flight.
He left through the exit in the lounge.

675
00:38:01,215 --> 00:38:02,535
(Black Lion)

676
00:38:04,175 --> 00:38:05,975
(Luger)

677
00:38:22,015 --> 00:38:25,535
I was planning to seek your guidance
about jewelry.

678
00:38:26,215 --> 00:38:27,935
Mr. Yuthaichai, did you come here alone?

679
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:30,095
I always have many questions

680
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:32,335
for someone I'm interested in.

681
00:38:32,655 --> 00:38:35,215
It's a female designer called Apinya.

682
00:38:35,295 --> 00:38:36,775
She usually works overseas.

683
00:38:36,855 --> 00:38:38,535
Can you help me to take a look?

684
00:38:38,615 --> 00:38:41,135
Does this mean I've fallen prey
to the scam now?

685
00:38:41,815 --> 00:38:43,455
The bid begins.

686
00:38:43,535 --> 00:38:45,575
This is how they launder money.

687
00:38:45,815 --> 00:38:49,495
They transfer the auction fund
to Yuthaichai's company account.

688
00:38:49,575 --> 00:38:51,095
After that, they'll transfer it
to the mastermind.
