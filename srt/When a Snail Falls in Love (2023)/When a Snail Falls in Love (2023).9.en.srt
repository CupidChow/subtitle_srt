4
00:01:41,192 --> 00:01:44,072
(Arrest Warrant)

5
00:01:53,512 --> 00:01:54,192
Fine.

6
00:01:56,272 --> 00:01:57,152
Xin and I

7
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,352
do have an affair.

8
00:02:00,512 --> 00:02:02,832
Our relationship has reached this point.

9
00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:05,232
Can't you feel my sincerity?

10
00:02:06,832 --> 00:02:07,752
Xin,

11
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:09,752
you see.

12
00:02:10,192 --> 00:02:13,232
I can help you transfer
Zaiyongdanacai Group's assets.

13
00:02:13,672 --> 00:02:15,392
In their eyes,

14
00:02:15,472 --> 00:02:17,112
I'm just a useful outsider,
nothing more.

15
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:22,552
Except for the agreed 30% ownership,

16
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:24,912
I have one more request.

17
00:02:25,032 --> 00:02:25,912
What request?

18
00:02:37,672 --> 00:02:38,592
What my request is, you ask?

19
00:02:40,272 --> 00:02:41,232
I hope

20
00:02:41,352 --> 00:02:42,872
our relationship

21
00:02:43,392 --> 00:02:44,792
can continue like this.

22
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:52,552
Xin's goal is to seek revenge
for her father

23
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:54,512
and regain her rightful ownership
of the company.

24
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:56,272
So she asked me to collaborate with her.

25
00:02:56,352 --> 00:02:58,472
Gradually, our relationship changed

26
00:02:58,952 --> 00:03:00,752
from business partners

27
00:03:01,032 --> 00:03:01,872
to lovers.

28
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,832
Until one day,

29
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:06,872
our plan had a flaw.

30
00:03:07,872 --> 00:03:09,952
We could face a huge economic crisis.

31
00:03:10,392 --> 00:03:12,072
So Xin asked me to meet her,

32
00:03:13,312 --> 00:03:14,552
which was the same night

33
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:17,272
she was murdered.

34
00:03:32,832 --> 00:03:35,232
I was terrified when I saw her body.

35
00:03:35,312 --> 00:03:36,632
I didn't know who the killer was.

36
00:03:41,232 --> 00:03:41,872
But

37
00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:44,352
at that moment, I was afraid
of being suspected as the murderer.

38
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:48,472
So I quickly packed up all the items
that could prove I stayed there

39
00:03:48,552 --> 00:03:49,232
and moved them out.

40
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:54,912
What about that bath towel?

41
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:00,632
I used that bath towel

42
00:04:01,552 --> 00:04:03,152
to cover Xin's body.

43
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:27,352
Since you moved out
all your personal items,

44
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:30,872
why didn't you make a police report?

45
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:34,072
At that time, I was at a loss.

46
00:04:34,352 --> 00:04:35,792
I was scared and heartbroken.

47
00:04:35,872 --> 00:04:36,352
My

48
00:04:36,432 --> 00:04:37,392
thoughts were in chaos.

49
00:04:37,552 --> 00:04:38,672
I was afraid

50
00:04:38,752 --> 00:04:41,032
that our affair

51
00:04:41,512 --> 00:04:42,432
would be exposed.

52
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:46,072
And the plan
to steal the company's assets

53
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,072
would be revealed too.

54
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:49,952
I didn't want to live
a shattered life, get it?

55
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:55,312
Actually,

56
00:04:55,632 --> 00:04:57,352
this jewelry auction

57
00:04:57,432 --> 00:04:59,112
was our final plan.

58
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:01,152
Xin and I planned

59
00:05:01,632 --> 00:05:03,352
to launder money through this auction

60
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:04,472
and transfer the company's assets.

61
00:05:04,552 --> 00:05:05,272
That was going

62
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:06,752
to be the last one and it would be over.

63
00:05:08,832 --> 00:05:09,872
But I didn't expect

64
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:12,792
it would turn out like this.

65
00:05:15,392 --> 00:05:16,312
Excuse me, sir.

66
00:05:16,672 --> 00:05:17,392
What is it?

67
00:05:19,872 --> 00:05:21,552
Someone turned in and confessed to being

68
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:23,152
the killer in Xin's case.

69
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:31,992
I actually knew for some time that

70
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:35,072
Yu and that wretched Xin had an affair.

71
00:05:36,072 --> 00:05:37,952
Please show respect for the deceased.

72
00:05:38,032 --> 00:05:38,992
It was that wretch

73
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,472
who didn't respect me and my family.

74
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:43,832
My father kindly took her in
and raised her.

75
00:05:43,912 --> 00:05:45,832
But she turned against us
and had an affair with Yu.

76
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:48,872
So is your motive for murder

77
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:51,072
out of jealousy?

78
00:05:51,152 --> 00:05:52,672
Who can stand

79
00:05:53,232 --> 00:05:54,472
a vicious woman like her?

80
00:05:55,112 --> 00:05:58,232
Not only did she want
to ruin the family business,

81
00:05:58,312 --> 00:06:00,832
but she was also engaged
in dirty activities on the back.

82
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:04,632
Then could you please describe

83
00:06:04,992 --> 00:06:08,232
how you killed the victim?

84
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:11,552
This testimony will be used in court.

85
00:06:11,912 --> 00:06:13,872
Or would you like to call a lawyer
to be present?

86
00:06:13,952 --> 00:06:16,232
It's okay. Just go ahead and ask.

87
00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:20,392
Please describe the process
of the incident on the day it happened.

88
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:32,192
Da,

89
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:32,832
Yes, sir.

90
00:06:33,552 --> 00:06:35,432
I want you to detain Ms. Sichun.

91
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:38,152
Arrest her for intentional homicide.

92
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,792
After that, release Mr. Yuthaichai.

93
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:41,392
Yes, sir.

94
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:42,712
Release the guilty person?

95
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:46,072
However, we can convict him with
evidence of his money laundering.

96
00:06:47,632 --> 00:06:49,832
Coach, you don't believe in Ms. Sichun.

97
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:52,912
That's why you want to
use Yuthaichai as bait

98
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:55,672
in order to obtain more clues.

99
00:06:56,712 --> 00:06:58,792
Today, I'll write the case report.

100
00:06:59,312 --> 00:06:59,992
Da,

101
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:02,872
go and release Yuthaichai.

102
00:07:02,952 --> 00:07:05,552
Just say we don't have enough evidence
to arrest him.

103
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:07,352
So we're letting him go for now.

104
00:07:07,432 --> 00:07:11,352
But we need to send one or two guys
to keep an eye on him.

105
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:12,192
Yes, sir.

106
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:49,632
I want to thank you

107
00:07:50,272 --> 00:07:53,472
for cracking the case and also

108
00:07:57,552 --> 00:07:59,632
for the things you've done for Xin.

109
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:10,872
I'm fine.

110
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:27,152
We overlook something.

111
00:08:27,232 --> 00:08:28,112
Wasu.

112
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:29,432
I need to go out for a moment.

113
00:08:46,632 --> 00:08:47,272
Coach?

114
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:49,712
You came later than I expected, Vita.

115
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:53,272
Ming wasn't convinced by me.

116
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:55,232
But she accepted my decision.

117
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:56,672
But she didn't act.

118
00:08:57,552 --> 00:08:58,232
As for you,

119
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:01,112
you didn't believe your mentor
and your superior.

120
00:09:01,672 --> 00:09:03,472
You only believe
in the doubts in your heart.

121
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:06,392
That's what brought you here.

122
00:09:09,912 --> 00:09:10,912
That's your strength.

123
00:09:13,432 --> 00:09:14,512
Don't just stand there.

124
00:09:15,192 --> 00:09:15,912
Come inside quickly.

125
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:25,632
Let's start a new round
of investigation.

126
00:09:26,872 --> 00:09:28,672
We'll begin with the crime scene.

127
00:09:38,952 --> 00:09:41,512
According to the statement
Ms. Sichun's provided,

128
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:44,352
she said she forced open
the front door lock.

129
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:47,312
When Xin heard the noise,

130
00:09:47,912 --> 00:09:49,432
she came down the stairs.

131
00:09:50,152 --> 00:09:51,752
(She was wearing pajamas at that time.)

132
00:10:05,032 --> 00:10:05,872
You wretch.

133
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:07,952
Why did you seduce my husband?

134
00:10:08,392 --> 00:10:09,272
What are you trying to do?

135
00:10:09,872 --> 00:10:10,832
You wicked woman.

136
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:16,232
(None of Ms. Sichun's slashes hit
any vital points.)

137
00:10:16,312 --> 00:10:17,952
The first injury was on the arm.

138
00:10:18,472 --> 00:10:20,712
Xin should have instinctively raised
her arm in self-defense.

139
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:22,032
The next injuries

140
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:23,832
appeared on the neck

141
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:25,512
and shoulder.

142
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:27,512
(They seemed more like slashes
than stabbing injuries.)

143
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:30,512
Now let's look at the characteristics
of Ms. Sichun's knife.

144
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:32,792
The way she swung the knife
would make it difficult for the victim

145
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:34,272
to be fatally wounded.

146
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,152
But it could make her fall.

147
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:39,912
But according to Ms. Sichun,

148
00:10:39,992 --> 00:10:42,832
when she saw Xin fall
and plead for help,

149
00:10:43,872 --> 00:10:45,672
she felt there was no turning back.

150
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:49,072
She went from swinging the knife
to stabbing her.

151
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:52,712
She deliberately stabbed Xin repeatedly

152
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:54,872
until she died.

153
00:10:57,992 --> 00:10:59,512
After Xin died,

154
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:03,992
Ms. Sichun picked up Xin's phone

155
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,392
and sent a message to Sen.

156
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:09,072
Her statement ends here.

157
00:11:18,872 --> 00:11:22,032
One contradiction with the testimony
is the depth of the wounds.

158
00:11:22,912 --> 00:11:26,832
If one person was wielding a knife
and the other one was running,

159
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:29,072
the wounds should have varying depths.

160
00:11:29,152 --> 00:11:31,432
But the wounds on Xin's body

161
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:33,752
have consistent depths.

162
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:36,232
Unless she didn't dodge.

163
00:11:36,712 --> 00:11:37,952
Are the depths consistent?

164
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:40,592
Could it be that Xin was restrained

165
00:11:41,712 --> 00:11:43,192
and unable to avoid them?

166
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:47,232
Could it be that Yuthaichai and Ms. Sichun
worked together?

167
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:48,552
There is a possibility.

168
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,792
We need to go back
to the motive of the murder.

169
00:11:54,272 --> 00:11:57,832
Based on the statements Da and Ming got
from the Zaiyongdanacai family members,

170
00:11:58,472 --> 00:11:59,872
everyone believes

171
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:05,352
Xin and her lover conspired to destroy
the Zaiyongdanacai family business.

172
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:07,232
If it weren't for Xin's death,

173
00:12:07,312 --> 00:12:09,392
their plan would have continued.

174
00:12:12,472 --> 00:12:14,472
Following Xin's arranged plan,

175
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:16,512
she was supposed
to attend the jewelry auction,

176
00:12:17,232 --> 00:12:19,272
which was just a few days
after her death.

177
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:19,992
Thus

178
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:23,392
killing Xin

179
00:12:24,432 --> 00:12:26,112
doesn't benefit Yuthaichai at all.

180
00:12:27,352 --> 00:12:28,072
That's right.

181
00:12:29,672 --> 00:12:31,392
But there are others with motives.

182
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:33,352
Whether it's Ms. Sichun,

183
00:12:33,992 --> 00:12:35,032
Mr. Jianggan,

184
00:12:35,272 --> 00:12:36,472
Mr. Jiangkai,

185
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:38,472
and Ms. Jindapa,

186
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:41,352
all of them wished Xin to be dead.

187
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:55,432
Are you cold?

188
00:12:57,272 --> 00:12:57,912
Yes.

189
00:13:08,992 --> 00:13:09,672
It's okay.

190
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:15,592
Where are you going?

191
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:28,832
Do you think you're not tired enough?

192
00:13:31,232 --> 00:13:32,232
Not at all.

193
00:13:34,352 --> 00:13:35,632
I no longer feel cold doing this.

194
00:14:10,352 --> 00:14:12,792
In any case, we think alike.

195
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,912
From Ms. Sichun's method of attack,

196
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:18,192
she's not Xin's real killer.

197
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,032
I agree.

198
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:22,072
We'll question her again tomorrow.

199
00:14:22,512 --> 00:14:25,632
If we're lucky, we'll find out

200
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,192
who she's taking the blame for.

201
00:14:35,232 --> 00:14:36,512
Ms. Sichun,

202
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:40,272
I hope you can honestly tell us

203
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:42,992
who your accomplice is.

204
00:14:44,512 --> 00:14:45,712
I've told you.

205
00:14:46,272 --> 00:14:47,752
I did everything on my own.

206
00:14:48,592 --> 00:14:49,992
Yu only discovered the body later.

207
00:14:50,312 --> 00:14:51,672
Then can you tell me

208
00:14:52,272 --> 00:14:53,392
about Xin's place?

209
00:14:54,112 --> 00:14:54,752
What's the unit number

210
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,032
and which floor is it on?

211
00:14:56,672 --> 00:14:58,432
1405
Unit 1405.

212
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:00,152
It's on the 17th floor.

213
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,992
What's the main color
of the wallpaper in the room?

214
00:15:02,072 --> 00:15:03,192
It was dim at night

215
00:15:03,752 --> 00:15:04,792
and not all the lights were on.

216
00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:06,152
Who would remember the details?

217
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:10,032
But when the police arrived
at the crime scene,

218
00:15:10,912 --> 00:15:12,192
all the lights were on.

219
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:15,312
Maybe Yu or Sen turned them on later.

220
00:15:15,952 --> 00:15:17,152
But their fingerprints

221
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:19,192
were not found on the light switch.

222
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:21,312
According to Sen's statement,

223
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:23,992
all the lights were turned on
before he discovered the body.

224
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:27,632
Now, let me ask you another question.

225
00:15:28,632 --> 00:15:31,472
What color was the towel

226
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:33,472
that covered Xin's body?

227
00:15:33,552 --> 00:15:35,272
When you lost control
and killed someone,

228
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,432
would you consciously
still remember the color?

229
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:41,312
But you still had the consciousness
to send a message to Sen.

230
00:15:41,392 --> 00:15:43,232
Based on the statement
you provided last time,

231
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:45,992
you could clearly explain each step

232
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:48,272
as if someone made you memorize them.

233
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:50,312
But we went
to the crime scene yesterday,

234
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:52,392
we simulated your way
of committing the crime.

235
00:15:53,072 --> 00:15:54,272
We believe

236
00:15:54,992 --> 00:15:56,432
you're lying.

237
00:15:59,112 --> 00:16:00,032
Ms. Sichun,

238
00:16:00,432 --> 00:16:02,832
you may think you're making a sacrifice

239
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:06,272
to protect the real killer.

240
00:16:08,112 --> 00:16:09,832
But have you thought about this?

241
00:16:09,912 --> 00:16:14,592
If you're convicted
of intentional homicide,

242
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:17,592
you'll have to spend
at least 15 to 20 years in prison,

243
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:20,952
or even life imprisonment.

244
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:23,232
Is this what you really want?

245
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:25,712
Have you considered

246
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:28,112
who you'll live with, in prison?

247
00:16:28,992 --> 00:16:30,712
Or how scary it is inside the prison?

248
00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:34,432
Are you really willing
to give up your freedom?

249
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:41,632
The person you're taking the blame for

250
00:16:42,552 --> 00:16:43,952
is probably not Yuthaichai.

251
00:16:44,592 --> 00:16:45,952
You better confess.

252
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:49,192
Who killed Xin?

253
00:16:50,872 --> 00:16:52,952
No matter what, we'll continue
to investigate and find the killer.

254
00:16:54,072 --> 00:16:55,232
But if you help us,

255
00:16:56,392 --> 00:16:58,952
you're helping him and stopping him
from making more mistakes.

256
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:02,272
You can also avoid punishment.

257
00:17:08,832 --> 00:17:11,112
My father is already old.

258
00:17:14,272 --> 00:17:16,512
I can't just watch him go to prison.

259
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:20,432
Da.

260
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:24,832
Listen up, everyone.

261
00:17:26,272 --> 00:17:29,952
I need all of you to immediately
go to the Zaiyongdanacai family's home

262
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:32,072
and arrest Jianggan.

263
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:34,072
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

264
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,152
Go now.

265
00:17:39,552 --> 00:17:40,752
Let me tag along.

266
00:17:41,912 --> 00:17:43,832
Don't you think the case is too simple?

267
00:17:44,992 --> 00:17:45,792
Come with me.

268
00:17:57,992 --> 00:17:58,752
Hey, Da.

269
00:17:59,232 --> 00:18:00,072
Huh?

270
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,752
Where did everyone go?

271
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:03,392
Where's everyone?

272
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:04,992
Hey, wait for me!

273
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:06,312
Captain, I'm coming too.

274
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,552
You caused my sister to go to jail.

275
00:18:14,632 --> 00:18:16,552
Why are you still here, huh?

276
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:18,552
Can't you see what's the situation now?

277
00:18:19,392 --> 00:18:21,792
Aren't you worried
about your sister at all?

278
00:18:21,872 --> 00:18:23,832
Is money that important to you?

279
00:18:25,592 --> 00:18:27,992
How dare you lecture us.

280
00:18:28,392 --> 00:18:29,992
If it weren't for you and Xin trying

281
00:18:30,072 --> 00:18:32,672
to embezzle company property,

282
00:18:32,752 --> 00:18:34,592
things wouldn't
have turned out like this.

283
00:18:37,192 --> 00:18:38,592
Please cooperate.

284
00:18:39,112 --> 00:18:40,952
This is Mr. Jianggan's arrest warrant.

285
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:42,592
Please tell us where he is.

286
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:44,912
Did you make a mistake?

287
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:47,032
I want to call your superior.

288
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:49,392
Stop it.

289
00:18:58,152 --> 00:18:59,632
- Thank you.
- Please go ahead.

290
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:02,912
The fatal wound that caused Xin's death

291
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:04,832
was the injury to the neck.

292
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:08,312
The killer used great force
in this area.

293
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:10,912
It caused a deep wound
that severed the artery,

294
00:19:11,472 --> 00:19:13,872
which caused Xin's death
from excessive bleeding.

295
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,672
The other wounds

296
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:16,832
aren't very deep.

297
00:19:17,352 --> 00:19:19,032
They're not enough to cause Xin's death.

298
00:19:23,552 --> 00:19:26,152
I suspect that the injuries
on the shoulder, neck, and other wounds

299
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,112
were not done by one person.

300
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:32,272
I suspect there is more
than one suspect in this case.

301
00:19:34,392 --> 00:19:35,872
I've been mentally prepared for this.

302
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:42,032
Hey, hey.

303
00:19:42,112 --> 00:19:42,872
Wait.

304
00:19:44,192 --> 00:19:44,832
Let go.

305
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:46,592
Let go.

306
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:50,552
If you look at the wound
on the shoulder and neck,

307
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:53,912
the killer must
have exerted a lot of force here.

308
00:19:54,352 --> 00:19:55,472
He certainly

309
00:19:55,552 --> 00:19:56,872
used his dominant hand.

310
00:19:57,472 --> 00:19:58,912
Most people are right-handed,

311
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:00,832
so he held the knife
with his right hand.

312
00:20:02,312 --> 00:20:06,392
But the cut on the left side
is shallow and narrow

313
00:20:06,912 --> 00:20:08,632
while the wound on the right side

314
00:20:08,712 --> 00:20:10,152
is deep and wide.

315
00:20:10,232 --> 00:20:12,872
I think the killer is left-handed.

316
00:20:13,472 --> 00:20:14,592
Left-handed, huh?

317
00:20:18,832 --> 00:20:20,512
My father can't go to prison.

318
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:25,032
Don't be afraid, son.

319
00:20:25,112 --> 00:20:26,032
I'm fine.

320
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:31,872
I'm Jianggan. I've experienced
so many hardships in life.

321
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,432
What else is there to be afraid of?

322
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:34,912
You didn't kill anyone.

323
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:37,632
So you don't need to be afraid.

324
00:20:58,672 --> 00:21:00,432
I was worried at first

325
00:21:00,872 --> 00:21:02,552
that you may be also left-handed.

326
00:21:04,832 --> 00:21:07,072
So the real killer
could be only one person.

327
00:21:11,632 --> 00:21:13,152
That person is you, Mr. Jiangkai.

328
00:21:15,072 --> 00:21:16,312
If I'm not mistaken,

329
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:18,952
the one helping to cover up
the wounds you caused

330
00:21:19,032 --> 00:21:19,872
was you.

331
00:21:24,152 --> 00:21:25,992
As for the other wounds,

332
00:21:27,112 --> 00:21:28,792
they were done by a right-handed person.

333
00:21:30,232 --> 00:21:31,672
What's going on, sir?

334
00:21:33,952 --> 00:21:36,112
Thanks to Vita's investigation into
Xin's fatal knife wound.

335
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:38,992
We now know that the killer
is left-handed.

336
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:43,392
And coincidentally,
you're the only left-handed person here.

337
00:21:50,632 --> 00:21:52,152
I didn't mean it.

338
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:55,112
That wench went too far.

339
00:22:01,552 --> 00:22:02,792
This can't be true, right?

340
00:22:02,872 --> 00:22:06,392
Everything is my fault.
It has nothing to do with Jiang Kai.

341
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,592
Actually, I threw
the circular saw tooth knife

342
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,832
to divert the attention of the police.

343
00:22:14,072 --> 00:22:14,952
Let's go.

344
00:22:16,912 --> 00:22:17,912
Wait a moment.

345
00:22:22,072 --> 00:22:22,992
You brat.

346
00:22:24,752 --> 00:22:27,112
You're the only one left
in our family now.

347
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:28,792
You should grow up now.

348
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,272
Xin accidentally discovered
my collusion with the carrier,

349
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,392
which damaged the company's reputation.

350
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:57,032
She wanted to blackmail me with it.

351
00:22:57,352 --> 00:22:58,752
So she invited me to her house.

352
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:01,512
Later, we got into an argument.

353
00:23:04,512 --> 00:23:05,472
Why are you so surprised?

354
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:07,072
Jiangkai, why are you here early?

355
00:23:07,312 --> 00:23:08,592
What? Are you waiting for someone?

356
00:23:14,992 --> 00:23:16,592
You're having an affair
with Yuthaichai, right?

357
00:23:16,672 --> 00:23:19,472
And what about you?
Embezzling company money.

358
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:20,992
Do you think I don't know that?

359
00:23:21,072 --> 00:23:22,752
You stole my sister's husband,
didn't you?

360
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:35,832
You stole my sister's husband, huh?

361
00:23:42,312 --> 00:23:43,552
Where do you think you're going?

362
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,312
I didn't know what to do next.

363
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,432
So I called my wife.

364
00:24:10,072 --> 00:24:11,112
She's dead.

365
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:12,832
She's dead! She's dead!

366
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:14,232
- Keep it down.
- She's dead!

367
00:24:14,312 --> 00:24:16,032
Do you want everyone to hear?

368
00:24:16,112 --> 00:24:17,992
My wife came to the crime scene.

369
00:24:19,112 --> 00:24:20,392
She picked up the knife

370
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:23,272
and made more cuts on the body
to confuse things.

371
00:24:34,192 --> 00:24:35,752
After that, we left.

372
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:39,992
You all know

373
00:24:40,432 --> 00:24:41,632
what happened next.

374
00:24:48,832 --> 00:24:52,072
I already knew about Xin
and Yuthaichai's affair.

375
00:24:52,832 --> 00:24:53,752
That day,

376
00:24:54,512 --> 00:24:57,792
I saw Jindapa leaving in a hurry.

377
00:24:58,512 --> 00:24:59,992
And I was worried
about what might happen.

378
00:25:00,472 --> 00:25:02,712
So I secretly followed her to monitor.

379
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,552
Then I saw them coming out
of Xin's house.

380
00:25:25,912 --> 00:25:28,192
And then, I cleaned up the scene

381
00:25:28,752 --> 00:25:31,072
and changed the time of Xin's death

382
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:35,312
to make it harder for you
to solve the case.

383
00:25:35,552 --> 00:25:36,632
Then

384
00:25:37,832 --> 00:25:39,392
what about the text from Xin?

385
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,272
It was also my idea

386
00:25:41,352 --> 00:25:43,792
to confuse the timing of Xin's death.

387
00:25:49,152 --> 00:25:52,832
I obtained evidence of Yuthaichai
and Xin's affair.

388
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:55,952
I was angry

389
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,392
and went to see my father
to confront the wench for me.

390
00:25:59,472 --> 00:26:01,112
But when I got home,

391
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:02,672
Father wasn't there.

392
00:26:02,752 --> 00:26:04,632
But at that time,

393
00:26:04,712 --> 00:26:06,352
he would usually be in his room reading.

394
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:07,992
I waited for a long time.

395
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:09,632
But he didn't come back.

396
00:26:11,472 --> 00:26:13,112
So I decided to go and find her myself.

397
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:16,592
As soon as I got there,

398
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:19,872
I saw Father coming out of that unit.

399
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:25,992
I immediately went in to check.

400
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:28,032
That was when I saw Xin's

401
00:26:29,752 --> 00:26:31,272
lifeless body.

402
00:26:40,992 --> 00:26:41,912
I thought...

403
00:26:41,992 --> 00:26:43,672
Your father had killed Xin.

404
00:26:44,432 --> 00:26:46,952
That was why you turned yourself in, right?

405
00:27:00,592 --> 00:27:01,832
Please come in.

406
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:08,792
This is the summary of the case.

407
00:27:10,912 --> 00:27:12,632
You did a great job this time.

408
00:27:13,152 --> 00:27:16,152
It has been exhausting for you lately.
So I want you to go back and rest.

409
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,232
What's wrong?

410
00:27:21,712 --> 00:27:23,752
This is something worth celebrating.

411
00:27:24,472 --> 00:27:26,272
You solved

412
00:27:27,232 --> 00:27:28,952
your first major case.

413
00:27:29,752 --> 00:27:31,672
But I can't bring myself to feel happy.

414
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:36,992
Everyone went
to Xin's condominium that day.

415
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,072
As a father,

416
00:27:39,152 --> 00:27:41,072
he staged the scene to protect his son.

417
00:27:42,512 --> 00:27:43,592
And the daughter

418
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:46,432
came to turn herself in

419
00:27:47,192 --> 00:27:48,712
thinking her father was guilty.

420
00:27:49,552 --> 00:27:52,152
Even so, they were a loving family.

421
00:27:52,632 --> 00:27:53,552
But why...

422
00:27:55,032 --> 00:27:57,712
Why were they so cruel to Xin?

423
00:28:06,432 --> 00:28:10,032
I believe Xin sought revenge
because she had lost a loved one before.

424
00:28:10,592 --> 00:28:12,992
This book might reveal
another side of her.

425
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:15,952
Xin cherished this book a lot.

426
00:28:18,192 --> 00:28:19,472
And I think

427
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,192
she can never come back to take it.

428
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,352
I saw this book at Xin's house.

429
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,752
It's a fairy tale.

430
00:28:36,552 --> 00:28:37,552
It was her favorite.

431
00:28:40,032 --> 00:28:41,752
Wasu also loved this book.

432
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:01,512
Go back and rest, Vita.

433
00:29:01,912 --> 00:29:03,152
Wasu is waiting for you.

434
00:29:05,392 --> 00:29:06,072
Yes, sir.

435
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,832
(The Zaiyongdanacai family scandal case
has taken another twist.)

436
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:23,712
(The true killers are Jiangkai,
and his wife, Jindapa.)

437
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:27,952
(They conspired together
to murder their own relative, Miss Xin.)

438
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:31,712
(The motive was due to a family feud
since the previous generation.)

439
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:34,472
(The consequences of this incident)

440
00:29:34,552 --> 00:29:37,312
(have led to a significant drop
in the stock of the family's company,)

441
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:40,912
(with many shareholders
selling off their shares.)

442
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,232
(We'll continue to monitor
the developments of the situation.)

443
00:29:42,312 --> 00:29:43,232
You're back.

444
00:29:43,312 --> 00:29:45,432
(How long will it take
to restore the business operations?)

445
00:29:45,512 --> 00:29:46,272
Are you tired?

446
00:29:48,552 --> 00:29:49,392
Have a seat first.

447
00:29:51,472 --> 00:29:52,112
Come here.

448
00:30:11,912 --> 00:30:13,472
(No matter what,)

449
00:30:13,552 --> 00:30:15,552
(you're the one I love the most, Wasu.)

450
00:30:35,472 --> 00:30:36,672
(Before this,)

451
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,592
(Breaking News: Xin's Killer Arrested)
(Miss Xin planned to avenge Mr. Sacai,)

452
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:40,472
(her father who committed suicide)

453
00:30:40,552 --> 00:30:45,952
(under pressure from Mr. Jianggan,
his younger brother.)

454
00:30:46,032 --> 00:30:48,952
(She joined forces with the son-in-law
of the Zaiyongdanacai family, Yuthaichai,)

455
00:30:49,032 --> 00:30:51,312
(and conspired with a rival company.)

456
00:30:52,192 --> 00:30:52,872
Okay.

457
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:54,472
The case is closed.

458
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,632
There are still many other tasks
to handle, right?

459
00:30:56,712 --> 00:30:57,752
Officer Vita?

460
00:30:57,832 --> 00:30:58,952
Someone is waiting for you outside.

461
00:31:01,312 --> 00:31:02,912
Can you guys meet outside in the future?

462
00:31:02,992 --> 00:31:04,272
This is a workplace.

463
00:31:04,352 --> 00:31:05,752
Please show some respect for each other.

464
00:31:06,592 --> 00:31:07,832
Young people these days...

465
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:09,432
Tea.

466
00:31:10,032 --> 00:31:10,672
Oh.

467
00:31:25,392 --> 00:31:27,952
Miss Vita, thank you very much
for helping solve this case.

468
00:31:28,032 --> 00:31:29,632
No need to thank me.

469
00:31:29,712 --> 00:31:31,352
I should also thank you

470
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:33,312
for cooperating with my investigation.

471
00:31:38,152 --> 00:31:39,352
This way, Xin can find peace

472
00:31:40,952 --> 00:31:42,552
in another world.

473
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,552
I'm not sure if such a world exists
or if there is another life.

474
00:31:57,632 --> 00:31:59,472
But from the perspective
of cause and effect,

475
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,152
Xin has succeeded.

476
00:32:12,832 --> 00:32:14,192
I feel sorry for you too.

477
00:33:32,712 --> 00:33:33,352
Ming.

478
00:33:35,312 --> 00:33:36,592
Why are you sitting here?

479
00:33:37,312 --> 00:33:38,592
It's not break time.

480
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:41,512
Why can't I take a break?

481
00:33:41,592 --> 00:33:43,352
It's not like there are any new cases.

482
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,712
You're right.

483
00:33:47,832 --> 00:33:49,032
But

484
00:33:49,392 --> 00:33:51,672
why are you staring at the captain
and Vita's photo?

485
00:33:52,232 --> 00:33:53,072
I saw it, you know.

486
00:33:55,752 --> 00:33:56,432
Da,

487
00:33:56,512 --> 00:33:58,072
you're quite familiar with the captain.

488
00:33:58,592 --> 00:33:59,352
Do you know...

489
00:33:59,432 --> 00:34:00,352
What type he likes,

490
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:01,792
right?

491
00:34:02,512 --> 00:34:03,192
Yes.

492
00:34:03,632 --> 00:34:04,432
What type?

493
00:34:10,072 --> 00:34:11,432
About that question,

494
00:34:11,512 --> 00:34:13,192
if you know,

495
00:34:13,272 --> 00:34:14,992
are you planning to become that type?

496
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:19,992
Of course, not.

497
00:34:20,072 --> 00:34:20,912
But at least,

498
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,312
I know

499
00:34:22,672 --> 00:34:25,432
if I'm getting closer
to the type he likes.

500
00:34:25,512 --> 00:34:26,472
If you ask me,

501
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:28,632
I say just be yourself.

502
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:30,792
Then tell him your feelings.

503
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:33,432
That's the simplest way.

504
00:34:35,272 --> 00:34:37,112
If only it were that simple.

505
00:34:37,232 --> 00:34:40,072
At least I should prepare a little.

506
00:34:40,152 --> 00:34:41,272
Prepare?

507
00:34:42,552 --> 00:34:43,832
Prepare what?

508
00:34:44,312 --> 00:34:46,072
Even if you're fully prepared,

509
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:47,112
if he doesn't like you,

510
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:48,832
nothing you do will work.

511
00:34:50,272 --> 00:34:51,152
Da,

512
00:34:52,352 --> 00:34:53,712
you're belittling me.

513
00:34:54,552 --> 00:34:55,632
That's not what I mean.

514
00:34:55,952 --> 00:34:57,912
I just want to tell you

515
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,112
to have a little confidence in yourself.

516
00:35:00,712 --> 00:35:02,312
Because at this moment,

517
00:35:03,112 --> 00:35:04,792
you're already quite likable.

518
00:35:04,872 --> 00:35:06,712
You don't need to change.

519
00:35:11,872 --> 00:35:12,752
Really?

520
00:35:13,192 --> 00:35:14,512
Don't lie to me.

521
00:35:17,312 --> 00:35:18,112
I'm not lying.

522
00:35:18,192 --> 00:35:20,832
Try finding an opportunity
to get closer to the captain

523
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:22,992
and tell him your true feelings.

524
00:35:23,912 --> 00:35:24,712
Okay?

525
00:35:32,192 --> 00:35:32,832
Thanks, man.

526
00:35:33,032 --> 00:35:33,672
Hmm.

527
00:35:53,832 --> 00:35:55,312
Why are you staring at me?

528
00:35:56,272 --> 00:35:57,432
Is there something on my face?

529
00:36:00,752 --> 00:36:03,992
I just feel you've changed.

530
00:36:06,672 --> 00:36:07,552
What do you mean?

531
00:36:09,632 --> 00:36:10,272
It's just...

532
00:36:10,912 --> 00:36:12,512
You're not as slow-witted as before.

533
00:36:12,592 --> 00:36:13,672
And you've become more formidable.

534
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:14,632
We crack the case

535
00:36:14,712 --> 00:36:16,672
thanks to you and the captain.

536
00:36:16,752 --> 00:36:17,592
That's not true.

537
00:36:17,672 --> 00:36:20,912
The information you and Da found
during the search was very helpful.

538
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:21,792
Really?

539
00:36:22,752 --> 00:36:23,672
I'm so glad to hear that.

540
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,392
By the way, coach...

541
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,472
I mean the captain.

542
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:28,832
The captain also said

543
00:36:28,912 --> 00:36:30,192
that I have changed.

544
00:36:30,312 --> 00:36:32,312
I'm not as slow as a snail anymore.

545
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:35,232
Is that so?

546
00:36:36,392 --> 00:36:39,792
He seems to care about you
and take care of you.

547
00:36:41,192 --> 00:36:43,992
I think the captain
is considerate of everyone.

548
00:36:44,072 --> 00:36:47,512
When he reviewed the statements
of the Zaiyongdanacai family,

549
00:36:47,592 --> 00:36:49,312
he praised you and Da a lot.

550
00:36:50,192 --> 00:36:52,192
But when he went on fieldwork,

551
00:36:52,272 --> 00:36:53,752
he brought you, Vita.

552
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:08,672
Vita,

553
00:37:09,472 --> 00:37:10,672
I have a question.

554
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:13,072
I'll be straightforward.

555
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,032
What do you feel about the captain?

556
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,592
He's a respectable superior.

557
00:37:31,192 --> 00:37:32,712
Apart from being a respectable superior,

558
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,432
do you have any other thoughts?

559
00:37:42,872 --> 00:37:43,512
Yes.

560
00:37:47,472 --> 00:37:49,992
He's also a merciless
and devilish coach.

561
00:37:52,872 --> 00:37:53,792
Okay.

562
00:38:14,952 --> 00:38:15,992
(I'm so happy.)

563
00:38:16,072 --> 00:38:19,552
(I made two advance gestures
toward others today.)

564
00:38:28,392 --> 00:38:29,272
I forgot my bag.

565
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,312
I can come and get it tomorrow.

566
00:38:46,552 --> 00:38:47,352
Here you go.

567
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,952
Did you ask to see me
just to bring me a cup of coffee?

568
00:38:54,192 --> 00:38:55,032
No.

569
00:38:55,272 --> 00:38:57,912
I just have something I want to ask you.

570
00:39:00,272 --> 00:39:00,992
Well,

571
00:39:01,992 --> 00:39:03,952
I want to ask...

572
00:39:10,272 --> 00:39:11,432
Please take the call first.

573
00:39:15,032 --> 00:39:15,952
Hello?

574
00:39:19,632 --> 00:39:21,152
I've already sent the email.

575
00:39:23,712 --> 00:39:25,432
Do you have a girlfriend?

576
00:39:26,512 --> 00:39:27,152
Okay.

577
00:39:31,472 --> 00:39:32,112
Good.

578
00:39:36,072 --> 00:39:37,912
So what did you want to ask me?

579
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:41,472
Well,

580
00:39:42,152 --> 00:39:43,912
I want to ask you if...

581
00:39:43,992 --> 00:39:45,592
Da's birthday is coming up.

582
00:39:46,272 --> 00:39:47,672
I want to buy him a gift.

583
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,472
Do you know what he likes or dislikes?

584
00:39:50,552 --> 00:39:52,752
But it's okay if you don't know.

585
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,672
Thank you.

586
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:55,952
Ming,

587
00:39:59,552 --> 00:40:00,472
Well,

588
00:40:03,712 --> 00:40:05,712
I think you
should just ask him directly.

589
00:40:06,512 --> 00:40:07,152
Da.

590
00:40:17,192 --> 00:40:18,592
What are the odds? I just want

591
00:40:18,952 --> 00:40:19,992
to grab some coffee.

592
00:40:20,072 --> 00:40:22,592
Then I'll leave you two to talk.

593
00:40:31,952 --> 00:40:32,752
I...

594
00:40:33,072 --> 00:40:34,112
I'm sorry, Ming.

595
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,472
I didn't mean to eavesdrop
on your conversation.

596
00:40:37,552 --> 00:40:38,352
It's okay.

597
00:40:38,432 --> 00:40:40,272
I should apologize.

598
00:40:40,352 --> 00:40:42,392
You told me to express my feelings
to the captain.

599
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,552
But

600
00:40:43,992 --> 00:40:44,912
I'm being timid

601
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,592
and awkward

602
00:40:46,672 --> 00:40:48,232
that I used you as a cover-up.

603
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,192
You know?

604
00:40:50,632 --> 00:40:51,712
When I was in school,

605
00:40:52,352 --> 00:40:53,952
I had a crush on a girl.

606
00:40:54,472 --> 00:40:56,752
I told her directly that I liked her.

607
00:40:59,112 --> 00:41:01,712
But she said she didn't like me.

608
00:41:02,352 --> 00:41:04,192
I chose to keep waiting

609
00:41:05,032 --> 00:41:07,232
and told her if she decided
to accept me one day,

610
00:41:07,312 --> 00:41:09,912
she should come to the garden
after school.

611
00:41:09,992 --> 00:41:11,552
I would go there and wait
for her every day

612
00:41:12,352 --> 00:41:13,192
until the school closed.

613
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:14,432
And then?

614
00:41:14,992 --> 00:41:15,992
Did she come?

615
00:41:19,512 --> 00:41:20,352
What happened after?

616
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:21,512
That's it?

617
00:41:23,072 --> 00:41:24,512
The storytime for today is over.

618
00:41:24,912 --> 00:41:26,712
Please tune in next time
for the continuation.

619
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:29,392
Hey, you can't do that.

620
00:41:29,472 --> 00:41:32,072
You only told half when I'm kind enough
to listen to your boring story.

621
00:41:51,832 --> 00:41:53,272
Why are you back so late?

622
00:41:57,672 --> 00:41:59,952
I saw you leaving first.
Why did I arrive first?

623
00:42:00,032 --> 00:42:01,672
You're really as slow as a snail.

624
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,672
You were the one who was fast.

625
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:06,752
You forgot this.

626
00:42:08,672 --> 00:42:09,632
Thank you.

627
00:42:10,552 --> 00:42:12,592
Did you resolve things
with Ming smoothly?

628
00:42:15,352 --> 00:42:17,072
Don't be nosy.

629
00:42:20,832 --> 00:42:21,632
Vita,

630
00:42:25,632 --> 00:42:27,432
I have something important to ask you.

631
00:42:34,472 --> 00:42:35,872
In two weeks,

632
00:42:35,952 --> 00:42:38,752
our department
will have a physical fitness assessment

633
00:42:38,832 --> 00:42:40,472
with two other elite teams.

634
00:42:40,952 --> 00:42:42,792
One is for fostering friendship.

635
00:42:42,872 --> 00:42:47,232
The other is to determine which team
is the top in the police department.

636
00:42:47,712 --> 00:42:48,552
Are you up for it?

637
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:49,232
Let's do this!

638
00:42:53,192 --> 00:42:55,032
I want to take this opportunity to test

639
00:42:55,112 --> 00:42:59,952
if you can join our department
as an official member.
