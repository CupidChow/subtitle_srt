(Badin's Death Anniversary)

5
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,480
Last night, I...

6
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,080
I think you had a fever last night.

7
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,880
But you look much better now.

8
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
What's wrong?

9
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,600
It's nothing.

10
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,240
Maybe I didn't get enough sleep.

11
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,920
Thank you for the breakfast.

12
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,720
Actually, you've improved a lot
in every aspect.

13
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,520
You don't need to do all of this
just to please me.

14
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,600
How did you know that
I loved egg whites?

15
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,280
That's not it.

16
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,200
I just happen to love egg yolks.

17
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,640
If that's the case,

18
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,800
these egg whites are...

19
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,240
These were the leftovers
when you fell asleep last night.

20
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,920
Are you okay?

21
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,360
Coach,

22
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,520
I have something to tell you.

23
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,760
I will stop investigating that case.

24
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,920
You can trust me.

25
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,200
Take your time.

26
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,400
- Didn't you say you would stop?
- I was just...

27
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,400
Ah!

28
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,040
I saw something that I wasn't
supposed to! Will I go blind?

29
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,200
Since when were you here?

30
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,320
I...

31
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,240
I can explain about the diary.

32
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,560
Actually, I saw it last night.

33
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,880
If you wish to know the truth,

34
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,160
I can tell you about it.

35
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,520
Let's go.

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,480
(Grave of Second Lieutenant Badin Unga)

37
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,240
Today's your death anniversary.

38
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,720
I'm here to visit you.

39
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,040
Grandma Lek is doing fine.

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,520
Her cooking

41
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,640
is as delicious as ever.

42
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,400
Beibo is all grown up too.

43
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,160
I brought a friend to visit you today.

44
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,880
She resembles you a lot.

45
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,640
She's a keen observer.

46
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,720
She's meticulous too.

47
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,440
The diary you obtained,

48
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,120
its owner was a person called Badin.

49
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,920
A few years ago,

50
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,920
I received an order

51
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,800
to execute a secret mission.

52
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,440
They wanted me to eradicate
a haunt of criminals

53
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,760
and arrest a major criminal named Luger.

54
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,040
Back then, he used a warehouse
as his base.

55
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,560
You jerk!

56
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,400
Badin!

57
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,000
Badin!

58
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,480
I'm going to charge inside
and arrest him.

59
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,880
Don't do it. It's a trap.

60
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,080
Sorry, Captain.

61
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,120
I have to arrest him.

62
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,920
Badin!

63
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,120
Badin!

64
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,160
Run!

65
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,200
After that explosion,

66
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,520
I fell into a coma for a few weeks.

67
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,760
When I woke up, I found out
that Badin was sacrificed.

68
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,040
Chief told me

69
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,120
that both Badin and Luger
died during that explosion.

70
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,080
I didn't even have the chance
to attend Badin's funeral.

71
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,440
Was that why you were so strict with me?

72
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,240
Coach,

73
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,080
this isn't your fault.

74
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,320
It isn't Badin's fault either.

75
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,480
I can understand his feelings.

76
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,320
Since we chose to become cops,

77
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
we'd definitely encounter
risky situations.

78
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,640
This is our dream.

79
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,440
This is our choice.

80
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,720
But no matter what,
he was a part of my team.

81
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,720
I should be responsible for his safety.

82
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,880
But this is the fault of the criminals.

83
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,560
Luger was the one who killed Badin.

84
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,680
He has already been brought to justice.

85
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,160
That's something
I've been wondering until now.

86
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,800
From the theft in the museum,

87
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,720
the news of the abandoned temple,

88
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,280
to the human trafficking incident,

89
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,560
all these signs are telling me
that he's still alive.

90
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,600
Due to Badin's death,

91
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,400
you're worried

92
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,200
that Grandma Lek and Beibo
will be in danger.

93
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,200
That's why you want to protect them.

94
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,400
I...

95
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,800
I want to assist you in investigating
the case with Luger.

96
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,000
And, I will keep this a secret.

97
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,680
Thank you.

98
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,000
However, as your superior,

99
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,080
I won't let you take such risks.

100
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,080
If you truly wish to help me,

101
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,280
you can help me gather information
and evidence.

102
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,800
I don't want you to end up like Badin.

103
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,880
All information related to Luger Case
is in here.

104
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,800
It's inside the folder
with my name on it.

105
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,040
Now, you don't need to steal
someone else's diary.

106
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,360
Understood.

107
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,520
What are you doing?

108
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,240
Wasu and I loved to make pinky promises

109
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,480
when we were young.

110
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,800
I'm not your elder brother.

111
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,960
That's unnecessary.

112
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,880
I promise.

113
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
But I won't

114
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,320
make a pinky promise with you.

115
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,720
Let's hurry back to the resort.

116
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,840
Da called me this morning.

117
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,960
He said Yuthaichai lied about his flight.

118
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,040
He didn't fly to another prefecture.

119
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,160
Roger that.

120
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,360
(Mu Dessert House)

121
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,960
It's me.

122
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,720
Our shop is closed today.

123
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,200
I have a huge order to prepare.

124
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,720
Mu,

125
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,760
I'm sorry

126
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,280
that I couldn't attend
your birthday celebration.

127
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,400
I truly wanted to attend it.

128
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,680
However, I couldn't do it.

129
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,560
I'm not sure

130
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,160
what you mean by that.

131
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,120
If you still wish

132
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,160
to be my friend,

133
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,160
you can tell me the truth
once you're ready.

134
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,880
What's wrong?

135
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,040
I'm fine.

136
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,280
Mu,

137
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,360
I...

138
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,960
Just tell me what's on your mind.

139
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,360
I don't understand Wasu.

140
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,600
It's obvious that he fancies you.

141
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,640
But why didn't he explain himself?

142
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,000
Once he's done with his affairs,

143
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,840
he should explain himself to me.

144
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,800
Mu, are you sure about that?

145
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,480
Thank you.

146
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,120
Okay.

147
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,840

149
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,280
Miss Nicha.

150
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,040
Hi, Mr. Yuthaichai.

151
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,240
We can sit together if you don't mind.

152
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,280
What a coincidence.

153
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,400
I was planning to seek your guidance
about jewelry.

154
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,320
It's my honor to help out
a gorgeous girl like you.

155
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,800
Vita, stall him for me.

156
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,080
(Please clean the room)

157
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,960
Okay.

158
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,680
Hello.

159
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,960
I'm on my way there.

160
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,320
I will pass the document to you.

161
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,520
Alright, I'll pass it to you later.

162
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,200
Sorry about that.

163
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,680
I forgot to take my stuff.

164
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,960
You don't need to clean the room.

165
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,120
Okay.

166
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,040
Okay, thank you.

167
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,920
Don't mention it.

168
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,720
For red jewelry,
it must be Thailand's ruby, am I right?

169
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,960
Oh, you...

170
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,880
I didn't expect you to be
so knowledgeable about jewelry as well.

171
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,000
I couldn't believe it.

172
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,120
You flatter me.

173
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,440
I just so happened to read about them
in magazines.

174
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,480
I'm not as knowledgeable as you.

175
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,320
Oh, by the way,

176
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,040
you have to attend tonight's banquet
in pairs, right?

177
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,520
Mr. Yuthaichai, did you come here alone?

178
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,720
Erm, I...

179
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,640
Sorry about that.

180
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,360
Did I ask you too many questions?

181
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,560
I always have many questions

182
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,120
for someone I'm interested in.

183
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,160
Don't be angry at me, okay?

184
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,200
Why don't we shift to another topic?

185
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,240
Vita,

186
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,640
I need Yuthaichai's computer password.

187
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,960
What a shame.

188
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,240
I tried to order
some coconut egg tarts just now.

189
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,880
But the waiter said

190
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,560
they were reserved for the VIPS
of the auction tonight.

191
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,080
The chef here is famous
for his desserts.

192
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,080
Did you make the reservation?

193
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,360
That's right.

194
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,040
Miss Nicha, do you want to have them?

195
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,960
Yeah.

196
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,520
I don't take sweet food after 4 p.m.

197
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,520
It's no wonder

198
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,080
you have a gorgeous figure...

199
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,520
Sure, no problem.

200
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,920
I can make arrangements for it

201
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,720
if you want to try them now.

202
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,280
Sir, do you need anything?

203
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,200
Tell the head chef to come here.

204
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,080
And,

205
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,320
tell him that this lady

206
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,160
wants to try the egg tarts he made.

207
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,360
Go now.

208
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,560
Wait.

209
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,880
I think

210
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,480
you should provide them with
top-tier treatment for their services.

211
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,320
For example, you should head to
the kitchen and tell him in person.

212
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,560
And,

213
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,320
I heard that
he's a tough person to deal with.

214
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,880
You may go first.

215
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,800
I...

216
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,160
I want you to serve me

217
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,000
personally,

218
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,560
okay?

219
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,680
Okay.

220
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,480
Your wish

221
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,240
is my will.

222
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,120
I'll be back in a second.

223
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,000
Wait here.

224
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,720
Okay.

225
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,360
Where did you learn that from?

226
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,360
I got the password.

227
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,480
2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 5.

228
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Vita, I'm in.

229
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,840
Here you go.

230
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,040
Wow.

231
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,040
Coconut egg tarts.

232
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,520
I was supervising the chef
when he was making them.

233
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,680
They look delicious.

00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,160
(Auction Guest Name List)

235
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,280
Here, let me feed you.

236
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
Let me feed you.

237
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,760
This is so delicious.

238
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,680
He does live up to his name.

239
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,040
The head chef said he would deliver
a special meal to my room tonight.

240
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,920
Do you want to join me?

241
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,600
Sorry about that.

242
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,120
Speak.

243
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,800
Excuse me,

244
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,640
but I have to go.

245
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,920
I'm very sorry.

246
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,920
Contact me anytime

247
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,240
once you make up your mind, okay?

248
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,120
Are you returning to your room?

249
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,560
Vita, I'm almost done.

250
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,040
Try your best to stall him.

251
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,360
Wait.

252
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,360
I...

253
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,280
I wish to know more about

254
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,880
gems and jewelry.

255
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,760
Miss Nicha,

256
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,080
there's a safe in my room.

257
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,280
There are quite a few of them inside.

258
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,600
You can call me

259
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,320
when you're ready.

260
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,440
I'll make a move first.

261
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,280
Mr. Yuthaichai.

262
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,920
Did you forget to take this?

263
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,360
This isn't mine.

264
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,480
Mr. Yuthaichai,

265
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,840
I'm already outside your room.

266
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,600
Aren't you going to invite me inside?

267
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,520
Miss Nicha,

268
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,600
you came to my room alone.

269
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,240
Aren't you afraid that Mr. Bowen

270
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,280
might get suspicious of you?

271
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,760
If you and I

272
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,560
keep quiet about it,

273
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
I suppose no one will know.

274
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,840
I'm good at keeping secrets.

275
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,240
I can keep this secret for you.

276
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,600
Miss Nicha,

277
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,440
you're so good at this.

278
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,280
I

279
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,280
love it.

280
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,520
You're passionate and proactive.

281
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,240
But you have to wait for me.
I'll be back in a second.

282
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,840
Wait!

283
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,840
I think

284
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,520
you look sexy

285
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,840
in this shirt.

286
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,560

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,560
Nicha.

288
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,360
Go!

289
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,680
Hurry!

290
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,040
Look at you.

291
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,160
What's wrong?

292
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,800
You're igniting my passion.

293
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,040
I can't hold it in anymore.

294
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,600
This time, it's my turn.

295
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,480
Hey, you!

296
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,000
Sorry about this.

297
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,200
I remembered that
I had an appointment with Wen.

298
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
I need to go.

299
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,280
Wait! You!

300
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,400
How could you leave like this?

301
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
Hey.

302
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,000
What about this?

303
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,160
We can see each other again
after the event.

304
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,240

305
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,200
wait for me!

307
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,680

to do something for me later.

Han,

315
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,760
I don't understand this.

316
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,680
Captain,

317
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,440
all of the documents are encrypted.

318
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
It's an international
encryption algorithm.

319
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,840
If we decrypt it by force,

320
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,680
the documents will be deleted.

321
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,880
According to the technology we have,

322
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,760
I think we need 72 hours

323
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,600
to decrypt it.

324
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,000
Alright.

325
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,840
Meanwhile, we'll keep him
under surveillance.

326
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,160
You guys have to hurry.

327
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Besides that,

328
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,600
Xin and Yuthaichai used virtual identities
to make illegal transactions.

329
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,640
You guys should keep an eye
on the cash flow

330
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,960
and see if you can find
the name of their virtual accounts.

331
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,800
Roger that.

(Facebook ID: Bowen, Theme: My Partner)

334
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,440
Now, we just need to wait
for the decrypted password

335
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,960
and the interrogation
of the Zaiyongdanacai family.

336
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,360
What else do we need to do?

337
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,720
Once we figure out the societal ties
related to the victim,

338
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,320
we'll categorize them
and analyze them accordingly.

339
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,120
Thus,

340
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,760
we need to gather information and
determine the investigative direction,

341
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,080
including the interrogation detail
from the Zaiyongdanacai family.

342
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,320
After that, we'll wait for Captain
and Vita to send us their information

343
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,760
before we compile them

344
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,960
and hasten the process.

345
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,960

00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,440
Da.

351
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,840
According to the financial report
we received from Vita,

352
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,960
I realized

353
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,680
that Miss Xin kept buying
expensive wine in this store.

354
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
And, the dates of their purchase,

355
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,200

356
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,080
and disposal

357
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,880
are all recorded.

358
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,960
I went to retrieve
the surveillance camera footage

359
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,640
after receiving the report.

360
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,400
I realized that although Miss Xin
did visit that place often,

361
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,480
she wasn't there to see Mr. Wasu.

362
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,840
However,

363
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
she only met this lady once

364
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,200
in the place.

365
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,880
It's a female designer called Apinya.

366
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,400
She usually works overseas.

367
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,920
I did my investigation.

368
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,600
Luckily, she returned
to Thailand not long ago.

369
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,680
We can

370
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,560
meet her by today.

371
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,920
Why is she so slow?

372
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,160

373
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,280

374
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,400
You really ignite my desire.

375
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,000
But that's fine.

376
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,560
I believe we have enough time
to know each other better

377
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,280
next time.

378
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,120
I'm telling you this

379
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,480
because I might fly to the US

380
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,080
after this event.

381
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,440
The US?

382
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,400
Unfortunately, the company needs
my directives for an important project.

383
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,360
However,

384
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,120
that's all I can say.

385
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,880
What a shame.

386
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,440
I was trying to find a chance
to thank you for the warm welcome.

387
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,760
That's fine.

388
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,800
I'll give you a warm welcome

389
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,400
when you come to the US.

390
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,080
I believe that we'll have plenty of time
to know each other by then.

391
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,960
Thank you.

392
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,080
I'll make a move first.

393
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,920
Okay.

394
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,000
If we keep this up, Mr. Bowen
will definitely suspect something.

395
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,600
(Som O, Xin's good friend)
I've known Xin for two or three months.

396
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,880
I was shocked too

397
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,720
when I received the news.

398
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,080
I will do my best
to cooperate with you guys.

399
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,400
Thank you, Miss Apinya.

400
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,920
If so, you can start by

401
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,960
telling me your relationship
with Miss Xin.

402
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,280
She contacted me first.

403
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,320
Xin said she wanted to improve
the standard of fabrics in Thailand.

404
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,800
So, she's just a business partner.

405
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,200
Can I put it that way?

406
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,240
(SMS: 5 million baht transferred,
3 million baht transferred, 4 million baht transferred)

407
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,800
You can put it that way.

408
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,000
When I mentioned the term
"business partner",

409
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,880
why did you look like you were
absent-minded?

410
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,000
Something just feels off.

411
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,360
It's something outside of work.

412
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,760
Xin

413
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,480
borrowed money from me.

414
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,680
She borrowed money from you?

415
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,960
If we release him now,

416
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,680
it'll be difficult for us
to capture him in the future.

417
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,080
I know that.

418
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,240
However, we can only wait.

419
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,080
I'll repeat your mission

420
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,280
during the event later.

421
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,280
Keep an eye on Yuthaichai.

422
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,520
And, we'll keep an eye
on the table reserved

423
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,800
by Miss Xin.

424
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,760
Maybe someone new will appear.

425
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,480
I know the table number.

426
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,520
A08
It's A08.

427
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,800
You can answer your call.

428
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,200
No, I won't.

429
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,360
Such calls have been
occurring frequently.

430
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,520
They said something was wrong
with my bank account.

431
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,120
I told them

432
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,760
that it wasn't my account.

433
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,560
Can you help me take a look?

434
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,760
There were dozens of SMS.

435
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,160
It was something like

436
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,200
the transaction records
of millions of baht.

437
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,440
Does this mean I've fallen prey
to the scam now?

438
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,200
Please wait.

439
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,320
Hello, Da?

440
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,280
There's a new situation.

441
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,360
Captain said that Miss Xin
might have another bank account.

442
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,000
And, it's an overseas account that she
registered with another person's name.

443
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,840
That person might be Miss Apinya.

444
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,800
I will send her name

445
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,880
and account details to you now.

446
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,160
This auction item is exquisite.

447
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,800
It's a set of jewelry that includes a
necklace, two earrings, and a ring.

448
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,720
The starting bid is 500,000 baht.

449
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,840
Each raise will increase
the bid by 100,000 baht.

450
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,360
The bid begins now.

451
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,640
I found it!

452
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,520
- Ning, what have you found?
- Transaction records in Faroe Islands.

453
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,080
Captain called us and said that
Yuthaichai plans to escape tonight.

454
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,040
We can only try to enter the password ourselves.
We only have three chances.

455
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,680
If we fail, the intel will be destroyed.

456
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,600
Da, what kind of number password
do you put on your phone?

457
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,680
It's either my birthday

458
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,640
or the birthday of the girl I fancy.

459
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,680
- What are you saying?
- Ning.

460
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,200
What about you?

461
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,640
The code of love.

462
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,280
What? I don't know. I said nothing.

463
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,080
Have you tried putting
Yuthaichai's birthday?

464
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,320
(Please enter the password)

465
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,560
Faroe Islands?

466
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:57,120
This is a 24.70-karat ruby ring.

467
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,680
It is made with slender pillow cuts.

468
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,600
It is verified by the SSEF and AGL

469
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:10,240
to be a Burma Ruby.
It's certified by the SSEF

470
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,080
to have an exceptional hue,
which is known as pigeon blood.

471
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And, this is the first appearance
of this ruby ring on an auction.

472
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,600
The starting bid

473
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,800
for this ruby ring

474
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,320
is seven million baht.

475
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,240
Make it 20 million baht.

476
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,440
Keep an eye on him.

477
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,520
Don't let him leave your sight.

478
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,400
We can only show our arrest warrant

479
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,840
after the deal is completed.

480
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,680
Now, we have evidence of Yuthaichai's
and Songticha's collusion.

481
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,680
The fund raised by this auction

482
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,880
will be donated to charity

483
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,960
in order to improve the lives
of those who live in poverty.

484
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,560
Next,

485
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,120
I shall announce this.

486
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,760
The bid begins.

487
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,840
This is how they launder money.

488
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,320
They transfer the auction fund
to Yuthaichai's company account.

489
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,240
After that, they'll transfer it
to the mastermind.

490
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,120
Using charity as an excuse,

491
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,600
they'll transfer it to the buyer
in secret.

492
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,840
They're doing dirty deeds using
charity as an excuse.

493
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,480
I'll definitely bring them to justice.

494
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,200
Mr. Sadee for seven million baht.

495
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,400
Anyone else?

496
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,280
We just discovered Miss Xin's
secret bank account.

497
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,040
She did so in order
to hide her identity.

498
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,760
Thus, she used Miss Apinya's details

499
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,760
to register a shell company
in the Faroe Islands.

500
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,440
- Do you guys want to try it?
- Ming, I don't think so.

501
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,560
This is too easy to be true.

502
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,520
Ning?

503
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,640
To be honest, I'm timid.
I don't want to try it.

504
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,880
Coach?

505
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,960
Just give it a try.

506
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,200
10 million baht.

507
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,120
Mr. Suteh for 10 million baht.

508
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,080
Anyone with a higher bid?

509
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,040
15 million baht.

510
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,280
Miss Pooboh for 15 million baht.

511
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,720
Anyone with a higher bid?

512
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,920
Mr. Yuthaichai?

513
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
20 million baht.

514
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,560
Mr. Yuthaichai for 20 million baht.

515
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,680
If so, I'll start the countdown.

516
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,800
20 million baht, one.

517
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,160
20 million baht, two.

518
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,360
Next.

519
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,640
20 million baht, three.

520
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,520
The bid will end at 20 million baht.

521
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,160
Deal.

522
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:05,760
The S99 red ruby belongs to
Mr. Yuthaichai now. Congratulations.

523
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:16,000
Thank you.

524
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,600
20 million baht has been transferred
to your bank account.

525
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,920
Okay.

526
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,000
Coach, he's out of my sight.

527
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,080
Over there, Vita. Let's go.

528
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,440
Excuse me.

529
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,920
- Mr. Han!
- Mr. Han!

530
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,760
Mr. Han!

531
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,960
Mr. Han! Wake up!

532
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,000
We did it!

533
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,960
- Ming, how did it go?
- Captain.

534
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,280
The documents have been decrypted.
We have key evidence of his crime.

535
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,320
You may arrest Yuthaichai now.

536
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,600
Good job.

537
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,200
What happened before we left?

538
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,200
The confetti.

539
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,040
Over there!

540
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,160
Mr. Yuthaichai,

541
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,720
we have evidence of your crime.
Please follow us to record your statement.

542
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,800
Thank you for cooperating with us.

543
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,360
You helped us to decrypt the documents.

544
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,120
Through our investigation,

545
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:57,120
we discovered illegal transactions
involving huge sums in your laptop.

546
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,720
I was just doing some investments.

547
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,880
However, these investments are
related to corruption and bribery.

548
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,640
Hey.

549
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,760
I have the right to decide

550
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,280
where to invest the company's fund
and its capital flow.

551
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,080
All of the family members are clear

552
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,760
with the decisions I make.

553
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,720
Is that so?

554
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,680
But do your family members know that
you used Miss Xin as a middleman

555
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,400
to collect these funds for you
in a company in the Faroe Islands?

556
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,240
Do they know about that?

557
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,160
How did you guys find out?

558
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,760
By monitoring your bank account,

559
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,760
we discovered

560
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,040
that you registered a company
on that island.

561
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,920
(Certificate of Incorporation &
Account Transaction Records)

562
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,840
(Account Transaction Records)

563
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,080
So,

564
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,080
what's your relationship with Miss Xin?

565
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,760
I heard that my husband was arrested.

566
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,800
You brought all these clothes
out from Miss Xin's unit, right?

567
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,160
The perfume you're using

568
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,200
is the same as the scent we found
in Miss Xin's wardrobe.

569
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,960
If we send it for analysis,

570
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,200
it's likely that we'll discover your DNA
on Miss Xin's clothing.

571
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,640
Hmph.

572
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,880
My clothes

573
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,520
and luggage

574
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,880
are my personal belongings.

575
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,080
You guys have no right

576
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,880
to search them
unless you have a search warrant.

577
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,600
Listen.

578
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,680
I will wait for my lawyer to come.

579
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,440
If not, I will not utter a single word.

580
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,320
Fine.

581
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,560
But take a look at this.

582
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,240
(Arrest warrant)

583
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,120
Fine.

584
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,360
Xin and I

585
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,280
do have an affair.

586
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,920
I want you to detain Ms. Sichun.

587
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,240
Arrest her for intentional homicide.

588
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,040
After that, release Mr. Yuthaichai.

589
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,480
However, we can convict him with
evidence of his money laundering.

590
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,760
Coach, you don't believe in Ms. Sichun.

591
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,040
That's why you want to
use Yuthaichai as bait

592
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,200
in order to obtain more clues.

593
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,480
Go and release Yuthaichai.

594
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,480
Just say we don't have enough evidence
to arrest him.
