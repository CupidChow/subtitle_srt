00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,300
(An adaptation of the novel
"When a Snail Falls in Love" by Ding Mo)

4
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,880
(Police Investigators Team)

5
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,360
Come in.

6
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,760
Captain.

7
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,200
What did you find, Ning?

8
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,480
This.

9
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,480
The evidence section of the area
reported to me.

10
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,920
We found many chemical components

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,720
from the mud sample.

12
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,520
According to the analysis,

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,280
the mud comes from this area.

14
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,280
It is an abandoned industrial zone on the outskirt.

15
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,120
Several years ago, a chemical plant exploded here

16
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,640
so a lot of workers moved out.

17
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,120
Only one retirement home left.

18
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,640
Okay.

19
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,920
Well done, Ning.

20
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,600
Thank you.

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,400
Vita.

22
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,280
Come with me.

23
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,560
Good job.

24
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,160
Yes, sir.

25
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,920
Mr. Ming,

26
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,760
you need to eat,

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,280
or you won't be able
to take your medicine.

28
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,160
This doesn't taste good, Chayan.
It's too bland.

29
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,320
Please make do.

30
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,080
When you get better,

31
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,920
I'll let you have a drink.

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,640
Are you bored?
There are only old folks here.

33
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,880
Not at all.

34
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,760
The elderly here are very nice.

35
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,680
It's hard to find a good boy
like Chayan these days.

36
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,280
He has been taking care of me
for three years. He's like my real son.

37
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,480
Are you Chayan's girlfriend?

38
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,800
No, no.

39
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,240
We just met. We're just friends.

40
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
Just friends?

41
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,280
Yes.

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,200
I used to be a fortune teller.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,680
Is that so?

44
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,120
Mr. Ming,

45
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,320
don't say things like that. Hurry up
and eat so you can take your medicine.

46
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,440
Did you know this?
The first time we met,

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,640
your feelings
were written all over your face.

48
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,880
It told me that you just ended
a relationship with someone.

49
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,800
You could tell from my face?

50
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,400
I can also tell

51
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,280
that someone's on your mind right now.

52
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,440
But it's not the one who hurt you.

53
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,400
It might be your ex-boyfriend

54
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,840
or someone you had feelings for.

55
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,960
Don't tell me
you're that fortune teller's disciple.

56
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,520
You can fake your expressions,

57
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,960
but the eyes

58
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
never lie.

59
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,680
You know
that I just had my heart broken,

60
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,280
and I still have feelings
for an old flame.

61
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,280
Even so, you still want to pursue me?

62
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,200
I just think

63
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,080
that you need someone by your side

64
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,280
during this time.

65
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,200
I've fallen for that gaze in your eyes.

66
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,560
Mr. Chayan.

67
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,240
Director.

68
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,680
The tax deduction certificate.

69
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,280
Thank you.

70
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,480
Thank you again

71
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,080
for covering our expenses
for the past few years.

72
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,480
Don't mention it, Director.

73
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,520
So you're not a volunteer

74
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,440
but

75
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,000
the main sponsor of this place?

76
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,520
Three years ago,

77
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,880
this nursing home
was going to be shut down.

78
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,280
The old folks here

79
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,000
might have become homeless.

80
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,400
You're a charming man, you know that?

81
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,680
But also a mysterious one.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,280
If you want,

83
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,360
I can slowly show you my true self.

84
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,240
I'll be right back.

85
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,440
You head back to the nursing home first.

86
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,080
Okay.

87
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,840
Follow me.

88
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,360
Anything?

89
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,040
No.

90
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,160
Vita!

91
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,240
Did you see his face?

92
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,040
No.

93
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,360
Stop! I said stop!

94
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,160
I'll shoot if you don't stop!

95
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,720
Stop!

96
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,960
Who are you?

97
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,880
Remove your hat.

98
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,240
I said remove your hat!

99
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,880
Ming.

100
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,600
I'm innocent.

101
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,680
You know that.

102
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,720
You're alive.

103
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,960
Then turn yourself in.

104
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,800
Don't come any closer!

105
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,520
Ming!

106
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,360
What happened?

107
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,560
I heard gunshots.

108
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,960
Wait! Ming!

109
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,600
Ming!

110
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,000
Calm down, Ming.

111
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,680
Where did he go?

112
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,760
Calm down.

113
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,280
Where did he go?

114
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,600
- There's no one here.
- Where did Thana go?

115
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,720
He was just here…

116
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,720
Where's Thana?

117
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,000
He was the man I once loved.

118
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,040
I just don't know

119
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,760
why he suddenly appeared.

120
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,920
Calm down.

121
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,280
You've met me

122
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,640
now.

123
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:03,800
Ah!

124
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,920
Wasu!

125
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,520
Wasu, open the door!

126
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,840
What's wrong?

127
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,200
My heart is beating so fast.

128
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,320
Wasu,

129
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,240
I just got a medical checkup.

130
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,840
I don't have sinus arrhythmia.

131
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,960
I didn't stay up late.

132
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,880
Did I have

133
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,080
a heart attack?

134
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,480
Wasu,

135
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,600
you have to take me to the hospital.

136
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,160
I don't want to have a heart attack.

137
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,360
Besides,

138
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,160
if it's hereditary…

139
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,920
Vita.

140
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,880
I heard what you said.

141
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,280
You're fine. Nothing's wrong with you.

142
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,520
But this has never happened to me.

143
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,640
I was sleeping soundly. I had a dream,

144
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,640
and my heart rate suddenly increased.

145
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,720
What did you dream of?

146
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,920
I dreamed

147
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,200
that I was working.

148
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,520
Who were you

149
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,760
working with?

150
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,440
The captain.

151
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,400
Sigh…

152
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,080
If that's all,

153
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,280
worry not.

154
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,080
Go back and continue dreaming.

155
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,640
If your heart rate goes up again,

156
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,960
don't worry.

157
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,120
If something does happen,

158
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,600
I'll give you my heart.

159
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,320
I have a way to keep
your heart from racing.

160
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,320
Want to hear it?

161
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,840
Stay away

162
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,240
from

163
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,040
your captain,

164
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,040
and don't interrupt my sleep again.

165
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,840
Da.

166
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,080
What are you doing here?

167
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,560
Have you been waiting for long?

168
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,680
It's um…

169
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,840
About what I wanted to say
earlier today.

170
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,680
Did you two use to date?

171
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,280
Yes.

172
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,520
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,720
I…

174
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,280
Thana and I used to date.

175
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,440
I didn't know how to tell everyone.

176
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,080
If I did…

177
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,640
You would have to leave the team

178
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,040
as Vita did. Right?

179
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,600
Like the time Wasu was a suspect.

180
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,840
I don't know what to do.

181
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,800
Until now,

182
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,520
I still can't believe
that he would be the murderer.

183
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,880
You need

184
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,400
to prove that.

185
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,400
I came

186
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,320
to remind you.

187
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,600
We're the police.

188
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,600
It's our duty to solve crimes

189
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,480
and arrest criminals.

190
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,280
Got it?

191
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,320
Got it.

192
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,640
I was going to tell everyone
even if you didn't come.

193
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,400
I know.

194
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,960
You can let go now.

195
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,240
Not giving me a hug to encourage me?

196
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,760
What?

197
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,480
You want me to stop investigating Luger?

198
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,280
- But Chief…
- I know.

199
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,400
You'll blame me.

200
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,280
But we have to tell the media about
the progress of the case in a few days.

201
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,560
Looking at the evidence so far,

202
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,560
Thana must be

203
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,000
the serial killer.

204
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,680
He has been at large for three years.

205
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,160
Therefore, pursue this lead.

206
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,120
I want to apprehend the culprit

207
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,400
before the press conference.

208
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,640
Yes, sir.

209
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,240
Come in.

210
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,280
This is the closure report.

211
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,400
Also,

212
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,680
I know the chief wants to suspend
the investigation of the Luger case.

213
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,400
That's what will happen.

214
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,240
Follow the chief's orders.

215
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,840
Solve the drug serial murder case first,

216
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,040
and then
we can continue investigating Luger.

217
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,000
Can I take a look at your wound?

218
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
It will hurt a little.

219
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,080
Fortunately, it's not inflamed.

220
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,600
Just wrap it up.

221
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,480
Okay.

222
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,080
Vita,

223
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,600
just now in the captain's office,

224
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,040
you two…

225
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,000
What about us?

226
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,640
Did I hurt you?

227
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,800
You have to tell me

228
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,760
if it hurts.

229
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,120
I was changing the captain's dressing.

230
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,200
What dressing?

231
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,440
What dressing?

232
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,400
Meeting in five minutes.

233
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,440
See you in the meeting room.

234
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,080
So unromantic.

235
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,800
Huh? What?

236
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,640
Meeting in five?

237
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,840
Oh, shoot!

238
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,760
Based on the map,

239
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,800
the nursing home is the only place within
the vicinity of the exploded chemical plant.

240
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,240
Everyone.

241
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,240
I have something to say.

242
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,840
I know Thana.

243
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,240
We dated three years ago.

244
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,200
I'm sorry

245
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,240
for hiding this from everyone.

246
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,240
Why are you only saying that now, Ming?

247
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,800
Do you know

248
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,920
how you hiding that information
could affect our investigation?

249
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,640
Stay calm.

250
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,160
It's not that bad.

251
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,840
If you did know Thana,

252
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,080
then tell us about him.

253
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,040
We have the right
to more information about our suspect.

254
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,760
Okay.

255
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,560
I met Thana

256
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,960
three years ago

257
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,680
at the City Mall.

258
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,080
We dated for four months.

259
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,640
There was nothing
to suggest he could be a murderer.

260
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,520
But one day, he just disappeared,

261
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,720
and became a suspect
in a serial murder case.

262
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,720
Since that day,
I haven't been in touch with him

263
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,760
until yesterday.

264
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,520
Hold on.

265
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,840
You met our prime suspect yesterday,

266
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,320
and you're only telling us about it now?

267
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,440
What are you thinking?

268
00:18:59,440 --> 00:18:59,960
Let's hear Ming out first…

269
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,120
I don't want to hear her out.

270
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,200
Where?

271
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,120
What happened?

272
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,000
A friend and I went to the nursing home,

273
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,880
and I saw him

274
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,360
in the ruins nearby.

275
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,920
I chased after him,

276
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,040
but he got away.

277
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,520
I think you let him get away.

278
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,440
She didn't.

279
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,360
How would you know that?

280
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,320
I knew everything. I just hid it.

281
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:25,880
Da!

282
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,720
Enough.

283
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
Enough.

284
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,440
Ming.

285
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,040
Yes.

286
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,520
I have to remove you from this case.

287
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,920
You know the reason.

288
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,040
I know, Captain.

289
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,920
Coach…

290
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,400
I'm really sorry.

291
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,600
All right.

292
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,600
We'll have to make a trip

293
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,320
to the place Ming ran into Thana.

294
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,480
Mr. Han, you'll come with me.

295
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,920
Ning,

296
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,280
summarise all the information.

297
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,960
Take a break, everyone.

298
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,520
Ming,

299
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,600
you can let it out

300
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,000
if you're upset.

301
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,640
You'll feel better.

302
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,200
Thank you.

303
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,680
You should go back too.

304
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,680
Get some rest.

305
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,560
Don't think too much.

306
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,400
I'll be rooting for you.

307
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,800
Thanks.

308
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,160
Chayan.

309
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,120
Why are you still here?

310
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,720
The air is better down here.

311
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,680
Here.

312
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,160
How did you know I was craving snacks?

313
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,040
Well…

314
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,680
I think snacks
always make you feel better

315
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,720
when you're down.

316
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,440
Thank you.

317
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,920
Officer Vita,

318
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,760
we have found him.

319
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,880
Go ahead.

320
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,000
We've identified the suspect entering and
leaving the hospital in the surveillance footage.

321
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,160
I've sent the data to your department.

322
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,440
Thank you.

323
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,360
Where are you going, Vita?

324
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,480
Can I come with you?

325
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,120
I'm heading out to investigate a case.

326
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,080
Just don't get in my way. Please?

327
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,640
You look serious.

328
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,960
You usually head out
with Captain Pla, right?

329
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,800
Why are you going out alone this time?

330
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,720
He's busy with another case,

331
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,360
so I have
to investigate this one myself.

332
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,680
On my own.

333
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,800
That means you need to take a taxi.

334
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,320
Why not take my car?

335
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,760
I guarantee I'll get you there
as fast as you want.

336
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,880
Time is of the essence

337
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,560
when it comes to solving a case, right?

338
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,440
Fine.

339
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,040
But you have to follow my instructions.

340
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,880
After all,
this is the police on the case.

341
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,360
I will obey all orders
of the beautiful officer.

342
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,400
Okay. Fine.

343
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,360
Is this the building
you came to last time?

344
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,200
It's certainly larger than expected.

345
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,520
Who knows
where the culprit could be now?

346
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,760
But this is the only lead we have.

347
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,080
We have to start here, Mr. Han.

348
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,440
It's odd.

349
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,800
The day Vita and I came,

350
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,000
we were after a suspect.

351
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,400
On the same day,

352
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,120
Ming ran into Thana at the nursing home.

353
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
We almost got him.

354
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,440
Da.

355
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,040
Is something the matter?

356
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,280
Can we talk inside?

357
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,640
Come in.

358
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,480
What everyone said during the meeting

359
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,960
might have hurt you.

360
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,320
I was worried,

361
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,960
so I came to check on you.

362
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
I'm fine.

363
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,840
I'm a lot better now.

364
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,160
Have a seat.

365
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,400
I'll get you a cup of coffee.

366
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,320
(Message from Thana)
Ming, I'm waiting for you.

367
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,040
Ming?

368
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,000
Ming!

369
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,480
I'm calling the captain.

370
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,880
Ming?

371
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,400
Ming!

372
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,360
Where are you going?

373
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,680
Thana is after me.

374
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,160
The only one who can fix the problem
is the one who created the problem.

375
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,440
I have to end this.

376
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,640
Ming…

377
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,960
Ming, what are you doing?

378
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,160
Ming!

379
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,120
Ming!

380
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,520
What's up, Da?

381
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,600
Captain, Ming received
a threatening text from Thana.

382
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,480
What?

383
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,600
She locked me in her place

384
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,120
and went to see him on her own.

385
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,080
Okay. Stay calm, Da.

386
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,760
Calm down.

387
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,720
What was in that message?

388
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,200
There was a kidnapped woman

389
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,840
and a message that said,

390
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,640
"Ming, I'm waiting for you."

391
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:56,960
What about the photo?

392
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,400
There was a poster on the wall.

393
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,680
It looked familiar.

394
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,320
I'll draw it out for you, Captain.

395
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,040
Okay.

396
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,520
City Mall.

397
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,920
(City Mall)

398
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,360
(Be my girlfriend.)

399
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,960
This is where you confessed to me.

400
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,280
Why didn't you tell me anything

401
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,800
in the past three years?

402
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,760
Leave!

403
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,680
Ever since you disappeared,

404
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,280
I refused to believe that you were dead.
I kept looking for you.

405
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,080
You are the murderer, aren't you?

406
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,760
It's dangerous here! Get out!

407
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,400
Are you? Answer me!

408
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,840
Are you the murderer?

409
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,680
Answer me!

410
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,520
- Leave! There's a bomb on me!
- Answer…

411
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,160
There's a bomb on me! Get out!

412
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,600
Ming,

413
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,560
listen to me.

414
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm not the killer.

415
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,480
I disappeared for three years
because I didn't want to put you in danger.

416
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,080
Back away, Ming!

417
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,200
Back up!

418
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,680
Captain, there's a bomb on Thana!

419
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,520
Leave!

420
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,760
Forget about me.

421
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,120
Get Ming out of here!

422
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,960
There's a woman upstairs
who has a bomb tied to her just like me.

423
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,160
I'm useless.

424
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,480
I'm just glad I got to see Ming…

425
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,240
Shut up!

426
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,400
What's the situation, Mr. Han?

427
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,080
This is a C-4 bomb
that's controlled by a detonator.

428
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,840
If it blows,
the entire building will collapse.

429
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,960
The mechanism inside
has been fine-tuned.

430
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,160
But there should still be hope.

431
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,520
I'll stay here.

432
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,200
Mr. Han, find the other hostage.

433
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,680
We'll defuse the bombs at the same time.

434
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,120
Got it.

435
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,080
Go back.

436
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,240
Go!

437
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,480
Get out, Ming!

438
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,160
This place is going to blow!

439
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,720
Get out of here, Ming!

440
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,880
Captain…

441
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,320
I never thought

442
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,720
I'd have an officer die with me
at the end of my time.

443
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,920
I'm not going to let you die

444
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,920
before I interrogate you.

445
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,720
(SWAT code)

446
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,920
Reached the target point.

447
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,360
Yes, Captain.

448
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,280
Ning, get them away from the building.

449
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,360
There are bombs inside.

450
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,240
Copy that.

451
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,080
Wait.

452
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,480
Don't go in there yet.
There are bombs inside.

453
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,680
Get the bomb squad here.

454
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,120
All right.

455
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,640
Stay calm.

456
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,560
Police.

457
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,040
I'm here to save you.

458
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,760
What's the situation, Mr. Han?

459
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,480
20 seconds left.

460
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,040
Any last words, Captain?

461
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,920
I should've listened to you

462
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,880
and given myself a chance
to be with the one I love sooner.

463
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,920
That's right.

464
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,720
If we make it back alive,

465
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,560
you should be braver
when it comes to love.

466
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,200
Okay.

467
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,680
Do you see the blue wire
near the circuit board?

468
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,560
I see it.

469
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,720
We'll cut it at the same time.

470
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,360
Ready?

471
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,200
Three.

472
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,920
Two.

473
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,880
One. Cut.

474
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,000
It's okay now.

475
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,320
Thank you…

476
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,000
Thank you, Captain…

477
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,560
Ming.

478
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,840
I'm escorting him back myself.

479
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,560
Mr. Han,

480
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,480
please take the girl to the hospital.

481
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,800
All right.

482
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,200
You're coming along.

483
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,760
I told you to go with Mr. Han.

484
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,520
Ning.

485
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,000
Hold this for me.

486
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,520
Yes.

487
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,760
Get Thana in the car.
I'll be right there.

488
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,520
Yes, sir.

489
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,520
Okay. Come on.

490
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,200
Let's go.

491
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,680
Hello? Captain?

492
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,720
(Prepare an interrogation room.)

493
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,640
(We'll be taking statements later.)

494
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,080
Um… I'm outside with Sen at the moment.

495
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,000
It's still work hours, isn't it?

496
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,160
I…

497
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,240
Are you on a date?

498
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,560
Yes.

499
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,120
(I'll get back as soon as I can.)

500
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,680
Come back right now.

501
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,400
That's all.

502
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,680
Captain,

503
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,120
was that our little snail?

504
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,480
The one who makes you want to be braver?

505
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,960
It'd be better to just confess.

506
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,280
That's something you should really learn
from that Sen guy.

507
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:10,920
Sen?

508
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,240
You think I haven't tried?

509
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,600
Maybe you did,

510
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,880
but it didn't work, did it?

511
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,800
Sometimes, practice makes perfect.

512
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,640
You brought me
to such a beautiful place.

513
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,200
Don't tell me
you have a surprise for me.

514
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,520
There's nothing.

515
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,120
I'm here for work.

516
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,040
But

517
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,200
was there a case here or something?

518
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,760
There's a murderer hiding around here.

519
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,960
A murderer?

520
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,760
So you're here to capture him, right?

521
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,040
This is exciting.

522
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,320
Sen, wait in the car.

523
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,240
Vita.

524
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,320
Be careful.

525
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,400
This is a trap.

526
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,600
Three? You…

527
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,600
Sen!

528
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,320
I told you to wait in the car.

529
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,680
You can't see him from this far.

530
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,520
Hey, you…

531
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,320
I doubt he can see us.

532
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,520
Get down!

533
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,640
Follow me.

534
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,720
It's the killer!

535
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,920
Vita.

536
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,800
We're doomed…

537
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,000
I didn't even get married yet.

538
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,840
Why don't you be my wife?

539
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,120
They say that it's bad luck
for their next life

540
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,400
if a man dies without marrying.

541
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,640
Plus, I'm so good-looking.

542
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,600
I won't let you die,

543
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,200
and neither will I marry you.

544
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:27,880
Sen,

545
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,080
wait here for me

546
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,080
and don't go anywhere.

547
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,520
Be careful.

548
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,160
Sen! No!

549
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,560
Let him go!

550
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,640
He's not involved!

551
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,040
The one who should drop the gun is you.

552
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,560
Or I'll kill this handsome man.

553
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,960
Good to know
that you think I'm handsome.

554
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,320
But what you don't know is

555
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,080
that I'm super rich.

556
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,120
How much did your boss pay you?

557
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,920
If you let me go,

558
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,600
I might spare you some change.

559
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:03,960
Shut up!

560
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,400
Don't insult me with money!

561
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,000
Let him go!

562
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,520
Ning.

563
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,200
Yes.

564
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,240
Take the suspect
to get a physical examination

565
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,720
and a blood test

566
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,520
to see if there are
any suspicious chemicals in his body.

567
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,960
Yes, sir.

568
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,120
Ming.

569
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,320
I'm glad I got to see you again.

570
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,720
You have to believe

571
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,000
that I'm not the killer.

572
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,320
Let's go.

573
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,720
You lovers can catch up later.

574
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,760
You have to believe me, Ming.

575
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,880
I'm not the murderer.

576
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,840
Get in.

577
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,280
Please come in.

578
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,680
I know you want
to go inside the interrogation room,

579
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,880
but I can't let you in.

580
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,960
That's all right.

581
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,600
I understand.

582
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,720
I'm sorry

583
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,120
for cuffing you too.

584
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,240
It's okay.

585
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,000
Don't do it again.

586
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,680
You should have more faith in me.

587
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,080
I just don't want you
to put yourself in danger for me again.

588
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,920
I never thought
I was putting myself in danger.

589
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,680
On the contrary,
I'm honored that I could help you.

590
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,880
(Sen: Vita and I got caught. Help us!)

591
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,240
I told you.

592
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,720
I'm not the killer.

593
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,320
I'm a victim as well.

594
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,680
Ask the girl who was kidnapped too.

595
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,280
Yes.

596
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,760
That girl told us

597
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,320
you weren't the culprit.

598
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,320
So why did you run away

599
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,200
from the case three years ago?

600
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,560
I was framed by the real killer.

601
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,720
He fakes the evidence to lock me up.

602
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,840
The real killer is still out there.

603
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:48,920
Black Lion.

604
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,640
Drop the gun!

605
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,280
I need to know the hostages are safe.

606
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,720
You don't get a choice.

607
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,480
Drop the gun.

608
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,720
Now!

609
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,280
You can lower the gun now.

610
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,720
I'll let you choose.

611
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,120
Who do you want to live?

612
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,600
You want my life, don't you?

613
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,720
Let them go.

614
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,920
Either way,
you're dying today, Black Lion.

615
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,840
But before you die,

616
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,840
I want to play a game.

617
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,480
That way,

618
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,720
at least someone lives.

619
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,040
If you don't choose,

620
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,680
then both of them will die.

621
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,680
Or you can choose to kill yourself.

622
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,240
Ten seconds.

623
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,280
The choice is yours,

624
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,200
Black Lion.

625
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:30,920
Five seconds, Black Lion.

626
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,040
Wait!

627
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,520
I know you don't like me, Pla.

628
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,240
You're mad at me for going after Vita.

629
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,000
But you don't have to die here.

630
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,720
If you kill yourself,

631
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,800
you'll see me and Vita getting married

632
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,000
from your casket.

633
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,040
Hey! Keep your mouth shut!

634
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,800
I won't!

635
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,880
Then, you can die first.

636
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,560
Sorry.

637
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,360
Got it,

638
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,600
Vita?

639
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,120
Yes.

640
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,200
Captain.

641
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,520
You haven't said a word to me

642
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,480
since earlier.

643
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,240
I know I let you down.

644
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,920
I was wrong this time.

645
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,360
Please let me make up for my mistake.

646
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,800
Why did you act without permission?

647
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,200
You know your limits.

648
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,720
So why did you still do it?

649
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,440
I just wanted
to help you find the evidence…

650
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,520
I don't need it.

651
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,760
You overestimate yourself.

652
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,480
If these two goons
weren't so half-baked,

653
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,480
do you know how dangerous
it could have been?

654
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,320
You need to think seriously, Vita.

655
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,760
I'm sorry.

656
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,520
I'm really sorry.

657
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,040
I'm very sorry.

658
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,480
I'm really sorry, Captain.

659
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,560
Come on.

660
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,560
Vita.

661
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,200
I'm sorry
I got you reprimanded by the captain.

662
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,560
It's all right.

663
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,000
Wait.

664
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,800
Let me ask you this.

665
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,840
If the killer made you choose

666
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,840
between me and the captain,

667
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,160
who would you save?

668
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,520
You.

669
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,120
Why?

670
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,760
The police must protect the public.

671
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,680
Is that all?

672
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,000
You would die with the captain
to save someone like me?

673
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,400
That's unlikely.

674
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,040
Vita,

675
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,520
I think

676
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,480
you already have
the answer in your heart.

677
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,120
You're just in denial.

678
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,760
No matter what, thank you.

679
00:46:45,711 --> 00:46:47,760
Don't forget.
We still have another date.

680
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,200
I'll be back for it.

681
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,800
What were you guys
talking about for so long?

682
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,640
The date.

683
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,720
Perfect timing, Vita.

684
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,720
Help me pick out a gift for Mu.

685
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,720
What's wrong?

686
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,080
Wasu.

687
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,400
Can I have a hug?

688
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,080
What happened?

689
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,520
I just wanted to be sure of something.

690
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,400
I'm done.

691
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,720
Huh? What?

692
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,320
Recently, I hugged three people.

693
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,040
What?

694
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:24,760
The first hug

695
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,120
was calm and warm.
It was the hug of a friend.

696
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,680
The second hug

697
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,800
was inclusive and healing.

698
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,480
It was like a hug from family.

699
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,320
These two don't matter.

700
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,280
What about the last hug?

701
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:52,840
You…

702
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,040
Vita.

703
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,200
Vita.

704
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,640
Tell me, Vita..

705
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,360
Captain Pla is pursuing you, isn't he?

706
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,200
He is, isn't he, Vita?

707
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,040
Or are you pursuing him?

708
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:05,840
Vita!

709
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,600
(Your cooking is as good as they say.)

710
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,240
(Word of mouth from the members
of the nursing home is that you cook well.)

711
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,480
(Three years ago,)

712
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,760
(I was set up by the real killer.)

713
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,240
(He planted my hair at the crime scene)

714
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,160
(and threatened me.)

715
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,600
(He forced me to turn myself in.)

716
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,360
Have you seen the real killer?

717
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,400
(Thai police arrests the wrong culprit,
a third victim appears, serial killer at large)

718
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,040
(Theoretically, by definition,)

719
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,680
(most serial killers
are compulsive in some way.)

720
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,920
(The position and the way
the tie knots are the same,)

721
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,880
(and there is some correlation
between the way they kill.)

722
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,640
(As such,)

723
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,160
(it's highly likely that we have
two suspects working alternately.)
