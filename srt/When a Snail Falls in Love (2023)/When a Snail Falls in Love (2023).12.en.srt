=Episode 12=

3
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,300
(An adaptation of the novel
"When a Snail Falls in Love" by Ding Mo)

4
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:40,769
Someone reported

5
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,649
that he found a female corpse.

6
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,889
Hence, we were here to investigate.

7
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:45,969
Did you find

8
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:48,929
the victim's fingernails odd?

9
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:51,169
I've analyzed it. The victim has been
in contact with poisonous substance.

10
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:08,209
This is Sen's contact number.

11
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:19,449
Brief me on the case, Ming.

12
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:23,729
Ming.

13
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:33,729
Please brief me on
what you've found on the crime scene.

14
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:37,009
Based on the corpse's condition,

15
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:39,689
it's deduced
that the victim is killed elsewhere.

16
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:44,009
Judging on the fingernails and stains
on lips, the victim might be poisoned.

17
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:46,169
Thank you.

18
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:47,529
You're welcome.

19
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,049
You have seen
dead bodies for a few times.

20
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:52,849
Aren't you used to it yet?

21
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:56,489
Yes.

22
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:00,049
I'm not used to this yet.

23
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:09,289
Let's get the ball rolling.

24
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:13,529
What is your relationship
with the victim?

25
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:18,449
I've never seen this woman.

26
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:20,329
Do you mean

27
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:24,849
that these numbers appear on
the victim's arm without you knowing?

28
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:28,929
I have only one request.

29
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,529
Please ask Vita over.

30
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:32,009
I won't tell you anything

31
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:34,289
if Vita is not here.

32
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,369
If that so, let me deal with him.

33
00:03:50,089 --> 00:03:51,089
I'll go.

34
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:05,329
Waiting is a torture.

35
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,409
I'm asking for Vita,
not you, Captain Pla.

36
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:14,649
Did you think that you can
just order the police around

37
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:16,849
like a waiter?

38
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,729
You harassed a police officer
in the police station.

39
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:20,329
You knew it too.

40
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:21,929
The number of days you can be detained.

41
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:24,489
I didn't harass her nor stir up trouble.

42
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:25,769
It's just a reasonable request, Captain.

43
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,889
Your action is harassment
from my perspective.

44
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:29,409
It can also be known as coercion.

45
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:30,689
You did this to Lina too, didn't you?

46
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:32,849
I did nothing to her.
It was her who was harassing me.

47
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:39,009
Since you spilled the beans,

48
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:41,849
let's talk about it.

49
00:04:47,249 --> 00:04:48,289
Fine, Captain.

50
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,289
You win.

51
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:52,529
I met Lina.

52
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:55,249
But I have nothing to do with her.

53
00:04:58,649 --> 00:04:59,289
Really?

54
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:00,609
When was it?

55
00:05:01,489 --> 00:05:02,489
Yesterday night.

56
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:05,289
I was having a meeting
with a client in a night club.

57
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:06,929
Then, I met this woman.

58
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:08,689
She invited me for a drink.

59
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:11,969
So, we drank together. That's all.

60
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:13,449
We didn't do anything else.

61
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:19,529
What about the ID on her arm?

62
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:23,649
She pestered me for my contact details.

63
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:25,609
I was really tired after work.
You can understand me, right?

64
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:28,609
I didn't have pen or paper with me,
so I wrote with her lipstick.

65
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:30,889
Then, I went back home.

66
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:33,649
I have no idea
what happened to her after that.

67
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:38,089
If you wish to find out her whereabouts,

68
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:40,609
you got the wrong person, Captain Pla.

69
00:05:50,609 --> 00:05:51,969
You're watching this, aren't you, Vita?

70
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:53,329
Listen.

71
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:56,249
I have nothing to do with

72
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:58,409
Lina or Nali, whoever she is.

73
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:00,969
I bear no feelings for her.

74
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:03,529
Instead,

75
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:07,449
I have feelings for you,

76
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:09,169
Vita.

77
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:11,049
Sit down.

78
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:14,209
I love you.

79
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:20,329
Is Sen in his right mind?

80
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:22,449
Confessing in an interrogation room.

81
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,529
Is he nuts?

82
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:31,769
Is there anything wrong, Captain?

83
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:34,649
It's normal for
your subordinates to date.

84
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,689
Are you going to mind that too?

85
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:40,009
You like Vita too, don't you?

86
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:43,449
Otherwise, whenever there's
progress between me and Vita,

87
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:47,569
you wouldn't show up.

88
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:51,929
Captain Pla.

89
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:54,129
Did you know?
Although you're expressionless,

90
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:56,729
your eyes can't lie.

91
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:03,849
No wonder.

92
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:09,129
You interrogate me on behalf of Vita.

93
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:11,769
After you left the night club,

94
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:13,809
where did you go?

95
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:15,449
I went home. I'm innocent.

96
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:18,409
Can anyone testify that?

97
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,849
No, Captain.

98
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:25,889
If you're asking for a witness,

99
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:27,969
I don't have anyone.

100
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,929
But I believe that after this,

101
00:07:33,609 --> 00:07:35,009
Vita can testify for me then.

102
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:36,889
Please take this seriously, Sen.

103
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:39,169
All right.

104
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:41,129
Stop goofing around.

105
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,609
It's pointless doing that.

106
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:47,009
Okay.

107
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:52,329
Vita.

108
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:54,809
You were watching me
behind the mirror, right?

109
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:59,249
I mean what I said.

110
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:02,329
Thank you, Sen.

111
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:04,849
However, I don't like you.

112
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:09,209
I hope that you can
deal with this quickly

113
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:11,289
and come to
the meeting room for a meeting.

114
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:13,689
We'll be having
a meeting to review the case.

115
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:15,929
Yes, Captain.

116
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:17,809
As for you,

117
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:21,769
you're still the police's suspect.

118
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:26,089
Hence, you must always
be in contact with us

119
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:28,929
and report to us

120
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,169
your whereabouts and who you met.

121
00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:40,409
Why don't you give me a chance?

122
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:46,409
I know

123
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:48,689
I have no strengths.

124
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,649
But all I want is a chance.

125
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:08,609
Okay.

126
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:11,449
I'll give you three dates.

127
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:14,409
If I still don't like you
after three dates,

128
00:09:14,489 --> 00:09:15,449
let's call it quits.

129
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:17,929
Really?

130
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:20,649
What did you say?

131
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:26,089
Thank you, Vita.

132
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:27,689
Thank you.

133
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:28,649
Hold on.

134
00:09:33,369 --> 00:09:34,049
Vita.

135
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:36,929
You'll be in charge to watch over Sen

136
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:40,089
until he is cleared of suspicion.

137
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:41,009
What?

138
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:42,329
This is because

139
00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:45,009
he's still one of our suspects.

140
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:48,289
In my opinion,
you're the most suitable person.

141
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:49,169
But I want to join
the investigation too...

142
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:51,249
Sure! I'll give my full cooperation.

143
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:57,809
Keeping watch on the suspect

144
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:01,409
is one of the crucial parts
in the investigation too, Vita.

145
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:03,889
Noted.

146
00:10:04,849 --> 00:10:05,329
Okay.

147
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:06,449
I think you can now

148
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:07,609
go home.

149
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:10,089
You can watch on him tomorrow.

150
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:11,609
Okay.

151
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:13,729
I'll wait for you, Vita.

152
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:17,249
I can assure you that it's going
to be the best three dates in your life.

153
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:27,489
Listen.

154
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:30,609
While you're keeping watch on him,

155
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:33,009
always report to me

156
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:35,929
on his whereabouts, schedule
and the people he met.

157
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:38,369
Even the tiniest bit of details.

158
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:39,849
Do I need to report to you

159
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:41,489
even when we're dating?

160
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:42,209
That's right.

161
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:44,009
Of course.

162
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:46,289
We should hurry to the meeting.

163
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:49,169
But Captain.

164
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,649
You said that I could go home earlier.

165
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:52,729
There's no clock out in our department.

166
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:57,089
Hurry up.

167
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:04,329
(Cyanide Serial Murder Case)

168
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:07,689
Based on the preliminary findings
by the forensic experts,

169
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:10,129
we discovered that the victim, Lina

170
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:12,529
experienced aggravated
sexual violence before she died.

171
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:15,449
She has bruises all over her body.

172
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:16,649
There are bruises on her hands

173
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:18,329
and her neck.

174
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:21,729
But there's no evidence
pointing to rape.

175
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:26,529
During the sexual intercourse,
the victim reacted.

176
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:30,529
It's probable that the violence
can be a sexual preference.

177
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:34,529
There's presence of pink lividity
on the victim's body.

178
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:37,849
In particular, the skin of
the outer ear and the earlobe

179
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:41,089
appears to be cherry-red in color.

180
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:44,249
The victim's face and lips are purplish.

181
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,929
There's also a bitter almond odor
emanating from the victim's mouth.

182
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:49,449
Based on the autopsy,
the victim is poisoned.

183
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:52,569
Don't you find
the pictures familiar, Captain?

184
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:53,329
That's right.

185
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:55,729
The victims are all young women.

186
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,009
They all died of cyanide poisoning.

187
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:02,409
They all exhibited seizures

188
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,569
before death.

189
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:06,849
Seems like you know the case well.

190
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:09,849
When I was in the police academy,

191
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:12,489
I did a report on this case.

192
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:30,049
Okay.

193
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:33,169
Let's take a look at this.
Three years ago,

194
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:37,409
there were several young girls
died of poisoning.

195
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:41,569
Their cause of death
is respiratory failure.

196
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:44,609
The same poison that Ming mentioned
is found in their bodies,

197
00:12:45,729 --> 00:12:47,609
Cyanide.

198
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:53,769
We found the third victim when
we conducted an on-site investigation.

199
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:55,849
Then we found the suspect's hair.

200
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:58,689
He is a researcher
in a pharmaceutical factory.

201
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:00,489
His name is Thana.

202
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:02,569
If I remember it right,

203
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,089
the police hunted Thana down for murder.

204
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:08,969
Then, Thana left
a suicide note by a cliff,

205
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,929
but his body was never found.

206
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:17,769
Since then, the cyanide murder
never happened again.

207
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:20,689
He has his Master's degree in Chemistry.

208
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:23,889
However, when the police
hunted him down,

209
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,849
he disappeared into thin air.

210
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:29,409
But one thing is strange.

211
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,049
No victims were found

212
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:34,249
in the last six months until yesterday.

213
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:36,289
Vita.

214
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:39,369
What do you think?

215
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:43,049
There are two possibilities.

216
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:44,049
First,

217
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:45,969
it's a copycat crime.

218
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:50,329
But it's hard to obtain the poison.

219
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:52,969
There are many ways to murder someone.

220
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:56,089
There's no need to go through the hassle
just to murder someone with cyanide.

221
00:13:56,609 --> 00:13:57,889
Second,

222
00:13:58,769 --> 00:13:59,889
Thana isn't dead.

223
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:05,329
Three years ago, he feigned
his death to escape the police.

224
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:07,209
Now, he has returned.

225
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:09,889
He murdered people with the same method.

226
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:13,649
I personally incline
to the second probability.

227
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:14,929
Okay.

228
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:17,049
How about you, Ming?

229
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,689
You mentioned

230
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:21,129
that you did a report on the case
when you were in the academy.

231
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:23,179
In my opinion,

232
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:27,449
it's likely that it's a copycat crime.

233
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:36,769
According to my research,

234
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:41,529
serial killers can't
hold back their desire to kill.

235
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:43,849
For instance, the case
that happened three years ago.

236
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:47,249
The longest gap between
two murder cases is two weeks.

237
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:48,769
The shortest gap is only one day.

238
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:50,969
Yet this round, the gap is three years.

239
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:56,049
Perhaps he did kill in between these
years, but the body was not found.

240
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:58,609
However, all the victims' bodies are
left at easily discoverable locations.

241
00:14:58,929 --> 00:14:59,929
It can be interpreted

242
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:02,169
as the killer trying to
show off his work to the world.

243
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:06,009
Please have a seat, Ming.

244
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:11,569
Both speculations are probable.

245
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:14,649
The serial killer is Thana.

246
00:15:14,729 --> 00:15:15,529
Or,

247
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:19,289
there's a copycat crime.

248
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:21,729
We need to look into both possibilities.

249
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:23,689
Let's divide into two teams.

250
00:15:23,729 --> 00:15:24,569
Do you understand?

251
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:25,529
- Yes.
- Yes.

252
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:31,609
Is your arm okay?

253
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,289
I'm fine, Chief.

254
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:36,009
That's a relief.

255
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,089
The hospital informed me

256
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:40,689
that Eig is no longer
in critical condition,

257
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:42,409
but he's still unconscious
for the time being.

258
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:44,769
I know that you're concerned about Eig,

259
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:48,529
hence I'm letting you know
that Eig is not dead yet.

260
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:51,729
However, you must keep this a secret

261
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:53,529
in case the information is leaked.

262
00:15:53,609 --> 00:15:57,169
The news reported
that the cyanide murder case

263
00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:00,249
is related to
the serial murder case three years ago.

264
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:02,849
If the serial killer is
the same person as three years ago,

265
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:04,689
that means

266
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:07,089
the serial murder case has returned.

267
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:10,049
Do you know how serious is this?

268
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:15,529
Due to the police's fallacy, the killer
is on the loose for three years.

269
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:16,209
That's right.

270
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:18,009
If that so,

271
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:20,969
we will

272
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:23,489
face tremendous public opinion pressure.

273
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:26,129
So, you must take this case seriously

274
00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:27,969
and solve the case soonest possible.

275
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:29,769
Did you understand?

276
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:31,929
Yes, Chief.

277
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:55,289
This is for you.

278
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:57,409
Eat up.

279
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:03,249
Thank you.

280
00:17:12,249 --> 00:17:13,049
I have a question.

281
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:15,849
When you were in academy,

282
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:19,929
why did you choose
to do a report on serial murder case?

283
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:34,889
I'm interested in
Thailand's serial murder cases

284
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:37,049
as it isn't common.

285
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,569
I would like to find out

286
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:42,009
the motive of the murderer too.

287
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:43,249
Are you talking about Thana?

288
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:46,929
Thana is just a suspect.

289
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:49,969
The evidence that the police found
was the hair strands on the victim.

290
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:51,849
But when the police
issued an arrest warrant,

291
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:56,609
he went missing.

292
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,409
Well, have you read his suicide note?

293
00:18:01,889 --> 00:18:04,249
What's the message of his suicide note?

294
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:06,849
It's short and simple.

295
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:09,809
Goodbye.

296
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:12,689
I'm going to end my own life.

297
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:16,929
Have you watched
the interviews with his friends?

298
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:19,729
What was he like with his friends?

299
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:22,089
I didn't research that thoroughly.

300
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:30,209
That's a pity.

301
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:32,449
I always thought
that Thana's suicide note

302
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:36,369
is meant for someone

303
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:38,969
who is really important to him.

304
00:18:49,249 --> 00:18:49,929
Da.

305
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:52,329
What's the progress
between Vita and Sen?

306
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:54,489
Well.

307
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:56,569
Are you okay now?

308
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:57,929
What do you mean?

309
00:18:58,009 --> 00:18:59,529
You should know

310
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:00,929
what I mean.

311
00:19:03,729 --> 00:19:04,649
Well.

312
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:09,289
How else could I feel?

313
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:11,089
It's good that Captain likes Vita.

314
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:12,969
I didn't really like him too.

315
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:14,649
You

316
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:16,129
have no idea at all.

317
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:20,929
You are the one who has no idea at all.

318
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:23,169
You don't even know that I like you.

319
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:24,969
Da.

320
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:27,009
Da.

321
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:31,489
Da.

322
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:33,209
Stop daydreaming.

323
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:37,769
I'll get back to work.

324
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:51,329
Thank you so much, Miss Mu.

325
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:53,489
Thanks for coming all the way here.

326
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:56,129
You're the master in
making traditional Thai pastries.

327
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:57,649
I'm sure that the wedding guests
would love these.

328
00:19:58,169 --> 00:19:59,089
It's okay.

329
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:01,889
Thanks for choosing us.

330
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:02,849
You're most welcome.

331
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:04,889
I'll go check on the venue.

332
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:06,209
Okay.

333
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:12,409
Let me help you with this.

334
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:13,249
Okay.

335
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:16,249
Let me do it.

336
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:22,169
Well, Mu.

337
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:23,089
What's the matter?

338
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:27,649
Have you been to the theme park?

339
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:30,209
I've only been here once.

340
00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:32,169
As I could not see,

341
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,449
my parents are afraid
that I might get lost.

342
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:36,169
I haven't been here since then.

343
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:40,289
Well, since we're here,

344
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:42,249
let's go and play.

345
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:44,969
Sure.

346
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:51,969
Are we going now?

347
00:20:53,729 --> 00:20:54,369
Mu.

348
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:55,889
Yes?

349
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:22,809
Today,

350
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:26,609
let me be your eyes.

351
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:03,609
Let's go.

352
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:06,969
Which way?

353
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:08,609
Follow me.

354
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:30,889
Wasu.

355
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:31,649
I'm here.

356
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:33,649
What's this sound? It sounds fun.

357
00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:40,249
That's just the music. Come on.

358
00:22:42,449 --> 00:22:43,569
I'm sorry.

359
00:22:44,249 --> 00:22:44,929
Come on.

360
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:30,089
What's the matter?

361
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:32,049
I'm tired.

362
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:33,529
Besides,

363
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:35,889
my legs are sore.

364
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:40,249
Well,

365
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:43,969
let me carry you on my back then.

366
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:46,049
Come on.

367
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:16,089
Wasu.

368
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:18,649
Did you go to the theme park?

369
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:19,849
I went with Mu.

370
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:23,489
We just had a near-death experience,
so we went there to relax.

371
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:25,409
It's considered as a date, right?

372
00:24:26,889 --> 00:24:28,649
I need to ask you something.

373
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:30,049
Go on.

374
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:32,369
When we date,

375
00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:37,409
how can we rate the date?

376
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:40,929
Did you have a date with Captain Pla?

377
00:24:42,889 --> 00:24:43,809
Hurry and spill the beans.

378
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,689
Tell me, quick.

379
00:24:46,689 --> 00:24:48,129
No.

380
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:49,129
It's Sen.

381
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:50,809
Sen.

382
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:53,609
The playboy from
that problematic family?

383
00:24:55,489 --> 00:24:56,689
Do you like him then?

384
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:58,689
Sen said that he loves me.

385
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:05,209
I thought I can give him
a chance before I say no.

386
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:06,769
It's the same as investigation.

387
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:09,169
We list out all the probabilities

388
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:12,289
before we make the decision.

389
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:16,129
In the end, the evidence and
truth will reveal themselves.

390
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:19,889
Vita.

391
00:25:19,969 --> 00:25:22,089
Love is simple.

392
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:23,449
It's either a yes or no.

393
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:26,609
Why do you have so many weird ideas?

394
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:29,929
Okay, never mind.

395
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:31,009
Let's put it this way.

396
00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:32,809
Listen. Love

397
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:36,089
has no standards. It's not a theory.

398
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,249
If you wish to know your heart,

399
00:25:39,129 --> 00:25:41,249
have a date with Sen.

400
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:43,529
Then, ask yourself if he's
the one. It's as simple as that.

401
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:47,769
How do we know if he's not the one?

402
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:51,809
That

403
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:54,609
depends on your feelings.

404
00:25:55,169 --> 00:25:57,489
Are you comfortable with him?

405
00:25:58,129 --> 00:25:59,449
Does your heart start racing?

406
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:01,009
Are you happy?

407
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:04,289
Heart start racing?

408
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:13,289
(Heart rate, 97/minute.
Above average, 61-76/minute.)

409
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:37,689
(How's work today?)

410
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:40,209
(I fixed a security camera
in Sen's house.)

411
00:26:40,609 --> 00:26:43,129
(I can keep watch on him live.)

412
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:47,089
Sen.

413
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:48,529
(As a police officer,)

414
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:51,409
(it's not appropriate
to keep watch on suspect)

415
00:26:51,449 --> 00:26:52,369
(with security camera.)

416
00:26:56,609 --> 00:26:57,609
(Noted, Captain.)

417
00:26:57,929 --> 00:26:59,049
(Thank you for your reminder.)

418
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:12,289
I have highlighted the important points

419
00:27:12,689 --> 00:27:15,769
and stated my opinions on the notes.

420
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:18,609
The whole team will
be on the field today.

421
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:19,649
Da.

422
00:27:19,729 --> 00:27:20,449
Yes.

423
00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:25,089
Investigate the source of the cyanide.

424
00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:26,089
Me and Ming

425
00:27:26,449 --> 00:27:27,569
will go to Thana's house.

426
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:29,129
It has been abandoned for quite a while.

427
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:30,489
Ning and Mr. Han.

428
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:31,529
- Yes.
- Yes.

429
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,049
Keep watch on Eig.

430
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:35,769
If there's any emergencies,
report to me immediately.

431
00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:37,289
- Okay.
- Noted.

432
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:38,929
Dismiss.

433
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:40,449
Captain.

434
00:27:42,689 --> 00:27:43,569
What about me?

435
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:00,649
Hello.

436
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,809
Thank you for trusting me, Captain Pla.

437
00:28:06,889 --> 00:28:09,009
If I'm not the suspect,

438
00:28:09,449 --> 00:28:11,049
I wouldn't have
the chance to be with Vita.

439
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:12,689
You're welcome.

440
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:14,529
If you did commit the crime,

441
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:18,289
you'll regret
staying close to the police.

442
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:22,009
I didn't even kill a mosquito.

443
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:24,089
I'm pretty sure
that I didn't kill anyone.

444
00:28:24,729 --> 00:28:26,609
Hence, right now, this moment.

445
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:28,049
It feels like

446
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:31,809
I've won the lottery.

447
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:33,529
All thanks to you.

448
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:35,369
Did you hear him?

449
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:37,649
He treats you like a lottery.

450
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:38,729
An important lottery.

451
00:28:38,729 --> 00:28:39,649
Well.

452
00:28:39,889 --> 00:28:42,649
I hope you can keep watch on Sen.

453
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:44,929
If there's any emergencies,
report to me immediately.

454
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:49,449
Also, if you think
that he's a dangerous person,

455
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:53,169
you are allowed to use violence.

456
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:55,729
Got it.

457
00:28:56,129 --> 00:28:56,809
Great.

458
00:28:57,689 --> 00:28:58,569
Take care.

459
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:05,449
Come on, Sen.

460
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:07,849
By the way,

461
00:29:08,249 --> 00:29:11,609
is this considered
as our first date, Vita?

462
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:13,169
No.

463
00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:15,209
This is work to me.

464
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:16,769
Besides.

465
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:20,929
Is this a power bank?

466
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:22,849
Ouch!

467
00:29:23,489 --> 00:29:25,369
I'll keep watch on you.

468
00:30:58,929 --> 00:30:59,849
Ming.

469
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:01,849
What's the matter?

470
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:04,049
Don't you find this odd?

471
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:07,849
The fridge hasn't
been used for a long time.

472
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:10,649
It's covered in dust.

473
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,649
However, why is this spot clean?

474
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:16,529
Look at the mark.

475
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:22,169
Seems like someone was here recently

476
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:24,049
and took away a fridge magnet.

477
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,369
Did you mean

478
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:27,529
that it could be Thana?

479
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:30,929
I don't think that it's him.

480
00:31:31,729 --> 00:31:34,489
His way of committing murders
indicates that he's a meticulous person.

481
00:31:35,449 --> 00:31:37,009
It has been three years now.

482
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:40,009
He didn't need
to destroy the evidence now.

483
00:31:40,449 --> 00:31:42,209
The magnet that was here.

484
00:31:44,329 --> 00:31:46,129
It's either a travel souvenir,

485
00:31:46,649 --> 00:31:48,049
a family photo,

486
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:49,849
or a photo of his lover.

487
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:52,449
However, it's certain
that whoever that took away the photo

488
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:55,169
has something to do with Thana.

489
00:31:56,929 --> 00:31:58,449
He or she doesn't want us to find out

490
00:31:59,969 --> 00:32:01,969
about his or her
relationship with Thana.

491
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:04,729
Ming.

492
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:10,049
What's wrong with you?

493
00:32:12,489 --> 00:32:13,249
It's nothing.

494
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:16,969
I've asked you to investigate on Thana.

495
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:18,089
Did you find anything?

496
00:32:19,449 --> 00:32:20,609
Nothing yet.

497
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:22,729
Please hurry up.

498
00:32:24,449 --> 00:32:26,289
I think there's someone behind this.

499
00:32:56,729 --> 00:32:57,809
Take this back to analyze.

500
00:33:00,969 --> 00:33:02,009
Let's go.

501
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:02,969
Okay.

502
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:35,089
It's past working hours now.

503
00:33:35,969 --> 00:33:38,009
I'll take this as our first date.

504
00:33:38,689 --> 00:33:39,409
Thank you.

505
00:33:40,849 --> 00:33:43,369
I always come to this restaurant alone.

506
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:45,129
I'm a regular here.

507
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:48,009
It's my first bringing
someone important here.

508
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:51,129
Their signature dish

509
00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:52,809
is charcoal-braised fish with sauce.

510
00:33:52,849 --> 00:33:54,209
This is the fish. This is the sauce.

511
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:55,769
It's the restaurant's signature sauce.

512
00:33:55,849 --> 00:33:59,769
It's a secret recipe handed down
from the owner's great-grandmother.

513
00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:04,649
It's rich but blends well with the fish.

514
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:08,489
Just like lovers who have
just confessed their love to each other.

515
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:10,169
Please enjoy your meal.

516
00:34:11,209 --> 00:34:12,049
After you.

517
00:34:13,249 --> 00:34:15,009
I've seen this for a few times.

518
00:34:15,049 --> 00:34:15,529
I'll do this.

519
00:34:15,569 --> 00:34:18,849
You only beautify yourself
when we have selfies.

520
00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:20,129
Well,

521
00:34:20,209 --> 00:34:21,369
are you that competitive?

522
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,129
No wonder you're dumped.

523
00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:25,689
No, I'm the one who dumped him.

524
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:27,169
I don't want to talk about it.

525
00:34:27,249 --> 00:34:29,609
But didn't you date him after me?

526
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:31,409
Just let me know
if you like to have leftovers.

527
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:32,849
Leftovers?

528
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:34,009
I dated him first.

529
00:34:34,049 --> 00:34:35,569
You're the one having leftovers.

530
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:37,209
Here's my proof.

531
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:39,769
This necklace is
my new year's gift from him.

532
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:41,649
I even spent the whole day with him.

533
00:34:41,729 --> 00:34:45,369
You only posted a photo
with him on Valentine's day.

534
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:49,369
Hey, I got the necklace too.

535
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:52,129
But I got it on Loy Krathong
(Thai calendar, December 15).

536
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:53,849
It's even earlier than New Year's Eve.

537
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:57,889
Gosh.

538
00:35:02,609 --> 00:35:04,889
I think that the restaurant
has changed their chef.

539
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:06,169
The sauce doesn't
taste as good as before.

540
00:35:06,249 --> 00:35:08,249
Let's go to
a different restaurant, shall we?

541
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:10,769
Look at the diamond earrings.

542
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:12,689
It's my birthday gift from him.

543
00:35:12,769 --> 00:35:13,489
Hold on.

544
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:14,489
Please wait a minute.

545
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:17,249
Look, I have it too.

546
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:19,089
What a fool! Don't you remember?

547
00:35:19,169 --> 00:35:20,569
We have the same birthday.

548
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,000
Vita.

549
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:26,809
Excuse me.

550
00:35:27,249 --> 00:35:28,289
Please don't fight.

551
00:35:29,529 --> 00:35:31,129
He gifted you the same gift

552
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:32,449
and the dates are near.

553
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:33,769
Isn't that obvious enough?

554
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:36,369
He was two-timing the both of you.

555
00:35:37,729 --> 00:35:38,809
- Two-timing?
- Two-timing?

556
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:44,369
That's right.

557
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:47,009
Hi, it's been a while.

558
00:35:47,089 --> 00:35:48,449
What is your name again?

559
00:35:52,689 --> 00:35:53,609
Dirtbag.

560
00:35:53,689 --> 00:35:54,729
Loser.

561
00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:04,729
Ask that man to pay for the bill, Miss.

562
00:36:15,689 --> 00:36:17,449
I need to return
to the police station for work.

563
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:19,689
I'll drop you off here.

564
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:21,289
Captain.

565
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:22,489
Actually,

566
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:24,969
you really like Vita, don't you?

567
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:32,769
I just want to say

568
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:36,329
that Sen looks like a playboy.

569
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:38,409
However, in front of Vita,

570
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:40,089
he's completely different.

571
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:42,769
He knows well about giving.

572
00:36:43,249 --> 00:36:43,969
Although Vita

573
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:46,409
is slow

574
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:47,729
and fuzzy,

575
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,569
if Sen is given enough time and chances,

576
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:52,649
Vita might fall in love with him.

577
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:57,049
If you really like Vita,

578
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:58,289
you should

579
00:36:58,649 --> 00:36:59,889
make an effort.

580
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:02,009
Or maybe put in
a little more effort than Sen.

581
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:03,249
Then, you can win over her.

582
00:37:07,209 --> 00:37:07,889
Okay.

583
00:37:09,049 --> 00:37:11,249
I know what to do.

584
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:13,489
That's great.

585
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:35,729
Hello.

586
00:37:36,009 --> 00:37:36,849
(Hello, Vita.)

587
00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:38,529
(Where are you?)

588
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:40,209
I'm

589
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:42,009
somewhere near Ekkamai.

590
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:43,409
Are you alone?

591
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:45,409
I'm with Sen.

592
00:37:46,009 --> 00:37:50,249
Report to me about Sen's status
every hour from now on.

593
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:52,809
No matter who he sees,
where he is and what he does.

594
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:54,329
(Additionally, take photos as well.)

595
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:55,369
Why?

596
00:37:55,449 --> 00:37:58,369
A playboy like Sen has a lot of tactics.

597
00:37:58,689 --> 00:38:00,529
If he's a criminal,

598
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:03,049
he might be a cunning person.

599
00:38:03,409 --> 00:38:04,369
You need to be careful.

600
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,969
But he's just our suspect now.

601
00:38:07,009 --> 00:38:08,849
Just to be safe.

602
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:11,089
As a police officer,
you need to be alert at all times.

603
00:38:11,649 --> 00:38:12,449
Okay.

604
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:26,809
Thank you.

605
00:38:31,169 --> 00:38:31,969
Vita.

606
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:34,849
The pain has spread to my arms.

607
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:37,809
I need you to help me
apply the medicine.

608
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:39,329
I can't do this on my own.

609
00:38:39,409 --> 00:38:41,049
If you dare to request anything else,

610
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:43,249
I'll make your arms hurt even more.

611
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:44,849
Okay then.

612
00:38:45,249 --> 00:38:46,329
I can do this on my own.

613
00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:50,929
You bought me painkillers too.

614
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:51,809
You're really thoughtful.

615
00:38:52,649 --> 00:38:53,329
This

616
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:54,609
is for Captain.

617
00:38:55,889 --> 00:38:56,649
Report.

618
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:12,289
Smile, Vita. One, two.

619
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:16,409
Send this photo to Captain.

620
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:18,769
The time and location
are captured in the photo.

621
00:39:22,449 --> 00:39:23,449
Good.

622
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:24,489
I know right.

623
00:39:26,689 --> 00:39:30,289
However, your Captain might be furious.

624
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:31,329
I'm not sure.

625
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,729
Why would he be furious?

626
00:39:34,449 --> 00:39:35,449
Well?

627
00:39:35,729 --> 00:39:36,649
I'm not quite sure.

628
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:38,289
I forgot to tell you this.

629
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:41,329
I decided to help you
with the investigation

630
00:39:41,409 --> 00:39:43,169
in return for your promise of
having three dates with me.

631
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:45,969
How do we investigate?

632
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,929
(Vita sends you a photo)

633
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:34,369
How is it, Miss Vita?

634
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:36,249
I have good connections.

635
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:37,889
I just need to make one call

636
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:41,689
and I can get my hands on the security
footage of all the night clubs.

637
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:42,929
Can you please keep quiet?

638
00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:44,769
I need to focus.

639
00:40:50,769 --> 00:40:52,409
This car is suspicious, Captain.

640
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:54,849
Sen.

641
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,089
I'm sorry.

642
00:41:07,129 --> 00:41:08,049
This one.

643
00:41:08,529 --> 00:41:09,329
Lina

644
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:11,009
is his prey
that he's targeting all along.

645
00:41:12,689 --> 00:41:13,489
I think...

646
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:17,929
I'm sorry, I thought
I'm in the police station.

647
00:41:20,969 --> 00:41:22,049
No worries.

648
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:24,409
I'm starting to get used to it now.

649
00:41:27,729 --> 00:41:28,729
Apologies, Sen.

650
00:41:28,929 --> 00:41:29,849
I need to get going.

651
00:41:30,609 --> 00:41:31,289
Also,

652
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:33,049
thanks for the information.

653
00:41:34,809 --> 00:41:35,609
Hold on, Vita.

654
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:39,409
I hope that you can stay.

655
00:41:45,649 --> 00:41:46,489
Vita.

656
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:48,249
Let me send you there at least.

657
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:50,609
You can reach there faster.

658
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:52,049
Is this okay?

659
00:41:57,329 --> 00:41:58,769
In such a short period of time,

660
00:41:59,249 --> 00:42:01,729
the murderer murdered
someone with the same method.

661
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:04,889
Regardless if he's the same
murderer as three years ago,

662
00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:07,729
you need to solve the case quickly.

663
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:13,849
The victims from both cases
died of cyanide poisoning.

664
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:16,489
There are two differences.
First, it's the knotting technique.

665
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:18,609
Based on the shoe prints, it's deduced

666
00:42:18,689 --> 00:42:21,249
that the suspect's shoe size is size 42.

667
00:42:21,969 --> 00:42:24,889
It's similar to our suspect, Thana.
