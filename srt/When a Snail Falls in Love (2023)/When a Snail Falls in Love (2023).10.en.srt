00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,300
(An adaptation of the novel
"When a Snail Falls in Love" by Ding Mo)

4
00:01:51,686 --> 00:01:52,526
Vita.

5
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,606
I need to talk to you.

6
00:01:56,806 --> 00:01:57,766
Is it about Mu?

7
00:01:58,806 --> 00:01:59,886
How did you know that?

8
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:01,446
Because you're my brother.

9
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:03,446
I know you very well.

10
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:12,086
Well.

11
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:13,086
Here's the thing.

12
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,486
I feel that I can't

13
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:16,366
win over Mu's heart now.

14
00:02:17,086 --> 00:02:18,766
I should've attended her birthday party

15
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:20,646
and given her a birthday present,

16
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:21,806
but I didn't.

17
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:26,526
It's because of Xin's death
and something that happened earlier.

18
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:28,726
But now

19
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,046
I'm ready to start over.

20
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:34,326
Just start if you're ready.

21
00:02:34,406 --> 00:02:35,206
That's all you need to do.

22
00:02:36,286 --> 00:02:37,726
You make it sound so easy.

23
00:02:37,806 --> 00:02:39,646
You're not me.

24
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,486
I didn't say it's easy, Wasu.

25
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:42,926
But I think

26
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:44,406
you should know very well

27
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:47,006
about how to please a girl.

28
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:50,166
Instead, you're grounded here
by your annoyances

29
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:52,886
because you lack courage.

30
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:54,086
And that's your situation now.

31
00:02:55,486 --> 00:02:58,846
If you think Mu deserves
your effort to start over,

32
00:02:59,926 --> 00:03:03,046
you should face her

33
00:03:03,126 --> 00:03:05,806
no matter how afraid you are.

34
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,566
Tell her your feeling honestly.

35
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:10,166
It's way better than
torturing yourself like this.

36
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:17,846
Wait.

37
00:03:18,126 --> 00:03:19,966
How do you know so much about this?

38
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,486
Are you seeing someone?

39
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:25,966
Is there anyone in the police station
courting you?

40
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:28,846
Is it Captain?

41
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:37,486
I have the last assessment tomorrow.

42
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:38,806
If I sail through it,

43
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,606
I can officially be part of the team

44
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:42,686
and work on big cases with Captain.

45
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:46,726
Tell me,

46
00:03:48,526 --> 00:03:49,526
does Captain

47
00:03:50,326 --> 00:03:54,166
train you like how he trains others?

48
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:07,606
(Ten minutes ago)

49
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:08,726
I'd like to ask you

50
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:10,966
to prepare for the upcoming assessment.

51
00:04:11,406 --> 00:04:12,446
Assessment?

52
00:04:12,926 --> 00:04:13,926
In two weeks,

53
00:04:14,326 --> 00:04:17,086
our department
will have a physical fitness assessment

54
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,926
with two other elite teams.

55
00:04:19,006 --> 00:04:20,806
One is for fostering friendship.

56
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:25,646
The other is to determine which team
is the top in the police department.

57
00:04:25,726 --> 00:04:27,526
I want to take this opportunity to test

58
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:32,686
if you can join our department
as an official member.

59
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:33,406
Okay.

60
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,046
I'll make it.

61
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:37,526
Three matches in total.

62
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:40,046
You should at least win two.

63
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:41,846
Otherwise, you won't pass.

64
00:04:42,806 --> 00:04:44,446
I'll win the three matches.

65
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:47,646
Don't get ahead of yourself.

66
00:04:47,726 --> 00:04:49,406
We will continue the training as usual.

67
00:04:49,886 --> 00:04:51,846
This time, I'm going
to train you more intensively.

68
00:04:52,286 --> 00:04:53,126
Yes.

69
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:53,926
Thank you.

70
00:04:58,766 --> 00:04:59,726
Let me make this clear first.

71
00:05:00,286 --> 00:05:03,166
No personal feelings should
be involved in this assessment.

72
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:04,566
I won't help you.

73
00:05:04,646 --> 00:05:05,566
Personal feelings?

74
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:08,366
Well...

75
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:11,446
What do you mean by "personal feelings"?

76
00:05:11,526 --> 00:05:12,646
I mean...

77
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:21,486
I mean...

78
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:25,526
We're just a coach and a trainee.

79
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:28,126
Because I'm just a judge

80
00:05:28,566 --> 00:05:30,366
during the assessment.

81
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:32,886
All right.

82
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:34,526
It's my pleasure.

83
00:05:36,326 --> 00:05:37,966
What if I fail the assessment?

84
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:41,566
If you fail,

85
00:05:42,366 --> 00:05:44,686
you won't be included
in the on-site investigation afterward.

86
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:46,126
So, I will

87
00:05:46,886 --> 00:05:48,366
investigate Luger on my own.

88
00:05:49,086 --> 00:05:50,086
You have to stay out of it.

89
00:05:50,486 --> 00:05:52,166
If so, I must pass the assessment.

90
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:18,286
(Case File of Luger)

91
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:21,806
(Vita sent a message)

92
00:06:23,806 --> 00:06:27,686
Coach, besides morning training,
I'll train in the evening too

93
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:29,766
since the assessment is coming soon.

94
00:06:33,486 --> 00:06:35,846
(Noted. Good luck with the assessment.)

95
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:43,166
(Noted. Good luck with the assessment.)

96
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,406
Wasu.

97
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,806
Are you here to buy desserts?

98
00:07:02,886 --> 00:07:04,126
Let's go inside.

99
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:11,166
Mu isn't here.

100
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:12,726
She headed out for something else.

101
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,606
It's fine.

102
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:17,126
But I have an idea

103
00:07:17,206 --> 00:07:18,806
to let you meet with
my sister every day.

104
00:07:24,326 --> 00:07:25,846
You can sign up for a dessert course.

105
00:07:26,886 --> 00:07:27,806
Fill up this.

106
00:07:37,726 --> 00:07:39,366
You're taking advantage of the shop.

107
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:40,686
How cunning.

108
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:41,846
Hey, no.

109
00:07:41,926 --> 00:07:43,046
That sounds rather harsh.

110
00:07:49,446 --> 00:07:50,166
Ning.

111
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:50,886
Yes?

112
00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:53,526
Where have Captain and Mr. Han gone?

113
00:07:54,246 --> 00:07:58,206
They went to the headquarters
for a meeting early this morning.

114
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:09,726
Da, help me. This is too many.

115
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:16,446
Where's Miss Vita?

116
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:21,286
Mr. Pla asked me to send these here.

117
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:24,286
Thank you.

118
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,206
How wonderful.

119
00:08:29,286 --> 00:08:31,326
It's lunch boxes for you.

120
00:08:32,206 --> 00:08:34,326
Because Captain thinks
I'm the weakest one on the team.

121
00:08:34,406 --> 00:08:36,686
He's worried that I might slow you down.

122
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,806
If you want this,
I can order one for you.

123
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,286
But I must finish

124
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,006
these two sets myself.

125
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:43,406
Enjoy your food, Vita.

126
00:08:44,046 --> 00:08:44,966
I'm not envious

127
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:46,086
but

128
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:47,446
this one.

129
00:08:49,726 --> 00:08:50,366
Why did you kick me?

130
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,606
I don't want them at all.

131
00:08:55,446 --> 00:08:56,446
Are you sure?

132
00:08:56,526 --> 00:08:57,766
I can order one for you.

133
00:08:58,406 --> 00:08:59,326
Give me your phone.

134
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,606
Take it. You owe me money.

135
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:34,006
Didn't Captain come
for your training today?

136
00:09:34,646 --> 00:09:35,726
Coach...

137
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:38,046
Captain

138
00:09:38,606 --> 00:09:40,846
will only be back in the evening.

139
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:44,286
Just call him what you've used to.

140
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:49,486
Only three days left
before the assessment.

141
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:50,446
Good luck.

142
00:09:50,646 --> 00:09:52,006
I won't lose to you.

143
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:54,686
We will do our very best for the match.

144
00:09:58,206 --> 00:09:59,366
Vita.

145
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,046
Do you know what kind of girls
Captain like?

146
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:06,086
No idea.

147
00:10:12,686 --> 00:10:13,966
Let's compete.

148
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:26,686
Did you go training
with Captain today again?

149
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:29,326
No, he wasn't in.
I went training myself.

150
00:10:32,726 --> 00:10:33,966
Let me ask you.

151
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:36,526
Does Captain

152
00:10:36,606 --> 00:10:37,886
have a girlfriend?

153
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,406
I don't think so.

154
00:10:41,486 --> 00:10:43,646
What kind of girls does he like?

155
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:47,286
Just a heads-up.

156
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:49,886
He might have
different feelings for you.

157
00:10:50,646 --> 00:10:52,246
He's my superior.

158
00:10:53,126 --> 00:10:54,406
I know.

159
00:10:55,726 --> 00:10:57,046
Let me be very clear.

160
00:10:57,846 --> 00:11:00,966
It's not that I don't want you
to have a boyfriend.

161
00:11:01,646 --> 00:11:02,886
I just hope
that he isn't a police officer.

162
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:05,166
Your current job has already
exposed you to dangers.

163
00:11:05,246 --> 00:11:07,366
If you were to date that Captain guy

164
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:09,446
who looks crazier than you...

165
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:13,206
Pla.

166
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:14,406
He's Pla.

167
00:11:14,486 --> 00:11:16,126
He's not crazy.

168
00:11:16,646 --> 00:11:17,646
Vita.

169
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:19,126
I'm serious.

170
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:20,446
I want you to be safe

171
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:23,326
and not date someone
who's exposed to dangers at any time.

172
00:11:23,406 --> 00:11:25,006
I've become stronger.

173
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:26,566
I can protect myself.

174
00:11:26,646 --> 00:11:27,966
What I mean is

175
00:11:28,046 --> 00:11:30,606
that you need to be mentally secure.

176
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:32,486
Do you get me, silly girl?

177
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,006
I have you.

178
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:37,406
But I assure you

179
00:11:37,486 --> 00:11:39,006
that I'll protect myself well.

180
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:44,886
Pinky promise.

181
00:11:47,486 --> 00:11:48,966
I've brought you some desserts.

182
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:56,726
I went to Mu's dessert shop earlier.

183
00:11:57,326 --> 00:11:58,846
I had signed up
for a dessert course there.

184
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:02,726
So, I'll be starting to have
many Mu's desserts for days to come?

185
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:06,166
And desserts handmade by your brother.

186
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:11,966
I remember that you made a cake for me
when we were little.

187
00:12:12,246 --> 00:12:13,886
I was sent to the hospital after that.

188
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:15,366
So,

189
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:17,286
will the history repeat this time?

190
00:12:22,766 --> 00:12:24,686
That's not right.

191
00:12:25,006 --> 00:12:26,526
That's hurtful.

192
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:27,926
My dessert teacher is Mu now.

193
00:12:30,206 --> 00:12:32,646
I have an assessment tomorrow.

194
00:12:33,006 --> 00:12:34,206
I'm going to bed now.

195
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:41,806
I'll eat it myself.

196
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:51,206
Hello, everyone.

197
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:53,326
As the chairman of this activity,

198
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,246
I sincerely appreciate all the units

199
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:59,086
who participate
in the friendly match today.

200
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,726
We're the civil servants

201
00:13:01,966 --> 00:13:04,646
as well as the elite units
of the police department,

202
00:13:04,726 --> 00:13:07,886
so we have an annual assessment
for skills, physical fitness,

203
00:13:07,966 --> 00:13:10,246
and knowledge.

204
00:13:10,686 --> 00:13:13,526
Today, as the chairman,
I'd like to thank the headquarters

205
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:15,446
(CRU, PIT)
for supporting us in this activity

206
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:17,326
(NPCU)
on behalf of the three units.

207
00:13:17,886 --> 00:13:18,726
All right.

208
00:13:19,246 --> 00:13:20,966
I won't delay your time much.

209
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:22,326
Lastly, I hope

210
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:25,286
you can do your very best.

211
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:26,246
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

212
00:13:43,926 --> 00:13:47,166
I've prepared
some lucky stickers for you.

213
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,166
What for?

214
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,006
Ning.

215
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:53,046
I gave lucky stickers

216
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:56,846
to my high school friends
before we entered the exam hall.

217
00:13:57,326 --> 00:13:59,086
Instead of counting on this trick,

218
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,166
you should depend on yourself.

219
00:14:01,246 --> 00:14:02,166
Mr. Han.

220
00:14:02,246 --> 00:14:03,486
Spare her embarrassment.
She made this specifically for us.

221
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:04,206
Fine, give it to me.

222
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:09,966
The bear

223
00:14:12,326 --> 00:14:13,526
for Mr. Han.

224
00:14:14,726 --> 00:14:15,486
The fox

225
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:18,286
for Ning.

226
00:14:19,246 --> 00:14:19,886
Not bad.

227
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:20,886
The deer

228
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:24,366
for Ming.

229
00:14:25,646 --> 00:14:26,286
The horse

230
00:14:27,846 --> 00:14:28,726
for Da.

231
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:31,086
And me,

232
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,206
I'm the snail.

233
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:43,046
Captain is here.

234
00:14:43,126 --> 00:14:43,806
Let's go.

235
00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:45,966
Everyone!

236
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:46,846
Fall in.

237
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:51,046
Attention.

238
00:14:51,126 --> 00:14:52,046
At ease.

239
00:14:52,886 --> 00:14:55,846
This year, we have
three different athletics sports.

240
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,046
Every team will participate
in two sports.

241
00:14:58,126 --> 00:14:59,246
After that,

242
00:14:59,326 --> 00:15:02,926
judges will compile the scores and
select two teams with the highest scores

243
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:05,966
for the last sports.

244
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:07,766
Hopefully, you can do your very best.

245
00:15:08,846 --> 00:15:09,926
Do you hear me?

246
00:15:10,886 --> 00:15:11,726
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

247
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:21,966
Vita.

248
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:23,806
Where's Captain's sticker?

249
00:15:26,286 --> 00:15:27,166
He doesn't have one.

250
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,686
Captain is one of the judges today.

251
00:15:29,766 --> 00:15:31,086
He's not on our team.

252
00:15:32,126 --> 00:15:33,006
Is that funny?

253
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,126
Have you warmed up?

254
00:15:37,246 --> 00:15:37,886
Not yet.

255
00:15:37,966 --> 00:15:38,886
Go now.

256
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:41,206
Let's go get warmed up.

257
00:15:41,286 --> 00:15:42,446
Let's go.

258
00:15:43,206 --> 00:15:44,326
Keep your pace consistent.

259
00:15:44,406 --> 00:15:45,286
Come on. Warm up.

260
00:15:45,366 --> 00:15:46,766
Move. Be quick.

261
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:48,806
The first event,

262
00:15:49,326 --> 00:15:50,366
obstacle relay.

263
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,486
Each team will send
three representatives.

264
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,326
There will be three batons

265
00:15:55,406 --> 00:15:56,246
and three obstacles.

266
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:58,606
The team passes the final obstacle
and crosses the finish line first

267
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:00,566
will be the winning team.

268
00:16:00,646 --> 00:16:01,646
Everyone, get ready.

269
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:02,726
Let's start now.

270
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:11,926
Are you up for it?

271
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:13,086
- Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

272
00:16:22,206 --> 00:16:23,086
Ready.

273
00:16:36,686 --> 00:16:38,846
Come on, Ning!

274
00:16:39,846 --> 00:16:40,846
Go, Ning!

275
00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:43,086
Faster!

276
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,686
Faster! Come on!

277
00:16:44,766 --> 00:16:45,406
Faster!

278
00:16:45,486 --> 00:16:47,006
Faster, Ning!

279
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:53,126
Run!

280
00:16:53,206 --> 00:16:54,166
Stand up!

281
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,886
- Run!
- Well done.

282
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:57,966
- Run!
- Faster!

283
00:17:13,606 --> 00:17:14,446
- Go, Vita!
- Go!

284
00:17:14,886 --> 00:17:16,286
Faster, Vita!

285
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:18,766
Jump, Vita! Jump!

286
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:32,806
Come on, Vita!

287
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,326
Go! Faster!

288
00:17:34,406 --> 00:17:35,366
Faster! Go!

289
00:17:35,446 --> 00:17:36,086
Vita!

290
00:17:45,726 --> 00:17:47,166
- What's that?
- Vita, there.

291
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:48,526
- You dropped the baton.
- Over there.

292
00:17:48,606 --> 00:17:50,486
You left your baton there, Vita.

293
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:51,886
Baton!

294
00:17:58,606 --> 00:18:00,526
The winning team is Team Red.

295
00:18:03,304 --> 00:18:05,926
- Gosh.
- Great, our effort paid off.

296
00:18:10,686 --> 00:18:12,806
Your team lost
in the first event, Captain.

297
00:18:12,886 --> 00:18:14,006
It's not over yet.

298
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:15,926
We shall see.

299
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:17,526
I'll wait for your cheering moment.

300
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,046
(NPCU scored one point)

301
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:33,406
Next event,

302
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:34,526
shooting.

303
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:36,406
The rule is simple.

304
00:18:36,486 --> 00:18:38,806
All members of the three teams
will be in the game.

305
00:18:39,246 --> 00:18:41,886
The team who shoots the most opponents

306
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:43,206
within the allotted time

307
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:44,726
will be the winner.

308
00:18:45,406 --> 00:18:48,646
I'm looking forward to an exciting game.

309
00:18:49,486 --> 00:18:50,766
Once you're ready,

310
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:52,606
you may start.

311
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:53,886
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

312
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:03,086
Let's go.

313
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:33,166
We've been attacked too many times.
We should be at the last.

314
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:35,086
We must change our strategy now.

315
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,006
The two teams have a very similar way
of changing their spots.

316
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:39,766
Our advantage is
that Mr. Han can shoot accurately.

317
00:20:41,086 --> 00:20:41,926
Decoy.

318
00:21:24,046 --> 00:21:25,326
Mr. Han, I'm shot again.

319
00:21:25,406 --> 00:21:27,326
Stupid, whatever.

320
00:21:29,606 --> 00:21:30,526
Move.

321
00:22:41,766 --> 00:22:45,446
(PIT scored one point)

322
00:22:46,606 --> 00:22:50,446
The third event is a match
of defensive techniques,

323
00:22:51,446 --> 00:22:53,686
in one-on-one.

324
00:22:54,046 --> 00:22:57,926
Participants must
use MMA defensive skills.

325
00:22:58,886 --> 00:23:02,206
Whoever surrenders first,
the other side wins.

326
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:11,446
Starts.

327
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:38,926
Team White won.

328
00:24:31,046 --> 00:24:32,246
Team Red won.

329
00:24:40,966 --> 00:24:42,766
You went all out
but ended up hurting yourself.

330
00:24:42,846 --> 00:24:44,246
Do you think it's worth it?

331
00:24:45,566 --> 00:24:47,726
What fools you to fight
against the champion?

332
00:24:49,046 --> 00:24:49,726
Sit down.

333
00:24:50,126 --> 00:24:51,086
Careful.

334
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:56,446
I felt embarrassed just now,

335
00:24:58,606 --> 00:25:00,446
but now I think

336
00:25:01,806 --> 00:25:03,326
getting injured isn't so bad.

337
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:09,206
What about the game?
Are we going to lose?

338
00:25:10,686 --> 00:25:11,526
Not yet.

339
00:25:12,126 --> 00:25:13,126
Look over there.

340
00:25:46,566 --> 00:25:49,886
The opponent is an aggressive type
with constant charging.

341
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,566
But he's not good at close combat.

342
00:25:52,646 --> 00:25:55,046
So, to defeat him,

343
00:25:55,126 --> 00:25:57,806
you need to use both counter-attacks
and dodging skills,

344
00:25:57,886 --> 00:25:59,966
then seize the right chance
to bring him down.

345
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:03,326
Team White won.

346
00:27:14,886 --> 00:27:16,566
(PIT scored two points)

347
00:27:16,646 --> 00:27:17,806
Yeah!

348
00:27:19,686 --> 00:27:20,606
Thank you.

349
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:21,966
Well done.

350
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,766
Great job.

351
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:31,366
Congratulations, Captain.

352
00:27:31,446 --> 00:27:32,846
Thank you, Chief.

353
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:38,926
As the chairman,

354
00:27:39,406 --> 00:27:42,246
I hereby express my gratitude to
the members of the three units

355
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:44,406
for participating in
the friendly match this year.

356
00:27:44,486 --> 00:27:46,446
This activity ended on a good note.

357
00:27:46,886 --> 00:27:47,966
I hope

358
00:27:48,406 --> 00:27:51,366
we can gather again next year.

359
00:27:51,686 --> 00:27:52,566
This year,

360
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:54,406
thank you for your participation.

361
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:55,406
That's right.

362
00:28:02,686 --> 00:28:04,646
Everyone, attention!

363
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:15,286
- Whoa.
- Yeah!

364
00:28:15,366 --> 00:28:16,806
We won.

365
00:28:17,686 --> 00:28:19,286
Take them. Well done.

366
00:28:22,766 --> 00:28:23,846
Great.

367
00:28:25,926 --> 00:28:26,926
Yeah!

368
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,046
- Yeah!
- Let me take it.

369
00:28:29,646 --> 00:28:31,766
I want to take a photo.

370
00:28:31,846 --> 00:28:33,646
We won for the first time
in three years.

371
00:28:33,726 --> 00:28:35,286
Congratulations.

372
00:28:36,686 --> 00:28:39,406
It's a big surprise
that you passed the assessment.

373
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:41,206
Thank you, Coach.

374
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,086
Thank you.

375
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,006
Stop calling me "Coach."

376
00:28:44,086 --> 00:28:45,086
Because

377
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:47,406
the training will end here.

378
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,606
But you should continue the training
when you have time.

379
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:53,686
Thank you for coaching me.

380
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,726
What you're facing next is important.

381
00:28:56,886 --> 00:28:57,806
You've become

382
00:28:57,886 --> 00:28:59,766
my trustable members.

383
00:28:59,846 --> 00:29:01,406
I'm relying on you now.

384
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:02,446
Excellent.

385
00:29:02,726 --> 00:29:03,366
Yes.

386
00:29:07,526 --> 00:29:09,286
Congratulations, Captain Pla.

387
00:29:09,366 --> 00:29:10,286
Thank you.

388
00:29:10,366 --> 00:29:11,406
We haven't seen each other
for some time.

389
00:29:11,486 --> 00:29:12,126
Look at this.

390
00:29:12,206 --> 00:29:12,846
Yes.

391
00:29:13,406 --> 00:29:14,566
- Congratulations, Captain.
- Thank you.

392
00:29:14,646 --> 00:29:16,526
Vita, Ming. Hurry over for a photo.

393
00:29:16,606 --> 00:29:17,766
Come on over.

394
00:29:17,846 --> 00:29:19,446
The excellent person
will stand in the middle.

395
00:29:19,526 --> 00:29:20,566
Done?

396
00:29:20,646 --> 00:29:21,326
Come on.

397
00:29:21,406 --> 00:29:22,726
1 2 3
One, two, three.

398
00:29:22,966 --> 00:29:24,166
Cheese.

399
00:29:31,286 --> 00:29:32,446
How do you feel, Ming?

400
00:29:32,966 --> 00:29:33,966
Are you tired?

401
00:29:35,286 --> 00:29:36,446
I'm good.

402
00:29:36,766 --> 00:29:38,126
I feel relaxed.

403
00:29:38,206 --> 00:29:39,526
You too.

404
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:40,686
Are you tired?

405
00:29:41,486 --> 00:29:42,726
Thanks to you, our team won.

406
00:29:49,006 --> 00:29:50,926
What has happened?

407
00:29:54,486 --> 00:29:55,166
I...

408
00:29:56,286 --> 00:29:58,726
I don't know how to face you.

409
00:29:59,246 --> 00:30:00,406
Sometimes,

410
00:30:00,486 --> 00:30:02,766
you can sense my feelings,

411
00:30:04,486 --> 00:30:06,486
but sometimes you seem

412
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,006
to be so clueless.

413
00:30:14,726 --> 00:30:15,606
Ming.

414
00:30:17,606 --> 00:30:21,166
I admit that I don't know
what you're talking about.

415
00:30:23,006 --> 00:30:25,926
But you can tell me outright.

416
00:30:32,766 --> 00:30:33,726
Vita.

417
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:37,206
I...

418
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:45,606
Let go!

419
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:48,206
Let go!

420
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:49,406
Who are you?

421
00:30:49,486 --> 00:30:50,286
Ming!

422
00:30:57,286 --> 00:30:58,406
Vita.

423
00:30:58,846 --> 00:31:00,686
Vita, is that you?

424
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:02,366
Hush, Ming.

425
00:31:02,606 --> 00:31:03,726
I'm here.

426
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,206
I'm clueless

427
00:31:05,286 --> 00:31:06,686
why someone brought us here.

428
00:31:07,286 --> 00:31:08,086
Ming.

429
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,566
Don't be nervous.

430
00:31:09,646 --> 00:31:11,006
We need to stay composed.

431
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:12,606
Uncuff ourselves first.

432
00:31:18,366 --> 00:31:19,326
Slowly sit up.

433
00:31:21,526 --> 00:31:22,366
Ming.

434
00:31:22,446 --> 00:31:23,126
What?

435
00:31:23,206 --> 00:31:24,366
I found a wire.

436
00:31:29,126 --> 00:31:30,326
Vita, calm down.

437
00:31:30,406 --> 00:31:31,486
Calm down.

438
00:31:31,566 --> 00:31:33,166
We need to unlock the cuff first.

439
00:31:53,326 --> 00:31:55,966
Over here. Be careful.
Don't hurt yourself.

440
00:31:56,886 --> 00:31:57,966
I'm really good at this.

441
00:31:58,446 --> 00:31:59,486
- Can you?
- Yes.

442
00:31:59,566 --> 00:32:00,886
Give me a second, Vita.

443
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:10,406
Vita, wait. Stay still.

444
00:32:12,646 --> 00:32:13,366
One more second, Vita.

445
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:18,406
Vita.

446
00:32:18,486 --> 00:32:19,606
Come here.

447
00:32:19,686 --> 00:32:20,246
Vita.

448
00:32:20,326 --> 00:32:20,926
Stand right there.

449
00:32:21,446 --> 00:32:22,206
Don't come nearer.

450
00:32:23,406 --> 00:32:24,166
No.

451
00:32:24,966 --> 00:32:25,686
Don't come nearer.

452
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:28,926
Okay.

453
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:30,126
I surrender.

454
00:32:32,486 --> 00:32:33,366
I surrender.

455
00:32:41,846 --> 00:32:42,926
Stop. Stop it.

456
00:32:45,646 --> 00:32:46,526
No, stop it.

457
00:32:47,126 --> 00:32:48,046
What do you want?

458
00:32:48,126 --> 00:32:50,046
Tell me the password
to the information system

459
00:32:50,126 --> 00:32:51,646
and I'll let you go.

460
00:32:51,726 --> 00:32:52,446
No.

461
00:32:52,526 --> 00:32:53,326
There's no password.

462
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:54,686
Do you want your friend to die

463
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:55,926
for a mere password?

464
00:32:57,246 --> 00:32:57,966
No.

465
00:32:59,326 --> 00:33:00,326
I can be your hostage.

466
00:33:00,886 --> 00:33:02,566
Let her go. I'll replace her.

467
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:04,806
Vita, you've been so kind to me,

468
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:06,206
but I don't.

469
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:08,046
- Let go of her. I'll replace her.
- No, Ming.

470
00:33:08,126 --> 00:33:09,206
How about this?

471
00:33:09,606 --> 00:33:11,766
If you refuse to tell,
I'll crack her head.

472
00:33:12,246 --> 00:33:13,126
No.

473
00:33:13,206 --> 00:33:14,326
Okay, I surrender.

474
00:33:15,046 --> 00:33:17,046
I surrender.

475
00:33:20,446 --> 00:33:21,246
Tell me now.

476
00:33:25,646 --> 00:33:26,406
The password is...

477
00:33:26,486 --> 00:33:27,326
No, Ming.

478
00:33:29,686 --> 00:33:32,846
One, two. One, two, three.
One, two. One, two. One. Hey!

479
00:33:36,526 --> 00:33:37,726
What the heck?

480
00:33:37,806 --> 00:33:39,086
Smash her now.

481
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:40,206
No!

482
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:45,286
Captain.

483
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:49,526
Perhaps this is my last chance
to confess to you.

484
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:51,406
I want to tell you,

485
00:33:51,846 --> 00:33:53,046
I like you.

486
00:33:54,686 --> 00:33:56,006
What nonsense are you talking about?

487
00:34:08,766 --> 00:34:09,406
You,

488
00:34:09,646 --> 00:34:10,326
you,

489
00:34:10,766 --> 00:34:11,566
and you.

490
00:34:14,766 --> 00:34:15,446
Da.

491
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:16,646
Ning.

492
00:34:17,286 --> 00:34:17,966
And Mr. Han.

493
00:34:19,846 --> 00:34:20,686
Captain.

494
00:34:20,766 --> 00:34:22,046
What's all this?

495
00:34:25,486 --> 00:34:26,326
Da.

496
00:34:26,406 --> 00:34:27,086
Da. Is it you?

497
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,366
You laughed when I said the password.

498
00:34:36,686 --> 00:34:37,486
Well,

499
00:34:37,566 --> 00:34:38,486
I said that to stall you.

500
00:34:38,566 --> 00:34:40,126
My confession to Captain

501
00:34:41,526 --> 00:34:43,326
is just a joke.

502
00:34:43,406 --> 00:34:45,166
Forget what I said.

503
00:34:46,046 --> 00:34:47,046
Did you believe that?

504
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,086
Well.

505
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:52,966
Welcome you to join

506
00:34:53,046 --> 00:34:56,366
Police Investigators Team.

507
00:34:57,326 --> 00:34:59,726
This is the traditional
we welcome new members.

508
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,966
We staged a stimulated
dangerous situation

509
00:35:02,446 --> 00:35:04,246
to let new members
experience it themselves.

510
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:06,526
Whether or not you pass the test,

511
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:09,286
it depends on your decision
if you abandon or stay with your member.

512
00:35:09,846 --> 00:35:12,206
We need this kind
of dedicated members in the unit.

513
00:35:13,206 --> 00:35:14,606
Congratulations.

514
00:35:15,726 --> 00:35:17,606
You both have passed the test.

515
00:35:19,686 --> 00:35:20,366
Ming.

516
00:35:20,926 --> 00:35:21,606
Vita.

517
00:35:22,486 --> 00:35:25,606
I'm happy that you can join us.

518
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:30,486
Ming.

519
00:35:31,126 --> 00:35:34,846
Your witty tricks are
truly a unique talent of yours.

520
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:36,246
Thank you for your compliment.

521
00:35:36,326 --> 00:35:37,286
As for Vita,

522
00:35:38,006 --> 00:35:40,446
what clues did you find
from what happened earlier?

523
00:35:40,526 --> 00:35:42,566
I've had a doubt from the get-go.

524
00:35:43,366 --> 00:35:45,606
The area where Ming and I took to

525
00:35:46,326 --> 00:35:47,526
is clean without leaves on the ground.

526
00:35:48,286 --> 00:35:50,926
The cuffs are stained with lubricant.

527
00:35:51,006 --> 00:35:53,886
Especially when Ming
tried to distract you

528
00:35:54,326 --> 00:35:55,966
with the random passwords,

529
00:35:56,046 --> 00:35:58,726
one of you laughed.

530
00:35:58,806 --> 00:36:00,566
Which made me more convinced

531
00:36:00,646 --> 00:36:02,166
that you're not the real criminals.

532
00:36:02,246 --> 00:36:04,406
If you were bad guys,

533
00:36:04,486 --> 00:36:06,966
you wouldn't laugh
no matter how funny the joke is.

534
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:10,646
But people with mutual liking

535
00:36:10,726 --> 00:36:11,886
can receive the humor.

536
00:36:12,886 --> 00:36:14,086
Did I get that right, Captain?

537
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:17,086
Very good, Vita.

538
00:36:18,086 --> 00:36:19,806
Congratulations.

539
00:36:24,406 --> 00:36:25,566
Our action is riddled with mistakes.

540
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:27,246
What a lousy plan.

541
00:36:28,006 --> 00:36:29,126
It's all your fault, Ning.

542
00:36:29,806 --> 00:36:31,606
You better watch out.

543
00:37:06,566 --> 00:37:07,846
(Unknown call)

544
00:37:08,806 --> 00:37:09,806
Hello.

545
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,486
Okay.

546
00:37:15,926 --> 00:37:17,046
Where do we meet?

547
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:37,886
I heard that Vita passed the assessment
and joined the unit.

548
00:37:39,246 --> 00:37:40,726
Thank you so much.

549
00:37:41,966 --> 00:37:43,966
She made it through her own hard work.

550
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,326
Do you like my sister?

551
00:37:56,526 --> 00:37:57,846
If you do,

552
00:37:57,926 --> 00:38:00,086
why do you support her
to be a police officer?

553
00:38:00,806 --> 00:38:03,006
I respect all decisions she makes.

554
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:06,246
Does she know you like her?

555
00:38:06,646 --> 00:38:07,926
I guess not.

556
00:38:09,006 --> 00:38:10,326
I disagree.

557
00:38:10,406 --> 00:38:11,766
Disagree what?

558
00:38:12,846 --> 00:38:13,686
Coach.

559
00:38:13,766 --> 00:38:14,886
Captain.

560
00:38:14,966 --> 00:38:16,126
What brings you here?

561
00:38:18,446 --> 00:38:20,006
What are you talking about?

562
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:23,606
Well.

563
00:38:23,686 --> 00:38:25,566
I invited Captain Pla over.

564
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:31,486
You said you disagreed. What's that?

565
00:38:31,566 --> 00:38:32,526
Can you tell me?

566
00:38:33,966 --> 00:38:36,006
No, it's just some random chat.

567
00:38:37,366 --> 00:38:38,326
We were talking about

568
00:38:38,406 --> 00:38:40,726
whether to support Manchester United
or Liverpool.

569
00:38:44,726 --> 00:38:46,886
Also,

570
00:38:47,406 --> 00:38:49,286
do we prefer PS or Xbox?

571
00:38:49,366 --> 00:38:50,846
Dogs or cats?

572
00:38:50,926 --> 00:38:52,486
Watching more movies or dramas?

573
00:38:52,966 --> 00:38:54,006
Is coconut ball with egg yolk better

574
00:38:55,006 --> 00:38:56,326
or Luk Chup?

575
00:38:58,286 --> 00:39:00,046
Something's wrong with you.

576
00:39:01,726 --> 00:39:02,646
Your expression.

577
00:39:04,086 --> 00:39:05,606
What's going on?

578
00:39:06,766 --> 00:39:07,406
Wasu.

579
00:39:07,486 --> 00:39:10,526
Why did you call Captain over? Tell me.

580
00:39:11,686 --> 00:39:13,846
Because your brother's
worried about you.

581
00:39:13,926 --> 00:39:14,766
While I came here

582
00:39:16,406 --> 00:39:18,886
to deliver the document
related to Luger's case.

583
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,846
So you won't have

584
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,006
to keep peeking at my laptop.

585
00:39:29,726 --> 00:39:30,966
Thank you, Coach.

586
00:39:33,886 --> 00:39:34,686
No, Captain.

587
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:37,686
Always got the title wrong.
I'm still not used to it.

588
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:43,206
You can call me Coach,

589
00:39:43,646 --> 00:39:44,366
Captain,

590
00:39:45,526 --> 00:39:46,726
or Wen.

591
00:39:50,886 --> 00:39:51,646
Vita.

592
00:39:53,406 --> 00:39:54,446
Go and rest.

593
00:39:55,046 --> 00:39:57,726
I'll see him off later.

594
00:40:21,446 --> 00:40:23,326
You can stop here.

595
00:40:24,806 --> 00:40:26,206
Mr. Wasu.

596
00:40:26,286 --> 00:40:28,726
I'd like to invite you
to taste some wine.

597
00:40:28,806 --> 00:40:30,526
Judging from your personal taste,

598
00:40:30,606 --> 00:40:32,566
I think you should be someone
who enjoys wine.

599
00:40:34,886 --> 00:40:37,686
Shall we continue our conversation?

600
00:40:37,766 --> 00:40:40,246
I sincerely invite you to taste the wine

601
00:40:40,326 --> 00:40:41,606
because

602
00:40:41,686 --> 00:40:44,086
I want you to have
a deeper understanding of me.

603
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:45,366
Also, you should learn more

604
00:40:45,446 --> 00:40:48,126
about how big the risk

605
00:40:48,206 --> 00:40:49,766
your sister's job is involved.

606
00:40:49,846 --> 00:40:52,166
You want to protect her, don't you?

607
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:53,886
Okay.

608
00:40:54,406 --> 00:40:55,366
Got it.

609
00:40:55,446 --> 00:40:59,286
But you better not choose a bad wine

610
00:41:00,246 --> 00:41:01,646
and restaurant.

611
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:03,366
Don't worry.

612
00:41:03,446 --> 00:41:06,206
We police never disappoint.

613
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:13,046
But I won't allow
you two to date easily.

614
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:16,446
To be honest,

615
00:41:16,926 --> 00:41:18,446
I think

616
00:41:18,526 --> 00:41:21,326
Vita's choice should be respected
on this matter.

617
00:41:21,406 --> 00:41:22,646
I hope

618
00:41:22,726 --> 00:41:24,286
you think the same way too.

619
00:41:25,806 --> 00:41:26,526
I'm leaving.

620
00:41:34,246 --> 00:41:35,846
(Rest)

621
00:41:50,726 --> 00:41:51,486
Vita.

622
00:41:53,006 --> 00:41:53,846
Captain.

623
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,206
Why are you here on an off day?

624
00:41:57,286 --> 00:42:00,046
That should be my question for you.

625
00:42:07,046 --> 00:42:08,806
You must come.

626
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:10,606
Is this a threatening note?

627
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:11,846
Is this

628
00:42:12,326 --> 00:42:13,166
sent by Luger?

629
00:42:15,406 --> 00:42:18,566
Do you remember Gan,
the woman we met in Ratchaburi?

630
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:20,246
Yes.

631
00:42:20,326 --> 00:42:22,526
She customized
this wedding invitation for me.

632
00:42:23,646 --> 00:42:25,846
She likes doing this kind of prank.

633
00:42:26,566 --> 00:42:29,246
She's truly strange
to make this for you.

634
00:42:29,326 --> 00:42:31,806
She seems to have hated you very much.

635
00:42:32,246 --> 00:42:34,366
Still, she invited you out of courtesy.

636
00:42:34,926 --> 00:42:36,326
She's unique.

637
00:42:38,366 --> 00:42:40,206
I guess she must be looking forward
to my presence.

638
00:42:41,246 --> 00:42:42,606
I plan to go.

639
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,006
And I want to invite you to come along.

640
00:42:45,086 --> 00:42:46,126
Thank you.

641
00:42:49,726 --> 00:42:50,486
Me?

642
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:52,926
Yes.

643
00:42:56,686 --> 00:42:57,486
Hello.

644
00:43:05,766 --> 00:43:06,886
Hello, Chief.

645
00:43:07,606 --> 00:43:08,446
(Here's a situation.)

646
00:43:08,526 --> 00:43:10,686
(Come over right now.)

647
00:43:11,606 --> 00:43:12,406
Yes.

648
00:43:13,126 --> 00:43:14,126
I'll be there right away.

649
00:43:19,086 --> 00:43:20,566
Hello.

650
00:43:20,646 --> 00:43:22,086
Are you Mr. Wasu?

651
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:23,246
Yes.

652
00:43:23,326 --> 00:43:24,166
This way, please.

653
00:43:24,846 --> 00:43:27,046
(Wasu, I'm sorry. Something urgent
came up. So, I can't come.)

654
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:28,806
(But I've invited someone
who can taste the wine with you.)

655
00:43:34,326 --> 00:43:35,326
Miss Mu.

656
00:43:46,046 --> 00:43:49,046
I didn't expect this from Mr. Pla.

657
00:43:52,606 --> 00:43:53,246
Me too.

658
00:43:53,486 --> 00:43:55,006
But it's good.

659
00:43:55,086 --> 00:43:56,886
Instead of seeing him,

660
00:43:58,086 --> 00:43:59,886
I get to see you here.

661
00:44:03,246 --> 00:44:05,846
So, have you sorted out

662
00:44:06,766 --> 00:44:08,126
the thing hidden in your heart?

663
00:44:12,046 --> 00:44:12,686
Yes, I did.

664
00:44:14,766 --> 00:44:16,086
Thank you

665
00:44:16,846 --> 00:44:18,446
for understanding me

666
00:44:18,526 --> 00:44:19,486
and giving me some time.

667
00:44:24,968 --> 00:44:26,166
Don't forget

668
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:28,366
we have a dessert class tomorrow.

669
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:31,366
Sure, I won't forget it.
I've already taken leave.

670
00:44:32,046 --> 00:44:37,166
By the way, do I need to compete
with others in the dessert class?

671
00:44:37,526 --> 00:44:38,806
Are there many students in the class?

672
00:44:39,206 --> 00:44:40,326
Actually,

673
00:44:40,686 --> 00:44:42,486
the class is fully booked.

674
00:44:42,566 --> 00:44:43,726
However,

675
00:44:44,286 --> 00:44:46,686
perhaps Pe made a mistake
in signing you up.

676
00:44:47,526 --> 00:44:50,286
So, you'll be the only student
in tomorrow's class.

677
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:51,966
Really?

678
00:44:54,446 --> 00:44:55,086
Oh.

679
00:44:56,686 --> 00:44:58,446
That's very good.

680
00:44:58,526 --> 00:44:59,286
What did you say?

681
00:45:00,486 --> 00:45:01,366
Oh, I...

682
00:45:01,446 --> 00:45:02,486
I was saying

683
00:45:03,646 --> 00:45:06,126
that this restaurant is very good.

684
00:45:08,126 --> 00:45:08,806
I see.

685
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,046
Let's clink our glasses.

686
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:11,806
Sure.

687
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:15,486
Thank you.

688
00:45:15,686 --> 00:45:16,326
It's fine.

689
00:45:16,926 --> 00:45:17,846
Cheers.

690
00:46:10,486 --> 00:46:11,046
What's it, Ning?

691
00:46:11,126 --> 00:46:12,286
Eig escaped from prison.

692
00:46:12,926 --> 00:46:14,686
The person who killed your brother

693
00:46:15,286 --> 00:46:16,686
is Black Lion.

694
00:46:18,406 --> 00:46:19,206
Luger.

695
00:46:20,046 --> 00:46:21,886
I'll kill Vita

696
00:46:21,966 --> 00:46:23,326
and her brother

697
00:46:24,126 --> 00:46:26,446
to give my brother's soul comfort.

698
00:46:26,526 --> 00:46:29,886
I want Black Lion to suffer.

699
00:46:31,526 --> 00:46:32,566
Only then

700
00:46:33,686 --> 00:46:36,006
will I allow him to die.
