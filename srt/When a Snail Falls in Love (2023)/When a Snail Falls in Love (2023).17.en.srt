(An adaptation of the novel
"When a Snail Falls in Love" by Ding Mo)

4
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,300
(Boonyavej Private Hospital)

5
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,740
It's not good.

6
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,460
The patient's spine is badly hurt.

7
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,580
It's possible
that he can't stand up again.

8
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,940
Da.

9
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,620
Doctor.

10
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,620
The patient wakes up.

11
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,100
Okay, please hurry over.

12
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,940
Ming.

13
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,820
You should go back and rest.

14
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,700
I can handle it on my own.

15
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,420
I'm not going back.

16
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,500
I just arrived here

17
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,460
and you just woke up.

18
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,700
I've bought you some porridge.

19
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,260
I'll serve you some later.

20
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,460
Da.

21
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,020
How do your leg and hip

22
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,100
feel?

23
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,140
I don't feel any pain.

24
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,780
I...

25
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,580
Da.

26
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,420
It's fine.

27
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,220
Rest well.

28
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,300
I'll get you some porridge.

29
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,180
Oh no, doctor.

30
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:38,860
What's the matter?

31
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,220
I got the wrong file.
It should be this one.

32
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,660
Crap.

33
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,860
I took the wrong medical record.

34
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,300
I'm sorry, doctor.

35
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,860
What do we do now?

36
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,580
After the full body check-up,

37
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,340
you can be discharged in a few days.

38
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,260
Where's the girl
who has been by your side?

39
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,260
When she heard
that you might be paralyzed,

40
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,500
she was about to cry.

41
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,980
You should cherish her.

42
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,380
Let's go.

43
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,220
Let's go, Watermelon.

44
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:21,940
Come on.

45
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,660
Let's go.

46
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,980
Don't forget about your lunch.

47
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,580
I've fixed supplementary food
for Watermelon too.

48
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,820
It's not healthy
if the baby only drinks powdered milk.

49
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,860
Thank you, Grandma Lek.

50
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,780
All right.

51
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,660
Be good.

52
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,700
Say goodbye to them.

53
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,620
Goodbye.

54
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,340
Goodbye.

55
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,620
- Let's go.
- See you, Grandma.

56
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,300
All right, bye.

57
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:45,940
Bye-bye.

58
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,820
Bye-bye.

59
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,620
Do come back often.

60
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,420
I will.

61
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,700
(Patient Pick-up)

62
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,100
Bite it in half.

63
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,300
Da.

64
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,300
You've finally woken up.

65
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,860
I miss you so much.

66
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,660
Calm down.

67
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,140
Talk about perfect timing.

68
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,700
I'll head out and get you some food.

69
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,380
You guys talk.

70
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,260
Sure. Okay.

71
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,180
Please look after him, Mr. Han.

72
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,100
How do you feel now?

73
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,140
Is your hip

74
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,220
paralyzed?

75
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,700
Can't you move?

76
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,020
My hip is all right.

77
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,380
I'm not paralyzed, Mr. Han.

78
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,820
Are you sure?

79
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,540
- Not painful?
- I'm sure.

80
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,780
Can you still move?

81
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,940
Look, it's easy.

82
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,060
But Ming told us

83
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,100
a different thing.

84
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,500
She mistook my condition.

85
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,740
I'll explain to her later.

86
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,260
I have an idea.

87
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,420
What's it?

88
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,660
Don't tell Ming.

89
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,740
Listen.

90
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,660
This is the way to know
Ming's feelings for you.

91
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,580
Can this work?

92
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,420
This is silly.

93
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,300
When can you return to the unit?

94
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,380
I'm all good, Mr. Han.

95
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,380
I'm eager to get back to work.

96
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,540
I've been sleeping for so long.

97
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,940
It's boring.

98
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,900
Is there any new case?

99
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,260
Yes.

100
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,580
The child abduction case.

101
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,620
Captain and Vita went outstation
for this case.

102
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,860
They'll come and visit you

103
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,300
once they're back.

104
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,580
Okay.

105
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,380
Is your hip all right?

106
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,900
Can you move?

107
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,780
Sure.

108
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,900
Look closely. It's trembling.

109
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,180
I don't see it.

110
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,780
Here you go.

111
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,300
In that case,

112
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,700
you should get up and walk.

113
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,140
How naughty.

114
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,860
What has happened, Pita?

115
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,660
I think the tire burst.

116
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,380
It's all flat.

117
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,820
Don't worry.

118
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,500
It won't take long to change the tire.

119
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,660
Okay.

120
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,940
Pita.

121
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,660
Do you have two spare tires?

122
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:45,980
Only one.

123
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,940
This is bad.

124
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,420
Watermelon, stay here.

125
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,660
This room is damp and moist,
serving for the wet theme.

126
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,900
Smack, smack, smack.

127
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,900
This is an SM room
with the jungle theme.

128
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,820
Did you see that?

129
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,260
There are five rattans.

130
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,420
Our guests can enjoy it to the fullest

131
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,100
as if they're in seventh heaven
in this room.

132
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,460
As you can see,
the ceiling is full of stars,

133
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,860
blinking all over.

134
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,180
Starry sky and satellite.

135
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,340
It's hot, right?

136
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,620
Which room do you prefer?

137
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,780
Is there any room

138
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,820
that's simpler?

139
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,780
Yes.

140
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,820
I've told you we have all kinds of room

141
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,060
to satisfy the need

142
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,980
of every couple.

143
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,580
However,

144
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,980
this room is a legendary one.

145
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,740
Because it's a surprise gift room.

146
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,180
Not bad.

147
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,140
But there are many hidden cameras

148
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500

193
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,980
What was that, Pita?

194
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,860
Nothing.

195
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,060
Gift room.

196
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,940
Nothing.

197
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,500
Um...

198
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,740
Pita.

199
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,460
Yes?

200
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,900
What do you think about this?

201
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,620
It's decent and well-covered.

202
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,500
But I think

203
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,660
I might be able to sleep well

204
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,060
with this behind me.

205
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,740
What's it?

206
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,500
This thing.

207
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,380
A huge bow.

208
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,300
Hello.

209
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,220
I'm on a mission now, Mom.

210
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,500
I'm good.

211
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,820
It's my mom.

212
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,460
Ma'am.

213
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,180
Hello, I'm Vita.

214
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,580
(You...you two...)

215
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,220
(So, is she my future daughter-in-law?)

216
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,940
(You even have a child.)

217
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,820
Yes, she's your future daughter-in-law.

218
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,740
But this is not my child, Mom.

219
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,660
It's someone else's.

220
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,020
(Pla's parents)
Rine told me about you.

221
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,620
Rine?

222
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,380
Being a police officer as a woman,

223
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,500
you must've suffered a lot

224
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,620
and your family
is worried about you too.

225
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,100
Thank you so much.

226
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,980
But I'm staying with my elder brother.

227
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,820
(Before this, my brother
disapproved of my job,)

228
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,740
(but he has changed his mind now.)

229
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,540
When will you resign...

230
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,100
I think that's it, Mom. I'm busy.

231
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,820
Bye.

232
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,580
See you.

233
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,460
How dare your son hang up on me!

234
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,220
Gosh.

235
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,180
I think Pla is serious this time.

236
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,780
What if he really marries a cop?

237
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,980
Oh my.

238
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,420
He's a full grown-up now.

239
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,940
You shouldn't interfere with his life.

240
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,220
However,

241
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,820
it's not good if both of them are cops.

242
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,980
So dangerous.

243
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,060
Jeez.

244
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,060
You should've stopped him
when he applied for the police academy.

245
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,620
I miscalculated that time.

246
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,820
This time, we must stop him.

247
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,900
Just wait and see.

248
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,180
Hello, Biya.

249
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,220
Yes.

250
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,340
Someone asks for you.

251
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,460
Who's it?

252
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,860
Baby.

253
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,340
Thank you.

254
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,260
Thank you for sending my baby back.

255
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,220
I thought I'd lost you forever.

256
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,260
Let's go and find Mom.

257
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,060
Peng!

258
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,340
Hurry over. Look who's here.

259
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,860
Baby. My baby.

260
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,740
Do you still remember me?

261
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,380
Does anything happen to you, my baby?

262
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,100
Congratulations.

263
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:46,940
Thank you.

264
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,780
Do you get hurt?

265
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,540
Thank you.

266
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,460
Thank you.

267
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,940
Thank you so much.

268
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,660
Baby.

269
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,900
I miss you so much.

270
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,540
I told you

271
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,780
the baby would come back.

272
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,740
Yes, dear.

273
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,700
Are you all right, baby?

274
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,500
What's it, Ning?

275
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,460
(Hello, Captain.)

276
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,300
(Based on the test report,
Forensic Medicine Department concluded)

277
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,340
the woman who abandoned the child
may be in the suburbs of Bangkok.

278
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,100
The exact location will
be confirmed two hours later.

279
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,300
Okay.

280
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,380
Call me once the result is out.

281
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,140
Vita and I are on our way back.

282
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,460
Yes, sir.

283
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:09,300
You enjoyed the drink. Let's go home.

284
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,900
Yeah, it's great.

285
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,660
Let's go.

286
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,140
You're so cute.

287
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,220
Want to have fun?

288
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,380
Let's find a safer place inside.

289
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,060
Okay.

290
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,420
Can I take him?

291
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,300
Sure, he's totally yours.

292
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,100
Hello.

293
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,620
Stop.

294
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,060
Close your eyes.

295
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,460
Do you want candy?

296
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,540
You'll have low blood sugar levels

297
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,460
without food for a long period.

298
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,020
Calm down.

299
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,540
Please calm down.

300
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,580
No.

301
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,340
No!

302
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,060
No!

303
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,580
No!

304
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,900
No!

305
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,260
Let go. Let me go!

306
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,140
Let go.

307
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:56,860
Hold her.

308
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,580
Let me go!

309
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,980
Let go!

310
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,940
Let go!

311
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,780
Let go!

312
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,380
No!

313
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,620
Her mental damage

314
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,700
should be more serious
than you've described.

315
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,940
I've noticed several inflamed
needle marks

316
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,500
on her arms.

317
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,380
I guess there are track marks.

318
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,500
She needs her medications.

319
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,060
I don't think

320
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,860
she's mentally stable enough
to go through the interrogation.

321
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,820
All right.

322
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,140
Thank you, doctor.

323
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,260
I'll leave.

324
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,020
Go ahead.

325
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,060
She has a Naga tattoo on her.

326
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,980
Which appeared in Luger's case before.

327
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,500
By any chance,

328
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,100
she might be Luger's henchperson

329
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,580
who has escaped.

330
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,900
Captain.

331
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,500
We have two urgent conditions now.

332
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,460
There have been numerous reports
of missing tourists

333
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,500
registered in several precincts.

334
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,900
The higher-up treats this seriously

335
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,500
and wants us to get to the bottom of it.

336
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,700
What about another matter?

337
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,580
The other one is

338
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,940
that Forensic Medicine Department
found out the woman's name and address.

339
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,220
Her name is Tuta.

340
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,460
She's not from Bangkok

341
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,460
but lives in a town nearby.

342
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,780
Okay.

343
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,380
You'll go and search around
the red-light district.

344
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,460
Vita and I will look into Tuta.

345
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,420
Yes, sir.

346
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,700
It's been years

347
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,660
and you cops still couldn't find her.

348
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,380
What's the point you came to me?

349
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,260
Her daughter is still alive.

350
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,780
She's in Bangkok.

351
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,500
However, she's in a delirious state.

352
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,100
We're trying to help her.

353
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:03,220
Can you tell us the situation
before your daughter left you?

354
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,700
This is the last photo she sent me.

355
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,420
After that,

356
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,460
I've never seen her again.

357
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,460
I've lost my granddaughter before

358
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,420
and now my daughter.

359
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,420
Can you

360
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,780
take me to see her?

361
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,380
I want to see my daughter.

362
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,380
Ma'am.

363
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,660
We can't let you meet
with your daughter now.

364
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,300
She stole someone's child.

365
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,700
We're investigating the case.

366
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,220
But don't worry.

367
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,100
She's safe now.

368
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,060
This child trafficking case
is related to the Luger case.

369
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,260
This is a crucial thread.

370
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,500
It's time to revisit that case.

371
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,020
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

372
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,660
Please do your very best on this.

373
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,620
You may leave now.

374
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,940
Yeah! Finally,
the Luger case is revived.

375
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,580
Are you happy, Pita?

376
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,740
Let's go.

377
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,420
(Boonyavej Private Hospital)

378
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,340
Captain.

379
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,420
How do you feel now?

380
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,260
Captain.

381
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,020
Ming told me that
the investigation went on smoothly.

382
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,580
Please heal up

383
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,500
and return to work soon.

384
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,860
Yes, sir.

385
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,380
Well, I'll take this out
and have someone to deal with this.

386
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,260
Sure.

387
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,380
Are you tired?

388
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,420
Not at all.

389
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,540
Previously, it was Da
who took care of me.

390
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,780
And now it's my turn to look after him.

391
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,940
Are you feeling better now?

392
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,820
Me?

393
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,220
Very good.

394
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,060
If so, why don't you get back to work?

395
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,820
Captain, not so soon.

396
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,180
Gosh.

397
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,500
I'm enjoying it now.

398
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,300
Well, we'll head back.

399
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,860
Bye.

400
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,340
Okay.

401
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,780
Ming.

402
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,060
What are you doing now?

403
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,620
The nurse said it's almost time.

404
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,580
I think you should
let the nurse do this.

405
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,140
It's fine.

406
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,180
I can handle this well.

407
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,540
It's better to ask the nurse...

408
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,260
Crap.

409
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,900
Da.

410
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,020
Ming, please hear me out.

411
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,900
Since you can move freely now,

412
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,620
you don't need my help anymore.

413
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,140
Ming, please listen to me. Ming.

414
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,900
I wanted to tell you this
a long ago, but...

415
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,540
Ming.

416
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,860
Ming.

417
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,020
I just want to have more time with her.

418
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,940
For my whole life.

419
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,900
I know I'm selfish.

420
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,580
In fact, you don't have to do this.
Ming cares very much about you.

421
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,100
I lied to her

422
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,300
because I'm afraid...

423
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,100
I'm afraid to be the guy who hurt her.

424
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,580
Every man

425
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,020
has this fear, Vita.

426
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,540
So does Captain.

427
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,300
He has this fear too.

428
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,820
Please come in.

429
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,180
What's the matter, Vita?

430
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,020
Do you have anything to talk to me?

431
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,820
I think...

432
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,740
What are you afraid of?

433
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,180
Pita.

434
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,340
Let me take you to a place.

435
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,620
Okay.

436
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,020
I admit defeat.

437
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,260
Again.

438
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,100
Hey.

439
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,260
I won, Pita.

440
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,180
Are you sure?

441
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,820
You won.

442
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,100
I said you won.

443
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,580
Pita.

444
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,780
Please trust me.

445
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,900
I know

446
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,740
that since the reopening
of the Luger case,

447
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,220
it has reminded you of Badin.

448
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,220
Anyway, please have faith in me.

449
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,980
I can protect myself.

450
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,700
With that move?

451
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,780
I've told you many times

452
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,580
not to use that on anyone.

453
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,980
You're not just anyone.

454
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,180
I've always trusted you.

455
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,260
Keep the amulet well.

456
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,820
No matter what,

457
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,300
you can't take it off.

458
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,620
Is this a proposal?

459
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,700
No, it's not.

460
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,420
It's your punishment.

461
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,140
I'm punishing you
for not listening to me.

462
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,260
Also, your penalty

463
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,100
is to take good care of yourself.

464
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,540
Don't let me worry.

465
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,460
Okay?

466
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,540
Wasu.

467
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,780
Why haven't I seen Mu's dessert
in the fridge these days?

468
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,460
Vita.

469
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,180
Help me to look this guy up.

470
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,420
Who's this, Wasu?

471
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,820
What's his beef with you?

472
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,100
Of course, he has.

473
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,420
He's my worst enemy.

474
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,900
Worst enemy?

475
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,660
Is he your business rival?

476
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,220
Or did he play dirty against you?

477
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,980
- If he commits fraud, report...
- It's not that.

478
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,220
This brat is Po.

479
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:04,940
Po?

480
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:05,940
Yes.

481
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,940
He keeps bugging Mu.

482
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,340
You're jealous.

483
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,140
Jealous?

484
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,740
Do you mean I'm jealous of him?

485
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,740
He's not that important.

486
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,660
Yes, you're jealous of him.

487
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,860
Mu wants to break up with me.

488
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,460
Why?

489
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,740
I have no idea.

490
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,980
She avoided me,

491
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,580
and intentionally kept
her distance from me.

492
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,700
And then this Po showed up.

493
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,300
One week later,

494
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,500
she told me we were over.

495
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,780
Po shows up out of a sudden.

496
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,460
But Mu won't accept him
in such a short time.

497
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,380
Try to recall

498
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,580
if you've done anything

499
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,620
that annoyed her.

500
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,100
No.

501
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,300
I think

502
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,140
you should talk to Mu.

503
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,380
Or maybe

504
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,220
you can talk to Po?

505
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,180
What are you talking about?

506
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,340
You're jealous.

507
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,580
I can't leave you.

508
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,900
You're always in my heart.

509
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,300
Hello!

510
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,620
Hey.

511
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,860
Who are you?

512
00:34:06,621 --> 00:34:08,501
What the hell is this?

513
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,220
Help me!

514
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,300
Don't move.

515
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,940
Please don't do anything to me.

516
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,100
Just let me go.

517
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,060
Let you go?

518
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:27,900
And you got to harass
another girl like you did, right?

519
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,260
No.

520
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:33,020
I'm good. I'm not doing this anymore.

521
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,020
Okay.

522
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,780
I trust you.

523
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,420
Really?

524
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,220
You want to let me go?

525
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,620
But

526
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,620
before you go,

527
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,980
I think

528
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,460
you probably know what I mean.

529
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,900
Help me.

530
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,460
I...I give you money.

531
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,380
Just take my money, please.

532
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,300
Please let me go. Please.

533
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,820
Your money?

534
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,940
I prefer your kidney
more than your money.

535
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,940
Let me go.

536
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,460
Let go.

537
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,060
Let go.

538
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,940
Let me go.

539
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,580
Shut your trap.

540
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,340
Everything is all right, Mr. Luger.

541
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,580
All right.

542
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,820
Recently, the reported cases
of missing tourists

543
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,220
are mostly men.

544
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,380
They're Asians

545
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,460
and Europeans too.

546
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,660
As of now, we're not sure if these cases
are linked to each other.

547
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,740
When Ning and Ming
looked into the missing people,

548
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:56,700
they discovered that all incidents
were related to the Naga totem.

549
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:01,780
The Naga totem is seen in the woman
who abandoned the child too.

550
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,460
I'll provide you with extra information
about the Luger case later.

551
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:09,420
Do you remember that the totem
is related to the Wan case?

552
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,460
I've requested Chief to reopen
the investigation into the Luger case.

553
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,780
Afterward, we need to come up
with a detailed plan

554
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,060
for every action.

555
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,380
We need to search for evidence

556
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,460
and gather as much intel as possible.

557
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,420
Also, we have to accomplish this
in the shortest time possible.

558
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,380
Captain.

559
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,020
We need a guise

560
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,340
before we go
to the red-light district, right?

561
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,180
Yes.

562
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,340
Everyone will be on standby.

563
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,100
Guys

564
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,140
will disguise as tourists,

565
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,820
while ladies

566
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,460
dress up as those
who visit the nightclub.

567
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,340
This time, we'll lure
the mastermind out.

568
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,780
We need to gather information,

569
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,740
clues,

570
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,260
and evidence

571
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,700
as much as possible.

572
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,700
Understood?

573
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,820
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

574
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,860
Go with him.

575
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,220
Wasu.

576
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,180
You're early.

577
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,060
Well, I'll put it here.

578
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,260
It's fine. Someone will do this later.

579
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,780
Okay.

580
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,540
Mu and Po are in the store.

581
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,300
They'll be here later.

582
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,500
Really?

583
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,700
When are they coming?

584
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,060
It'll be a minute.

585
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,900
See, here they are.

586
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,580
Mu.

587
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,780
I came here early in the morning.

588
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,340
Even though you're not here,

589
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,700
I'm helping Pe out

590
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,980
to decorate the site.

591
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,900
Yes, Mu.

592
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,300
Wasu has done a great job.

593
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,620
Thank you, Wasu.

594
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,340
Hadn't Pei hurt his arm,

595
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,420
I wouldn't have asked for your help.

596
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,500
Mu.

597
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,060
Can you please not be mad at me?

598
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,260
I went to your store this morning,
but you weren't there.

599
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,580
I was suffocated when I heard

600
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,940
that you're with that guy.

601
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,580
Don't be mad at me, please.

602
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,900
I didn't go out with Po.

603
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,740
Really?

604
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,900
So,

605
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,740
that guy

606
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,460
posted that photo online and confused
everyone that you two are together

607
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,380
without permission, right?

608
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,060
If so,

609
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,220
will you still stay with me?

610
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,540
Wasu.

611
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,940
At least

612
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:38,780
he's way better than those
who have girlfriends but lie to others.

613
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,180
Pe.

614
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,020
Take me to meet with the customer.

615
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,180
Okay.

616
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,900
Hold on to my right arm.

617
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,020
No.

618
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,140
I don't have a girlfriend.

619
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,260
Are you sure you don't?

620
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,900
Mu.

621
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,140
This is the total expense.

622
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,700
Okay.

623
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,540
I'll go and settle the payment.

624
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,540
Mu.

625
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,420
I...I'm sorry.

626
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,500
I don't know you're mad because of this.

627
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,540
I'm sorry

628
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,060
for letting you misunderstand
for so long.

629
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,340
I told others that I'm single,

630
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,020
not because I despise you.

631
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,060
I'm afraid

632
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,420
that woman would harass you.

633
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,500
I know she can be very annoying.

634
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,260
She's even more annoying

635
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,340
than that Po.

636
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:04,660
Mu.

637
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,620
I've never despised you.

638
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,500
On the contrary,

639
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,460
I see you

640
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,900
as the most important person
in my life.

00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:29,940

00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,900
Sure. You should take care of yourself.

718
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:56,020

729
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,820

00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,020
What's it?

747
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,020
(I'm telling you)

748
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,660
we have a mission later.

749
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,740
What mission, Ning?

750
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,300
It's about the child abduction case.

751
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,900
Possibly involves prostitution.

752
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,500
And it might be related to Luger.

753
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,420
(Now,)

754
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,820
(everyone is out for this mission,)

755
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,780
(except for you and Mr. Han)

756
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,540
(who stay at the hospital.)

757
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,140
Luckily, other units are sent
to our aid.

758
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,500
I won't talk much to you.

759
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,980
That's it for now, Da.

760
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,020
Wait, Ning.

761
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,700
Hello. What about Ming?

762
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,420
Ning.

763
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,420
This brat.

764
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,220
Can you show me your tattoo?

765
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,020
No rush.

766
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,340
Hey, what are you doing?

767
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,900
She can't go with you.

768
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,740
Why not? I already paid for her.

769
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,780
What's going on now?

770
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:57,900
Captain.

771
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,580
The woman retreated out of a sudden.

772
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,140
I saw it.

773
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,380
Let her be.

774
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,860
What about Vita and Ming's side?

775
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,300
We just came in.

776
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:08,940
Waiting for someone to approach us.

777
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:10,900
Okay.

778
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,220
Stay alert.

779
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:13,980
(Yes, sir.)

780
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,340
Do you need help?

781
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,900
It seems like you're searching
for some places.

782
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,900
Um...we're looking for a place to eat.

783
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,780
I see.

784
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,420
I can give you some recommendations.

785
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,420
I know several good places.

786
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,180
Do you want any drinks?

787
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,340
Drinks?

788
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,340
This is a good place.

789
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,300
It's the favorite place of tourists.

790
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,500
They serve good snacks too.

791
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,180
I have their discount card too.

792
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:53,860
You can use it.

793
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:54,820
Really?

794
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,580
Let's go.

795
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,340
Oi.

796
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,020
It's you again.

797
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,980
Why did he run away?

798
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,580
Him?

799
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:16,100
He's a habitual con artist here.

800
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,900
Several tourists have
already fallen prey to him.

801
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:19,900
Is that so?

802
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:20,900
What happened?

803
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,820
Did he tell you about the discount card?

804
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:26,980
He did.

805
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,100
Look.

806
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,220
This is the first step.

807
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,780
He would trick you
into going to that store.

808
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,340
Later, he'd encourage you
to drink excessively

809
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,380
until you drop.

810
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,220
Then, he presents you
with a highly-charged bill.

811
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,660
If you fail to foot the bill,

812
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:43,180
he'd force you into prostitution.

813
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,260
That's scary.

814
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,060
Thank you for saving us.

815
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,140
It's my pleasure.

816
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,100
It sounds good.

817
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,180
I forgot to bring my purse.

818
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,620
I need to head back to the hotel.

819
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,820
You can take a stroll here.
I'll be back soon.

820
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:05,340
Okay.

821
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,860
Is this your first time here?

822
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,060
Yes.

823
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:18,980
If so,

824
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,100
let me show you around.

825
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,500
Frankly, the place is complicated.

826
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,540
It's not good for a lady like you

827
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,980
to wander around here.

828
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:29,820
Thank you.

829
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,700
You're welcome.

830
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,300
Excuse me.

831
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,140
Can you tell me where the blue bus is?

832
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,220
On the corner.

833
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:49,420
Thank you.

834
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,900
There are many foreigners here.

835
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:57,940
Are you all right?

836
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,140
I'm good.

837
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:02,980
This place is messy and noisy.

838
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,420
I'd like to wait for my friend
in a quiet place.

839
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,100
Quiet place?

840
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:10,820
Yes.

841
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,500
Sure, it is.

842
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,860
Let me take you there.

843
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,220
Thank you.

844
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:17,500
Let's go.

845
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,220
Sure.

846
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:26,780
Honestly,

847
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,260
our company is throwing a party tonight.

848
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,900
If you don't mind,

849
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:33,420
you can join us.

850
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:35,900
Well,

851
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,380
can you take me there?

852
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,420
It's my pleasure.

853
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,580
This way, please.

854
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,620
- Let's go.
- Sure.

855
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,220
Go upstairs.

856
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:50,940
Okay.

857
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:54,460
Come on.

858
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,340
The party starts soon.

859
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,060
Sure.

860
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,100
Please come in.

861
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,420
This way.

862
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,260
Okay.

863
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,020
Excuse me.

864
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,060
Didn't you say
it's your company's party?

865
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,460
Why is the place so quiet?

866
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:34,740
They are all inside there.

867
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:36,540
Come on.

868
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:37,580
Wait.

869
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,380
I'll ask my friend to be quick.

870
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,860
There's no signal here.

871
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,900
But the signal inside is stronger.

872
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,500
Come with me.

873
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:47,620
Okay.

874
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,540
Sorry, you can't go in.

875
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,260
Please, mister.

876
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,700
Please come in.

877
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,780
The guy in front of Baihu's shop

878
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,220
and the one in the floral shirt
brought in by K,

879
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,660
don't let them approach our people.

880
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:38,460
They're cops.

881
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:47,660
Prestigious guests,

882
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:50,460
let me introduce
the special entry of the night.

883
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:56,500
Normally, the items from our auction
only have six months of period of use.

884
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:02,980
But in this special case, the lot will
be auctioned at a transfer price

885
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,460
as it hasn't had
our exclusive mark on it.

886
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:09,500
Therefore, you may do
as you please with her.
