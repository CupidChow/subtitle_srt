00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I will definitely get angry.

Zi Hao.

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hang in there.

Zi Hao!

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Zi Hao!

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm sorry.

Don't come over!

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Come on!

Don't come over!

Don't come over!

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Don't come over!

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Stop!

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's go.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Come on.

00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Come on.

An Ning.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What's this?

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is a good one.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is good.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is good.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Take both of them.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm so tired.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Just like me.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is a good one.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why did they add this one?

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I really like it.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,760
are close.

31
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,040
Ming Min Qing Xue,

32
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,320
thank you for saving my life.

33
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,120
From now on, you're known

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,280

00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:18,500
Perhaps those old banner.(ель vardı

36
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,500
I love you.

37
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,500
From now on, you should take her to the palace.

38
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,500
I am the only one.

39
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
I will leave a piece of my past.

40
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,500
If love is like a dream, I will embrace it.

41
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Yes.

42
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,500
I am willing to be in your arms.

43
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
I am willing to be in your arms.

44
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
You are not her.

45
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
You are just a substitute.

46
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
You go.

47
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Don't let me see you again here.

48
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
I...

49
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,500
The wind is blowing my love away.

50
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,500
I am willing to be in your arms.

51
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Get up.

52
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Little beauty, you are so stubborn.

53
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Kill me.

54
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Kill you?

55
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
That's not interesting.

56
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,500
I will make you die.

57
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Let her go.

58
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Let her go.

59
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Okay.

60
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Kneel down.

61
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
I will let her go.

62
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
Kneel down.

63
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
No.

64
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Kneel down.

65
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
No.

66
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Kneel down.

67
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
No.

68
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
I can't.

69
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
Kneel down.

70
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
No.

71
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Come on.

72
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Hurry.

73
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
No.

74
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Beat her.

75
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Yes.

76
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
No.

77
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Stop.

78
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Stop.

79
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
I will beat you.

80
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
No.

81
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Stop.

82
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
No.

83
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Let her go.

84
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
Stop.

85
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Let her go.

86
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Okay.

87
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
No.

88
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
Then I will make you two get married.

89
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
No.

90
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
Let her go.

91
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Hurry.

92
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
Hurry.

93
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Ji Ya.

94
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Ji Ya.

95
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
No.

96
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
No.

97
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
Ji Ya.

98
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Ji Ya.

99
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Let her go.

100
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Kill them.

101
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Ji Ya.

102
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Ji Ya.

103
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Shi An.

104
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
I told you not to...

105
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Ji Ya.

106
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Ji Ya.

107
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Ji Ya.

108
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Ji Ya.

109
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,500
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Shi An.

111
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
I...

112
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
I want to be with you.

113
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Ji Ya.

114
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Ji Ya.

115
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Ji Ya.

116
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Ji Ya.

117
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Ji Ya.

118
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
I will take you home.

119
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Your Highness.

120
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
The prince said he didn't mean it.

121
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
You stay here.

122
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
I will go save him.

123
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Your Highness.

124
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
This is too risky.

125
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
I think we should just let him go.

126
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Do as I say.

127
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
You.

128
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Go and keep an eye on the woman who was caught from Lin Zhao.

129
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Don't let her run around.

130
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Yes.

131
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,500
My useless brother was killed in Lin Zhao.

132
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
I will take two positions for my father.

133
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
When we get back to the Xuanhuang,

134
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
the throne will be mine.

135
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
The whole Xuanhuang will be mine.

136
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
What do you want?

137
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
Guess.

138
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
Uncle.

139
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Mohan.

140
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,500
It's you.

141
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
Wen Fuyu.

142
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
For someone who is not related to you,

143
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
and looks like you,

144
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
you risked your life to save him.

145
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Why did you not save him when you were with me?

146
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
I don't understand what you are saying.

147
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
Let him go.

148
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,500
You don't understand, do you?

149
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Then...

150
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,500
I will cut through his face.

151
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
What do you think?

152
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Wen Fuyu.

153
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Are you crazy?

154
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
What grudge does he have against you?

155
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
His face is a crime.

156
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
You abandoned me for Uncle Wen Yan.

157
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,500
You made me get caught by the Xuanhuang and die.

158
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
You caused all of this.

159
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Bring me a whip.

160
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Yes.

161
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,500
What are you doing?

162
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
This time,

163
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
you and Uncle Wen Yan owe me.

164
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Wen Fuyu, don't touch him.

165
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,500
I'll take the responsibility.

166
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,500
I hate to see you being so indifferent to everything.

167
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Only when I see Uncle Wen Yan,

168
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
I can see you are moving.

169
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
It makes me sick.

170
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Wen Fuyu.

171
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
What do you want?

172
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
If you have anything to say, don't touch him.

173
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Shut up.

174
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
You have no right to speak here.

175
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Yuecai.

176
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Take her away.

177
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Where are you taking her?

178
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
You'd better be honest.

179
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Otherwise, I will cut through his face.

180
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,500
Let's go.

181
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Mu Han.

182
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Uncle.

183
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Come on.

184
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Come on.

185
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Drink.

186
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Drink.

187
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Come on.

188
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,500
Leave her alone.

189
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Come on.

190
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Second Prince.

191
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Beautiful.

192
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
You are beautiful.

193
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
You are really beautiful.

194
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Come on.

195
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Let me kiss you.

196
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Don't come over.

197
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Don't touch me.

198
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
Let me go.

199
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,500
Let me go.

200
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Let me go.

201
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
Let me go.

202
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,500
Report.

203
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Second Prince, we are surrounded by the people of Lingzhao.

204
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Lingzhao?

205
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
What's going on?

206
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,500
Why did you offend the people of Lingzhao?

207
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
Did you do something good?

208
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
No.

209
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Second Prince.

210
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
He...

211
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
He is the lover of Prince Zi Shang.

212
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
As long as we take him,

213
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
the people of Lingzhao won't touch us.

214
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,500
No.

215
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,500
Don't be fooled by him.

216
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
I am not.

217
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Go.

218
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Second Prince.

219
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
You have to take me with you.

220
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,500
I am your woman.

221
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
You can't leave me.

222
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Go away.

223
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Go.

224
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Kill them.

225
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Second Prince, what should we do?

226
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
I will go to Yunzhou.

227
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
I will kill them.

228
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Let's go.

229
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
Bailing.

230
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
Your Highness.

231
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
They ran to Yunzhou.

232
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Go after them.

233
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,500
Uncle.

234
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Listen to me.

235
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Release them.

236
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
You want to save him?

237
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Yes.

238
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Unless you give me Yunzhou.

239
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
Otherwise,

240
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,500
I will kill him with my sword.

241
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Uncle.

242
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
What are you going to do?

243
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Mother.

244
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
I can't.

245
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,500
If you give Yunzhou to the people of Mancheng,

246
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
you will become their soulmate.

247
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
No.

248
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
There is only one chance.

249
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Either you save a city,

250
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
or save a person.

251
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,500
You choose.

252
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Your Highness.

253
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Uncle.

254
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Your Highness.

255
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
Your Highness.

256
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Your Highness.

257
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Your Highness.

258
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Your Highness.

259
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Your Highness.
