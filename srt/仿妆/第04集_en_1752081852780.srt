1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:55,780
This

2
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,980
Who taught you to do this?

3
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,260
Your Highness,

4
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,900
today I'll show you what you can do!

5
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,140
You!

6
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:00,780
Your Highness,

7
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,180
I've got an audience.

8
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,060
Please give me a good one, Your Highness.

9
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,820
Your Highness,

10
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,100
hold me.

11
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,740
Don't let go.

12
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,060
He hates me so much,

13
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,740
but why did he hurt me?

14
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:48,940
Your Highness,

15
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,340
are you all right?

16
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,340
Take your dirty hand off.

17
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,380
You don't deserve to hold him.

18
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:58,820
What?

19
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,820
I don't deserve to hold him?

20
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,820
Your Highness,

21
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,660
Mu Han?

22
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,540
Yes, Your Highness.

23
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,340
He just took a wife away a few days ago.

24
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,500
You're really good at

25
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,460
telling lies.

26
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,900
Let me see if there's any wound.

27
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,780
It's all right, Father.

28
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,580
That's good.

29
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,340
Your Highness.

30
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,620
Did you catch the person behind the scene?

31
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,020
It's Princess Ji Yao.

32
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,700
I'll...

33
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,860
I took her from her.

34
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,940
She was not willing to do it,

35
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,460
so she did such a ridiculous thing.

36
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,420
Forget it.

37
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,700
I don't want to argue with her.

38
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,660
Your Highness, you're generous and respectful.

39
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,620
I'll leave you to it.

40
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,340
I'll leave you to it.

41
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,220
We've done our job.

42
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,380
By the way, Father,

43
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,580
do you remember

44
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,020
the slave, Mu Han, you gave me?

45
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,380
He's a good man.

46
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,420
I can only be in danger

47
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,780
with him.

48
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,340
Can you give an order

49
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,420
to take him to the slave house

50
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,140
and give him the title of guard?

51
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,620
Well...

52
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,740
Father,

53
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,580
I have the son you gave me.

54
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,900
And Mu Han.

55
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,500
I'm not afraid of any danger in the future.

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,340
Good.

57
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,940
I'll do as you say.

58
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,660
Thank you, Father.

59
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,460
Shu Er.

60
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,260
You're being more and more

61
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,420
rude to me now.

62
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,620
I wonder what you want to do today.

63
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,460
Look at your wound.

64
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,460
Do you feel better?

65
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,100
With the blood of the princess,

66
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,420
I feel better.

67
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,140
The thread can heal a hundred diseases.

68
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,460
Now the thread has entered your body.

69
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,780
Your blood

70
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,540
has the power to heal.

71
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,460
Don't let anyone else know about it.

72
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,900
That's good.

73
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,580
Let me see.

74
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,540
This slave

75
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,220
is not pretty.

76
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:41,980
I don't like it.

77
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,700
Shake it.

78
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:21,820
Crazy girl.

79
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,420
The trial of tablespoon science

80
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,060
Furthermore,

81
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,260
to feel him right

82
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,660
I put a little compound in my hand.

83
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,820
So they will get cake better.

84
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,180
Milk soup

85
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,180
so...

86
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,460
your eyes

87
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,460
so our eyes

88
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,180
will become bigger like nations and largest in the world!

89
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,540
But why

90
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,740
do you still let me

91
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,860
taste your beauty?

92
00:05:51,140 --> 00:06:18,900
Are 8 making of the

93
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,900
Thank you, father.

94
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,900
It's just a family dinner.

95
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,900
No need to be polite.

96
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,900
Father,

97
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,900
this is the painting I personally made for the annual show.

98
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,900
What a beautiful embroidery.

99
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,900
Your Majesty,

100
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,900
I'm very grateful.

101
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,900
Uncle,

102
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,900
what gift did you prepare for father?

103
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,900
Your Majesty,

104
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,900
this time, the eldest princess is very concerned about your birthday.

105
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,900
A few months ago,

106
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,900
I have already arranged to prepare a gift for you.

107
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,900
Your Majesty,

108
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,900
this thing is called the human skin bone.

109
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,900
It's made of the body of the traitor Zishangzhou Hang Zhan.

110
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,900
It can lure me, Lin Zhao,

111
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,900
to go out to battle and win.

112
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
Human skin bone?

113
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,900
This is quite fresh.

114
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,900
How did you make it?

115
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,900
The human skin bone is the softest part of the human skin.

116
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,900
It's cut open and put into water.

117
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,900
Its joints are made into bones.

118
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,900
The meridian is wrapped around the neck.

119
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,900
When the wind and dryness are good,

120
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,900
it will attract the very delicate human skin bone.

121
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,900
Good.

122
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,900
Nowadays,

123
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,900
all kinds of traitors have one intention.

124
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,900
They are just too stupid.

125
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,900
But this human skin bone is enough to shock them.

126
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,900
If anyone dares to treat him like the son of the late Empress Tiangao,

127
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,900
this human skin bone will be his end.

128
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,900
I will be a father.

129
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,900
I will not be scolded.

130
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,900
I will be a father.

131
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,900
Very good.

132
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,900
You are very sincere.

133
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,900
I will take my leave.

134
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
You are very sincere.

135
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,900
I will take my leave.

136
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,900
You wait a little longer.

137
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,900
When I feel the trust of Wen Nianruo is almost gone,

138
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,900
I will take revenge and revenge.

139
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,900
You please take your leave.

140
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,900
You please take your leave.

141
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,900
Let me take you with me.

142
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,900
Stop.

143
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,900
Let go of him.

144
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,900
It's not necessary.

145
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,900
I just called you brother.

146
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,900
And you obey me.

147
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,580
Dad.

148
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,300
Wanwu?

149
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,580
Uncle,

150
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,580
I don't care.

151
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,900
There are many people in the palace.

152
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,180
If you insist,

153
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,300
it's not appropriate.

154
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:20,940
How dare you!

155
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,700
You are a low-ranking slave.

156
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,100
How dare you question me?

157
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,620
Isn't the news of the lord's relationship with the princess

158
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,140
being controlled by Jin?

159
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,300
How come I didn't know

160
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,140
the princess had made me her

161
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,580
personal

162
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,180
servant?

163
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,780
Take me back.

164
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,340
Okay.

165
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,540
Let's go home.

166
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,500
Uncle,

167
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,540
I will take you back.
