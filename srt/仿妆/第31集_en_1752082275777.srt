1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I can't go to the wedding.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I've already told you my heart.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll pay you back what I owe you.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Your Highness, Miss Wang You.

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
She's not allowed to go out for a walk

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
without my permission.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let me out.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I said let me out.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Miss Wang You,

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
without your permission,

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can't go out.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Miss Wang You,

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
without your permission,

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
you can't go out for a walk.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You...

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I want to see her.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Your Highness,

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Miss Wang You wants to see you.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
No.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
No?

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Miss Wang You,

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
you haven't eaten anything for a day.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If you keep going like this,

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
you'll get sick.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Go back and tell Mu Han

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
if he doesn't come to see me,

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll keep starving.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Your Highness,

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Miss Wang You said you didn't see her for a day.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
She's been fasting for a day.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Why don't you

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
see her?

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Why?

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You care about her so much.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why do you have to do this?

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I can't see her.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm afraid I can't control her

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and hurt her.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
She won't come.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Instead of torturing yourself here,

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll help you leave.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You help me?

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
How?

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Here's the medicine.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
After taking it,

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
you can let people

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
lose their breath in a moment,

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
but it won't hurt their lives.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If you really want to leave,

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
take this medicine

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and escape from the mansion

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
by faking your death.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Why should I believe you?

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What if it's poisonous?

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If I really want to hurt you,

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't need to bother you.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Put it here.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Eat it or not, it's up to you.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
By the way,

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
if you don't want to leave,

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
it's okay.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You can stay

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
and have a drink

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
with me later.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll go with you.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Miss Wang You.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Come on, call the doctor.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Uncle.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What's going on?

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Although she's pale,

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
she's stable.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
She's pretending.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Leave here.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes.

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
She...

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Stop pretending.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Get up.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I...

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why did you pretend to be sick?

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Do you want to leave me?

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What's wrong with pretending to be sick?

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Who told you to lock me up like a prisoner?

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I told you.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Whether you remember or not,

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
you're Wen Yan Shu.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Why?

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm not.

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Just because I look like that woman?

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Besides, you have Wei Hui Qi.

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What am I doing here?

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
She's dead.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay.

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You don't remember, do you?

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll help you remember.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let me go.

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let me go.

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Look.

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
These are your favorite things.

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Do you remember anything?

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Do you remember anything?

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Even if you let me wear her clothes,

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and put on her hairpin,

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
what's the point?

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I said I'm not her.

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
She's dead.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
She won't come back.

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Shut up.

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't want you

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
to say that again.

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Otherwise,

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the army of Ling Zhou

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
will attack the border of Zhuyan.

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't want to see the God of Darkness

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
die in the battlefield.

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Just listen to me.

122
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You...

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Don't hurt Shi An.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's not her fault.

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'll wear it.

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll wear it.

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll listen to you.

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Be good.

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Sit down.

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I just want

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
to keep you by my side.

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I don't want to lose you again.

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But I'm not her.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Even if you keep me by your side every day,

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
what's the point?

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
As long as I admit that you are Fei Yan Shu,

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
that's enough.

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Nothing else

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
matters.

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Your Highness,

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Crown Prince Zhu Yan wants to see you.

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Be good.

144
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Listen to me.

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Stay here.

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll be back soon.

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Where did you hide Wang You?

148
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Did you hand it over

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
or did someone search it?

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is the state of Ling Zhou.

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I said no.

152
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's no.

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Who said no?

154
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Shu.

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Wang You.

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Did he ever bully you?

157
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll take you back now.

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let's go.

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Wait.

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Whether you go or stay,

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
let him decide.

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Wang You.

163
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
As long as you nod,

164
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I can take you back to Zhu Yan now.

165
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Even if you don't be my princess,

166
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I can give you everything you want.

167
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
No one will restrict your entry.

168
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You can go wherever you want.

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Think it over before you answer.

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Enough of you two.

171
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You want to keep me by your side.

172
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

173
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Shu.

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Wang You.

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Did you hear that?

176
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You can go now.

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If he doesn't go,

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I won't go anywhere.

179
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

180
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Since you've found him,

181
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
why didn't you take him back?

182
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Prince Zi Shang was on guard at the Garden.

183
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I tried to provoke him.

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But they're more isolated.

185
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And he seems to be interested in Prince Zi Shang.

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm taking him away tonight.

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Take him to the back yard of the Chalou in the south.

188
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yes.

189
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Go.

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Shu.

191
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Take a deep breath.

192
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Take the lotus seed soup to nourish your energy and calm your nerves.

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I said I won't eat it.

194

I said I won't eat it.

195
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Shu.

196
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The doctor just told me that

204
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
he shouldn't eat too much sweets.

205
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Wang You likes sweet things.

206
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000

207
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
He just ate the lotus seed soup.

208
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Can't you understand?

209
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm not like you.

210
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You're trying to make him do something he doesn't like.

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You!

212
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000

213
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000

Yes.

218
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll take you away.

219
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
As long as you go back with me,

220
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll agree to anything.

221
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm not leaving.

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I don't want to be your princess consort.

223
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't want to be someone else's substitute.

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I just want to be myself.

225
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Trust me.

226
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I won't put you in a trap anymore.

227
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Go back with me.

228
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What's the matter?

229
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I came to tell you.

230
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You think Yan Shi'an is sincere to you.

231
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
He just treats you as Wen Yan Shu.

232
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So from the beginning,

233
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm in your eyes

234
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
as Wen Yan Shu's substitute, right?

235
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
