1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,560
S Sister.

2
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,080
You won't hold back anymore.

3
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,880
Torture Sun slam near the laser say bye,

4
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,440
you'll not be hurt anymore.

5
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,720
will

6
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,240
not

7
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:48,760
but

8
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,600
house

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
My Lord, he's out of breath.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I just wanted to torture him.

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I didn't expect him to die so soon.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Then I'll throw him into the grave.

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let's bury him.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 16

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
General, we didn't find Bai Ling's body.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Leave us.

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
My Lord.

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
My Lord, please calm down.

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
My Lord.

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Maybe this blood...

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Only the blood of the little tree can continue.

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
My Lord.

24
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Is it a urgent report from the border?

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Lord Xuanyuan came back to avenge his son.

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He's out of the capital.

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He's already lost his parents in the border.

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Forgive me for being direct.

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If he agrees to marry,

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Zhu Yan will support him immediately.

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Ashu can't marry.

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But the Crown Prince of Zhu Yan said he wanted him.

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The others can't.

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
My Lord, Zhu Yan's letter.

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If you don't agree to marry Princess Royal,

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Zhu Yan will support you.

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
My Lord, please calm down.

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But what did the Crown Prince of Zhu Yan say in the letter?

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The most important thing is to arrange Princess Royal's marriage as soon as possible.

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
When she marries Zhu Yan,

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
she will have a child.

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
She can get back to Linzhou.

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes.

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The Crown Prince of Zhu Yan

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Is father going to ask me to marry Uncle Wen Yan instead?

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm afraid he has this intention.

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't worry.

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Mother will settle your marriage as soon as possible.

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yu'er.

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Do you have someone in mind?

51
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Of course.

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I have someone in mind.

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I've made up my mind about the marriage.

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Father.

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hurry up.

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The Crown Prince of Zhu Yan has a good feeling for you.

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You will be together forever.

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
My Lord.

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Since Shu Er's marriage has been arranged,

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
why don't you arrange the one who is pregnant together?

61
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Okay.

62
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yu'er.

63
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
General Mu is a young and talented man.

64
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He has been in love with Mu for a long time.

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's a great thing to have a child.

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Mu Han.

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Will you marry me?

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Uncle Wen Yan is going to get married soon.

69
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He will never come back.

70
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If you are willing to marry me,

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
not only general,

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I will push you to a position above the top of the ten thousand people.

73
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If you want the first position...

74
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Who said I was going to marry him?

75
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Uncle.

76
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Get out.

77
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Get out.

78
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Uncle.

79
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Uncle.

80
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Do you remember what happened to me last time?

81
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't be angry, father.

82
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I just thought about leaving you and my homeland.

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I was too worried, so I came here.

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Don't interfere with my marriage.

85
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If I refuse,

86
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
the people of Ling Zhao will also fall into the fire of water.

87
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If I refuse,

88
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
the worst result is to tell the truth to Brother Shi An.

89
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
There is still a way to escape.

90
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I am willing to.

91
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's just a matter of time.

92
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I want to choose by myself.

93
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I have no idea about your little mind.

94
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Uncle.

95
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Don't be too stubborn.

96
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I understand.

97
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Uncle wants to marry him.

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Why is the Marquis so angry?

99
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Have a cup of tea to calm down the fire.

100
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There are twelve hours left.

101
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm going to send my princess to marry him.

102
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Marry the princess?

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Isn't the Marquis preparing something?

104
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Believe it or not, I will kill you now.

105
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Even if you kill me,

106
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
you can't change the fact of marriage.

107
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The princess is now alone.

108
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The only one who can save her

109
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
is you.

110
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Do you think I don't know

111
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
that this is a trap set by you?

112
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Do you want me to sneak in?

113
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The princess has a grudge against me.

114
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't want her to be cruel to me in her hometown.

115
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
If you are willing to save her,

116
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I can pretend to be blind.

117
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Why do you think

118
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I will believe what you say?

119
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Do you still have a choice?

120
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Do you still have a choice?

121
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Do you want to see the person you care about most?

122
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I am willing to marry someone else,

123
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
have a child,

124
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
live forever,

125
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and never see each other again?

126
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You think about it.

127
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Marquis, are you really going to marry him?

128
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
This action is very important.

129
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Be sure to find some good masters.

130
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Be careful.

131
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Take away the gold snake.

132
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yes.

133
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The marriage road is full.

134
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I am Princess Dinghu Zhou.

135
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I am the princess.

136
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I am the princess.

137
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I am the princess.

138
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I am the princess.

139
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I am the princess.

140
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I am the princess.

141
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I am the princess.

142
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I am the princess.

143
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I am the princess.

144
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I am the princess.

145
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I am the princess.

146
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I am the princess.

147
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I am the princess.

148
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I am the princess.

149
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I am the princess.

150
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Ow.

151
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Take down this traitor who tries to ruin the peace with you.

152
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,200
Your smile is like a river

153
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
The blue sea is like the sky

154
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:53,200
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

155
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,200
I don't care if the wind and the moon are in my fingers

156
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,200
The world is like the sky

157
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,200
If we can be together forever

158
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,400
Forever to the end

159
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
The tears are like a wish

160
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Between you and me

161
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,400
The wind and the moon are in my fingers

162
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
The world is like the sky

163
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
The sea is not changing

164
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:32,400
I am here to make you smile

165
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,200
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

166
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,200
I don't care if the wind and the moon are in my fingers

167
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,200
The world is like the sky

168
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
The sea is not changing

169
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,200
I am here to make you smile

170
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Forever to the end

171
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,200
The wind and the moon are in my fingers

172
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Open your eyes

173
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Your smile is like a river

174
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,200
The blue sea is like the sky

175
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:20,200
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

176
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,200
I don't care if the wind and the moon are in my fingers

177
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,200
The world is like the sky

178
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,200
If we can be together forever

179
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,200
Forever to the end

180
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,200
The tears are like a wish

181
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Between you and me

182
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,200
The wind and the moon are in my fingers

183
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
The world is like the sky

184
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
The sea is not changing

185
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:56,200
I am here to make you smile

186
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:09,200
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

187
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,200
I don't care if the wind and the moon are in my fingers

188
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
The world is like the sky

189
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200

190
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:25,200
I am here to make you smile
