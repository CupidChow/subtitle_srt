1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Aladdin vs the

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:13,640
First part listening to the original plays

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:20,040
start by taking the additional smoking

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:26,020
and find out his story..

5
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,140
From the deaths leading to the centered disappearances of our allied countries..

6
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,020
Then that leg of diving center is in solution..

7
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,040
But when we were searching for the palace, we found a prince.

8
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,040
His mother is a palace maid.

9
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,040
She was accidentally sent by His Majesty.

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,040
Later, she was hidden in the palace by Wen Fuyu and the Queen.

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,040
Even His Majesty, Wen Jiuling, didn't know about this child.

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,040
What's your name?

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,040
My name is Wen Xuan.

14
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,040
Xuan.

15
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,040
Did you kill her here?

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,040
You said you let her go.

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,040
You were afraid she would take revenge for Wen Jiuling's death.

18
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,040
Let all the hatred stop at this moment.

19
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,040
From now on, you should be willing to sacrifice for your parents.

20
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,040
By the will of the heavens.

21
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,040
When the first King was ordained and the throne wasÎ½red.

22
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:12,540
The father's son and the queen of the King were killed and died.

23
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,140
and prove his loyalty to Zhou.

24
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,740
I will sweep away the enemy's enemies

25
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,340
and save the emperor.

26
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,740
I will sell the previous King Zishang

27
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,740
to prove the power of Zishangzhou.

28
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,940
I will be the new King Zishang.

29
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,740
Long live Your Majesty.

30
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:40,940
Your Highness.

31
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,740
Since you dismissed the bandits

32
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,340
and helped the new king to ascend the throne,

33
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,140
people's life is getting better and better.

34
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,940
The new king is still young.

35
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,740
He can't be completely relaxed.

36
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,740
The priority is to re-establish

37
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,540
the diplomatic relations between Zhou and Yan.

38
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,140
To prevent the new king from being attacked.

39
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,140
When everything is settled,

40
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,340
we can go back to Zishang.

41
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,740
Your Highness.

42
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,740
The new king thinks you have worked hard.

43
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,940
He gave you a new mansion.

44
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,940
What do you think?

45
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,740
No need.

46
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,540
I'd rather live here.

47
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,140
I'm used to it.

48
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,140
Your Highness.

49
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,140
It's been three years.

50
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,940
The new king is back.

51
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,740
Leave it to me.

52
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,540
Give it to me.

53
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,740
Your Highness.

54
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,340
Your Highness.

55
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,340
Shi'an, you're here.

56
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,940
I'm too busy with work.

57
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,940
I need to rest.

58
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,540
You came here to slack off.

59
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,540
Are you giving the official business to Ji Yao again?

60
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,940
She hasn't spoken to me for days.

61
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,540
If I don't visit you often,

62
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,340
I'm afraid you'll sneak out of the palace again.

63
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,340
I can't go out of the palace and meet people.

64
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,140
I'm so tired of hearing this.

65
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,140
The envoys of the neighboring country are visiting.

66
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,140
I don't want you to get hurt.

67
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,140
Be good.

68
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,740
After this time,

69
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,540
I'll take you to the great river of Zhuyan.

70
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,540
But you said this

71
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,540
last year,

72
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,340
last year,

73
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,740
and last year.

74
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,940
I don't know when it will come true.

75
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,340
Don't be so close to the table.

76
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,540
Be careful of your eyes.

77
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,340
The crown prince will care about people.

78
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,740
If you're really sick,

79
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,740
I won't have the support of the college.

80
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:35,940
Okay.

81
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,340
If you don't give me some salary,

82
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,540
I'm afraid I'm really going to be sick.

83
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,940
You really lack salary?

84
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,340
How is the official business?

85
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,740
The food and accommodation of the envoys

86
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,940
have been arranged.

87
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,740
By the way, there is one more thing.

88
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,940
The courier company sent a message

89
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,540
that the Prince of Zishuang will come with the envoys.

90
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,940
He will visit tonight.

91
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,340
You took the wrong one.

92
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,740
You took the love poem sent by the Prince of Zishuang.

93
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,540
Your love poem

94
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,540
is more than my memorial.

95
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,940
It's cold.

96
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,940
I took it to light the fire.

97
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,340
I heard that you seemed to be a little uneasy.

98
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,140
Why am I uneasy?

99
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,740
I have no guilt.

100
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,740
But you,

101
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,540
so many family members,

102
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,740
none of them like you.

103
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,940
I'm different from you.

104
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,740
I have no guilt.

105
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,740
Today is the Lantern Festival.

106
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,340
I have time to accompany him.

107
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,340
I am in this palace all day long.

108
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,940
My heart will be locked.

109
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,540
Your Highness, we are here.

110
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,340
Your Highness, we arrived at Zhuyang.

111
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,540
Your Highness, you have been tired all the way.

112
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,740
You are indeed a little tired.

113
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,340
Let's go back and rest.

114
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,340
No need.

115
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,540
You accompany me to see the scenery.

116
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,340
Bailing, wait for me here.

117
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,140
I'll be back soon.

118
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,740
I'll be back soon.

119
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,740
Who are you?

120
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,740
A'Shuo.

121
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,140
Is that you?

122
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,340
A'Shuo?

123
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,740
You have mistaken me.

124
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,340
A'Shuo.

125
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,140
I've been looking for you for three years.

126
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,540
I finally found you.

127
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,540
Let me go.

128
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,140
Who are you? I don't know you.

129
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,140
I'm Mu Han.

130
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,540
Look at me carefully.

131
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,140
Don't you remember me?

132
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,140
Let me go.

133
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,740
I'm warning you, don't come over.

134
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,340
If you come over, I'll call for help.

135
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,740
Insane.

136
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,740
A'Shuo.

137
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,540
Your Highness, what's wrong with you?

138
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,340
I found him.

139
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,140
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,140
I found him.

141
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,140
I finally found him.

142
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,140
Where did you go?

143
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,940
I just walked around.

144
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,740
Why didn't you ask someone to inform me?

145
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,940
I'm sorry. I forgot.

146
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,940
You didn't listen to me.

147
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,940
Didn't I tell you not to go out?

148
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,140
Why?

149
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,740
Why is that?

150
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,140
You can't leave the palace and meet someone.

151
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,540
What's the difference between me and a bird in the cage?

152
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,340
I'm sorry, Wang You.

153
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,740
You were killed by a person and lost your memory.

154
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,140
I don't want to lose you again.

155
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,540
I'm really scared.

156
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,940
But why don't I remember anything about it?

157
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,140
Am I really a princess who grew up in Zhuyan?

158
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,540
Do we really have a marriage contract?

159
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,340
Did I really love you?

160
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,540
Why can't I remember anything?

161
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,740
Wang You, look at me.

162
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,740
The past is the past.

163
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,940
When we get married,

164
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,740
I'll spend my whole life with you.

165
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,940
It's late.

166
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,140
Go to bed early.

167
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,340
Your Highness.

168
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,540
Don't come to the princess again.

169
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,140
Your life is not worth it.

170
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,540
Your face is not suitable.

171
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,140
Why?

172
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,540
Your Highness, the map is ready.

173
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,140
Thank you.

174
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,140
Long time no see, Si Yichen.

175
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,140
How are you, Your Highness?

176
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,140
Prince Zi Shang, I heard that you are not married yet.

177
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,340
There are countless ladies in my Zhuyan State.

178
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,940
If you can make friends with me,

179
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,340
it will be a good thing.

180
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,140
Thank you for your kind words.

181
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,340
No need.

182
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:21,140
I came here because I have something important to discuss with you.

183
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,140
Please.

184
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,140
In the past three years,

185
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,140
the relationship between Lingzhao and Zhuyan is getting further and further.

186
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,140
I came here to re-establish a friendly diplomatic relationship

187
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,140
with Zhuyan State and fight against Xuanhuang.

188
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,940
Prince Zi Shang,

189
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,140
please take a look at the current situation.

190
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,140
Xuanhuang only targets Lingzhao.

191
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,140
He is very admirable to me.

192
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,140
Why should I cause trouble for myself?

193
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,140
The Xuanhuang Army has been living on the borders of the two states,

194
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,140
and has been harassing and provoking the soldiers.

195
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,140
They are obviously trying to take over Lingzhao.

196
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,140
In fact, they are also trying to take over Zhuyan State.

197
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,140
I think the current situation of the Xuanhuang Army

198
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,140
is all because of Zhuyan State.

199
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,140
Prince Zi Shang is wrong.

200
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,140
The Xuanhuang people came to my Zhuyan State

201
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,140
to negotiate with my people.

202
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,140
The economy is getting better and better.

203
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,140
Don't you think it's a good thing?

204
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,140
This is the long-term plan of the Xuanhuang people.

205
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,140
First, they invest in large amounts of transactions

206
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,140
to win the people's favor on the border.

207
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,140
Then, they develop cultural and social relations,

208
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,140
marriage, marriage and marriage.

209
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,140
Zhuyan border is vast, but it is not enough to help the troops.

210
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,140
Once there is a gap,

211
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,140
the Xuanhuang people can immediately attack the imperial city.

212
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,140
I think the Crown Prince

213
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,140
will not want to see

214
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,140
the people's hands and feet.

215
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,140
I will wait for the Crown Prince to reply.

216
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,140
I will leave first.

217
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,140
Prince Zi Shang is right.

218
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,140
Not long ago, when I went to the border,

219
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,140
I found that most of the people

220
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,140
were dressed as Xuanhuang people.

221
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,140
I think this is not a empty story.

222
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,140
First, strengthen border management

223
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,140
and restrict the entry of Xuanhuang people.

224
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,140
Remember, no Xuanhuang people know.

225
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,140
Then, the alliance with Lin Zhao State...

226
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,140
I need to think about it again.

227
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,140
He is a man of many words.

228
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,140
Now there is a evil plan of the Xuanhuang people.

229
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,140
Lin Zhao cannot know.

230
00:14:43,140 --> 00:15:03,840
The

231
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,140
I'm as young as the moon

232
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,140
I asked a thousand times

233
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,140
Who is writing

234
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,140
You and me

235
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,140
I wish

236
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,140
Open your eyes

237
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,140
Your smile

238
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,140
Who is the one who is left behind

239
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,140
The blue sea is the sky

240
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,140
I wish to be with you for the rest of my life

241
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,140
Long love

242
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,140
No fear of the wind

243
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,140
The wind is willing to be with me

244
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,140
Time is changing

245
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,140
If I can be with you forever

246
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,140
Forever to the end

247
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,140
The deep wish of the two of us

248
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,140
Between you and me

249
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,140
Why is this wish

250
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,140
The end of the sky is still the same

251
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,140
If I can be with you forever

252
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,140
I'm as young as the moon

253
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,140
I asked a thousand times

254
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,140
Who is writing

255
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,140
You and me

256
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,140
I wish to be with you for the rest of my life

257
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,140
Open your eyes

258
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,140
Your smile

259
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,140
Who is the one who is left behind

260
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,140
The blue sea is the sky

261
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,140
I wish to be with you for the rest of my life

262
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,140
Long love

263
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,140
No fear of the wind

264
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,140
The wind is willing to be with me

265
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,140
Time is changing

266
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,140
If I can be with you forever

267
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,140
Forever to the end

268
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,140
The deep wish of the two of us

269
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,140
Between you and me

270
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,140
Why is this wish

271
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,140
The end of the sky is still the same

272
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,140
If I can be with you forever

273
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,140
I'm as young as the moon

274
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,140
I wish to be with you for the rest of my life

275
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,140
Thank you for watching!
