1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,440
Tak휘

2
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,120
To be Continued

3
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,880
So put it all back in its place.

4
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,000
Isn't It?

5
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,920
Or

6
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,440
I –

7
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,440
What do you mean?

8
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,440
I don't understand

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,440
I'm not a selfish person

10
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,440
I have parents and children

11
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,440
I'm willing to sell myself for the sake of living

12
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,440
I don't want to be caught and made the name of Liangyan Junzhu

13
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,440
That day the suicide was me

14
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,440
I was forced to do it

15
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,440
You are really not

16
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,440
Get out

17
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,440
I'm not afraid of death

18
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
Greetings, young master

19
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,440
Greetings, young master

20
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
Don't be so polite

21
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,440
If it weren't for you today

22
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,440
Fos and others wouldn't have given up

23
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
It's a coincidence

24
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
I just killed the fish

25
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,440
The old thief's people came

26
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,440
I can only dress up as a fish

27
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,440
This is the only way to escape

28
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
I'm afraid it's not that easy

29
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
You immediately send someone back to the capital

30
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,440
Do the job for me

31
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
Don't show your feet

32
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
Yes

33
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,440
I heard that the old thief was trying to show his kindness

34
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,440
The old thief is still in the ancestral hall

35
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,440
The prince and the princess are still outside

36
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,440
You

37
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,440
The revenge has not been repaid

38
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,440
The parents are unable to rest

39
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,440
Instead of letting them face the enemy here every day

40
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,440
Why don't you take them back to the Wuyin Youlin for some lonely land?

41
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,440
Yes

42
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Rescued

43
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
Madame

44
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,440
Mother

45
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,440
Sorry to see you

46
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:27,220
Probably want to live Aww

47
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,760
love

48
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,340
Is

49
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,480
okay

50
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,220
Also have the athlete selected

51
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,140
Let's just go

52
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,140
Very physical

53
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,440
You rolls

54
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,240
not that

55
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,900
My besteaus

56
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,520
Are looking for you

57
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,200
dare not

58
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
hurry up

59
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,700
do not

60
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,660
come

61
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,660
Don't make any noise.

62
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,660
Good.

63
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,660
You dare to attack me.

64
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,660
You traitor.

65
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,660
You are looking for death.

66
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,660
My lord, you don't know.

67
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,660
Yes, they are very powerful in Zishangzhou.

68
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,660
There are still people who support them.

69
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,660
If I don't do something wrong,

70
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,660
I'm afraid I can't be at peace.

71
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,660
Father and mother are dead.

72
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,660
Do we still have to use them?

73
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,660
Aren't you afraid that the emperor will know?

74
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,660
The emperor is far away from the emperor.

75
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,660
The emperor is far away from the emperor.

76
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,660
How can such a small thing enter his ear?

77
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,660
If you don't tell me,

78
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,660
the emperor will never know.

79
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,660
What's the benefit of telling me to hide it for you?

80
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,660
There is no benefit.

81
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,660
But once it's exposed, it will only be bad for you.

82
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,660
After all, you and Zishang King have a very close relationship.

83
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,660
But please rest assured.

84
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,660
Thanks to your help,

85
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,660
there is still a princess to guide you.

86
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,660
The fairy king is hurt, and the army is self-punished.

87
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,660
Even if it is broken,

88
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,660
it is its most deserved.

89
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,660
What does this have to do with me and my uncle?

90
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,660
My lord, you are right.

91
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,660
The rebels are very good at this.

92
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,660
Who?

93
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,660
Come out.

94
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,660
Uncle.

95
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,660
Uncle.

96
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,660
It's you.

97
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,660
Why are you here?

98
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,660
He is my face and my bodyguard.

99
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,660
What are you doing here?

100
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:18,660
Uncle, do you know where this is?

101
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,660
Isn't this interesting?

102
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,660
Since you have something to say,

103
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,660
we'll go first.

104
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,660
Why are you here?

105
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,660
Why are you here tonight?

106
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,660
I was lost tonight.

107
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,660
I was in a daze.

108
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,660
Really?

109
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,660
What do you think?

110
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,660
Your eyes are so red today.

111
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,660
It's like there's no meaning to it.

112
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,660
Why is that?

113
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,660
He is the king's man.

114
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,660
The queen is not my type.

115
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,660
What do you think?

116
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,660
Tonight, you met me.

117
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,660
Next time, you won't have that good of a luck.

118
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,660
Thank you, princess.

119
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,660
You betrayed your own life and killed your own people.

120
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,660
You are safe.

121
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,660
Tonight, you will be punished for your own life.

122
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,660
Uncle, how are you?

123
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,660
You are really a fool.

124
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,660
You are really a fool.

125
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,660
There are hundreds of souls in my mansion.

126
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,660
Tonight, I will use your blood to pay homage.

127
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,660
Kill them!

128
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,660
Yichen.

129
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,660
Zhe'er.

130
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,660
I am the only one in your world.

131
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,660
I am the only one in your world.

132
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,660
I am the only one in your world.

133
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,660
I am the only one in your world.

134
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,660
I am the only one in your world.

135
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
I am the only one in your world.

136
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,660
I am the only one in your world.

137
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,660
I am the only one in your world.

138
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,660
I am the only one in your world.

139
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,660
I am the only one in your world.

140
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,660
I am the only one in your world.

141
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,660
I am the only one in your world.

142
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,660
I am the only one in your world.

143
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,660
I am the only one in your world.

144
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,660
I am the only one in your world.

145
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,660
I am the only one in your world.

146
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,660
I am the only one in your world.

147
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,660
I am the only one in your world.

148
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,660
I am the only one in your world.

149
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,660
I am the only one in your world.

150
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,660
I am the only one in your world.

151
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,660
I am the only one in your world.

152
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,660
I am the only one in your world.

153
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,660
I am the only one in your world.

154
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,660
I am the only one in your world.

155
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,660
I am the only one in your world.

156
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
I am the only one in your world.

157
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,660
I am the only one in your world.

158
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,660
I am the only one in your world.

159
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,660
I am the only one who knows you,

160
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,660
I am the only one who has known you.

161
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,660
I am the only one in your world.

162
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,660
I am the only one in your world.

163
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,660
I am the only one in your world.

164
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,660
I am the only one in your world.

165
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,660
I am the only one in your world.

166
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,660
I am the only one in your world.

167
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,660
I am the only one in your world.

168
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,660
I am the only one in your world.

169
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,660
I am the only one in your world

170
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,660
I am the only one in your world.

171
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,500
I am the only one in your world

172
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
I am the only one in your world

173
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
I am the only one in your world

174
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,500
I'm not afraid of the wind and the moon

175
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,500
I'm not afraid of the wind and the moon

176
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,500
I'm not afraid of the wind and the moon

177
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,500
I'm not afraid of the wind and the moon

178
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,500
I'm not afraid of the wind and the moon

179
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,500
I'm not afraid of the wind and the moon

180
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,500
I'm not afraid of the wind and the moon

181
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
I'm not afraid of the wind and the moon

182
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
You and I

183
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,500
The world is changing

184
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,500
If you and I could be together

185
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Forever to the end

186
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Tears are deeper than you and me

187
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,500
The moon is in the air

188
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,500
The wind and the moon are still the same

189
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,500
I'm not afraid of the wind and the moon

190
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Open your eyes

191
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Your smile is like a dream

192
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,500
The blue sea and the sky

193
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,500
I want to be with you forever

194
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,500
I want to be with you forever

195
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,500
I'm not afraid of the wind and the moon

196
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,500
I'm not afraid of the wind and the moon

197
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,500
I'm not afraid of the wind and the moon

198
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
You and I

199
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,500
The world is changing

200
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,500
If you and I could be together

201
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
Forever to the end

202
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Tears are deeper than you and me

203
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,500
The moon is in the air

204
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,500
The wind and the moon are still the same

205
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,500
I'm not afraid of the wind and the moon

206
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Open your eyes

207
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
You and I
