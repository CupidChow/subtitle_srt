Live happily.

00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,640
Live well

I

23
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,220
I'm here to kill you

24
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,900
I'm going to attack

25
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,220

26
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,500
Sending all to the Cang Hua House

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
The innocent souls of the Zishan Mansion

28
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,500
Can help your father

29
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
You don't sound like it

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Little girl

31
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Do you have this ability?

32
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,500
I have no way out

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
You want to kill the emperor?

34
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,500
Okay

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,500
Maybe I can help you

36
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,500
A little help

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
What did you say?

38
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
The emperor is your father

39
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
He knows nothing about your favor

40
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,500
Yes

41
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,500
He gave me a high position

42
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
And a lot of wealth

43
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,500
But he also gave me

44
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
The pain of death

45
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
And the suffering of day and night

46
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Guess

47
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Where did his blood-stained anger come from?

48
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,500
It's from my mother's life

49
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
She treated me well

50
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Because I could strengthen her blood-stained anger

51
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
She rewarded me with a boy

52
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Because

53
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
I could speak for her

54
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
When I gave birth to the baby

55
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,500
It's my time to sacrifice

56
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Come

57
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Brother

58
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
Blood

59
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
We can cooperate

60
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Tell me

61
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
How do you want to pay back?

62
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,500
I want to become you

63
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Okay, I'll give you

64
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
And you

65
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Give me a free life

66
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
You don't regret

67
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
I will not regret

68
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Yu terrifying

69
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
The wind was cages

70
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
So let the studio open

71
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Yu withаю

72
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Quick

73
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Quick

74
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Suggest

75
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,500
A load of glory

76
00:04:48,500 --> 00:05:18,500
You will become a

77
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,500
I'm not Wei Yan Shu anymore.

78
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Leave now.

79
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,500
But I have to remind you.

80
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
If you reveal the secret between us to the whole universe,

81
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
I will kill you without hesitation.

82
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
Don't worry.

83
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
I will not let you go.

84
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
I will not let you go.

85
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
I will not let you go.

86
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
I will not let you go.

87
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
I will not let you go.

88
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
I'm leaving.

89
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
From now on,

90
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,500
I just want to spend the rest of my life with the one I love.

91
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
I hope one day in the future,

92
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
I can be the emperor of the Ming Dynasty.

93
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,500
The world will be at peace.

94
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
I will be at peace.

95
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Shu, what happened?

96
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
He Chuan.

97
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
I...

98
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Shu, how are you?

99
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
I'm here.

100
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Are you okay?

101
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Almost.

102
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Almost.

103
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Almost.

104
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Almost.

105
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,500
We can be free.

106
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Princess, according to your order,

107
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
disperse those faces.

108
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Okay.

109
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
You should leave too.

110
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Princess,

111
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
His Majesty has not kept his promise

112
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
and killed my sister.

113
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
In the past,

114
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
in order to protect my sister's life,

115
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
my hands

116
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
were already covered with dirty blood.

117
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,500
I have to protect my sister.

118
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
I have to protect my sister.

119
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
I have already covered with dirty blood.

120
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Princess,

121
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
His Majesty's blood is very weak.

122
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
You don't have a child.

123
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
He will definitely put you in a trap.

124
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Don't drive me away.

125
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Let me stay by your side

126
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
and protect you.

127
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Okay?

128
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
You stay by my side

129
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
because you want to take revenge, right?

130
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Get up.

131
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Prepare the horse.

132
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Let's attack.

133
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
Yes.

134
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Your Highness, the princess is here.

135
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Greetings, Father.

136
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Father,

137
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
tomorrow is Mother's death day.

138
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
I have prepared some food and wine

139
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,500
and want you to go with me.

140
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Uncle,

141
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
your mother has passed away for many years.

142
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
I'm afraid

143
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
she can't even remember

144
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
what she looks like.

145
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
But

146
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
I lost my mother when I was a child.

147
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Now that I have opened the house for a long time,

148
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
my father has never been there.

149
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
This huge princess's mansion

150
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
is always cold and quiet.

151
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
I taught you

152
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
to give up these children's love

153
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
to make it a big deal.

154
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Father,

155
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
just promise me.

156
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Just once.

157
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
You little girl.

158
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
Okay.

159
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
I'll be there tomorrow.

160
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Thank you, Father.

161
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Anye Wei.

162
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Yes, Your Highness.

163
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Take a elite soldier

164
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
to the princess's mansion.

165
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
If there is any movement

166
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
in the princess's mansion tomorrow,

167
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
don't talk about it.

168
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Yes.

169
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Leave us.

170
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Yes, Your Highness.

171
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Your Highness.

172
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Your Highness.

173
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Your Highness.

174
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,500
You can go.

175
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,500
You can stay.

176
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
I'm here to tell you

177
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
that Father is in my sister's mansion.

178
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
You stay here.

179
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
No one is allowed to enter.

180
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Yes.

181
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,500
Your Highness.

182
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Lord Bao.

183
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
I can finally

184
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
take your life.

185
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
Little Uncle.

186
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Do you want

187
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
to go against Father?

188
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Father?

189
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
My father

190
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
died in the massacre

191
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
in the Prince Zi Shang's mansion.

192
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,500
You are...

193
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,500
No matter who you are,

194
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
if you dare to kill me,

195
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
you have to be prepared

196
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
to die.

197
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
I want to

198
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
