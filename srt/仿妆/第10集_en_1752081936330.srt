1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Let's go~~

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Love with Princess

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Episode 15

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Love with Prince

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Episode 15

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Do you have to love someone wholeheartedly?

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Besides, our relationship...

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So what?

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We both know very well.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If we have this kind of relationship,

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,620
I will take you to the

12
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,000
Mermaid's World

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and spend a short rest of your life with you.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
My Lord,

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
it's better to love someone wholeheartedly.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We used to love each other wholeheartedly.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You know that

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm the one who is with Shu'er now.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let's go, Shu'er.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
My Lord, do you want me to teach that boy a lesson?

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Tonight, I want Mu Han to die.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Go and get the Minister of War.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What's wrong with Shu'er?

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What's wrong?

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Shu'er seems to be not interested in

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
the affairs of men and women.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What's the matter with you?

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What does it mean to love each other wholeheartedly?

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You are close to each other and often have private meetings.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Why?

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Why?

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's still a matter of course.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You care so much about the relationship between me and him.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Do you have a crush on him?

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Really?

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Then I really like to do impossible things

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and teach people who are not to be known.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The story of him and the rumored Wen Yan Shu

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
is not so similar.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What kind of person is he?

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Mu Han,

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
how is the thing I told you last time?

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's tiring to take care of two people at the same time.

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Why don't you just take care of me?

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Why is he so late to find Mu Han?

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I can't stop him.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Push me!

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
My people,

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
don't touch anyone.

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Let's go.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's go.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Fu Yu, does your head hurt?

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You didn't rest well yesterday.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Today is the same as tomorrow.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You still have a big bag.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Fu Yu, you should rest more.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Can you talk less?

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Uncle,

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
you will like the food I bought for you.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You just had breakfast this morning.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You are considerate.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You came from afar and came to visit me.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
How about taking a rest after passing by Zishang's fief?

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Zishang Wang Sisheng greets you.

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
His face...

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
My lord,

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
what?

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Do you know Guard Mu?

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Guard Mu?

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Guard Mu is from the Princess's mansion.

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Do you know him?

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The Princess's guard

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
is a very important person.

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't know the Princess's guard.

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But I think I know him.

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Maybe I remembered it wrong.

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You remembered it wrong?

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You didn't know

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
that you wanted to fight with me.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You are joking.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You are not as kind as Fu Yu.

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You are very stubborn.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
How about going to Zishang's mansion

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and let me see the owner of the mansion?

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I apologize for being rude.

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Thank you, my lord.

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Please.

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Zishang's mansion

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
My lord, please come in.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Zishang's mansion

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He looks so much like him.

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Could it be that he died in a fake way?

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Who sent the assassin to assassinate Si Yichen?

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It was Zhu Yu.

98
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He failed to do his job.

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He was sent to the village after the assassination.

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Hurry up.

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Send someone to get him back.

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes.

103
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What's the matter, my lord?

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Why did you have to ask me to bring Guard Mu here so early in the morning?

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You don't know.

106
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
When I saw Guard Mu yesterday,

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I felt very familiar.

108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He looks like the late King Zishang.

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I wonder what Guard Mu has to do with the late King Zishang.

110
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What do you mean, my lord?

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Back then, my disloyal brother

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
had a plan to rebel.

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
His majesty ordered to execute him.

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Their couple, along with my nephew Si Yichen,

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
were already dead.

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Si Yichen is a man of the world.

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But my nephew had a stroke since he was a child.

118
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He was sick in the mountains.

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
No one knew what he looked like when he grew up.

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
When I saw Guard Mu's face,

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I thought,

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
the body hanging on the wall,

123
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
was it my nephew Si Yichen?

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What?

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
My lord, you said I'm Si Yichen.

126
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
There are so many people of the world who look alike.

127
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You have no evidence,

128
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
so you need to be more cautious.

129
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
My lord, what do you think?

130
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Tell me, who are you?

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If you are Si Yi Chen,

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
then who was the body hanging on the wall of the city?

133
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Why did you approach Shu?

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You don't want to tell me?

135
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Then I will let you die here today.

136
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Stop!

137
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Sister really adores Guard Mu,

138
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
but she is willing to block the knife for him.

139
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This Wen Yan Shu is quite a good student.

140
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Shu, this person has an unknown background.

141
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Staying by his side is a disaster.

142
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You said he was Si Yi Chen.

143
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What evidence do you have?

144
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Zhou Yu, come in.

145
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

146
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Greetings, Your Excellencies.

147
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Zhou Yu, you should recognize him.

148
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Is he Si Yi Chen?

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You and An Ning are about to get married.

150
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's been ten years since we last met.

151
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He probably doesn't recognize you.

152
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Your Highness, the Prince sent me to pick you up

153
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and ask Miss An Ning to marry you.

154
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It seems that someone is not at ease.

155
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Now that the situation is getting worse,

156
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I will go to the palace and ask for help.

157
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I will go to the palace and ask for help.

158
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It seems that someone is not at ease.

159
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Now that it's not safe,

160
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I will send Yi Chen back to the palace.

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Bai Ling, you go to pick up Ning Er.

162
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Tell Ning Er that I will wait for her in the palace.

163
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yes.

164
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Your Highness, I have looked carefully.

165
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He is not Si Yi Chen.

166
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Did you look carefully?

167
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Your Highness, I have looked carefully.

168
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
He looks a little like Si Yi Chen.

169
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But he is definitely not the same person.

170
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Your Highness, you have been to my guards

171
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
many times.

172
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Do you have a grudge against me?

173
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I was confused.

174
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Please forgive me.

175
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Please forgive me.

176
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yes.

177
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You are confused and want to end it.

178
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Sister, you should forgive others.

179
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
His Highness did not do it on purpose.

180
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Why are you so aggressive?

181
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Sister Fuyu, why are you speaking for His Highness?

182
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Why don't you speak for yourself?

183
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I just think that His Highness

184
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
is thinking for your safety.

185
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Besides, it's not a big deal

186
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
to recognize the wrong person.

187
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You are so generous.

188
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Why don't you apologize for Prince Zi Shang?

189
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You...

190
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Uncle, don't hurt He Qi.

191
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Since we have said it,

192
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
why don't we forget it?

193
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
For a guard with an unknown background,

194
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
you should apologize instead.

195
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What happened today is my fault.

196
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I shouldn't have

197
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
offended you and Guard Mu.

198
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Please forgive me.

199
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Let's end it here.

200
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
If there is another time,

201
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I will not forgive you.

202
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Thank you for your kindness.

203
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Let's go.

204
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
My Lord, I still think

205
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
he is too similar to Prince Zi Shang.

206
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Go check his background.

207
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Okay.

208
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Uncle,

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
what are you doing?

210
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Tell me, who are you?

211
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm here to see you.

212
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm here to see you.

213
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm here to see you.

214
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm here to see you.

215
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm here to see you.

216
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm here to see you.

217
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm here to see you.

218
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm here to see you.

219
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm here to see you.

220
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm here to see you.

221
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm here to see you.

222
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm here to see you.

223
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm here to see you.

224
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm here to see you.

225
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm here to see you.

226
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm here to see you.

227
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm here to see you.

228
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm here to see you.

229
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm here to see you.

230
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm here to see you.

231
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm here to see you.

232
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm here to see you.

233
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm here to see you.

234
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm here to see you.

235
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm here to see you.

236
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm here to see you.

237
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm here to see you.

238
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm here to see you.

239
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm here to see you.

240
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,700
One Eyes

241
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,700
Loves traumas

242
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,700
I'm afraid that the wind and the sea will be separated.

243
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:45,700
I wish to spend the rest of my life with you.

244
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,700
I'm not afraid of the wind and the sea.

245
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,700
I wish to spend the rest of my life with you.

246
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,700
If we can be together forever,

247
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,700
I wish to be with you forever.

248
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,700
How many wishes are there in front of me?

249
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,700
Why is it so far away?

250
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,700
Finally, the sky and the sea are not separated.

251
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:21,700
Let me be by your side.

252
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,700
I'm afraid that the wind and the sea will be separated.

253
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,700
I wish to spend the rest of my life with you.

254
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,700
I wish to spend the rest of my life with you.

255
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,700
I wish to spend the rest of my life with you.

256
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,700
I wish to spend the rest of my life with you.
