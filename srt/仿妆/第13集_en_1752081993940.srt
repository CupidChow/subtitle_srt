00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,800
We are

优优独播剧场——YoYo Television Series Exclusive

3
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,300
Are you okay?

4
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,660
Let me take you back.

5
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,120
those in there are playing cards,

6
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,900
and I am just honestly just Weimaran.

7
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,580
I don't care.

8
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,960
Shut up.

9
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,540
Shut up.

10
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,180
Shut up!

11
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,560
Go to Hell!

12
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,680
Go to Hell!

13
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,260
Let me go!

14
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,520
There is no other way to physical attack.

15
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,820
Get down.

16
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Why this time, Shu'er is so protective of her?

17
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,800
It seems that Shu'er's eyes are a little different.

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,800
What? You think Wen Fuyu's eyes are different?

19
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Princess, rest early.

20
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,800
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Shi'er, Yichen accidentally got sick.

22
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,800
I'm going to take him to the secret mirror to treat him.

23
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,800
I'll leave my sister to you.

24
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
It's been ten years.

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,800
We've been here all along.

26
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,800
An Ning, don't worry.

27
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
He will definitely come back.

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,800
He probably doesn't recognize me.

29
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,800
But he definitely recognizes you.

30
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
My An'er!

31
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Mother?

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,800
All these years, your father and I have been looking for you.

33
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Come home with me.

34
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Don't go!

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,800
An Ning, don't worry.

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
I'll be back soon.

37
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
God of Yan!

38
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Does it hurt?

39
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
It hurts.

40
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,800
This is just a greeting.

41
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,800
See you tomorrow in the palace.

42
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
I'll be back.

43
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Your Highness.

44
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
I have a question.

45
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Please go ahead.

46
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,800
I've never met you before.

47
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Why do you have such a big enemy against me?

48
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Your Highness, I heard that he was alone.

49
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,800
He went to the Princess's Mansion to assassinate him.

50
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
What did you say?

51
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
An Ning?

52
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
An Ning?

53
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
An Ning?

54
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Wen Yanshu.

55
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
It's you.

56
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
You killed An Ning.

57
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
I...

58
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
No.

59
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
I can't tell the truth.

60
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,800
That's why I'm so worried.

61
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Even if I killed him,

62
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
I wouldn't...

63
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
I want you to die with him.

64
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,800
This bone is called the Heart-wrenching Bone.

65
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,800
The white bone pierces the heart and breaks into the bone.

66
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
But don't worry.

67
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
I won't let you die so early.

68
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,800
You just need to endure for an hour.

69
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,800
You want to imprison the Princess for him?

70
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,800
If you tell anyone about tonight,

71
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
I'll take back all the military funds.

72
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800
I know you don't care about the people.

73
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
But once you're defeated,

74
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,800
your glory and wealth will disappear.

75
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Enjoy yourself.

76
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
She's not here.

78
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,800
I saw her in the Crown Prince's room.

79
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,800
It seems she has a good feeling about the Crown Prince.

80
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,800
I think she's going to tell the truth.

81
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Hey.

82
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,800
I think you should stay.

83
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
I'm happy to be with you.

84
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,800
It's normal for you to think that way.

85
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,800
You're a good dog.

86
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
You found me here.

87
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,800
I'm disappointed with the Crown Prince's trick.

88
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
What do you mean?

89
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,800
You should ask Lingzhao for a marriage.

90
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Then the Princess will be the Crown Princess.

91
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
At that time,

92
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,800
it's easier for you to do what you want.

93
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,800
General Mu seems to be different from the rumors.

94
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,800
It's really a surprise to see you today.

95
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
It's just a rumor.

96
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Don't take it seriously.

97
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,800
What's important is to achieve our goals.

98
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Isn't it?

99
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Yes.

100
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Shu'er, you're awake.

101
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Shu'er, don't worry.

102
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
I have my own way.

103
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,800
Princess Linzhao was kidnapped.

104
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,800
You want to start a war between the two countries.

105
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,800
You want to start a war between the two countries.

106
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
You want to start a war between the two countries.

107
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,800
You want to start a war between the two countries.

108
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
You're the future king of Xuanhuang.

109
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Are you willing to be suppressed by Lingzhao?

110
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
As long as you kidnap Wen Yanshu,

111
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
you can use him as a bargaining chip

112
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,800
and ask Lingzhao's king for a marriage.

113
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,800
So you have an idea.

114
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,800
This is the route Wen Yanshu returned to the city.

115
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,800
The rest is up to you.

116
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Princess was too tired last night.

117
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
She's resting now.

118
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Don't disturb her.

119
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Get out of the way.

120
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Brother, don't worry.

121
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
I'm just tired.

122
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
I can't rush to work.

123
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
You and Muhan go first.

124
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Father is waiting for your order.

125
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Don't get into the official business.

126
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
My lord, if you don't worry,

127
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
I'll go with my sister.

128
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
It's good to have a care.

129
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
What about Princess Ji Yao?

130
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Princess Ji Yao said

131
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,800
she finally came out and wanted to play for a few more days.

132
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
You set out immediately and rush to work at night.

133
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Maybe you can arrive early.

134
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,800
In case you get into the official business and get punished by the king.

135
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Go.

136
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,800
Muhan said he was happy with me.

137
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
When I return to Linzhao,

138
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,800
I'll tell my parents to grant them a marriage.

139
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
What did you say?

140
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Grant them a marriage?

141
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,340
The

142
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
The

143
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Bai Ze, send this letter to Linzhao.

144
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
Give it to the king.

145
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Yes.

146
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
What did you say?

147
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Ashu and Fuyu

148
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
were kidnapped by Prince Nanshan.

149
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,800
My lord, they asked you to exchange their lives

150
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
in three cities within three days.

151
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Otherwise...

152
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Three cities?

153
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,800
They really dare to make a bold decision.

154
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
My lord,

155
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,800
it's important to think carefully.

156
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
My lord, my queen,

157
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
it's better to save people.

158
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
If...

159
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Report!

160
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
My lord,

161
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
this is a letter from the Crown Prince of Zhuyan,

162
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
sent by the Eight Hundred Li family.

163
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
If the chief princess comes to Zhuyan,

164
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
I'm willing to help Linzhao

165
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
to sweep out the evil spirits.

166
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Where is the Dark Shadow Guard?

167
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
My lord.

168
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
Give the order.

169
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
At all costs,

170
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
save the two princesses as soon as possible.

171
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Yes.

172
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
My lord, the Dark Shadow Guard is on the move.

173
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
I'm afraid it will alert the enemy.

174
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
I'm willing to go to save people.

175
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
I'm willing to go with the troops.

176
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
Good.

177
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,800
It's rare that you both have such a heart.

178
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
In that case,

179
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
within three days,

180
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
whoever saves the two princesses first

181
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
will be rewarded.

182
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
If the two princesses are able to,

183
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,800
you two

184
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
will be punished with death.

185
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Yes.

186
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
My lord.

187
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Are you going to save the witch Wen Yanshu?

188
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
I'll talk to you when I get back.

189
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
I forgot to tell you.

190
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
I ordered Prince Xuanhua

191
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
to take away Wen Yanshu.

192
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
He deserved it.

193
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
You can't save him.

194
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
My lord.

195
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Once this is over,

196
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
I'll let you handle it.

197
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
My lord.

198
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Your father

199
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
will be punished

200
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
if he doesn't behave properly.

201
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Tomorrow

202
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
is your death day.

203
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
But before that,

204
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
I'll trouble you

205
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
to be the military officers.

206
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
So that I can

207
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
also be able to

208
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
rely on you and your brothers.

209
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Good.

210
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
If you dare to touch my finger,

211
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
Lingzhao's body

212
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
will break through the barrier

213
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,800
and you will all die.

214
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
We will die?

215
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Let's just enjoy ourselves.

216
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
Let's talk about the world

217
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
and the many years we have missed.

218
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,800
How far is it?

219
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
I asked thousands of times

220
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
who is writing

221
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,800
our wishes.

222
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Open your eyes

223
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
and your smile

224
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,800
is like water flowing through the river.

225
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
The blue sea and the sky

226
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,800
I want to spend my life with you.

227
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
I don't care if the sky and earth

228
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
are different from each other.

229
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,800
The world is like a sky.

230
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,800
If we can be together forever,

231
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,800
we will be together forever.

232
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,800
I don't care if the sky and earth

233
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,800
are different from each other.

234
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Open your eyes

235
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
and your smile

236
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,800
is like water flowing through the river.

237
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
The blue sea and the sky

238
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:46,800
I want to spend my life with you.

239
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
Chile

240
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Open your eyes

241
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
and your smile

242
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,800
is like water flowing through the river.

243
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
The blue sea and the sky

244
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:36,800
I'm willing to spend the rest of my life with you

245
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Don't be afraid of the wind and the sky, you and me

246
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Time will change with the sky

247
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,800
If we can be together forever, you and me

248
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Forever until the end

249
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,800
The deep wish of the eyes, you and me

250
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,800
Why is it so far away?

251
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,800
The heaven and the sea are not even

252
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:12,800
Let me be in your heart

253
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Forever until the end
