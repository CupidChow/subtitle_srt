1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,340
Counter refugees

2
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,840
I want cathedral

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,600
Cedrall

4
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,380
Kinda like Brandon

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,440
You planned it.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,840
You are so kind and mature.

7
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,080
But you and uncle didn't cross the Daling.

8
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,680
But you still have the crown princess.

9
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,120
Now you are getting married.

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,160
The crown princess is so angry that I have no one.

11
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,000
If you promise me today,

12
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,520
I promise to double the conditions of Linzhao.

13
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,800
How about it?

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,640
Yes.

15
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,600
It seems that the marriage is not going to work.

16
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,440
Well, in that case,

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,720
I will cancel the marriage.

18
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,920
Father, what about Mohan?

19
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
You are so kind.

20
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,680
You don't want to hurt others.

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,680
You should let Mohan go as I want.

22
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,680
If Linzhao is in trouble,

23
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,240
I will help you.

24
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,200
Okay.

25
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,240
Today, for the sake of the crown prince,

26
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,840
I will spare his life.

27
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,400
Thank you, your majesty.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,200
Okay, you can leave.

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,760
I am tired.

30
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,800
Thank you, father.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,760
Thank you, your majesty.

32
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,840
Report.

33
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,320
Your majesty.

34
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,880
The people are complaining about the death in the capital.

35
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,080
The girls' families who were caught in the trap

36
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,440
and the high-ranking officers.

37
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,440
I...

38
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,080
The dead will not be caught in the trap.

39
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,080
Yes.

40
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,720
Brother Shi'an, last night...

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,160
An Ning, you and I don't need to be polite.

42
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,440
But you came to cancel the marriage.

43
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,880
Your father...

44
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,800
Don't worry about it.

45
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,200
I have my own way.

46
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,760
Now that you are safe and sound,

47
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,960
I feel relieved.

48
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,920
Go to him.

49
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,280
Yan Shi'an.

50
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,280
You are not happy?

51
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,480
What happened?

52
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,360
Princess Jiao.

53
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,080
I will leave if there is nothing else.

54
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,560
What's wrong?

55
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,720
You are unhappy?

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,560
Don't be sad. I know.

57
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,080
Uncle Wen Yan brought you a green hat.

58
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,400
You are not happy...

59
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,160
Say it again.

60
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Don't follow me.

61
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
I don't want to say it.

62
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,760
Don't be angry.

63
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,160
I know Lin Zhaogong very well.

64
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,440
I will take you to see him.

65
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,440
Does it hurt?

66
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,640
No.

67
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,560
Don't pay attention to His Majesty for me.

68
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,440
What if he is mean to you?

69
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,040
For you, I can do anything.

70
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,040
Even if it takes my life,

71
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,760
I will not give up.

72
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
Uncle Wen Yan.

73
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
Listen to me.

74
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,440
You are more important than anyone in the world.

75
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,440
I don't deserve you.

76
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,440
You deserve it.

77
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
How is your injury?

78
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,440
It's okay.

79
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
This is...

80
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
It's a pity.

81
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Master Tan said

82
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,440
this is the only one in the world.

83
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,440
He will never meet another one.

84
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
If you really like it,

85
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
I will fix it for you.

86
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,440
I will be your friend.

87
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
I will be your friend.

88
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,440
I will be your friend.

89
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Oh, right.

90
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,440
There is a Lantern Festival tonight.

91
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,440
Let's go to see the lanterns together.

92
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Lanterns?

93
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Yes.

94
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,440
It is said that the Lantern Festival

95
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,440
originated in Jiangling.

96
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,440
If there is a person who can put the lanterns together,

97
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,440
they can stay together for a lifetime.

98
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,440
The Lantern Festival is so lively this year.

99
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,440
Look how beautiful my lanterns are.

100
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Hurry up.

101
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,440
Hurry up.

102
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,440
There is a lantern festival.

103
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
Wait for me.

104
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,440
Come on.

105
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,440
Let's go to the lantern festival.

106
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
Yan Shi'an,

107
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
you are not going to take a walk

108
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
if you walk so fast.

109
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
I will tell you one last time.

110
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
Don't follow me.

111
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
Otherwise, don't blame me for being rude to you.

112
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
I don't believe you will do this.

113
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
You and I will take a walk together.

114
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,440
Open your mouth after you swallow the food in your mouth.

115
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
No.

116
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,440
You are so pitiful.

117
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
I am so nice to you.

118
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
You are still angry.

119
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,440
How about I give you the peach gourd?

120
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
I will give you the peach gourd.

121
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,440
I wish to have a good time with you

122
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,440
and spend the rest of my life with you.

123
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,440
So that we can spend the rest of our lives together.

124
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
What wish did you make?

125
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,440
The wish I just made is...

126
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
Don't say it.

127
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,440
I won't talk to you if you say it.

128
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
Okay.

129
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,440
What are you doing?

130
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,440
I will be with you until the next time.

131
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,440
I have fixed the jade pendant that day for you.

132
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
The three-colored flowers are only left to be cut.

133
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,440
It's a revenge day when the flowers bloom.

134
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
If we have a revenge day,

135
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,440
there will be one innocent girl left in this world.

136
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
An Ning, I can't stay in the capital for long.

137
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
I will return in a few days.

138
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,440
I will make a good move.

139
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
I will go to the capital with you.

140
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
I will wait for you.

141
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
I will wait for you.

142
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
I will wait for you.

143
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
I will wait for you.

144
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
I will wait for you.

145
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
I will wait for you.

146
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
I will wait for you.

147
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,440
I will return in a few days.

148
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,440
If you encounter any trouble in the future,

149
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,440
just tell someone to bring this thing back to Zhu Yan.

150
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,440
Then you can transfer half of the troops of the Eastern Palace.

151
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,440
Brother Shi'an, thank you.

152
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Mu Han is not a good person.

153
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,440
This marriage is all planned by him.

154
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
Then I will be at ease.

155
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Is that so?

156
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
Brother Shi'an,

157
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,440
can you do me one more favor before you leave?

158
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,440
OK, I promise you.

159
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
Your Majesty,

160
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,440
the Xuanhuang has been moving recently.

161
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
I am willing to lead the troops out of the battle

162
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
to share your worries.

163
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
Oh?

164
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Good.

165
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
You are sharing your worries for me.

166
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Then do you know that the Xuanhuang is now strong?

167
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,440
And I have not fought in the war for many years.

168
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
How much do you want to win

169
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
if you want to lead the troops to the Xuanhuang?

170
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
I have already thought of a solution.

171
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
We can ask the Zhu Yan State for help.

172
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,440
The so-called King of Chun's order.

173
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,440
I think the Crown Prince of Zhu Yan State will be willing.

174
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
OK, then it's too much.

175
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
If you can destroy the Xuanhuang,

176
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,440
it will be a big trouble for me.

177
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,440
But you will be rewarded for your victory.

178
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

179
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,440
General Mu,

180
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,440
I think my sister does not love you.

181
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Love is not about the heart.

182
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
I am willing to do it.

183
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
I am willing to do it.

184
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,440
I know my sister best.

185
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
She is happy and loves beauty.

186
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,440
You are no different from those men for her.

187
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,440
I think you are having a good time with the Crown Prince of Zhu Yan State.

188
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,440
Please be careful.

189
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
If you are not comfortable,

190
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
General Mu will go back and see.

191
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Crown Prince, be gentle.

192
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,440
You really don't know how to be considerate.

193
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,440
I am more considerate than General Mu.

194
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,440
Of course, it's you.

195
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,440
I am sorry.

00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440

00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,740
I am sorry.

225
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,520
I am sorry.

226
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,360
No.

227
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,840
I am sorry.

228
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,840
I am sorry.

229
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,840

I can always be with you

240
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:07,340
Don't be afraid of the wind and the clouds, between us

241
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,340
Time will change with the sky

242
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,340
If we can be together forever

243
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,340
Forever until the end

244
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,340
The wish of the yearning, between us

245
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,340
I will be with you

246
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,340
