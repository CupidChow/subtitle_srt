1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,180
이게

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:21,340
eh

3
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,480
Play su bike

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:37,660
Play

5
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,660
Let's end the fight.

6
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,580
And if the flowers bloom,

7
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,700
then we will part ways.

8
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,140
Why are you here again?

9
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,300
I want to see you.

10
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,300
When there is no one down there,

11
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,260
you should run away,

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,820
so we don't get discovered here.

13
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,780
I won't run away.

14
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:10,980
Wangyou!

15
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,780
Wangyou!

16
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,220
Hide yourself!

17
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:17,820
Quickly.

18
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,340
Why are you so nervous?

19
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,340
I've finished my painting.

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,840
I'll go get it for you.

21
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:38,840
You!

22
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:40,840
You...

23
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:43,840
You...

24
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:45,840
You...

25
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:46,840
You...

26
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:48,840
You...

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:49,840
You...

28
00:01:51,340 --> 00:02:00,180
You went up then did you really keep something in fed up with

29
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,120
There's only thought that i would beWorld's top tier

30
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,340
Why not refresh the divines back in Eternity

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,640
only so could kill my first wife

32
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,340
I never thought i found the one i transaction in years

33
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,340
and i eventually got you as my oneian mode wind

34
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,980
and became your fiancee.

35
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,660
You know each other?

36
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,100
You go out first.

37
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,580
I have something to talk to her.

38
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,460
She is not Wen Yanshu.

39
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,660
You got the wrong person.

40
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,740
We will get married soon.

41
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,780
The past is like smoke and clouds.

42
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,060
Please don't disturb us.

43
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,060
You are really diligent.

44
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,540
You find the same person to replace.

45
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,060
I am ashamed of myself.

46
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,740
I will get married tonight.

47
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,860
It seems that I can't drink your wedding wine.

48
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,060
I won't send you off.

49
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,140
I prepared all these for you.

50
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,460
How is it? Do you like it?

51
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,060
Good.

52
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,460
The wedding gown is ready.

53
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,460
What do you think?

54
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,740
You47 are so thinking.

55
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,860
I've never asked her.

56
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,060
He is destined to be with me.

57
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,060
He can't be alone.

58
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,060
Aren't you afraid that he will recover his memory?

59
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,060
Of course I am.

60
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,060
But I'm even more afraid that he will leave me.

61
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,060
That's good.

62
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,060
I'm afraid that he will never remember the past again.

63
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,060
Stop talking.

64
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,060
What is my memory?

65
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,060
You don't know.

66
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,060
I put a famous enemy in your room.

67
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,060
If you want to leave here,

68
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,060
Light it up.

69
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,060
Wherever I am,

70
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,060
I'll take you away.

71
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,060
I ask the stars and the sky.

72
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,060
But the light of yearning is lost.

73
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,060
I can't catch the white crane.

74
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,060
What did he say to you?

75
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,060
He...

76
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,060
He said goodbye to me.

77
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,060
I open my eyes and see the snow.

78
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,060
The snow falls on my shoulder.

79
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,060
Even if I can't count to half,

80
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,060
I'll never forget you.

81
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,060
I know I'm destined to be with you.

82
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,060
I'm destined to be with you.

83
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,060
I'm destined to be with you.

84
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,060
I'm destined to be with you.

85
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,060
Your highness,

86
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,060
Don't wait.

87
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,060
The flower feet are about to leave.

88
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,060
We should go.

89
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,060
Even if it's a favor,

90
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,060
I want to take him away.

91
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,060
Wang Yao.

92
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,060
Yuan Ji Yao.

93
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,060
Guards.

94
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,060
Give my order.

95
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,060
Lock the palace.

96
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,060
Yes.

97
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,060
Sorry.

98
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,060
Please go.

99
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,060
I'll go.

100
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,060
It's okay.

101
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,060
Thank you.

102
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,060
You just met me for two years.

103
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,060
And you're willing to go out with me.

104
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,060
You're the son of Ling Zhao.

105
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,060
People say you're a good person.

106
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,060
When you're alone,

107
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,060
let me go.

108
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,060
Let you go?

109
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,060
I said I would help you.

110
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,060
But I have no money.

111
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,060
How about this?

112
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,060
I'm destined to be with you.

113
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,060
One thousand taels?

114
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,060
You're so black.

115
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,060
Just take it as

116
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,060
the human power to save you from the city.

117
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,060
But I was still a princess.

118
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,060
I lost my past.

119
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,060
Where are you?

120
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,060
We're almost in Ling Zhao.

121
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,060
Find a place where there's no one.

122
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,060
Yes.

123
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,060
If so,

124
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,060
why don't you go back

125
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,060
and be your princess?

126
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,060
I'm just kidding.

127
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,060
I do the laundry, cook, clean,

128
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,060
and cook.

129
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,060
I'm good at everything.

130
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,060
Really?

131
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,060
But Wen Yanru never respects me.

132
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,060
Come up.

133
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,060
Wen Yanru

134
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,060
Xia Xiaqian

135
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,060
Xia Xiaqian

136
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,060
Xia Xiaqian

137
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,060
Such a serious expression.

138
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,060
It's like Wen Yanru.

139
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,060
Great.

140
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,060
God is the best.

141
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,060
This place.

142
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,060
Are you familiar with this place?

143
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,060
Do you remember anyone?

144
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,060
No.

145
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,060
I just think it's so special here.

146
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,060
Your highness.

147
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,060
Why do you have to

148
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,060
decorate the fire like this?

149
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,060
I want to know

150
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,060
if it's her.

151
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,060
What a beautiful firefly.

152
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,060
How to choose

153
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,060
You

154
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,060
You are in front of me

155
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,060
Why do you still pretend to be blind

156
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,060
You and we

157
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,060
In the same time

158
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,060
Dare not realize

159
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,060
Can I still forget you again

160
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,060
Why are you asleep?

161
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,060
A'Shu

162
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,060
How many years have passed

163
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,060
Asked thousands of times

164
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,060
Who is writing

165
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,060
You and me

166
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,060
Open your eyes

167
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,060
Your smile

168
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,060
Flowing water

169
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,060
The blue sea

170
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,060
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

171
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,060
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

172
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,060
I don't fear the wind

173
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,060
The distance between us

174
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,060
The world is changing

175
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,060
The world is changing

176
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,060
If we can be together

177
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,060
If we can be together

178
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,060
We will be together forever

179
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,060
The distance between us

180
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,060
The distance between us

181
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,060
Why do we still pretend to be blind

182
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,060
The blue sea

183
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,060
The blue sea

184
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:06,060
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

185
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,060
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

186
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,060
You

187
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,060
You

188
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,060
You

189
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,060
Open your eyes

190
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,060
Your smile

191
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,060
Flowing water

192
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,060
The blue sea

193
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,060
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

194
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:05,060
I'm not afraid of the wind and the clouds, we are one.

00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,060
Time is like a sky.

196
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:16,060
If we can be together like a wish, we will be together forever.

197
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,060
The sky is dark, we are one.

198
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,060
Why is it so far away?

199
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,060
The sky is dark, we are one.

200
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:37,060
Why is it so far away?
