1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Thanks for watching!

2
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:43,620
Don't forget to legslike and subscribe my channel.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Mother and I have been wandering for many years.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
There is no home to return to.

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Mother, wake up. It's snowing.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Mother.

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I beg you. I beg you.

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Miss, I beg you.

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I beg you to save my mother.

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Mother, we have money.

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We can go to the clinic.

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's go.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'll take you to the clinic.

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Mother.

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Mother.

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Mother.

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Mother.

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I can't remember it clearly.

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's okay.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll tell you.

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Until then,

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I knew that

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
you were the Princess of Ling Zhao.

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I thought of many ways to thank you.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But I couldn't be careful.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Until I saw you wrote many letters of face-to-face.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I pretended to be a face-to-face and got into the house.

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But you didn't have a face that you couldn't bear.

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Stop.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Are you okay?

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You wanted to give me money to let me out of the mansion

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
because I saved you.

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But I don't want to.

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I want to stay with you.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I want to know where you come from.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Why do you live such a life?

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Sister, you are so weak.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You can't stand it.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Sister Lan, let me help you.

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What's wrong with you?

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You thought I did it on purpose.

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Really.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Uncle.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Are you okay?

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You are so weak.

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You are so useless.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't understand.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's okay.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You are so kind.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Why no one is willing to stand by you?

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If you don't want to have children

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and insist on staying alone in Hechuan,

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
don't blame me.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You will end up like your mother.

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Father, I beg you.

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Father.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Father.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Take her out.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And let her die.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You are so weak.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You rejected the hand that His Majesty gave you.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
As long as I am with you,

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Princess.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Princess.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You even defied His Majesty.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Your Majesty, please don't.

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Your Majesty.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Punishment

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
is necessary.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
When the Queen sees you in trouble,

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
she will be so happy to punish you.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No matter how much you are hurt,

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
you will not bow to His Majesty.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Until the moment he really killed himself.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
How dare you kill in the palace?

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Go report to His Majesty.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
A'Shu.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Am I dying?

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Why can I only see red in my eyes?

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
A'Shu.

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If you can only see red,

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
we will only wear red clothes in the future.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Then we can't see blood.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
His Majesty is always unbearable.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He told you to let go of the night.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But he has already found out

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
that I am the illegitimate son of Prince Zi Shang

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
who was driven out of the family.

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I hate Prince Zi Shang.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
In order to recover Prince Zi Shang,

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
he took me as his adopted son.

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
From now on,

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
you will be with the Princess.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
As my adopted son,

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
you are the Princess's brother.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I will take you as my empress.

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
In order to stay by your side,

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I promised His Majesty.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Since I came out of the night,

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I saw blood and became a madwoman.

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I can't control myself.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Everything is red.

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
A'Shu.

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Why?

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Why am I always covered in blood

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
when I wear any clothes?

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I see everything is red.

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Brother,

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I am so afraid that one day

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I will be dragged into the night sky.

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What should I do?

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
A'Shu.

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I have killed all those people.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
In this way,

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
we will only wear red in the future.

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We won't see the blood color.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay?

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay.

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
With this identity,

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I can be above everyone.

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But I can't be close to you under the sun.

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Then,

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I will be your shadow.

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I will be with you forever.

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
A'Shu.

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Brother, it's snowing.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Look at these.

132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's beautiful.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Brother,

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I know the cold and the cold.

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I have you by my side.

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No matter how bitter it is, it's worth it.

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
A'Shu.

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Now I can be with everyone.

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But you can't be alone.

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Brother,

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I have you in this life.

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I have no regrets.

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
My story is over.

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I hope you can stop thinking about it

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and live for yourself from now on.

146
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Can you tell me

147
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
where he is now?

148
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I miss him day and night.

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I miss him all the time.

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I have never stopped thinking about him.

151
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I can't lose.

153
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
When did you know

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
that I was your shadow?

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I didn't know.

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I didn't know.

157
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm not him.

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Since I don't want to lie to myself.

159
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's really hard to live like this.

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Brother,

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
if there is a next life,

162
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't want to live like this.

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
If there is a next life,

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I will wait for you on the Neihe Bridge.

165
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I will wait for you.

166
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I will take you

167
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
to search for all the heaven in the world.

168
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Then it's a deal.

169
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Whether it's this life or the next life,

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
you have to be with me.

171
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Live well.

172
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Live well

173
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
with his face.

174
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Live well.

175
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Live well.

176
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Live well.

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Live well.

178
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Live well.

179
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Live well.

180
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Live well.

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Live well.

182
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Live well.

183
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Live well.

184
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Live well.

185
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Live well.

186
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Live well.

187
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Live well.

188
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Live well.

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Live well.

190
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Die for a person

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
who loves and fears you.

192
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
