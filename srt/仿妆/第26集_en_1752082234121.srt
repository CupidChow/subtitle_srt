1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
How is she?

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
She's poisoned with a very strong poison.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
She's poisoned with a very strong poison.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
She has a terrible pain in her whole body.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's hard to cure.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's give her a pleasure.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Is there a way to detoxify her?

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If we remove the poison in her body,

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
maybe we can save her life in the Ghost Gate Pass.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But I don't know if this method will work.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It all depends on her luck.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
When she's in trouble, she'll die.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Please give her the medicine.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Prince, have you really made up your mind?

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Prince, have you really made up your mind?

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You can leave now.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Prince, please.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Prince, please.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Prince, please.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Prince, please.

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The Crown Prince is not patient with her.

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Send some men to guard her.

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Send some men to guard her.

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes.

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Sir, the Princess has a favor to ask.

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Please come with me.

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You're here.

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Now the late emperor has passed away.

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The court is in chaos.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll ascend the throne in a short time.

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If you marry me now,

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
you'll have the whole country.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You think so?

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I have no interest in you.

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I have no interest in you.

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm not interested in you.

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm not interested in you.

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm not interested in you.

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm not interested in you.

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm not interested in you.

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I have no interest in you.

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You're my partner.

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Why did you promise me

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
to marry me?

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It was just an opportunity.

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What if I keep you by my side?

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't threaten me.

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,500
right!

63
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,720

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,920

65
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,140

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,560

Wu Han!

83
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Why is my daughter missing?

84

Search!

85
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You are inside.

86
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You are inside.

87
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Don't make any noise.

88
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Stop!

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Search!

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Your highness.

91
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The people in the city are all killed.

92
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
They are all the spies who were in the capital.

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
General Mu.

94
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The second princess is missing.

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Hurry up and lock the city gate.

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Hurry up and find her.

97
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes.

Your highness.

99
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What happened?

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Your highness.

101
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The guards were lost last night.

102
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The bedroom where Uncle Wen Yan was was burned to the ground.

103
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The guards were lost last night.

104
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The bedroom where Uncle Wen Yan was was burned to the ground.

105
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Only this jade pendant is left.

106
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Your highness.

107
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Your highness.

108
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
She can't be dead.

109
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
She can't be dead.

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
She must be hiding.

111
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
She must be hiding.

112
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Uncle Wen Yan!

113
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You can't be dead.

114
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Uncle Wen Yan!

115
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
No matter where you are.

116
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I will find you.

117
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
She is fine now.

118
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Can you take care of yourself?

119
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Give me your hand.

120
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I will apply medicine for you.

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Do you think

122
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Do you think

123
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Do you think Mu Han

124
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Do you think Mu Han will go crazy to find her?

125
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Mu Han

126
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Mu Han will go crazy to find her?

127
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
An Ning!

128
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
An Ning!

129
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Come and take the princess away.

130
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Are you okay?

131
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000

134
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Princess.

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I hope you will be safe.

137
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Uncle Wen Yan is dead.

138
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I will take care of her.

139
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
An Ning.

140
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You are awake.

I can't wait for you to disappear

222
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
How many years have passed

223
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Who is writing on the wall

224
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You and me

225
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Open your eyes

226
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Your smile is like water

227
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The blue sea is heaven

228
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I want to be with you forever

229
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't care if the wind and the moon are in front of me

230
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Time changes with the sky

231
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
If we can be together

232
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Forever the end

233
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The wish of tears in front of me

234
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Between you and me

235
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Open the old garden

236
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000

If we can be together

253
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Forever the end

254
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The wish of tears in front of me

255
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Between you and me

256
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Open the old garden

257
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The end of the day will not change

258
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Let me be with you forever

259
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
