1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,880
Is there no more interest between me and you now?

2
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,720
Whether it is between you or not, or just...

3
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,680
We are allengthy.

4
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,560
Besides, what lies between us...

5
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,220
Don't...

6
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,360
Don't go.

7
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,080
Don't go from here.

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,580
I...

9
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
I've been waiting for you

10
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,080
for a long time.

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,080
The revenge of killing a father

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
and the hate of losing a father

13
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,080
have you forgotten?

14
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
Without me,

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,080
I would have been torn apart,

16
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,080
and my face would have been torn apart.

17
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,080
I'm holding Wen Yan Shu's face

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,080
only to avenge the blood of the Heavens.

19
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
You regretted

20
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,080
changing this face?

21
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,080
Even if the golden golden wings

22
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
would have been torn apart,

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,080
I would have never regretted it.

24
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
No.

25
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
If I don't do anything,

26
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
will there be something difficult to solve?

27
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
It's ridiculous.

28
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,080
The General of the North and South, Hang Zhan and the King of Zishan

29
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
have been murdered

30
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,080
and the whole family has been killed.

31
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
You...

32
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
I'm finally dead.

33
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,080
I'm finally dead.

34
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
Brother.

35
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
Blood.

36
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
Blood.

37
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Blood.

38
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
Did you see it?

39
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,080
Did you see it?

40
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,080
I saw it.

41
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
You...

42
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
Poor thing.

43
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
Father, I'll find out the truth

44
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
and avenge your death.

45
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
Hurry up.

46
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
The car of the Princess Royal is here.

47
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
Father.

48
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
Mother.

49
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
Father.

50
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,080
Your Highness.

51
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
Princess.

52
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
Master.

53
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,080
You must save the Emperor.

54
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,080
I'm sorry for the Emperor.

55
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
I'm sorry for the Emperor.

56
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,080
Who are you?

57
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
I...

58
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,080
I'm here to avenge your death.

59
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
I'll take this face.

60
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
From now on,

61
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,080
I'm the Princess Royal.

62
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Wen Wenshu.

63
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Father,

64
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
I'll kill the Emperor

65
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
and avenge your death.

66
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,080
But I can't go back.

67
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,080
I'll live my life

68
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,080
with this evil face.

69
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Father.

70
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
Father.

71
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,080
Wen Jun has a blood-stained object.

72
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,080
To get rid of his blood,

73
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
we must find the gauze that father said

74
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,080
and make three flowers.

75
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Uncle,

76
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
you look good recently.

77
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Go.

78
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,080
I've finally found the gauze.

79
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
Why are you here?

80
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,080
Princess said a lot of sweet things last night.

81
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Last night?

82
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
You stayed here all night?

83
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
What did you think?

84
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
What did I say?

85
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
Guess.

86
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
You may leave.

87
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
I'll go.

88
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,080
I'll go.

89
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
I'll go.

90
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
I'll go.

91
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
I'll go.

92
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
Zimo.

93
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Go tell father

94
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
that I want to go to the palace

95
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,080
and have dinner with him.

96
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,080
Yes.

97
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,080
Why are you here?

98
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
I'm waiting for you.

99
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,080
Princess has been assassinated recently.

100
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,080
I'd better go with you.

101
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
It's okay.

102
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
Zimo is here.

103
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
Last time,

104
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
you were in danger

105
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
because of him.

106
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
So this time,

107
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,080
I'll do it.

108
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,080
I'm suddenly unwell.

110
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
I have to leave.

111
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
You don't have to follow me.

112
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
Yes.

113
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,080
What are you going to do?

114
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,080
I'm also unwell.

115
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,080
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,080
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,080
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,080
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,080
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
How could he be here?

131
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
Your Majesty,

132
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
I have to deal with the evidence.

133
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
You may leave.

134
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
Yes.

135
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
What's going on?

136
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
Why is Xiu Shu not here?

137
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,080
It's not fake.

138
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
It doesn't matter if you steal it.

139
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
Let's go.

140
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Where is Father?

141
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,080
His Majesty has to deal with the evidence.

142
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
He won't wait for you.

143
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
What's wrong with you?

144
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
He's not well.

145
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
The person who just fought with me

146
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
shouldn't be him.

147
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Maybe I'm too much.

148
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
I'll go and see.

149
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
I'm going to be close with the princess.

150
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,080
Don't bother me, Marquis.

151
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
Believe it or not,

152
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
I'll kill you now.

153
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,080
Say it.

154
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,080
I'm going to kill you.

155
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,080
I'm going to kill you.

156
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
I'm going to kill you.

157
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
I'm going to kill you.

158
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
Shu Er.

159
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,080
Princess,

160
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
stop.

161
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
I think I've made it clear to you

162
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
last time.

163
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,080
Shu Er,

164
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
don't blame Marquis.

165
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,080
I don't think

166
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
he did it on purpose.

167
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
Take it away.

168
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,080
Shu Er,

169
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
he hates me.

170
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
Uncle,

171
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
I have something to tell you.

172
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
You bastard!

173
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
You bastard!

174
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,080
You bastard!

175
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
I'm sorry.

176
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
I'm sorry.

177
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
I'm sorry.

178
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
I'm sorry.

180
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
I'm sorry.

181
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
I'm sorry.

182
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
I'm sorry.

183
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
I'm sorry.

184
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
I'm sorry.

185
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,080
I'm sorry.

186
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,080
I'm sorry.

187
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,080
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,080
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
I'm sorry.

193
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
I'm sorry.

194
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
I'm sorry.

195
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,080
I'm sorry.

196
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
