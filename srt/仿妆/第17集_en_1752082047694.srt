1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,640
为什么

2
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,620
황

3
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,620
저� erste

4
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,420
Welcome.

5
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,780
will you forgive her?

6
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,860
But

7
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,620
you don't have any pity at all.

8
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,860
My pity

9
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,220
is not to kill her in person.

10
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,580
When she goes to Yan Shi'an,

11
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,540
she will be dead.

12
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,300
What did you say?

13
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,380
Yan Shi'an has no grudge against her.

14
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,740
Why do you treat her like this?

15
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,740
Yan Shi'an

16
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,980
If you want to know,

17
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,660
ask her yourself.

18
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,660
But I'm afraid

19
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,940
you can't even get out of this place.

20
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,340
Mu Han,

21
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,020
who are you?

22
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,020
Who are you?

23
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,620
The day I come back

24
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,140
is the day I kill you.

25
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:12,980
He Chun,

26
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,180
do it yourself.

27
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,740
Mu Han, Mu Han, Mu Han.

28
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,940
Why are you in the wedding dress?

29
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,860
I don't like this wedding dress.

30
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,460
I want to drink tea.

31
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,300
If you can't catch the train before dark,

32
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,820
you will be late again.

33
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,980
I'm afraid you can only stay outside.

34
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,740
I'm happy to do that.

35
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,620
Stop the train.

36
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,860
Yes.

37
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,540
The tea needs to be watered.

38
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,860
Then we can start over.

39
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,700
How long will you keep doing this?

40
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,500
If you delay the wedding,

41
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,660
I can't explain to Zhu Yanling.

42
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,060
General Mu is so impatient to send me to the wedding.

43
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,500
Are you afraid that I will miss the wedding

44
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,500
you and Wen Fuyu have?

45
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,700
You used to be my dog.

46
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,260
Now you are the king's dog.

47
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,980
Zi Mo, protect the princess.

48
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,300
I'll go get some spring water

49
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,780
to make tea for the princess.

50
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,060
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,220
I was a bit too much

52
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,940
to her.

53
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,940
If I didn't ask you to do anything,

54
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,020
maybe you are still

55
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,740
the man in the princess's mansion.

56
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,380
Maybe I don't need to go to the wedding.

57
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,220
Alright.

58
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,980
We'll be right there when it's your turn.

59
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,100
It's late.

60
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,860
Let's go have an early rest.

61
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,660
When we're in Zhuyan State,

62
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,460
let me dance one last time.

63
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,580
Some

64
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,780
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

65
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,780
Look.

66
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,780
There are fireflies.

67
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,780
I remember when I was a child, my mother would take me to the back of the mountain to see fireflies.

68
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,780
I will always remember her at this season.

69
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,780
You must miss her very much.

70
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,780
That is all the past memories.

71
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,780
I heard that there is a very beautiful temple across the grassland.

72
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,780
When we passed by, we went to see the temple.

73
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,780
There is a very beautiful temple.

74
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,780
Let's go and see it when we pass by.

75
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,780
Okay.

76
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,780
You take me to see it.

77
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,780
Master, what is this?

78
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,780
Amitabha.

79
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:09,780
What the master wants is like a flower in the mirror and a jade in the water.

80
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,780
It is all empty.

81
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,780
Do you think Qianwen is really accurate?

82
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,780
When you enter the world, you must listen to the fate.

83
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,780
Everything you want is in your hands.

84
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,780
How can you always make such a decision?

85
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,780
I am so tired.

86
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,780
Mohan.

87
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,780
You.

88
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,780
You.

89
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,780
You.

90
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,780
After the sun, it is the landscape of Zhuyan.

91
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,780
Such a lively landscape.

92
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,780
I wonder if I will have a chance to see it again.

93
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,780
Miss, look.

94
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,780
Is there anything you like?

95
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,780
We are the ancestral jade masters.

96
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,780
It can keep you safe.

97
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,780
There is a jade for peace.

98
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,780
This jade is...

99
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,780
It is called the jade for peace.

100
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,780
The jade for peace.

101
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,780
The jade for peace.

102
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,780
Can it really keep you safe?

103
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,780
Of course.

104
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,780
The jade is with the person.

105
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,780
It is a great relationship.

106
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,780
The jade is with the person.

107
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,780
It is a great relationship.

108
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,780
After the Gouhu party tonight,

109
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,780
I will not eat anything.

110
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,780
Can I use this jade to change your jade for peace?

111
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,780
Of course.

112
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,780
Here.

113
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,780
Here.

114
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,780
Hold it.

115
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,780
If the sign is changed,

116
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,780
the jade for peace will also be changed.

117
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,780
This jade for peace...

118
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,780
For you.

119
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,780
This...

120
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,780
is the result of two boxes of jade.

121
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,780
Thank you.

122
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,780
I will be by your side every day.

123
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,780
The Princess of the State of Yingzhou is here.

124
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,780
The Princess of the State of Yingzhou is here.

125
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,780
Your Highness,

126
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,780
I still need to return the order.

127
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,780
Please do not hesitate.

128
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,780
The Princess of the State of Yingzhou is here.

129
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,780
The one who hurt me...

130
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,780
is me.

131
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,780
The one who hurt me...

132
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,780
is me.

133
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,780
Your fiancee is getting married.

134
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,780
Where else do you want to go?

135
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,780
How far is it?

136
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,780
I asked a thousand times

137
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,780
Who is writing the fate of us?

138
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,780
Open your eyes

139
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,780
Your smile

140
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,780
Flowing like water

141
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,780
The blue sea and the sky

142
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:15,780
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

143
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,780
I don't know if the fate is in our hands

144
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,780
The world is changing

145
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,780
If we can be together

146
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,780
We will be together forever

147
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,780
Facing this fate

148
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,780
Between us

149
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,780
We can make this wish come true

150
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,780
The heaven and earth are not the same

151
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,780
I am here

152
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,780
Your smile

153
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,780
Flowing like water

154
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,780
Open your eyes

155
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,780
Your smile

156
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,780
Flowing like water

157
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,780
The blue sea and the sky

158
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:29,780
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

159
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,780
I don't know if the fate is in our hands

160
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,780
The blue sea and the sky

161
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:41,780
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

162
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,780
I don't know if the fate is in our hands

163
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,780
The world is changing

164
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,780
If we can be together

165
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,780
We will be together forever

166
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,780
Facing this fate

167
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,780
Between us

168
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,780
We can make this wish come true

169
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,780
The heaven and earth are not the same

170
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,780
I am here

171
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,780
Your smile

172
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:50,780
Thanks for watching!
