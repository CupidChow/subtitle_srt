1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,240
All right.

2
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,240
Let's belt these clock hands together.

3
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,640
Their hearts will get compassion

4
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,560
But...

5
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,000
we are harder on our hands than human eyes

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Episode 15

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Don't be angry.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I admit

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I have a special feeling for you.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Even if you treat me as a word,

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
can you have a moment

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
when you belong to me?

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Okay.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I promise you.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We'll take our time.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I won't be in a hurry.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'll come back to see you.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Mao You.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
She doesn't love you.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Forget her.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Go back with me.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
She doesn't love me.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I don't want to see her.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't want to see her.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
She doesn't love me.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What about you?

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You also think I'm a bad person.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Of course not.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let me explain.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I...

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't want to hear it.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Go.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Your Highness.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Your Highness.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Miss Wang You has escaped.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Search the city gate.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Search it.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No need.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yichen.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He came to me before he left.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He said he would rather die than enter the mansion.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If you force him again,

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
he will die.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Stop.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Those who disobey must not leave the city.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Go.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Father.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Where is she?

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Didn't I tell you to bring her here?

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It was very dangerous at that time.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I didn't know what to do.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It was very dangerous at that time.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I was afraid that the guards would find out.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I had to let her go.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
If she is safe,

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
you will be punished.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If she has any trouble,

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I will beat you to death.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Your Highness.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We followed the prince Zhuyan.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We found the trace of Miss Wang You.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Wang You.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Shuu.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Don't come over.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Wang You.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Shuu.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Shuu.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Wang You.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Wang You.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Shuu.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What are you doing?

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't come over.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If you come over, I will jump off.

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Don't be impulsive.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Come back with me.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Calm down first.

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Come over first, okay?

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Come over first.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's talk it over.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Go.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You two

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
think of me as her.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I said I am not.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I am Da Lan Wang You.

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
No.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I never treated you like Uncle Wen Yan.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You are in my heart.

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You want me to be your Crown Prince.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And you want to put me in the Prince of Zishang's mansion.

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The one you love has always been Uncle Wen Yan.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Never me.

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay.

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Calm down first.

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
As long as you come over first,

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I will do whatever you do.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't believe you.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't believe you.

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't move.

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If you come over again, I will jump off.

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Wang You.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Uncle.

105
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Hurry up.

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Go find her.

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes.

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Uncle.

109
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Wang You.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Uncle.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Bai Ling.

112
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
How is it going over there?

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
How is it going over there?

114
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I haven't seen the figure of Yan Shu.

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What about you, Your Highness?

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
If it wasn't for you,

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
would she be able to jump off?

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Keep looking.

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Uncle.

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Uncle.

121
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Report.

122
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Your Highness.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
His Majesty passed away.

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What?

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You guys keep looking.

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes.

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's go.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Episode 2

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Uncle.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Uncle.

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Uncle.

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Uncle.

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Mu Han.

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Si Yi Chen.

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You won't let me live well,

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
but I won't let you live well either.

137
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You look like her, don't you?

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay.

139
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Then I'll let you experience

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
the taste of life and death again.

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yue Chen.

142
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Leave this to you.

143
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Once you're done,

144
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
you'll be rewarded.

145
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't worry, Mistress.

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I will definitely help you.

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Uncle.

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Hold on.

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The forest gate will be here soon.

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm not Uncle.

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Can't you let me go?

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay.

153
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay.

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't be anxious.

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
When you're back and heal your wounds,

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
you can go wherever you want.

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I won't hold you back anymore.

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Hold on.

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's okay.

160
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Hold on.

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Uncle.

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Uncle.

163
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Hold on.

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Uncle.

165
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't know why you lost your memory.

166
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But as long as I know you're still alive,

167
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and I can look at you like this,

168
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll leave you alone.

169
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Your Highness.

170
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Miss Wang You is seriously injured.

171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
She needs to rest for a few days

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
before she can wake up.

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I see.

174
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You may leave now.

175
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes.

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Uncle.

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You're awake.

178
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Uncle.

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What's wrong with you?

180
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Doctor.

181
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What's going on?

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Your Highness.

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
She fell down and her head is injured.

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Her head is injured.

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
She needs to rest for a few days.

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I won't bother you

187
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
for the next few days.

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'll be here.

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll be here.

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll be here.

191
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You should rest.

192
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll come to see you

193
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
when you're better.

194
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It turns out

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm Wen Yushu.

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
In this battle,

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
you've been thinking about me all these years.

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Why did you kill me?

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What am I to you?

200
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Your Highness.

201
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Your Highness.

202
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Uncle Wen Yushu has been taken away.

203
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Xuanhuang.

204
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
How could Xuanhuang take Uncle Wen Yushu away?

205
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
How did they know

206
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
that Miss Wang You is Wen Yushu?

207
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Could it be

208
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Zhu Yan, the prince?

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Bai Ling.

210
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Take her to Zhu Yan.

211
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll go to Xuanhuang.

212
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Your Highness.

213
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Did you find the Crown Prince?

214
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Your Highness, no.

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
These days, under the trick of the old prince,

216
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
the court has been changing the Crown Prince's voice.

217
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If the Crown Prince doesn't show up this morning...

218
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That old man

219
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
won't let the Crown Prince go back to Zhu Yan easily.

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Since the Crown Prince is not here,

221
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'll defend the throne for him.

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What's wrong with the Crown Prince?

223
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
His Majesty has been in a coma for days.

224
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
He's still out for a walk.

225
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
In my opinion,

226
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
the Crown Prince's position should be replaced.

227
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The Prince is a man of integrity and filial piety.

228
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He's a wise man.

229
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
He's the only one in the family.

230
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You are really Zhu Yan's children.

231
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
My father is still in the imperial mausoleum.

232
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You are going to rebel against him.

233
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

234
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Rise.

235
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

236
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Your Highness,

237
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
why are you wearing a mask today?

238
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
My father passed away.

239
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I haven't come out of the pain.

240
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's too sad to see.

241
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Really?

242
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't think you are the Crown Prince.

243
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You...

244
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
How dare you pretend to be the Crown Prince?

245
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Guards,

246
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
arrest him.

247
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes.

248
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
How dare you?

249
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Let me go.

250
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Let me go.

251
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
When the Crown Prince comes back,

252
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'll be your servant.

253
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Finally, you are awake.

254
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If you dare to touch me,

255
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
when the Crown Prince comes back,

256
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'll be your wife.

257
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Crown Prince?

258
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He's not coming.

259
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You...

260
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Just forget about it.

261
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What did you do to him?

262
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What did I do to him?

263
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Of course,

264
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
he's dead.

265
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Little girl,

266
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
you enjoy yourself.

267
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I promise you won't disturb us.

268
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I promise you won't disturb us.

269
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Ha ha ha ha ha.

270
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Your Highness.

271
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Qingxue.

272
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Qingxue.

273
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Qingxue.

274
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I have a wish.

275
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Between you and me,

276
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
why is it so far away?

277
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The sky is always clear.

278
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
If I'm not with you,

279
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,000
you'll be gone.

280
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Qingxue.

281
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Open your eyes.

282
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Your smile is everywhere.

283
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The sky is always clear.

284
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I wish to spend the rest of my life with you.

285
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I don't fear the wind and the clouds.

286
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Between you and me,

287
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
the world is like a sky.

288
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
How we wish to be together.

289
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Forever, until the end.

290
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The deep of the night,

291
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
between you and me,

292
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
why is it so far away?

293
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The sky is always clear.

294
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
If I'm not with you,

295
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
you'll be gone.
