00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,300
If we can only function as humans.

00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,760
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,760
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
Her lot just came out.

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,760
Her lot 99 it was wrong, her lot 55 was wrong

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,760
My god, anyckey

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,680
The key for a better world,

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,840
All that we are is,

23
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,320
To trust and not give up.

24
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,520
I'm starting to cry.

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,020
What if you're infected by her and asking questions

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,040
What if you're into her right now

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,340
After all the noise her really starts to scream

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,300
Thousands of step Lite

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,680
After the Forbidden City case of the manor and almost all the prisoners whose male retinue left their stone stream

00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,940
Str S frozen

31
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,420
Just funny

32
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,820
How interesting

33
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,180
I've been looking for you

34
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,440
Teard

35
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,080
What?

36
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:45,840
Bai Ling.

37
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,900
Please settle Miss An Ning down.

38
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:51,760
Yes.

39
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,420
Miss An Ning, please.

40
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:54,940
Wen Yan Shu.

41
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,900
You once told me

42
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,380
that you killed Hang An Ning.

43
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,220
Why is she back now?

44
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,780
Were you lying to me

45
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,380
or was she not Hang An Ning at all?

46
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,780
valence

47
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,540
Shu,

48
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,220
after so many years,

49
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,660
I finally found you,

50
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,340
but why didn't you remember me?

51
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,380
Why?

52
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,260
Why did you lie to me and say you didn't recognize me?

53
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,340
You must remember me, right?

54
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,340
You must remember me.

55
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,340
I will definitely remind you that you are Wen Yanshu.

56
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,340
Mu Han.

57
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,340
Mu Han.

58
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,340
Happy birthday.

59
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,340
Why do you wear this dress?

60
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,340
Do you remember something?

61
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,340
Right? Tell me.

62
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,340
Do you remember something?

63
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,340
Mu Han.

64
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,340
You remember?

65
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,340
You can escape from me.

66
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,340
Mu Han.

67
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,340
Look.

68
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,340
You look exactly the same.

69
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,340
Her name is Wen Yanshu.

70
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,340
You are her.

71
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,340
You are Wen Yanshu.

72
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,340
Tell me.

73
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
You are Wen Yanshu.

74
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,340
I really am not.

75
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,340
You are Wen Yanshu.

76
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,340
I really am not.

77
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,340
Sorry.

78
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,340
I didn't mean to.

79
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,340
Look.

80
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,340
You wrote every word in your heart.

81
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,340
What do you remember?

82
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,340
Are you A'Shu?

83
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,340
Tell me.

84
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,340
Don't lie to me anymore.

85
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,340
I said I am her.

86
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,340
Why don't you admit that you are her?

87
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,340
Go.

88
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,340
Go.

89
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,340
I finally found you.

90
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,340
Why did you lie to me?

91
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,340
You are Wen Yanshu.

92
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,340
Why don't you admit that you are her?

93
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,340
I don't mind.

94
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,340
I still have time.

95
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,340
I will make you remember who you are.

96
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,340
You are Wen Yanshu.

97
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,340
You are right in front of me.

98
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,340
A'Shu.

99
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,340
I really miss you.

100
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,340
Please come back.

101
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:56,340
How can we not meet at the same time?

102
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,340
Do I have to forget you again?

103
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,340
Find a wood carving master to repair it.

104
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,340
This is a plain and rough carving.

105
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,340
It's rough.

106
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,340
It must be difficult to repair.

107
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,340
If you want to make it flat,

108
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,340
I will do it.

109
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,340
It must be better than this.

110
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,340
Don't worry.

111
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,340
I will go to someone to repair it.

112
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,340
What is it?

113
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,340
Of course.

114
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,340
I cooked the soup.

115
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,340
Do you want to try it?

116
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,340
I will leave this to the next person.

117
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,340
You don't have to do this.

118
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,340
Okay.

119
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,340
I will put it there.

120
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,340
It's been too long.

121
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,340
I always feel that

122
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,340
she is not the real An Ning.

123
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,340
Do you know that this dress is not for you?

124
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,340
Do you know who this dress belongs to?

125
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,340
Who are you?

126
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,340
I have never mentioned me to you.

127
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,340
I am the wife of her Wei Guo Men.

128
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,340
Hang An Ning.

129
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,340
The wife of Wei Guo Men?

130
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,340
The woman in the painting and this dress.

131
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,340
This dress is her beloved.

132
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,340
The clothes that Princess Lin Zhao liked the most.

133
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,340
You look very similar to her.

134
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,340
If you wear this dress,

135
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,340
you will look more like her.

136
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,340
If I were you,

137
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,340
I would have left earlier.

138
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,340
I would never have a relationship with someone I belong to.

139
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,340
Moreover,

140
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,340
she and I are still engaged.

141
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,340
So,

142
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,340
you have always asked me to recognize her.

143
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,340
I am not her.

144
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,340
I don't want to have anything to do with you.

145
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,340
Let's stop here.

146
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,340
Bai Ling.

147
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,340
Close the gate immediately.

148
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,340
I will go to the palace.

149
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,340
I will go to the palace.

150
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,340
Yes.

151
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,340
Who gave you the guts

152
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,340
to run away from us?

153
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,340
Why do you care about me?

154
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,340
I am a human.

155
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,340
I am not a piece of material that you use to remind others.

156
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,340
I don't care about that.

157
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,340
I think you are who you are.

158
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,340
Enough.

159
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,340
Wen Yan Shu is dead.

160
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,340
You killed him.

161
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,340
Who do you think you are?

162
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,340
Shut up.

163
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,340
You are so arrogant.

164
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,340
Do you think I don't want to touch you?

165
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,340
You are trying to keep me by your side.

166
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,340
Isn't it because of my face

167
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,340
that looks exactly like her?

168
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,340
Okay.

169
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,340
I will destroy her now.

170
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,340
Let go.

171
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,340
You...

172
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,340
What are you doing?

173
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,340
Let go of me.

174
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,340
Let go of me.

175
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,340
What are you doing?

176
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,340
Let go.

177
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,340
I told you.

178
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,340
You are playing tricks on me.

179
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,340
If you dare to lock me up again,

180
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,340
I will kill you.

181
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,340
Stop it.

182
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,340
Don't even think about leaving me.

183
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,340
Shuiguang.

184
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,340
I hate you.

185
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,340
I hate you.

186
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,340
What are you doing?

187
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,340
Who let you in?

188
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,340
I am your wife.

189
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,340
If you two do this,

190
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,340
where will I be?

191
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,340
Mother.

192
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,340
If I don't look like this,

193
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,340
will you like me?

194
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,340
You know very well

195
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,340
what I have been doing to you.

196
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,340
Mother.

You know very well

200
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,340
what I have been doing to you.

201
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,340
Stop pretending.

202
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,340
Get up.

203
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,340
Next time,

204
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,340
I don't want to see

205
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,340
something like this happen.

206
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,340
Si Yichen.

207
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,340
I am your fiance.

208
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,340
Can't you compare with a substitute?

209
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,340
Besides, he doesn't love you at all.

210
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,340
What do you mean by forcing him to be around you?

211
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,340
If you really love you,

212
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,340
then you should be happy.

213
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,340

Don't fear the wind and the sky, between us, time changes to fragments

247
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:50,340
If we can be together forever, forever to the end

248
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:58,340
The wish of the face, between us, why is it so far away
