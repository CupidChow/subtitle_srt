1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,100
Hoping that this fashion is inspired from Salomon buddha baked

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,400
it changes to�

3
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,600
Leave now

4
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,080
do not pay any attention to me

5
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,860
there could be a king

6
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,480
that obedient

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,160
your koulder

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,700
I it is the king

9
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,160
who should meet to

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,360
forget all bullshit

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,320
isn't it

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,540
what are you getting up National

13
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,560
do not think

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,300
we were Future

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,680
prepared

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,620
and

17
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,600
what you

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,760
have everything

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,780
stars

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,780
Princess

21
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,780
Thank you, Shuo

22
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,780
I won't let anything happen to you

23
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,780
I will not let anything happen to you

24
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,780
What is so special about me that you can be so greedy?

25
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,780
I have the bone in my body

26
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,780
Please let me go

27
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:58,780
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

28
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,780
I'm fine

29
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,780
It's just that I'm afraid

30
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,780
It's a big crime to kill the princess

31
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,780
And you have a bad luck

32
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,780
This person has a bad background

33
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,780
If you like her like this

34
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,780
Take you as my grandson

35
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,780
Father will reward you a few more

36
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,780
Father, if father and son are not here

37
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,780
I can't rest assured

38
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,780
Besides, I'm not the murderer of the princess

39
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,780
I slept with her all night last night

40
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,780
Where did she come from?

41
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:46,380
But why did her bell appear in the

42
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,380
Okay, okay

43
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,380
As long as you can rest assured

44
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,380
Give birth to a grandson for me

45
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,380
I will let go of the mother

46
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,380
Thank you father

47
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,380
Report

48
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,380
Your Majesty, the doctor reported

49
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,380
Princess Ji Yao is unconscious

50
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,380
I'm afraid it's more dangerous than that

51
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,380
Why is it so sudden?

52
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,380
I'm afraid it's because the princess Ji Yao is weak

53
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,380
The family is too hurt

54
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,380
It's hard to keep the medicine if she's unconscious for a while

55
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,380
Ji Yao's grandfather is Zhu Yan

56
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,380
If you can't save her

57
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,380
If you offend Zhu Yan

58
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,380
Then let the mother give her a burial

59
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,380
I obey

60
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,380
If the princess Ji Yao is safe

61
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,380
Can father give orders to let the mother go?

62
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,380
I'm afraid I can't

63
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,380
I'm afraid I can't

64
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,380
I'm afraid I can't

65
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,380
I'm afraid I can't

66
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,380
I'm afraid I can't

67
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,380
Can father give orders to let the mother go?

68
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,380
I promise you

69
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,380
As long as Ji Yao is fine

70
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,380
I let the mother go

71
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,380
But Ji Yao's current situation

72
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,380
Even the doctor has no idea

73
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,380
I advise you

74
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,380
Don't waste your energy

75
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:05,380
I'm going to try for the fetus in the womb

76
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,380
Okay, okay, okay

77
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,380
I'm pregnant

78
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,380
Thank you father

79
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,380
Uncle

80
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,380
You really have her baby

81
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,380
So what?

82
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,380
You said before

83
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,380
She's just your toy

84
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,380
How can you carry her baby?

85
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,380
It's just a baby

86
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,380
If brother mind

87
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,380
You can draw a line with me

88
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,380
Uncle

89
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,380
You know

90
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,380
I don't care about your baby

91
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,380
I mind

92
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,380
She doesn't deserve you to go to this ghost gate for her

93
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,380
If brother has nothing else

94
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,380
I'll go first

95
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,380
From the pulse

96
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,380
The princess's injury is not serious

97
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,380
It's just that the princess is sleeping every day

98
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,380
The medicine is hard to get

99
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,380
I'm afraid it's too much to ask for life

100
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,380
Ask for life

101
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,380
She doesn't want to die

102
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,380
Dr. Sun

103
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,380
You go and open a few more medicines

104
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,380
Remember to personally pick up the medicine

105
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,380
Can't be too much

106
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,380
Yes

107
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,380
он

108
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,380
You what are you doing?

109
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,380
Princess, you're finally awake

110
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,380
You age scared me

111
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,380
She's not dead yet. Why are you crying?

112
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,380
Remember, later, you'll have to drink the medicine that Imperial Physician Sun personally made.

113
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,380
This Wen Yanshu, how dare she take advantage of my illness and assassinate me?

114
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,380
I must tell His Majesty!

115
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,380
Princess, you've been in a coma for the past few days.

116
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,380
It's the Senior Princess who saved you.

117
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,380
You're talking about Wen Yanshu?

118
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,380
She's actually so kind.

119
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,380
What does Your Highness mean by this?

120
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,380
What do I mean?

121
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,380
If it wasn't for her,

122
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,380
I'd really like to kill you with one arrow!

123
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,380
Uncle.

124
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,380
When Uncle's child grows up,

125
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,380
and he knows that his father is such a despicable person,

126
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,380
he definitely won't get to know you.

127
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,380
It seems that the Marquis is quite self-aware.

128
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,380
What do you mean?

129
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,380
I'm not a child.

130
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,380
I'm not a child.

131
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,380
You're quite self-aware.

132
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,380
What do you mean?

133
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,380
What do I mean?

134
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,380
You know best.

135
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,380
You're badly injured.

136
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,380
Go back to the hospital.

137
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,380
What do you mean?

138
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,380
What are you talking about?

139
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,380
What do you mean?

140
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,380
I'm talking about my child.

141
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,380
I'm not a child, I'm not a child.

142
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,380
I'm not a child.

143
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,380
You're really bad.

144
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,380
What do you mean?

145
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,380
I'm not a child.

146
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,380
I'm not a child.

147
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,380
I'm not a child.

148
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,380
I'm not a child.

149
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,020
You are the child's father

150
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,340
Enough

151
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,420
Your Highness

152
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,380
Lord Qi Ya came to you to deliver the tonic as ordered by the Lord

153
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,220
He is waiting in the hall at this moment

154
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,100
Princess

155
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,660
The Lord is very worried about your health

156
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,340
Let me thank Dr. Sun for delivering some tonics to visit you

157
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,780
And also treat the guard of the tomb

158
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,100
Thank you for your kindness, father

159
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,100
When the mother is better

160
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,900
I will take her to the palace to thank him

161
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,740
Then I will leave first

162
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,860
Wait

163
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,620
I don't know what happened these days

164
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,220
Every night

165
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,580
I feel headache

166
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,900
Dr. Sun, why don't you stay and treat me?

167
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,460
I just got a few good wines recently

168
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,780
It's better to go back after drinking

169
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,580
Then I will follow your order

170
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,140
Thank you for your kindness

171
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,580
This is the powder of the nightingale

172
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,260
No color, no taste

173
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,260
Can make people lose their inner power

174
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,700
Die of an explosion

175
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,540
Let people find out the cause

176
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,140
The insertion is closed

177
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,740
I am pregnant

178
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,060
I already made a note of the wine

179
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,580
Here's a toast to the Lord

180
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,300
This wine is grape

181
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,620
The Lord should taste it

182
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,620
Thank you, Princess

183
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,180
This wine

184
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,180
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,980
Good wine.

186
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,380
Princess,

187
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,420
Dr. Sun has prepared it.

188
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,420
Please go over.

189
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,620
Then you can taste it slowly.

190
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,340
I'll go first.

191
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,780
Thank you.

192
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,180
Good wine.

193
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,180
Good wine.

194
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,340
Thank you.

195
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,140
It's a little new.

196
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,340
Eunuch,

197
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,740
is this a girl from the music world of Yin?

198
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,820
It's the best to hang out as a famous man.

199
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,940
It's her.

200
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,780
Let's go.

201
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,780
W...

202
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,060
Why don't you give it a go?

203
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,860
How about she?

204
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,800
You know,

205
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,000
I never created it.

206
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,020
You gave me the rot's neither.

207
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,180
It's good.

208
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,540
If you don't like it,

209
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,460
take it.

210
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:32,780
Jin,

211
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,900
are you really going to Huan Shan andaven without a princess?

212
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,660
Take it?

213
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,860
of course.

214
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,980
The princess where?

215
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,940
I don't want to play it

216
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,180
You...

217
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,180
Within three days,

218
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,180
you must be well-received by the people.

219
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,180
Princess Liangying's husband,

220
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,180
Rongyan Juemei.

221
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,180
Thank you, sir.

222
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,180
I'll do it right away.

223
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,180
Your Highness.

224
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,180
It's really you.

225
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,180
You're still alive.

226
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,180
I thought you...

227
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,180
To get close to Wei Yanshu,

228
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,180
and to avenge her,

229
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,180
I need you to do something for me.

230
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,180
I'm willing to be your

231
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,180
father.

232
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,180
Mu Han!

233
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,180
Take her away.

234
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,180
Mu Han!

235
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,180
I'm the Emperor's man.

236
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,180
How dare you kill me?

237
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,180
Qiya came to the door by herself today.

238
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,180
We can't miss this opportunity.

239
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,180
Why did you kill Qiya in the Princess's mansion?

240
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,180
If Qiya dies in the Princess's mansion,

241
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,180
the Emperor and Princess will be suspicious.

242
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,180
This will make the Emperor and Princess

243
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,180
feel guilty about what the Crown Prince did.

244
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,180
Even if Qiya died in the Princess's mansion,

245
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,180
the Emperor wouldn't blame her

246
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,180
for the love of her daughter.

247
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,180
Do you know who I am?

248
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,180
Who are you?

249
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,180
