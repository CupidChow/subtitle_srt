1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,080
BUTTER FISH

2
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,000
Episode 17

3
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,480
It's you who stole it.

4
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,120
Why are you here?

5
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,620
Sister.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,820
I wanna have a look

7
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,200
if General Mu near your mansion

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,500
needs any help?

9
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Sister, don't be surprised.

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,500
No need.

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Without my permission,

12
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
she wouldn't want to leave my sight.

13
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,500
Sister, you're being too domineering.

14
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,500
So what?

15
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,500
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Is the person in your heart

17
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Mu Han?

18
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Guess.

19
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
You've written the answer on your face.

20
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
If I say,

21
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
you just be straightforward.

22
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Press her on the bed.

23
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Ask her,

24
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
do you like me?

25
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
If she says,

26
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
she doesn't like you,

27
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,500
how can you have her?

28
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
You just tie her up.

29
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Five flowers, big treasure.

30
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,500
Tie her up, tie her up, tie her up.

31
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
Five flowers, big treasure.

32
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,500
This idea.

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
If she doesn't like you,

34
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
she has to like you.

35
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,500
You're so ambitious.

36
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,500
I'll help you.

37
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
I'll help you.

38
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,500
I'll help you.

39
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
I'll help you.

40
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,500
I don't need your help.

41
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
I can do it myself.

42
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Why are you here?

43
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Whose Junko is this?

44
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
It looks so good.

45
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
How much did you drink?

46
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
None of your business.

47
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
You're drunk.

57
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Go back.

58
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
I'm not going back.

59
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
I'm going back.

60
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Don't run away from other bad girls.

61
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
I'm not stupid.

62
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Do you know who I am?

63
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
I know.

64
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
You are...

65
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
Junko.

66
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
I can't see you.

67
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,500
What are you looking at?

68
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Why are you so concentrated?

69
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Every time we...

70
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
What kind of magic trick is this?

71
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
You're so simple.

72
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
This is much better than magic tricks.

73
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,500
...forget you again.

74
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,500
It's the story of the Saint-Petersen girl, Shang Ying and the Lord of the Four Seasons.

75
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
At that time, Shang Ying wanted to make up with the people.

76
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
As the person who is the devil of the wild girl.

77
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
She didn't know how to get the secret clan to confess to Si Yuan.

78
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
She didn't love herself.

79
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
The grassland people will be heartbroken.

80
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,500
After the two girls fell in love, Si Yuan didn't die.

81
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Because Si Yuan's true identity is the God of War.

82
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Shang Ying is actually a good girl.

83
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
But they have a chance.

84
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,500
The battle with the devil thousands of years ago has already begun.

85
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
They have experienced the story of three lives and three lives.

86
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
They only have each other in their hearts.

87
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
They can't pretend to be others.

88
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Who won the battle of the devil?

89
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Si Yuan or Shang Ying?

90
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
You're so silly.

91
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
I won't tell you.

92
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Say it again.

93
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Who am I?

94
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
I'm here.

95
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
I'm here.

96
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
I'm here.

97
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
I'm here.

98
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
I'm here.

99
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
I'm here.

100
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
I'm here.

101
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
I'm here.

102
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
I'm here.

103
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
I'm here.

104
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
I'm here.

105
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
I'm here.

106
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,500
I'm here.

107
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
I'm here.

108
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
I'm here.

109
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
I'm here.

110
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
I'm here.

111
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
I'm here.

112
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
I'm here.

113
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
I'm here.

114
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
I'm here.

115
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
I'm here.

116
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
I'm here.

117
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
I'm here.

118
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
I'm here.

119
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
I'm here.

120
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
I'm here.

121
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
I'm here.

122
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
I'm here.

123
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
I'm here.

124
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Why are you here?

125
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
You're asking me?

126
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,500
You drank last night

127
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
and left me alone in the yard.

128
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
You sleep well.

129
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Forget it.

130
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Forget it.

131
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Let's not talk about it.

132
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Go with me.

133
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Where to?

134
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
What for?

135
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Of course to coordinate you and General Mu.

136
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Last night you said you loved General Mu.

137
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Did you forget?

138
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
If he can fall in love with me,

139
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
it can stimulate the love of flowers.

140
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
I'm here.

141
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
I'm here.

142
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Why are you here?

143
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,500
I prepared this for you and General Mu.

144
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
You must be careful.

145
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
I'm leaving.

146
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
Don't go.

147
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
You two alone

148
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Let's enjoy the two-man world.

149
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
I also prepared a big surprise.

150
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
You asked Yuan Ji Yao to invite me here.

151
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
How do you want to torture me?

152
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,500
If I say it's not me, do you believe it?

153
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
I'm sorry.

155
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
I'm sorry.

156
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
I'm sorry.

157
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,500
I'm sorry.

158
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
I'm sorry.

159
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
I'm sorry.

160
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
I'm sorry.

161
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
I'm sorry.

162
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
I'm sorry.

163
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
I'm sorry.

164
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
I'm sorry.

166
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
I'm sorry.

167
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:45,500
I don't care if the clouds are gone, the sky is clear, the sea is clear.

168
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,500
I'm just a star.

169
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,500
I can't see the two stars anymore.

170
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
I wish I could live forever.

171
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,500
I wish I could be a bird forever.

172
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,420
Or

173
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,700
deed millions of dollars a year for me.

174
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,180
I'm so terrible to him.

175
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,300
Even if he wants to achieve love,

176
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,100
is he too cruel to him?

177
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,600
When we wereTFffing,

178
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
I remember him.

179
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,600
The leader of the Prince of Zi Shang, Bai Ling.

180
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
You know my identity.

181
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Who are you?

182
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Who am I?

183
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
I am...

184
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
the one who wants to die.

185
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,600
What's the grudge between you and Prince of Zi Shang?

186
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
The Prince of Zi Shang you respect,

187
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
even if he is a thousand knives,

188
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
he can't wash away his sin.

189
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
His dirty and disgusting Prince's Mansion

190
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
should be destroyed.

191
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
It should be destroyed.

192
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
My Lord, don't torture him to death.

193
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
I remember when I was burning the camp,

194
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,600
there were only the Xuanhuang people and Mu Han in the camp.

195
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
I see.

196
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,600
The one you worship is Mu Han.

197
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Both of them are the remnant of Zi Shang.

198
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Right?

199
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
You don't say.

200
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Then I'll wait for Mu Han to come.

201
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
You go to hell together.

202
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Keep an eye on him.

203
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Don't let anything go wrong.

204
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Yes.

205
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Your Highness,

206
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
my brother sent a letter to Xuanwu without permission.

207
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
He hasn't come back yet.

208
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
He didn't even find the body.

209
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Bai Ling was caught by He Chuan.

210
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Give me my sword.

211
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Your Highness, you can't go.

212
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
It's obviously a trap.

213
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
It's all because of my indecision

214
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
that Bai Ling is in danger.

215
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
I can't let him take all the consequences for me.

216
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
My Lord, Princess.

217
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
I'm here to see you.

218
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
My Lord, Princess.

219
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
My brother called me here late at night

220
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
to see if you were a criminal.

221
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Do you know that

222
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
General Mu, whom you miss,

223
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
is in love with her?

224
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
What does that have to do with me?

225
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
You'll know in a while.

226
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
General Mu.

227
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Tell me.

228
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Who is it?

229
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Who is it?

230
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Tell me.

231
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Tell me.

232
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Tell me.

233
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Tell me.

234
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Why did you call me here?

235
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
General Mu.

236
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
General Mu.

237
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Do you know who he is?

238
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
I don't know him.

239
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
You don't know him?

240
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Good.

241
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,600
My Lord, you're so cruel.

242
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Aren't you afraid of being punished?

243
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
You better be careful.

244
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Brother.

245
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Let's talk about time

246
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
and our longings

247
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,600
How far apart are we?

248
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
I've asked thousands of times

249
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Who is writing the words

250
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,600
about our wishes?

251
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Open your eyes

252
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Your smile

253
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,600
is like water and fire

254
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
The blue sea and the sky

255
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,600
I want to be with you forever

256
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Don't be afraid of the wind and the clouds

257
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Between us

258
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,600
Time is like a piece of paper

259
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
If we can be together

260
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Between us

261
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
We will be together forever

262
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
The tears are like smoke

263
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Between us

264
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,600
Why is it so far?

265
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
The blue sea and the sky

266
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
I want to be with you forever

267
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,600
I will be with you forever

268
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:12,600
You are like the sky

269
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Open your eyes

270
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Your smile

271
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,600
is like water and fire

272
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
The blue sea and the sky

273
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,600
I want to be with you forever

274
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,600
I will be with you forever

275
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
You are like the sky

276
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Between us

277
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Open your eyes

278
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Your smile

279
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,600
is like water and fire

280
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
The blue sea and the sky

281
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,600
I want to be with you forever

282
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
Don't be afraid of the wind and the clouds

283
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Between us

284
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Time is like a piece of paper

285
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
If we can be together

286
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
Between us

287
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,600
We will be together forever

288
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
The tears are like smoke

289
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Between us

290
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Why is it so far?

291
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
The blue sea and the sky

292
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
I want to be with you forever

293
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:35,600
I will be with you forever

294
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
You are like the sky

295
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Between us

296
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Open your eyes

297
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Your smile

298
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,600
is like water and fire

299
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
The blue sea and the sky

300
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
I want to be with you forever

301
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
I will be with you forever

302
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,600
You are like the sky

303
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Between us

304
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Open your eyes

305
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Your smile

306
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
is like water and fire
