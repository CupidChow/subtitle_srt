1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:55,940
In Your іt's eassie we tactical

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and match the color of the jade.

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
They are a match made in heaven.

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But why do I think

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
she is purple?

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes,

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
she is purple.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Maybe

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
it's because of your eyes.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Goodbye.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The End

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You have been in Wenfu Yu's mansion for so long.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What did you do?

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What did you say?

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Princess,

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I just went to drink a cup of tea.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Liar!

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You like to go to the second princess's mansion so much.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you like Wenfu Yu

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
or the southern court?

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Princess,

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Kneel down.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Without my permission,

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
you are not allowed to get up.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Isn't this Guard Mohan?

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I heard

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
you went to the second princess without knowing it.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What?

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The second princess's mansion

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
can't tolerate you anymore, right?

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's time.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Close your eyes.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Although you are a guard,

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
the second princess's bed

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
is also warm.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Do you want to kill me?

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You are crazy.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You killed my people on my territory.

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He is the one of the Marquis.

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't you know?

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
My heart is cruel.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But you taught me.

44
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
He everyday learn from your mistake.

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I can't help.

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You are not calling me healthy.

47
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Marquis, you are here.

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Uncle��

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
His Majesty ordered me to visit Zhuyan.

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I specially invited

51
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Are you trying to avenge your own death?

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Are you kidding me?

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We all know that

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the Mu's Guard killed Qi Ya.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It shows that his martial arts are very good.

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So if he goes,

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
he can definitely make it.

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Don't you think so?

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Sure.

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll go with him.

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
A Shu,

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
stop it.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You know

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
it's dangerous outside.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He's my man.

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Of course he'll listen to me.

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
A Shu,

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
do you really trust him?

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You even let him go

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and killed Xueyan.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Since you already know,

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
don't send anyone

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
to spy on me anymore.

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I hate this feeling.

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
With Guard Mu here,

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
you don't have to go with me.

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But His Majesty...

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Remember,

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
you're doing this for me.

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Episode 2

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Marquis Cheng'an is here.

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Brother.

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Brother.

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why are you here?

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I heard that Zhuyan State has a great view.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I asked my mother

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
to let me go with you.

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What's wrong?

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Is there anything wrong?

90
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I made some pastries myself.

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Guard Mu,

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
why don't you take me to the car

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and have a taste?

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No need.

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I can ride it.

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Marquis,

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm here to see you.

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm here to see you.

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Marquis,

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
since Guard Mu wants to ride a horse,

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
let him ride my horse.

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The Second Princess

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
is very thoughtful.

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You flatter me.

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I didn't expect you to be good at it.

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's something that can't be seen on the stage.

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I didn't expect

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Marquis Han to be interested in it.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The Second Princess

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
has put the Young Master of the Shi family

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
outside the door.

113
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
She only cares about

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
a guard.

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't think

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
she's interested in it.

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Sister.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What's wrong?

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Is the carriage broken?

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I know

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
you don't want me to ride a horse with you.

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Take my carriage.

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I have a lot of things

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
to tell you.

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Please, Princess.

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Marquis,

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
get on the road.

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's late.

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Guard Mu,

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
why does your clothes

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
look so similar to Uncle He?

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This dress

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
is the master's dress

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that Shu Er custom-made.

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What?

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Marquis also wants to try

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
the taste of maidservant.

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
From now on,

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
we only wear red.

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
This way, we won't see blood.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll buy another horse

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
when we get to the next station.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's getting late.

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let's get on the road.

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Uncle,

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I've already

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
taken all the people

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
from Xianzi to Qingzhou for you.

150
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Why didn't you tell me

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
that you were going to Zhuyan?

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Why are you here?

153
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Everyone in Linzhang knows

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
that my mother

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
is the princess of Zhuyan.

156
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What's the use

157
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
of taking you with you?

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
There are many benefits.

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What?

160
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
There are many benefits.

161
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Pick one.

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Pick one for me.

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You go first.

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll pick one for him.

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'll pick this one.

166
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
My eyes are all red.

167
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm scared.

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Isn't this your favorite color?

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll pick this one.

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll pick this one.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll pick this one.

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm familiar with

173
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
the same color

174
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
as I like.

175
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Pick another one.

176
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This one.

177
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Red mood.

178
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay.

179
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Did I think too much?

180
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Uncle.

181
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I have something to tell you.

182
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Let's go.

183
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Brother,

184
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
you hurt me.

185
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Uncle,

186
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
you've been acting strange lately.

187
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Why are you acting so strange?

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Did I cause

189
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
something to happen

190
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and make him suspect me?

191
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's abnormal.

192
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't understand what you're talking about.

193
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Since we came back from Zishangzhou,

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
you've been distant from me.

195
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
