00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
THE HOT UP POLITICS

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:20,000
When Love Fallen

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,000
It Makes This Film

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,000
A Timeless Job

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,000
While Love Fallen

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,000
Is Demanded

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,000
by Search for a Reason

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The World is Called

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,160
...

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,200
damage

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,400
of

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:56,680
As long as weYu were not

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:05,400
Brother, I want to be alone for a while.

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,400
I should have thought of it.

15
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,400
I should have thought of it.

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
Why is Shagu on him?

17
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,400
I finally understand why he...

18
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,400
Why he loves me and loves me.

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Why he wants to get rid of the secret water that he and the Purple Shark King have been facing.

20
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Have you ever been in the sky?

21
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,400
If love is like a dream, it's like a shadow.

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,400
In the dream, I'm just like a shadow.

23
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,400
I'm willing to be in your arms forever.

24
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,400
At this moment, all the secrets...

25
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
have been solved.

26
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,400
The sea is full of the clear sea.

27
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,400
There is only one last thing left.

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Yichen, it's all going to end soon.

29
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,400
I won't let you wait too long.

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Like a fallen leaf,

31
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,400
I'm like a floating fish on the shore.

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,400
I'm not afraid of the cold.

33
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,400
I'm brave enough to give myself to you.

34
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Did you take the medicine?

35
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Muhan, no.

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,400
I should call you Si Yichen.

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Am I right?

38
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
Isn't General Mu going to war?

39
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Why is he tied up?

40
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
I heard from the servants of the Palace of the Princess.

41
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
He is the former Prince of the Purple Shark King, Yu Nie.

42
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
He was discovered by the Princess.

43
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,400
I heard that he was going to be executed.

44
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
That is the most elite official of Lingzhao.

45
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
You want to die?

46
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,400
What if His Highness is executed?

47
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Wen Yanshu, what do you want to do?

48
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,400
What's wrong? Are you scared?

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Are you in pain?

50
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,400
You worked so hard to stay by my side.

51
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Is it because you want to get revenge one day?

52
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Yes.

53
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
But...

57
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Do you hate me?

58
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Let me ask you first.

59
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
Have you ever loved me?

60
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Do you deserve my love?

61
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Do you know how many people I have participated in the assassination of the Prince of the Purple Shark King?

62
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
What are you talking about?

63
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Before I went to the Purple Shark King,

64
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,400
I thought of many ways to kill people.

65
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
I made Qi Ya realize it.

66
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,400
You think my hands are not stained with blood.

67
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,400
In fact, I ordered it.

68
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Wen Yanshu, I want to kill you.

69
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Are you angry now?

70
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,400
Oh, I remember another person.

71
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
An important person.

72
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Your fiance, Hang An.

73
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
It's you.

74
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
You killed him.

75
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
So what?

76
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
It's not my fault.

77
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,400
He came to the door.

78
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,400
When he died, he still missed you.

79
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
It's so miserable.

80
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Oh, right.

81
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,400
I found the Thousand-Thread Eye on him.

82
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,400
That magic treasure was in his body.

83
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
I turned it upside down.

84
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
You're crazy.

85
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Crazy.

86
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Since you're dying,

87
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
I'll tell you the truth.

88
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,400
The Thousand-Thread Eye needs to cut three flowers with the gourd.

89
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Its power can break through everything.

90
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,400
Otherwise, what do you think I'm working so hard for?

91
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Of course, for the gourd in your body.

92
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Princess Shan.

93
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Yichen, let's play together.

94
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Yichen, what's wrong with you?

95
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
I'm going to find my father.

96
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
Yichen.

97
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Mother.

98
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Yichen.

99
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
It's not safe now.

100
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,400
I'll send Yichen back to the mansion.

101
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Bailing, you go to Ning'er.

102
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Mother, Yichen is not safe now.

103
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
We'll wait for you in the mansion.

104
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
Father, Yichen.

105
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
The King of Zishan has been attacked.

106
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
The whole family was killed.

107
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
It's all a joke.

108
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,400
So my policy was to kill me.

109
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
From the first moment I saw you,

110
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,400
I was thinking about how to crush the Three-Blood Flower.

111
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,400
I tried my best to make you love me and hate me.

112
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,400
To take your power as my only friend.

113
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
To make the world mine.

114
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,400
After this, Lin Zhao will be a coward.

115
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Murder and violence.

116
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,400
It's his destiny to be transferred.

117
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Si Yichen.

118
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,400
There is no justice in this world.

119
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
I want you to be with me.

120
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Fall down.

121
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Ha ha ha ha.

122
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
It's all a joke.

123
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,400
The one I love the most is my biggest enemy.

124
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Wen Yanshu.

125
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,400
You'd better kill me now.

126
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Otherwise, as soon as I can escape,

127
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,400
I will crush you into pieces.

128
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Ha ha ha.

129
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Ha ha ha.

130
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Ha ha ha.

131
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Ha ha ha.

132
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Ha ha ha.

133
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Let all the sins be forgiven.

134
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Ha ha ha.

135
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Come on.

136
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Take him to the prison.

137
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Yes.

138
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Ha ha ha.

139
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Uncle.

140
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
What's wrong with you?

141
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Brother.

142
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
I'm fine.

143
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
I'm going back.

144
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Uncle.

145
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Let's sit down and talk.

146
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Ha ha ha.

147
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Ha ha ha.

148
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Ha ha ha.

149
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Ha ha ha.

150
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Ha ha ha.

151
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Ha ha ha.

152
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Ha ha ha.

153
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,400
Ha ha ha.

154
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Ha ha ha.

155
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Ha ha ha.

156
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Ha ha ha.

157
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Ha ha ha.

158
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Ha ha ha.

159
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Ha ha ha.

160
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,400
Ha ha ha.

161
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Ha ha ha.

162
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Ha ha ha.

163
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,400
Ha ha ha.

164
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Ha ha ha.

165
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Ha ha ha.

166
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Ha ha ha.

167
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Ha ha ha.

168
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,400
Ha ha ha.

169
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,400
Ha ha ha.

170
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Ha ha ha.

171
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Ha ha ha.

172
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,400
Ha ha ha.

173
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Ha ha ha.

174
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,400
Ha ha ha.
