1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Well, I'll see you then.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
tyranny

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,000
You killed her?

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
She members Style of Indulgence to make noises from the palace.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I wanted to educational her,

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but it went so bad....

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
went to the points of detachment..

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Shuman doesn't believe me.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Princess.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Princess.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
How can you...

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He is the father of His Majesty.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Jin Ye.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You didn't see him.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Princess.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Qi Ya Ying was killed because of me.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I was also killed because of him.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Right?

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Right.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Right.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's go.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I need a reasonable explanation for Qi Ya's death.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If I say it was a sudden mistake,

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
will you believe it?

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The wound on her body

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
can't be caused by a sudden mistake.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
She killed my whole family.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
She even killed the child.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Princess.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Will you be sad for us?

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So you chose to stay with me

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
to find a chance to revenge, right?

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
If Shu Er didn't take me away,

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I wouldn't have a chance.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I remember you wanted to kill me

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
when we first met.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Now?

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Is it the same as before?

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If I say yes,

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
what will Shu Er do?

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's just that

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
while you were being tamed,

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
you had some difficulties.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I want you to

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
be completely

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and completely recovered.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Come with me to the palace tomorrow.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you want to live, listen to me.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Even if you can't count to half,

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
you can still draw a line.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Father.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Qi Ya not only punished me for being drunk,

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
but also refused to give me a curse.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
This led to the miscarriage.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
These imperial physicians can testify.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Father.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's your unborn grandson.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Imperial Physician Sun.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Is it true?

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's true.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
All right.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You can leave now.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I want to talk to him alone.

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Qi Ya.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
How did Qi Ya die?

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He is a master

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
of the best of the best.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
In order to protect the princess,

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
will kill him no matter what.

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If it weren't for your happiness,

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I would have killed you long ago.

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Remember.

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Except for getting the princess's heart,

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
you'd better not have any other thoughts.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes.

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Your Majesty.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I've already gone to the night court.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I won't make any more mistakes.

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You've been getting more and more slack.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't you want your sister's life?

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I dare not.

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I will do my best to serve Your Majesty.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Come and have a look.

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Come and have a look.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This is nice.

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This is nice.

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Come and have a look.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Wrap it up.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
All right.

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Come and have a look.

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This is nice.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Come and have a look.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Father.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Is there any problem with Zishangzhou?

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Father.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Since the late Prince Zishang was sentenced to treason,

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
the new Prince Zishang has been very obedient.

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He has handed over the military power to the capital

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and took twice the credit.

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Zishangzhou is in the territory of the Yan Dynasty.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We must ensure that nothing is lost.

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I thought that Zishangzhou was in danger.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Other Zhou army would not dare to make trouble again.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I did not expect that they would secretly raise troops

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and not take the public.

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I was shocked.

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Father, do you need me?

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The Taizu Dynasty was not easy to unify.

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
After all, the Taizu Dynasty was a woman.

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
She was a rich woman.

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Jiang Rong went to all the states and states.

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
She has been in the west for generations.

130
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Xuan Huang was out there.

131
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
She often took advantage of the war.

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
She should solve the external troubles first.

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Then she will solve the internal troubles.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Father, now that Lingzhao's treasury is empty,

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and Xuan Huang's army is strong,

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm afraid it will be difficult to fight.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Zhu Yan of the Lin State is very talented.

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Lingzhao is in trouble.

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The next one is them.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Everyone in the whole country is in danger.

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It is not difficult to negotiate with them.

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I am willing to go to Zhu Yan and persuade the master.

143
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Good.

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You did a good job in Zishengzhou.

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Do not let me down this time.

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If you lack people, you can make a decision yourself.

147
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You can leave immediately.

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes.

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Wait a minute.

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
When you go to Zhu Yan, you must pass Zishengzhou.

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Go and see if that Zisheng cannot be the master of Yizhou,

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I will remove his throne.

153
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:56,520
Then the people will be convinced by the

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Isn't that person Mohan?

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Is there really something between them?

156
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I saw you fainted in the carriage.

157
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I asked someone to take you back to my house.

158
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The second princess is better than opening the door and seeing the mountain.

159
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Why did you take me here with a fragrance?

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Mohan has been away for too long.

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The eldest princess will be suspicious.

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Mohan went to Princess Fuyu's house.

163
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Went to Wen Fuyu's house.

164
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Good.

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I want to see what reason she has.

166
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Then I will say it directly.

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I need you to help me.

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Father is old.

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The day he retires is the day of the death of the emperor.

170
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So you want me to help you kill Wen Yanshu.

171
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Not only.

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I want him to die.

173
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I want him to die.

174
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I want him to suffer.

175
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I want him to die.

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't care about Wen Yanshu.

177
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I just don't believe in others.

178
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I always like what Wen Yanshu has.

179
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I want to grab what he loves.

180
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I want him to be humiliated and killed.

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You are not afraid.

182
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I will tell Wen Yanshu about this.

183
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Mohan, I think you are a smart person.

184
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You should know how to choose.

185
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Even if you choose Wen Yanshu.

186
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
For me.

187
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's more important than a life.

188
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Go.

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Wen Yanshu has me.

190
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't care.

191
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Remember.

192
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
My wife Ms.ography.

193
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Understand?

194
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Look what color is this.

195
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Stop.

196
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You want to kill someone, you'd better stay away from me.

197
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,000
You're a bad witch.

198
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,200
You're being tainted, you know?

199
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
So noisy.

200
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,800
Zimo, get the carriage ready.

201
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,800
She always wears green clothes.

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,600
She's really kind to be treated as a donkey.

203
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,800
Really.

204
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I can't even tell.

205
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,000
What I'm telling you is

206
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,600
you'd better think about it.

207
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,800
You look so angry.

208
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What's the matter?

209
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
My dog is lost.

210
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,600
Come here and find it.

211
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,600
Who's making a fuss?

212
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,200
You and me, we're just like that.

213
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,400
Open your eyes.

214
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,400
Your smile,

215
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,400
like water flowing through the sea.

216
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,200
The blue sea, the sky,

217
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:05,000
I'd like to spend the rest of my life with you.

218
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,800
I don't fear the wind, the wind blows through my fingers.

219
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,000
Time changes with the sky.

220
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,800
If we can be together forever,

221
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
we'll be together forever.

222
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,400
The deep of tears,

223
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,400
between you and me,

224
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,400
why are we so far apart?

225
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,200
The love has been hidden for so long,

226
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,000
but our shape is on the road of reunion.

227
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

228
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
I'm sorry.

229
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
I'm sorry.

231
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
I'm sorry.

233
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,200
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
I'm sorry.

236
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
I'm sorry.

237
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
I'm sorry.

238
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
I'm sorry.

240
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
I'm sorry.

241
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
I'm sorry.

242
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
I'm sorry.

243
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
I'm sorry.

244
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
I'm sorry.

245
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
I'm sorry.

246
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
I'm sorry.

247
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
I'm sorry.

248
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
I'm sorry.

249
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,200
I'm sorry.

250
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
I'm sorry.

252
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
I'm sorry.

253
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
I'm sorry.

254
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
I'm sorry.

256
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
I'm sorry.

257
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
I'm sorry.

258
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
I'm sorry.

260
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
I'm sorry.

261
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
I'm sorry.

263
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,200
I'm sorry.

264
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,200
I'm sorry.

265
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
I'm sorry.

266
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
I'm sorry.

267
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
I'm sorry.

268
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
I'm sorry.

269
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
I'm sorry.

270
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
I'm sorry.

272
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
I'm sorry.

273
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
