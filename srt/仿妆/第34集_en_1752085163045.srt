00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Chapter 3

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,240
Let's go home

3
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,760
They must find my laptop

4
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,000
So you can 222

5
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,640
Da Shu

6
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,000
Da Shu

7
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,140
refreshing

8
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:06,140
We will become each other's support

9
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:12,140
The ending is as simple as a fairy tale

10
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,140
Everything has never changed

11
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,140
Just take it as a story of the autumn leaves

12
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,140
If I meet you again

13
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,140
I still...

14
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,140
You can't catch up with me

15
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,140
You, you are right in front of me

16
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,140
In the end, we will never meet again

17
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,140
I still...

18
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,140
Why are you so weak?

19
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,140
I'm always a little bit confused

20
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,140
Yizhi, let's meet in the next life

21
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,140
Don't leave me

22
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,140
Don't leave me

23
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,140
Yizhi

24
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,140
Yizhi

25
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,140
We were so close

26
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,140
Maybe it was already destined

27
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,140
Today's ending

28
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,140
You are An Ning

29
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,140
Yes

30
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,140
I love you

31
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,140
I always love you

32
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,140
I just want to revenge

33
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,140
And become a bad person

34
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,140
I don't care who you are

35
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,140
An Ning or A Shu

36
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,140
You are the most important person in my heart

37
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,140
And the person I love the most

38
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,140
Don't leave me

39
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,140
Don't leave me

40
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,140
Promise me

41
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,140
Don't forget me

42
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,140
No

43
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,140
I don't want to be trapped here

44
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,140
I don't want to be trapped

45
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,140
A Shu

46
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,140
A Shu

47
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,140
A Shu

48
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,140
No

49
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,140
I don't want to leave you

50
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,140
A Shu

51
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,140
Kill them

52
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,140
Brothers, charge

53
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,140
Charge

54
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,140
Kill them

55
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:46,140
This is the agreement between Xuan Huang and Zhu Yan and Lin Zhao

56
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,140
To ensure that Lin Zhao will not have any more wars in ten years

57
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,140
He used his own strength to protect you

58
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,140
But in the end you couldn't protect him

59
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,140
So all this

60
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,140
You knew it

61
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,140
When he went to Zhu Yan to get married

62
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,140
We got to know each other

63
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,140
When Zi Shang was killed, my master died

64
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,140
He thought you were dead too

65
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,140
So he changed his identity

66
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,140
He used Wen Yan Shu's identity to protect you

67
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,140
To avenge you

68
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,140
All this is my fault

69
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,140
But when everything comes to an end

70
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,140
I will decide

71
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,140
The fate of Yuan Qi Yuan Mie is not up to you

72
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,140
Your Majesty

73
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,140
Long live the emperor

74
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,140
Long live the emperor

75
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,140
All of you rise

76
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,140
Thank you, Your Majesty.

77
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,580
Your Majesty, you have been in the throne for three years.

78
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,700
I hope you can make a good daughter soon.

79
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,700
You don't have to talk about this.

80
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,180
The one who wanted to be my queen has died.

81
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,260
From now on,

82
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,700
I will not marry anyone else.

83
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,740
I will not marry anyone else.

84
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,740
I will not marry anyone else.

85
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,740
I will not marry anyone else.

86
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,740
I will not marry anyone else.

87
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,740
I will not marry anyone else.

88
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,740
I will not marry anyone else.

89
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,740
I will not marry anyone else.

90
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,740
I will not marry anyone else.

91
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,740
I will not marry anyone else.

92
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,740
I will not marry anyone else.

93
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,740
I will not marry anyone else.

94
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,740
I will not marry anyone else.

95
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,740
I will not marry anyone else.

96
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,740
I will not marry anyone else.

97
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,340
I will not marry anyone else.

98
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,340
I will not marry anyone else.

99
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,340
I will not marry anyone else.

100
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,340
I will not marry anyone else.

101
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,340
I will not marry anyone else.

102
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,340
I will not marry anyone else.

103
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,340
I will not marry anyone else.

104
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,340
I will not marry anyone else.

105
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,340
I will not marry anyone else.

106
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,340
I will not marry anyone else.

107
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,340
I will not marry anyone else.

108
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,340
I will not marry anyone else.

109
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,340
I will not marry anyone else.

110
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,340
I will not marry anyone else.

111
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,940
I will not marry anyone else.

112
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,840
Evening Mushroom

113
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,240
The Arctic calling

114
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,180
In this drop of time, thousand years have passed

115
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,740
And all are Angelic

116
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,920
zigzag

117
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,820
In thousands words

118
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,720
Who гром

119
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,260
You used my máLet's talk

120
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,220
I'm losing

121
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,660
Open your eyes

122
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,560
You smile

123
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,400
Just like April, June, happy fighting

124
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:23,400
I wish to spend the rest of my life with you

125
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,400
I don't fear the wind and the sky, you and me

126
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,400
The world is in the sky

127
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,400
If we can be together forever

128
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,400
We will be the destination forever

129
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,400
I face the abyss, you and me

130
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,400
I don't fear the wind and the sky

131
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,400
The world is in the sky

132
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,400
If we can be together forever

133
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:02,400
We will be the destination forever

134
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Open your eyes, your smile

135
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Like a dream

136
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:34,400
The sea is clear, I wish to spend the rest of my life with you

137
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,400
I don't fear the wind and the sky, you and me

138
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,400
The world is in the sky

139
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,400
If we can be together forever

140
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,400
We will be the destination forever

141

The sea is clear, I wish to spend the rest of my life with you

144
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,400
I don't fear the wind and the sky

145
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,400
I don't fear the wind and the sky, you and me

146
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,400
The world is in the sky

147

If we can be together forever

148
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,400
We will be the destination forever

149
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,400
I face the abyss, you and me

00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,400
I don't fear the wind and the sky

151
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:20,400
The sea is clear, I wish to spend the rest of my life with you

152
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Who is writing on the side of the river?

153
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,400
You and me

154
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Open your eyes, your smile

155
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,400
Like a dream

156
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:58,400
The sea is clear, I wish to spend the rest of my life with you

157

I don't fear the wind and the sky, you and me

If we can be together forever

00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,400
We will be the destination forever

Open your eyes, your smile

166
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,400
Like a dream

167
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:21,400

You and me

I don't fear the wind and the sky

177
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,400
I don't fear the wind and the sky
