1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,800
Be together from today

2
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,700
walk together

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Sister?

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What are you doing?

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Put it down.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Thank you, sister.

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Sister.

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You're welcome.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Ashu.

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Why did you do this to her?

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We're the only ones who can do this.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I used to like red.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Now I don't.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I used to do this to you.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now I can do this to others.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
People change.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Am I right?

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Brother.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Sister.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's late.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Time to rest.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You go back first.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
There was something wrong with Qian Siying.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What triggered her hatred?

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That night in the Purple-Tailed Prince's mansion,

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
you were ill.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You were so obsessed with blood.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Really?

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Don't worry.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'll go and check.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll go and check.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll go and check.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll go and check.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll go and check.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll go and check.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll go and check.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll go and check.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll go and check.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll go and check.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll go and check.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll go and check.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll go and check.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll go and check.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll go and check.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why did the flower of hatred bloom at this time?

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's a good start.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I should be loved by you.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Dad.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
When I collect the three flowers,

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I will revenge for you.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I will revenge for you.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Your Majesty.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The person you want is here.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Summon him in.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Summon.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Zimo.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
From now on,

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
you should protect the Princess.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If she is pregnant,

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
you must report it immediately.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
My throne is safe.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But now,

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
my blood and blood are mixed.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Do you think

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
the gods will blame me?

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's the will of the gods.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You should be with the gods.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Tell me.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Why are you

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
so fond of me?

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
When you were teaching Fang Si,

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
you taught me how to be a good daughter.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I was relieved to hear that.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
When you bought me the clothes

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and the clothes for the ten stars,

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I decided to follow you

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
for the rest of my life.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You sent me the zither and calligraphy.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You taught me how to play the zither.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
In this world,

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
no one is worth it except you.

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No one can compare to you.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I will never forget you.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
you raised us in the mansion

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and never favored us.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But you let that

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
pretty and poor girl serve you.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Your Highness, I...

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Get out.

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Get out.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I've asked all the questions.

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You may leave.

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Mu Han.

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I will make you fall in love with me.

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I gave you all these.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And you live in this room?

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why did you give me these?

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm in a good mood.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Is there a problem?

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You are as famous as the rumors say.

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You are very mysterious.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Do you like these gold and silver treasures?

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So,

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
zither, calligraphy, painting, jade, stone and pattern?

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't believe it.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You don't have to worry about it.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The children of ordinary people

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
are not so calm when they face these treasures.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Or...

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Come to my bedroom later.

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Come.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Your Highness, you asked me to come.

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What's up?

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Come here.

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What are you thinking at this moment?

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What do you think?

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Sister, give me your hand.

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So you like this.

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But I don't want...

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You have so many things to do.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The best...

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Of course, you have to keep it to the end.

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You...

128
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Brother.

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He really knows how to adjust time.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Uncle, I'll take you to a place.

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Sister, where are you going?

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Uncle, I know you like the cakes of Zhuyan.

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I know the cook of this restaurant is from Zhuyan.

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So I bought it with the people and bought it for you.

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Brother, I came with you today to tell you that

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
you don't have to worry about me in the future.

137
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Uncle,

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
that night, you dragged me into the hell.

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Have you ever thought about Luanchang?

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You and I...

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The past is the past.

142
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The future is the future.

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Uncle, why did you become like this?

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Did you hurt Mohan?

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's none of your business.

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Uncle, I'm sorry.

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I shouldn't have tamed you.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
No matter where your heart is,

149
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll find it for you.

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Okay?

151
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Okay?

152
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The fate of the evil is broken.

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The fate of the evil is also a fate.

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We will never break up in this life.

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Boss, I'll take this.

156
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This devil is robbing my sister's husband.

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's see how I'll deal with him.

158
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Boss, I'll take this.

159
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll take this.

160
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'll take this.

161
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll take this.

162
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll take this.

163
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'll take this.

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll take this.

165
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'll take this.

166
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'll take this.

167
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll take this.

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll take this.

169
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'll take this.

170
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'll take this.

171
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'll take this.

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll take this.

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll take this.

174
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll take this.

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'll take this.

176
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll take this.

177
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll take this.

178
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll take this.

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'll take this.

180
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll take this.

181
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'll take this.

182
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'll take this.

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'll take this.

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll take this.

185
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'll take this.

186
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'll take this.

187
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'll take this.

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'll take this.

189
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'll take this.

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'll take this.

191
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll take this.

192
