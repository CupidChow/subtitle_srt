Episode 16

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Killing a son and hurting a king

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
is just like committing a rebellion.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The Long Ballad

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Tonight,

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll go with him.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Uncle Han.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I told him to do this.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The son-hurt king is treacherous.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He's secretly serving the rebels.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Shouldn't he be killed?

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Uncle Han,

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
killing the son-hurt king

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
is a crime.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Even if I don't kill him,

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
His Majesty will never let him off.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Uncle Han,

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
are you trying to cover up for him?

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Brother,

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm not covering up for him.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm killing people for you.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That night,

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
weren't you going to kill the son-hurt king?

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Can we go now?

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Leave.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The Long Ballad

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Father,

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the son-hurt king is treacherous.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He's secretly serving the rebels.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He's trying to rebel.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He's been killed by me.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He's been keeping a secret from the people.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The son-hurt king is a coward.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He'll be humiliated in the future.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
How did you sleep last night?

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I slept well.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Where's the princess?

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
for helping me kill the son-hurt king.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You're welcome.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's all what I should do.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The weather is nice today.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Do you like sunny days

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
or rainy days?

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't like them both.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The mood is always changing.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The princess

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
should go out to the open air.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The Long Ballad

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Why isn't Wen Yan Shu back yet?

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The Long Ballad

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He's not Wen Yan Shu.

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
When you get to Zhuyan Valley,

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
we'll deal with these enemies.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The Long Ballad

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Last night,

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
there was a handsome man

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
in the Internet Cafe.

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I dreamed of him.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But it was just a moment.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
When we get to the border,

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
we'll eat the flowers.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Pack up and leave.

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The Long Ballad

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He's the man in my dream.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes, Brother An.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yes.

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Wait for me.

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Why is there someone here?

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Wake up.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Who are you?

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The wound is gone.

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It looks much better.

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Does it?

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I received a letter not long ago.

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I heard that the envoy from Linzhao

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
came to Zhuyan Valley.

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Father is very happy.

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But he's very sick recently.

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He can't see you.

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So I'll be the one to entertain you.

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm the Crown Prince of Zhuyan Kingdom.

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yan Shi'an.

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Please.

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Let's go.

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We came to visit you

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
with the treasure of the treasure.

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Please accept it.

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm not short of these.

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You may have heard that

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
now Linzhao and Xuanhuang

94
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
are fighting against each other.

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The war is on.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But the country is in danger.

97
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Zhuyan needs to help.

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
If Zhuyan has any request,

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I, Linzhao, will help him.

100
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I have gold all over the land.

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You don't know

102
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
that it's a small thing.

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But what I want today,

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't know if you're willing to give it to me.

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Your Highness, it's okay to say it.

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I want the Princess of Linzhao.

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
To dance for me?

108
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
To see my sincerity?

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What do you think?

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You may not know that

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Princess of Linzhao

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
is not only beautiful,

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
but also good at dancing.

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Your Highness,

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Princess of Linzhao is my words.

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm afraid it's not appropriate.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This is the attitude of your peace talks.

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The soldiers in the front line are all dead.

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
They can't get food and clothing.

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Now the Princess of Linzhao

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
is just dancing.

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's so hard for her.

123
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's really a shame for the people.

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
How sincere is your sincerity?

125
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm willing to give you a thousand gold.

126
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What do you think?

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I hope you can do what you say.

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Uncle.

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Let's just fight.

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If you fall,

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'll pretend that the Princess of Linzhao

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
is not sincere.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The moon is blue in the evening.

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Good dance.

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
When did you learn this dance?

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm going to the river to get some wine.

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The gray table is full of the floating boat.

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
One by one, the love is written.

139
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But it's trapped in the snow.

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The moon is full of hope.

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The heart knows what it wants.

142
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Good.

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We always look at each other.

144
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We always think about each other.

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But you always stay in my dream.

146
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You are cold.

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We have a thousand hopes and dreams.

148
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But they are gone.

149
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We miss the face that belongs to us.

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We can't get close to love.

151
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The endless hatred.

152
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The four seasons.

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The endless years.

154
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Open your eyes.

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Your smile.

156
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The water is flowing.

157
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The blue sea is like heaven.

158
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The wind and the moon are not afraid of you.

160
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The world is like heaven.

161
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If we can be together forever.

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
We will be together forever.

163
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The deep wish that faces us.

164
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Between you and me.

165
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Why is it so far away?

166
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The endless hatred.

167
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The endless years.

168
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Open your eyes.

169
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Open your eyes.

170
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Your smile.

171
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The water is flowing.

172
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The blue sea is like heaven.

173
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

174
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The wind and the moon are not afraid of you.

175
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The world is like heaven.

176
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
If we can be together forever.

177
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The wind and the moon are not afraid of you.

178
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Between you and me.

179
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The world is like heaven.

180
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If we can be together forever.

181
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We will be together forever.

182
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The deep wish that faces us.

183
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Between you and me.

184
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Why is it so far away?

185
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The endless hatred.

186
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The endless years.

187
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Open your eyes.

188
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Open your eyes.

189
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Your smile.

190
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Open your eyes.

191
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Your smile.

192
