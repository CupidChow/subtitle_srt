4
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,020

11
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,160
since you want to die together

12
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
then I

13
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
I'll send you to hell.

14
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,340
He Chuan.

15
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,060
Why?

16
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,220
Actually, I regret it.

17
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,700
If I didn't cheat you,

18
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,100
maybe...

19
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,540
we can be good brothers.

20
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,340
He Chuan.

21
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,860
He Chuan.

22
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,780
Yu Tu.

23
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,860
Long live the river.

24
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,620
You live a good life.

25
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,180
After all,

26
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,680
you are awash

27
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,700
I cried.

28
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,700
You are clearly not me.

29
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,700
But this time,

30
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,700
I will never be able to touch the face of the living person

31
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:22,700
to taste all the sweetness in the world.

32
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,700
He Cheng.

33
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,700
He is the one who is the only one.

34
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,700
I have never been the only one who is the only one.

35
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,700
You are the only one who is the only one.

36
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,700
I am the only one who is the only one.

37
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,700
I miss you so much that I can't stop thinking about you.

38
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,700
I can't stop thinking about you.

39
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,700
You and I are deeply connected.

40
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,700
I can't forgive you.

41
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
I actually...

42
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,700
I...

43
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,700
I...

44
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,700
I...

45
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700
I...

46
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,700
He Cheng.

47
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,700
Actually, I am...

48
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,700
Actually, I love you.

49
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,700
Someone.

50
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,700
Someone.

51
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,700
Is there anyone?

52
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,700
Someone.

53
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,700
Wen Fuyu.

54
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,700
It's you.

55
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,700
Aren't you usually very arrogant?

56
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,700
What do you want to do?

57
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,700
Sister likes to wear red clothes the most.

58
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,700
I will arrange it for you.

59
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,700
Where is Mu Han?

60
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,700
Where is Mu Han?

61
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,700
I want to see him.

62
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,700
Didn't you say that you are angry with him?

63
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,700
You personally killed the emperor and was exposed to the world.

64
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,700
You are no longer the high-ranking Princess Royal.

65
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,700
You are no longer the high-ranking Princess Royal.

66
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,700
Sister, look.

67
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,700
This is a poison that makes people lose their senses.

68
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,700
Sister must drink it like a tree.

69
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,700
You...

70
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,700
Shut up.

71
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,700
After drinking this,

72
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,700
you will not be able to hear.

73
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,700
You can't see.

74
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,700
You can't speak.

75
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,700
You can't embroider.

76
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
You can't touch.

77
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,700
You are like being trapped in a box.

78
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,700
You will slowly lose your senses.

79
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,700
Stay well.

80
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,700
Wen Fuyu.

81
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,700
Wen Fuyu.

82
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
Wen Fuyu.

83
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,700
Wen Yanshu.

84
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,700
Do you think that I will forgive you

85
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,700
because of your current state?

86
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,700
Father.

87
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,700
Mother.

88
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,700
I have finally avenged you.

89
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,700
Father.

90
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,700
Mother.

91
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,700
Mother.

92
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,700
What are you doing now?

93
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,700
Do you think that I will believe you

94
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,700
because of your current state?

95
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,700
Wen Yanshu.

96
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Look.

97
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,700
You are my close relative.

98
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,700
You are the one I love the most.

99
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,700
The funniest thing is

100
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,700
I actually fell in love with my enemy.

101
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,700
Tell me.

102
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,700
How do you want me to choose?

103
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Why?

104
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,700
Why is that person you?

105
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,700
I hate it when you kill yourself now.

106
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,700
But I can't do it.

107
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,700
Bai Ling.

108
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,700
Take her away.

109
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,700
Yes, Your Highness.

110
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,700
Let's go.

111
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,700
I have your smile.

112
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,700
It's ridiculous.

113
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,700
You and I have a wish.

114
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,700
Open your eyes.

115
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,700
Your smile.

116
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,700
Like water flowing.

117
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,700
The blue sea and the sky.

118
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:06,700
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

119
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,700
Don't be afraid of the wind and the clouds.

120
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,700
Between you and me.

121
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,700
Time changes.

122
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,700
If we can be together.

123
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,700
Between you and me.

124
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,700
We will be together forever.

125
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,700
Tears are like wishes.

126
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,700
Between you and me.

127
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,700
Why do we have to be apart?

128
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,700
The sky and the sea are not the same.

129
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:42,700
Let me be your smile.

130
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,700
Let's go.

131
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
Open your eyes.

132
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,700
Your smile.

133
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,700
Like water flowing.

134
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,700
The blue sea and the sky.

135
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:33,700
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

136
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,700
Don't be afraid of the wind and the clouds.

137
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
Between you and me.

138
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,700
Time changes.

139
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700

140
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,700

141
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,700
We will be together forever.

142
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,700
Tears are like wishes.

143
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,700

144
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,700

Don't be afraid of the wind and the clouds.

00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,700
Let me be your smile.

151
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,700
