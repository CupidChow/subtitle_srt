00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,800
Yi

00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,480
Li

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,640
Pro conditions

6
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,720
Pro foment

7
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:50,420
Or

8
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,580
Darling

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,100
Den

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,920
You

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,920
I think he likes the wife of Princess Liangyin.

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,920
I heard that the wife is beautiful.

13
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,920
The whole capital is changing.

14
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,920
I am the wife they say,

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,920
Mu Han.

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,920
But I have another secret.

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,920
Prince Zishang's heir, Si Yichen.

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,920
Three months ago,

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,920
on the night of my wedding,

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,920
because of the fear of Zishangzhou,

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,920
the emperor sent Princess Wenyan to kill Prince Zishang.

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,920
Hide the crown prince.

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
To keep the blood of the private world,

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
my father asked my master to seal my acupoint.

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Hide me.

26
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,920
I survived this killing,

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,920
but I saw my relatives die in front of me one by one.

28
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
The general of the army,

29
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
the king of Chu,

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,920
was killed.

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,920
That night,

32
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,920
the red blood was dyed black.

33
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,920
For the sake of the war,

34
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,920
many people killed themselves.

35
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,920
The blood was flowing everywhere.

36
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,920
Until the two women who were on the street

37
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,920
appeared in front of me.

38
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,920
She was attracted by the strong blood of the evil wolf.

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,920
She played with my parents' blood without any fear.

40
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,920
She looked so innocent and crazy.

41
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,920
She reminded me of that

42
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,920
reason that I have never been able to live without.

43
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,920
The chief of the chief, Wen Yan Shu.

44
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
It's snowing.

45
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
It's snowing.

46
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
Greetings, chief.

47
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,920
I came to the capital of Jingdu from Zishangzhou.

48
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,920
I found a husband for the late princess of the royal family.

49
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,920
I want this sedan chair.

50
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,920
It's the fastest way to get close to the enemy.

51
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,920
Chief, you can't.

52
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,920
This sedan chair is the wife of Princess Liangyin.

53
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Get out.

54
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,920
Wen Yan Shu was so angry that he was so obsessed with men.

55
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Chi Mingyu collected the corpses everywhere.

56
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,920
He really came.

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,920
Tonight is the best time for me to kill my enemies.

58
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,920
The corpses are in a hurry.

59
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,920
What's your name?

60
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,920
I...

61
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,920
You are my man now.

62
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Princess, you can't.

63
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,920
The dead man's name is...

64
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,920
What's the name of the man I killed?

65
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,920
Wen Yan Shu.

66
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,920
You will decide tonight.

67
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,920
Kneel.

68
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Take it down.

69
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Take it off.

70
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Continue.

71
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,920
I will take it off.

72
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:20,920
The husband of Princess Liangyin is as beautiful as it is said.

73
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,920
The Western Regions men have a different style.

74
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,920
Come on.

75
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
Be generous for me.

76
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Wen Yan Shu.

77
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
You killed my parents.

78
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,920
You and I are in a relationship.

79
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,920
I will let you go.

80
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,920
I will kill you.

81
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,920
I will kill you.

82
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,920
I will let you die.

83
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Oh no, I can't move.

84
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
This is...

85
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,920
Kneel.

86
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
Take it up.

87
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,920
Why is my body out of control?

88
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
I will kill you.

89
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,920
I will kill you.

90
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,920
I will kill you.

91
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,920
I will kill you.

92
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,920
If it weren't for me,

93
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,920
you would have buried the dead man.

94
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
You wanted to kill me?

95
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,920
You are lying.

96
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
Everyone wants to kill you.

97
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,920
I fed you the poison of Shiling Flower.

98
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
I have the dream broken bone.

99
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,920
You can only listen to me.

100
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
If I die,

101
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,920
the poison of Shiling Flower will not be cured.

102
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
It won't take long.

103
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,920
The poison will spread all over your body.

104
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,920
If you want to kill me,

105
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,920
just do it.

106
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,920
Why bother?

107
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Because I like you.

108
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,920
The power of the poison is the strongest power in the world.

109
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,920
If you want to get this power,

110
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,920
you need to use the thousand-four-ears to inject the poison.

111
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Use the love and hatred of people to make them leave the Three-Legend Palace.

112
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,920
The poison of Shiling Flower is the best.

113
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
It's the same as me.

114
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,920
The hatred of the flower is born from hatred.

115
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,920
The hatred of the flower is the best chance to nourish the flower.

116
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
You hate me?

117
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,920
Then you hate me.

118
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,920
I like to see you hate me.

119
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Let me see your hatred.

120
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,920
How much can you be blinded?

121
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
All men are ashamed of their own self-pity.

122
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
If I take this opportunity to be fierce to him,

123
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,920
I can definitely add to his hatred.

124
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,920
I like to teach people who can't be controlled.

125
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,920
I will teach you well.

126
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Enjoy yourself.

127
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,920
Come here.

128
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Stay here. Don't make any noise.

129
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
Don't make any noise.

130
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Uncle,

131
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,920
I heard you took Princess Liangying's husband.

132
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,920
Brother, you really understand.

133
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,920
You know I don't like you calling me that.

134
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,920
We are brothers and sisters.

135
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,920
This will never change.

136
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,920
Uncle, the smell on your body

137
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,920
is enough to destroy all my will.

138
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
Do you smell it?

139
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
What is it?

140
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Don't panic.

141
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,920
This is the scent of the soul we often use.

142
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,920
What's wrong?

143
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,920
Uncle,

144
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,920
you never move like this.

145
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,920
Could it be...

146
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Are you afraid of people?

147
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
No.

148
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,920
I've been sleeping in the ghost house these days.

149
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,920
It's not convenient.

150
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,920
How come you recovered so early?

151
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
Do you need a doctor?

152
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,920
No.

153
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
I'll be fine after a few days.

154
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
You should go.

155
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,920
If anyone finds out, I'll leave.

156
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Princess, didn't you say

157
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
you wanted to do something uncontrollable?

158
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
You...

159
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,920
Chen Wanhou, you should go.

160
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
I'll go.

161
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,920
Take me to the medicine.

162
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
I'll go.

163
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,920
The soul is in the other person's hands.

164
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,920
We can't kill her yet.

165
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,920
But we can get her heart first.

166
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,920
We can cut the cord and kill her.

167
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,920
To solve this problem,

168
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
the only way to get the medicine is to kill her.

169
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,920
Only one way.

170
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,920
She seems to be in a bad mood.

171
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,920
I can't.

172
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
If I can get rid of her today,

173
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,920
I'll have to go to her house.

174
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,920
When she wakes up,

175
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,920
although it's not a dream,

176
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
she still has a grudge against the door.

177
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,920
What is she doing?

178
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Princess Chang is in the same city as you.

179
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,920
How could she die suddenly?

180
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,920
Your blood.

181
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,920
The more I know, the longer it will take.

182
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
Her blood can kill people.

183
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,920
What does she have?

184
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,920
Your Highness, something bad happened.

185
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,920
Princess Qi Yao has taken someone to the Palace.

186
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,920
I'm here.

187
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,920
I'm here.

188
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,920
I'm here.

189
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,920
