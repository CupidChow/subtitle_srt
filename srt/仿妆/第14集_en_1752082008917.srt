1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,640
How long are you going to stand by our side?

2
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,960
You can do that before me.

3
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,460
Mu Heng

4
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:09,960
Mu Heng

5
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,960
Mu Heng

6
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,460
Mu Heng

7
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,760
Mu Heng

8
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Mu Heng

9
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

10
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

11
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

12
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

13
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

14
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

15
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

16
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

17
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

19
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

20
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

22
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

23
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,760
Let go of her!

24
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,320
Are you going to hate me for killing Sin Nomad?

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,760
You can't save me!

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,760
You can't my ego!

27
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,660
Looks like I'm successive.

28
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,560
Next time let's feature together.

29
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:26,760
Is it serious?

30
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:47,800
그래 enormous

31
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,300
Across the inconceivable个署

32
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,240
Gosh

33
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,300
Gosh

34
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,820
There's theove fire

35
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,300
Mother.

36
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,300
Mother.

37
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,300
Mother.

38
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,300
Mother.

39
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,100
Mother.

40
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,300
Uncle.

41
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,600
You're awake.

42
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,500
His Majesty gave me the order

43
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,800
to command the imperial guards to guard the imperial city.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,500
Uncle.

45
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Now I have the right to speak.

46
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,000
I remember you said

47
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
that one day

48
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,000
you hoped I could have power.

49
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,000
You also said...

50
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,000
Where is Mu Han?

51
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,000
Where is Mu Han?

52
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,000
He's dead.

53
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,000
What did you say?

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,500
Impossible.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It was an emergency.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
For a word of advice,

57
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
I made a fire

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and destroyed the camp where the Xuanhuang was.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
No one

60
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,000
could get out of the fire alive.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,500
Impossible.

62
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,000
Uncle.

63
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,000
It's okay.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,500
You have me.

65
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
That's enough.

66
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,000
Impossible.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,500
You lied to me.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,500
I'm going to find him.

69
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,000
I said

70
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,000
he couldn't come back.

71
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
He's dead.

72
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,000
He's dead.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,500
Uncle.

74
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,500
You're too sad.

75
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
I wonder if you will

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,500
shed tears for me when I die.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,500
I won't.

78
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,500
The truth has been revealed.

79
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,000
Your Majesty's edict

80
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
is that Marquis Cheng'en

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,500
is loyal, brave and talented.

82
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,500
We order him to command the army to defend the city.

83
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
The end.

84
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,000
Thank you, father.

85
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
He doesn't deserve to be the commander.

86
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,840
Let's go back.

87
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,320
Mohan...

88
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,720
You came back...

89
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,460
Do not give me the

90
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,460
courtyards

91
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,420
that you trust

92
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,620
Inew

93
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,480
what

94
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,420
what

95
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,480
what

96
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,100
It's... It's... It's a head.

97
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,300
It's a head.

98
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,300
Whose head is it?

99
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:36,900
It's... It's... It's...

100
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,300
It's Prince Xuan Huang's head.

101
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,300
Xiaoshu, what's going on?

102
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,900
Father,

103
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,100
at that time, Mu Han

104
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,900
was in a dilemma

105
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,300
between me and Princess Fuyu

106
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,900
and then Cheng Enhao came

107
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,100
and saved us.

108
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,900
I thought

109
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,300
he would die in that tree.

110
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,700
In your opinion,

111
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,100
how should I reward him?

112
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,500
Mu Han saved you.

113
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,500
Of course, you should reward him.

114
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,500
He shows the style of our family.

115
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,500
Honor should belong to him.

116
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
I will

117
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,900
lead the army to guard the imperial city

118
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,300
and give the head of the family a seat.

119
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,700
Cheng Enhao,

120
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,900
give me 10,000 taels of gold

121
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,500
and a pot of Mingzhu.

122
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

123
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,500
Mu Han,

124
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,100
I didn't know about the fire.

125
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,700
Don't worry, Princess.

126
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,700
Even if I leave the Princess's mansion,

127
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,300
I have the Shiling Flower in my body.

128
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,100
I can't escape the Princess's control.

129
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,300
General Mu,

130
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,700
thank you for saving me.

131
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,300
This jade Buddha was given to me by my mother

132
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,900
on my birthday.

133
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,300
It can keep you safe.

134
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
Now,

135
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,100
I will give it to you.

136
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

137
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

138
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,900
Thank you, Your Majesty.

139
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,100
I will give it to you.

140
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,100
I hope you can open the mansion alone.

141
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,100
General Mu,

142
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,500
I'm just kidding.

143
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,900
Don't mind it.

144
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,500
The second princess's gift is too precious.

145
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100
I can't afford it.

146
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,900
Your Majesty,

147
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,900
since the princess died,

148
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,300
the imperial physician has been coming to the mansion for a check-up every half month.

149
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,300
It's not a big deal.

150
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,100
It's just that I haven't seen her for a while.

151
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,900
Your Majesty,

152
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,700
my sister...

153
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,100
You can rest assured.

154
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,500
I will arrange for you to meet in the future.

155
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

156
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,900
Your Majesty,

157
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,700
is this the newly married young lady's blood,

158
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,700
or warm blood?

159
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,700
How is this girl?

160
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Your Majesty,

161
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,500
I made a trap

162
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,500
according to your order.

163
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,700
But it doesn't seem to be the blood spirit.

164
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,900
I guess there are too few people in the trap.

165
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,900
Then continue to find me.

166
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Yes.

167
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,700
Your Majesty,

168
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,100
I will go to the mansion.

169
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,300
I will go to the mansion.

170
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,300
Yes.

171
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,900
Now the power of the blood spirit is getting weaker.

172
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,300
I have to find a way to make Shu

173
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
be more selfish.

174
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,900
Your Highness,

175
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,900
the general's family is packing

176
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,700
General Mu's luggage.

177
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,700
They said they would move out.

178
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,100
Okay.

179
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,700
You are in such a hurry to go.

180
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,900
Gu Han.

181
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,900
Gu Han.

182
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,100
You are in such a hurry

183
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,100
to find Wen Fu?

184
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,900
Then the princess said

185
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,100
I have no reason to stay in the palace.

186
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,100
You still don't believe me.

187
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,900
Okay.

188
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,900
In that case,

189
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,300
I will leave everything in the palace.

190
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,900
Brother,

191
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,300
why are you here?

192
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,500
Why can't I come?

193
