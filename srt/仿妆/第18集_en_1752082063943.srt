1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,680
Wow,

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I will not be able to replace Uncle Xiao in the Realm of the Ghost.

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Tonight,

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
take him in first.

5
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes.

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Please spare my life, Your Majesty.

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
After Uncle Xiao has given birth,

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
we just need to find a way

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
to bring his child back.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The spirit of the blood spirit

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
can be revived again.

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Please spare my life, Your Majesty.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Please spare my life.

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Please spare my life.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Please spare my life.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Please spare my life.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Please spare my life.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Please spare my life.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Please spare my life.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't let him shut up.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Please spare my life.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Please spare my life.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Did you make these?

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Your Majesty,

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I just made these for the prayer.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Prayer?

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You want His Majesty to discover your existence.

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Take your mother and son out of here.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I dare not.

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I know my mistake.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Please forgive us, Your Majesty and the Second Princess.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The medicine for the books.

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And a note.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's really good.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Since you're not young anymore,

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
you should go to the night court

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
with your mother

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
to do more hard work.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't learn these every day.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You won't have any bad thoughts.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I and Xuan'er

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
must keep our words in mind.

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We've been in the night court for a long time.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
We won't take a step out of the palace.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
If anything happens,

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
you can kill me.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Remember what you said today.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I've just realized

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
that I'm trapped in an endless abyss

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I can't sleep even for a moment

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm left alone in the mortal world

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Love and hate

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Can't escape from the fate

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This abyss

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The abyss

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Who is it?

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's me, Your Highness.

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Bailing?

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You're still alive.

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's great.

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What...

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What's going on?

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm fine.

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Don't be angry.

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Go away.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I want to be saved.

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You'll know it in the future.

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's Uncle Wenyuan who saved me.

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I've been in the yard of the city.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
After I recovered, I went out to see you.

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But I found that the crown prince sent her to the wedding.

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
She's still soft-hearted.

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Your Highness, I saw Wang Qing, the maid of the royal family,

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
in the yard of the city.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The dog emperor ordered

80
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
that the royal family of Zishang was all dead.

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I can't live without her.

82
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm in pain.

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If it weren't for the princess,

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm afraid I would have died.

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
She didn't participate in the massacre.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
She was just a pawn.

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
She really didn't participate?

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Absolutely.

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I dare not lie to you.

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The crown prince of Zhuyan and the princess are getting married.

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
There are still some days.

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
If we go to Zhuyan now,

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
it's too late.

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So what if I take her away?

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There are hundreds of lives in the royal family.

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I can't revenge.

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Why should I drag her into the abyss?

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Marquis Cheng'en Hechuan

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
tried to destroy the marriage.

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He was not happy.

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He demoted her to a commoner.

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
She will never be allowed to enter the palace.

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Do you know how painful she is?

104
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You...

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Now you are afraid?

106
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
She is so afraid of painful people.

107
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You not only killed her,

108
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
but also ruined her face.

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I want you to pay for everything.

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Marquis Cheng'en

111
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
No.

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What's your name?

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I am Mu Jing.

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I am old.

115
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I am dead.

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I am going to save Shi Yan.

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Brother An Ning

118
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I am An Ning.

119
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
An Ning

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I am An Ning.

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
An Ning

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I am An Ning.

123
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,360
The day the Purple

124
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
House was destroyed,

125
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I swore to kill the enemy

126
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
with my life.

127
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Now it's your turn.

128
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You didn't die.

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No wonder you forced me to marry Shu

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and made me a commoner.

131
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It was all your plan.

132
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I should have killed you

133
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
if I knew you were in the Purple Palace.

134
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But you don't have that chance now.

135
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Kneel down and beg them.

136
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Kneel down?

137
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Impossible.

138
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
If you don't kneel down,

139
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
next time

140
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I will see your legs.

141
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I should have kneeled down to them.

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
No way.

143
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The rebels are all dead.

144
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
They deserve to die.

145
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Rebels?

146
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
My father was loyal

147
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
for so many years.

148
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But he changed his name to rebel.

149
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You deserve to die.

150
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He deserves to die.

151
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Stop.

152
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Because my mother is low-ranking,

153
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
she doesn't recognize me.

154
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
She thinks we are all liars

155
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and are bullied.

156
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What do you think I have?

157
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Give me the sword.

158
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Watch out.

159
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Can you walk?

160
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Gou Gou,

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
this is for you.

162
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Thank you for saving me.

163
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I will bring it to you every day.

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I will come to play with you.

165
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's you today.

166
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's because my mother did something wrong.

167
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This heartless son of a bandit

168
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
made us both die.

169
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He drove me out of the mansion

170
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and killed my mother.

171
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So,

172
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I decided

173
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
to kill this heartless son of a bandit

174
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
in the next life.

175
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And,

176
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
do you know

177
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
that I planned

178
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
the sin of the son of a bandit?

179
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I saw him die in front of me.

180
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Maybe

181
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
it was not a dream.

182
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Do you know

183
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
how happy I was?

184
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I finally avenged

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
the ten years of the bandit.

186
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He Chuo, I will kill you now.

187
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I asked thousands of times

188
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
who was writing

189
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
our wishes.

190
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Open your eyes

191
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and your smile

192
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
is like water flowing.

193
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The blue sea and the sky

194
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I wish to spend my life with you.

195
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I do not fear the wind

196
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and the clouds between us.

197
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Time changes with the sky.

198
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
If we can be together,

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
we will be together forever.

200
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The deep wish between us

201
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
is like a dream.

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The heaven and the earth

203
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
are not yet changed.

204
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I will be with you

205
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:14,000
in the next life.

206
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Open your eyes

207
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and your smile

208
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
is like water flowing.

209
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The blue sea and the sky

210
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I wish to spend my life with you.

211
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The blue sea and the sky

212
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I wish to spend my life with you.

213
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I do not fear the wind

214
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
and the clouds between us.

215
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Time changes with the sky.

216
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
If we can be together,

217
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
we will be together forever.

218
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The deep wish between us

219
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
is like a dream.

220
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The heaven and the earth

221
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
are not yet changed.

222
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I will be with you

223
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:37,000
in the next life.

224
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Thank you for watching!
