1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,240
The Ontact Hotel

2
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,860
entertainers

3
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,140
you dare snatch your life

4
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,740
how dare you come out to see me

5
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,400
You have worshiped a noble

6
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,140
I will accept it

7
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,840
since it's a princess

8
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,940
you friends

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,520
Give me the man you took from me.

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,560
Man?

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,840
These are all the men I took from you.

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,480
I wonder which one Princess Ji Yao is talking about.

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,640
Of course,

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,320
it's my sister's husband,

15
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,240
Mu Han.

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,800
Mu Han?

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,480
You were tired of playing with me just now.

18
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,280
Now,

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,360
you're resting in the side hall.

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,320
You!

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,800
You're shameless!

22
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,440
I'll kill you!

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,160
How dare a princess

24
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,080
talk to me like that?

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,720
You deserve to be punished for your crime.

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,040
Wei Yan Shun, I'll kill you!

27
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,680
Ji Yao!

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,520
Princess Liang Ying and Ji Yao

29
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,920
are twin sisters.

30
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,480
Now that they've died,

31
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,440
Ji Yao is always sad and sad.

32
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,440
Please forgive her for her offence.

33
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,960
But a husband

34
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,560
should repay her with love and etiquette.

35
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,800
Since you're here,

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,080
why are you hiding?

37
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,200
Come out.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,840
Don't worry.

39
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,920
Even if she's a dog in my mansion,

40
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,600
no one will take her away.

41
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,160
Ji Yao,

42
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,240
isn't it better to leave such a character

43
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,320
to the dead

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,360
than to leave it to the dead?

45
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,880
The real person is dead.

46
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,680
What do you think?

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,040
Come on!

48
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,600
Burn this famous husband to death!

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,600
And bury my sister's soul!

50
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,320
Who dares to speak in my place?

51
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,080
You deserve to be punished too.

52
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,720
You!

53
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,760
Hold me.

54
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,280
Take care.

55
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,320
I won't see you off.

56
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,880
Wen Yan Shu,

57
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,440
wait for me.

58
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,920
Yan Shu.

59
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,440
He's always trying to steal the princess's husband.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,640
He's always trying to get the court officials to agree with him.

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,720
If His Majesty doesn't agree,

62
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,920
it'll be hard to win the hearts of people.

63
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,560
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,640
Greetings, Father.

65
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,880
Shu is here.

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,400
Your Majesty.

67
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,600
I heard what you said just now.

68
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,680
Father, you don't know me yet.

69
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,800
You finally met someone you like

70
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,320
and fell in love with him.

71
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,440
Aren't you worried

72
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,360
about having a grandson?

73
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,000
Father.

74
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,480
I believe you.

75
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,600
Then make up for your mistake

76
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,680
and find another husband

77
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,400
who's a good match for you.

78
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,440
Send him to Yuan.

79
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,240
Thank you, Father.

80
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,040
Liu Wan,

81
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,600
ask He Chuan to bring Mu Han here.

82
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,600
He'll be punished according to the order of the famous husband.

83
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,640
He'll be punished in the name of the slave.

84
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,400
It's an explanation for Yuan.

85
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,560
You bastard.

86
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,480
Today,

87
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,280
you'll die.

88
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,440
Are you doing this

89
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,120
because you're afraid that I'll take your place?

90
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,200
Killing me will only offend your backer.

91
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,640
Do you dare to do that?

92
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,480
I'll do it.

93
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,080
According to the law of Lingzhao,

94
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,720
the death penalty

95
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,480
should be given on the prisoner's face.

96
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,960
I can give it to you

97
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,440
if you want.

98
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,080
Remember this feeling.

99
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,200
This is just the beginning.

100
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,600
It's really just the beginning.

101
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,320
Her Highness!

102
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,400
What has this happened?

103
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,260
Your Highness!

104
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,240
This is the famous husband

105
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,160
that Your Highness was talking about.

106
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,920
Antonio de Rome

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,240
has brought him to terminology.

108
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,520
What a terrible guy you are!

109
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,480
Attention for the viewing.

110
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,600
Prime Minister is holding an opportunity

111
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,400
because he lonely he Latin lady.

112
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,320
And he submitted to the royal guard as a Japan brother to bid him farewell.

113
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,440
Why does he have to do this?

114
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,320
So to speak,

115
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,060
Zhen Ni, you won't kill on us

116
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,000
You really Ð²ÐµÐ´ÑŒ him

117
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,920
I will vow to revenge

118
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,100
Just watch

119
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,100
Zhenglehong

120
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,900
Ding Yuyi

121
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,180
Cheng Taishou

122
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,520
Pick one

123
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,160
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,240
Uncle,

125
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,600
look.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,200
I brought you something.

127
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,800
This is the powder of Xiaoyao.

128
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,400
It's colorless and tasteless.

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,440
It can make people lose their inner strength

130
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,880
and die of an explosion.

131
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,720
It can make people can't figure out the reason.

132
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,600
And this.

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,440
The Jade Vest of the Red Blood Horse Brain.

134
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,200
I ordered people to work hard

135
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,280
to get the blood of the red blood horse.

136
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,920
Its color is pure.

137
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,720
It's like fresh blood.

138
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,720
Take it away.

139
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,160
I don't like this color.

140
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,120
Are you kidding?

141
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,640
I remember you like red the most.

142
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,480
I was lost in the mansion of Prince Zi Shang.

143
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,240
You're obsessed with blood.

144
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,920
Really.

145
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,000
You're so unique.

146
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,040
Wait.

147
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,640
How could know I like him so?

148
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,480
Young Master Jin,

149
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,280
where is Real Manor?

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,160
It's right next to you.

151
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,880
There's a place right next to the place next to it.

152
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,400
A place very close to my home.

153
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,520
This place is the only place

154
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,720
where I can have love and food.

155
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,000
I said I'm fresh.

156
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,480
Domesticated.

157
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,120
Rom hvis vous n'avezchoui,

158
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,320
do it.

159
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,160
The woman I saved

160
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,680
ready climbs the stairs.

161
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,000
TheðŸ‘Œ

162
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,440
Yi'er is valuable.

163
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,480
depend on wind growth.

164
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,620
The driving-hÃªu of the princess solo,

165
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,960
others praise,

166
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,480
how could they protest,

167
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,640
but that emperor.

168
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,700
Don't go to meet fate.

169
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
What's going on?

170
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,700
What's going on?

171
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,700
What's going on?

172
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,700
Hurry up.

173
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,700
One day,

174
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,700
I'll let you pay for your hero.

175
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,700
Qian Song has a problem.

176
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,700
Could it be...

177
00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:00,700
Asked a thousand times, who is writing the wish.

178
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:07,700
Open your eyes, your smile, like water flowing.

179
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:16,700
The blue sea and the sky, I wish to spend the rest of my life with you.

180
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,700
I don't want to be separated from you.

181
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,700
Time changes with the sky.

182
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,700
If we can be together forever,

183
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,700
we can be together forever.

184
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:40,700
The wish of the two of us, why is it so far away?

185
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,700
The wish of the two of us, why is it so far away?

186
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,700
If we can be together forever,

187
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:56,700
we can be together forever.

188
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,700
The wish of the two of us, why is it so far away?

189
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:35,700
Open your eyes, your smile, like water flowing.

190
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:42,700
The blue sea and the sky, I wish to spend the rest of my life with you.

191
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,700
I don't want to be separated from you.

192
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,700
Time changes with the sky.

193
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,700
If we can be together forever,

194
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,700
we can be together forever.

195
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,700
The wish of the two of us, why is it so far away?

196
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,700
The wish of the two of us, why is it so far away?

197
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,700
The wish of the two of us, why is it so far away?

198
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:19,700
Let me be with you.

199
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:41,700
The Long Ballad
