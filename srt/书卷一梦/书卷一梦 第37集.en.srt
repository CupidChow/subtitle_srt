00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,940
[Episode 37]

3
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,000
Wait for me outside.

4
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,260
Yes, Your Highness.

5
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,880
Xiaoyu, you're here.

6
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,710
Come, come, come,

7
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,720
have a seat.

8
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,960
His Majesty was poisoned,

9
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,220
and Nan Rui was framed—

10
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,710
these were all your doing, weren't they?

11
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,770
You actually harmed innocent people

12
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,440
just to make the iconic scenes
happen sooner.

13
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,540
If a man wants to fill his belly,

14
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,470
he must plant crops in the fields.

15
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,600
As spring turns to autumn,

16
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,079
seeds grow into fruit

17
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,520
and are eventually harvested.

18
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,050
This is the way of the world.

19
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,120
Just like this sweet potato—

20
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,530
do you feel cruel

21
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,960
when you eat it?

22
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,880
So, in your eyes, human lives

23
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,110
are no more than sweet potatoes?

24
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,690
You really are absurd.

25
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,590
They're just a bunch of

26
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,910
fictional characters I created myself.

27
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,630
How much more precious

28
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,079
can their lives be
than this sweet potato...

29
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,800
Even if they're just fictional characters,

30
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,650
you created them yourself.

31
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,190
Didn't you invest your emotions

32
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,560
and effort?

33
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,030
On a screen,

34
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,590
they're nothing more than

35
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,320
lines of code—easily edited
and deleted at will.

36
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,660
Today I kill one emperor,

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,520
and tomorrow I can write 100,

38
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,310
1,000,

39
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,240
or 10,000.

40
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,210
Song Xiaoyu,

41
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,190
you're the one who's
never been clear-headed.

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,840
How are the people in this world

43
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,680
any different from the Barbie dolls

44
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,430
you grew tired of as a child?

45
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,710
They're all fake.

46
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,120
I really misjudged you.

47
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,530
In the real world,

48
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,240
you're a crap screenwriter who doesn't

49
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,750
cherish the characters you create.

50
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,820
And here,

51
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,910
you're just a lunatic who kills
innocent people!

52
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,750
So what?

53
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,680
I have the power to kill

54
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,000
and the power to save.

55
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,890
Do you want to know

56
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,000
how Nan Heng got sick?

57
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,360
Wasn't it...

58
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,280
you who poisoned him?

59
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,520
Me? Poison him?

60
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,360
I wouldn't bother

61
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,690
with such dirty tricks.

62
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,600
Do you really think

63
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,030
those three rules I told you

64
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,310
are the only ones in this scripted world?

65
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:10,960
Let me tell you,

66
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,010
in this scripted world,

67
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,010
there are four...

68
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,720
there are three rules.

69
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,399
There are other rules?

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,360
They're related to Nan Heng's illness?

71
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,240
Didn't he tell you the truth?

72
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,630
Fine.

73
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,270
Then I'll tell you.

74
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,410
The fourth rule is

75
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,360
that those who change the iconic scenes

76
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,760
will suffer backlash.

77
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,070
Nan Heng...

78
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,680
What will happen to him?

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,390
If the plot continues to deviate
from its original course,

80
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,360
he'll only grow weaker and weaker

81
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,750
until he dies.

82
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,750
Song Xiaoyu,

83
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,510
don't you love him

84
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,280
and this scripted world?

85
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,420
So, tell me,

86
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,800
are you going to go against
the plots I wrote

87
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,070
and watch Nan Heng die,

88
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,310
or help me complete all the iconic scenes

89
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,000
and return to the real world together?

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,530
That way, he can still live.

91
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,170
Offer incense?

92
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,800
Today's the first day of the month,

93
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,830
an auspicious day.

94
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,040
To pray for a happy marriage
for Miss Yiting,

95
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,360
Madam got up early and took her

96
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,560
to the Temple of the God of Matchmaking.

97
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,490
The Temple of the God of Matchmaking?

[Outskirts; Temple of
the God of Matchmaking]

100
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,159
Hurry up.

101
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:35,830
See?

102
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,490
There are so many people here.

103
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,560
So great.

104
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,850
Come on, come on.

105
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,830
Mom, I told you,

106
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,820
if you want to pray, do it yourself.

107
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,480
I don't believe in this stuff.

108
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,600
A happy marriage depends on

109
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,680
how you get along and work things out.

110
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,950
I can't even clearly say

111
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,390
what my future with him will be like,

112
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,390
so why put all our hope

113
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,780
in something so intangible?

114
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,620
Watch your words.

115
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,690
The God of Matchmaking is watching above.

116
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,810
Show some respect.

117
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,950
Seriously.

118
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,300
God of Matchmaking,

119
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,490
this devotee has only this daughter.

120
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,180
I vow three years of my life

121
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,720
in exchange for my daughter's
lifelong peace

122
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,000
and a happy marriage.

123
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,120
God of Matchmaking, please bless her.

124
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,250
God of Matchmaking, please bless her.

125
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,880
Hurry.

126
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,750
What are you doing?

127
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,560
Why are you standing there like a statue?

128
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,130
Hurry up and make a wish.

129
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,510
Quick, quick, quick.

130
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,420
Please bless my daughter,
God of Matchmaking.

131
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,530
God of Matchmaking, please bless
my daughter's marriage.

132
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,460
God of Matchmaking, please bless
my daughter

133
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,409
with a happy marriage.

134
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:34,050
Mom.

135
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,800
Please bless her.

136
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,360
Just a few days ago,

137
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,720
you were criticizing Shangguan He
like crazy.

138
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,540
You said his eyes were too flirtatious,

139
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,240
destined to take concubines in the future.

140
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,120
You also said

141
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,720
that his philtrum was a bit too short,

142
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,920
which meant he'd bring
misfortune to his wife.

143
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
You even said that I chose my own husband,

144
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,070
and that if I ever regretted it,

145
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,430
you'd let me cry myself to death
without caring.

146
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,240
What?

147
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,100
Why are you praying so hard today?

148
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,430
What nonsense are you talking about?

149
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,630
Come here, come here.

150
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,460
Show some respect to
the God of Matchmaking.

151
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,390
God of Matchmaking,

152
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,120
please don't take offense.

153
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,810
Please don't mishear.

154
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
What I meant was

155
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,360
that my husband at home
has flirtatious eyes

156
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
and a short philtrum.

157
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,000
I really wasn't talking about
my daughter's husband.

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,640
Please don't get it wrong.

159
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
Please, God of Matchmaking,

160
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,800
please.

161
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,400
I'll kowtow to you three times.

162
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,200
God of Matchmaking, please bless
my daughter.

163
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,460
Please bless my daughter
with a happy marriage.

164
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,560
Please bless and protect my Yiting
for her entire life.

165
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,690
Madam!

166
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,310
Please.

167
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,040
I've bought the Lovers' Knots.

168
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,360
Great.

169
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,120
Hurry up,

170
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,650
tie them up in the branches.

171
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,510
Hang it higher.

172
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,540
The higher, the luckier.

173
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,120
Why are you so clumsy?

174
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,720
Come on, come on.

175
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,510
Give it to me.

176
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,510
I'll do it myself.

177
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,950
Seriously.

178
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,720
Hang it here.

179
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,659
Here.

180
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,630
This doesn't mean that I believe in
this sort of thing.

181
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,980
But since I'm getting married,

182
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,050
everything must be done properly,

183
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,750
and I have to experience everything.

184
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,600
Good girl.

185
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,120
And these,

186
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,720
tell me,

187
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,180
where should we hang them?

188
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,430
Fortunately, there aren't too many people
praying today.

189
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,560
Everything worked out just as I hoped.

190
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,549
In the future,

191
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,130
I hope that God blesses you

192
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,530
and lets you live happily.

193
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,600
Mr. Feng, wake up.

194
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,460
Time to go home.

195
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,550
Mr. Feng?

196
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,230
Mr. Feng?

197
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,500
Mr. Feng!

198
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,440
Mom,

199
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,640
something's wrong!

200
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,240
What's wrong?

201
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,550
What do you want?

202
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,440
I know it's very hard for you

203
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,210
to make this decision.

204
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,810
But if you continue to resist stubbornly,

205
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,830
I can only take action against
the Song family.

206
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,310
For example, your sister.

207
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,820
What do you want?

208
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,910
Your Grace!

209
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,790
Is this from Rong Hua?

210
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,440
Yes.

211
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,600
What did you do to Yiting?

212
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,750
Why don't you open it and see?

213
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,540
Now, it's just one of her fingers,

214
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,040
but whether Song Yiting lives or dies

215
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,200
in the future

216
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,670
is up to you.

217
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,470
If you dare to lay a finger on them again,

218
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,240
I'll kill you first.

219
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,230
The north wind is strong today.

220
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,020
The scene of the "Either-Or Selection"
at the city tower

221
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,620
must be quite the spectacle.

222
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,630
Mother,

223
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,910
you've been taking care of
His Majesty all morning.

224
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,200
Let me handle things here.

225
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,320
Go back and rest.

226
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,520
The royal physician said

227
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,470
that your father

228
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,150
likely won't make it through this time.

229
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,720
I just want to

230
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,150
look at him properly once more.

231
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,510
That way,

232
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,080
if something really happens...

233
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,080
when I think of him

234
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,600
in the future,

235
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,620
it won't only be those years

236
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,190
when we glared at each other
with cold resentment

237
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,120
and endless disputes.

238
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,680
Your Majesty.

239
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,240
Your Majesty!

240
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,030
I'll go find Physician Qin.

241
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,790
Okay.

242
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,440
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

243
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,790
I've already sent people to find
the antidote.

244
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,000
You will be fine.

245
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,770
I suspect

246
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,910
that all of this was orchestrated
by Chu Guihong.

247
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,120
I will keep my guard up

248
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,400
and find out the truth.

249
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,630
I also beg Your Majesty

250
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,890
to send the Xuanjia Army back
to the capital to deal with it.

251
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:02,850
Heng.

252
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,330
Get up first.

253
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

254
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,450

00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,240

Come on.

Yes.

259
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,280
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

260
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,240
I've arranged everything

261
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,550
to protect Rui.

262
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,320
I also promise you

263
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,030
that I'll protect him with all I have.

264
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,130
I won't let anything happen to him.

Yes, Your Majesty?

267
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,950
Rui never addresses me

as "Your Majesty."

269
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,630
Don't let me hear you

00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,230
call me "Father" ever again!

271
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,840
It was my fault.

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,870
Can you...

273
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,320
Can you...

today is your birthday.

284
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,200
This snow tiger

285
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,750
must be a birthday gift from
the Seventh Prince.

286
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,670
Worthless and ignorant,

287
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,960
only knowing how to mess around.

288
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,910
Go back now.

289
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,750
Yes.

Forget it.

Since it's a gift from him,

00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,750
take it inside.

293

Your Highness,

294
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,710
are you alright?

295
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,120
Didn't I tell you to protect Nan Rui?

296
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,310
Why are you here?

297

It's the Crown Princess.

298
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,600
She went to Lord Qianyu's manor.

299
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,840
I don't know what she said to Lord Qianyu,

300
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,390
and she didn't let the Xuanjia Army
follow her.

301
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,720
After that, she left

302
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,870
the manor alone with Lord Qianyu

303
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,260
and had the Xuanjia Army bring this back.

304
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,720
Nan Heng,

305
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,140
you lied to me again.

In the next life,

307
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,860

310
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,240
Go and gather 200 Xuanjia Army soldiers

311
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,120
to follow me to the city tower.

don't blame me.

If I weren't in such a hurry to get back,

I wouldn't have treated you this way.

Rather than be held hostage

to ask the Nightwalker to help
Yunlong and Shanhu.

00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,870
under these circumstances.

517
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,200
Murdered the Emperor and his brother?

518
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,840
What are you talking about?

519
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,160
Before I came,

520
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,880
I had someone finish

521
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,270
today's Emperor's Daily Diary.

522
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,660
"His Majesty, aged and weary,

523
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,720
reminiscing about the late Empress,

524
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,440
chose to appoint a new heir

525
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,880
and passed the throne to
the Eighteenth Prince, Nan Rui.

526
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,310
But the Crown Prince, Nan Heng,
grew resentful

527
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,770
and poisoned His Majesty,

528
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,040
framing Nan Rui as the culprit."

529
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,410
Your Ladyship, do you think

530
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,960
this will make for

531
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,110
a fine chapter

532
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,800
in future history books?

533
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,640
You want to rebel.

534
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,570
Heng will never
let you get away with this!

535
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,830
The Xuanjia Army is still at the border,

536
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,430
while the capital is guarded
by my Qianyu Army.

537
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,010
Your beloved son

538
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,240
is about to die on the city tower.

539
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,750
How will he stop me?

540
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,350
300 Xuanjia Army soldiers in the capital

541
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,520
against 5,000 Qianyu Army soldiers.

542
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,990
Even if Nan Heng had nine lives,

543
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,640
he wouldn't survive this.

544
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,400
Xuanjia Army!

545
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,240
Go up and save them!

546
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,110
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

547
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:04,880
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

548
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,590
Fugui!

549
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,810
Take her away first!

550
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,720
No!

551
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,640
Listen to me!

552
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,270
Fugui, hurry!

553
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,360
I can't leave.

554
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,510
If we live, we live together.

555
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,970
If we die, we die together!

556
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,480
Protect her.

557
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,960
Yes.

558
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,590
Nan Heng.

559
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,350
Stop the Xuanjia Army climbing up.

560
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,080
Cut off their reinforcements!

561
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,310
Shangguan He!

562
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,000
Shangguan He.

563
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,020
Shangguan He.

564
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,000
Shangguan He,

565
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,130
how bad is it?

566
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,810
I wanted to be the hero and save you...

567
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,160
but I didn't expect to let you

568
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,620
see me at my most pathetic.

569
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,020
I made a mistake.

570
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,070
At a time like this,

571
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,780
you still have the mood to joke?

572
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,440
Let's go.

573
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,270
Let's go home.

574
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,350
Let's go!

575
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,290
Song Yiting, listen carefully.

576
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,570
In the future, whoever you choose,

577
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,020
he can't be worse than me.

578
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,960
Fugui!

579
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:04,920
Yiting!

580
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,990
Song Yiting,

581
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,660
there are things

582
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,630
that should be initiated by men.

583
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,580
Like being the first to ask

584
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,630
and the first to fall in love.

585
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,990
The more you do,

586
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,400
the less there is left

587
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,200
for me to do.

588
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,720
But luckily,

589
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,030
there's still one last thing I can do,

590
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,980
and that's to use my life

591
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,850
to protect you well.

592
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,100
Shangguan He.

593
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,580
Shangguan He!

594
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,310
Shangguan He!

595
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,750
Shangguan He!

596
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,440
Yiting.

597
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,550
Shangguan He!

598
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,160
Fugui!

599
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:54,850
Take her away!

600
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,240
Yes.

601
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,000
Let go of me!

602
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,620
Nan Heng!

603
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,010
Nan Heng!

604
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,260
Nan Heng!

605
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,200
See?

606
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
When the female lead is in danger...

607
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,040
the male lead comes to save her.

608
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,240
Nan Heng.

609
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,910
Nan Heng.

610
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,590
Nan Heng.

611
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,830
You're right.

612
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,800
You're the male lead.

613
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,340
So you'll be fine,

614
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,160
right?

615
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,520
Nan Heng.

616
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,720
You can't die.

617
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,800
Do you hear me?

618
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,790
Do you hear me?

619
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,440
You can't die!

620
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,870
Do you hear me?

621
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,510
Answer me!

622
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,770
Do you hear me?

623
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,590
I hear you.

624
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:44,970
I hear you.

625
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,000
Don't worry.

626
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,960
I'm your male lead.

627
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,660
I won't die.

628
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,370
Nan Heng.

629
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,450
Nan Heng.

630
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,390
Hang in there, okay?

631
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,400
Listen to me,

632
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,830
hang in there, okay?

633
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,290
You can't die, Nan Heng.

634
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,750
You're the only one I have in this world.

635
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,040
Do you know that?

636
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,590
I have no one else.

637
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,580
You really are... all I have left.

638
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,400
Please don't die.

639
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm begging you.

640
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:31,610
Okay?

641
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:38,610
I...

642
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:39,750
I...

643
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,650
Nan Heng...

644
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,650
Nan Heng.

645
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,780
Nan Heng!

646
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,590
Only...

647
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,130
only by dying...

648
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,050
can I prove

649
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,900
that I'm not a fictional character

650
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,160
that...

651
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,220
I've truly lived.

652
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,570
Song...

653
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,990
Song Yimeng...

654
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,460
Thank...

655
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,990
thank you.

00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,430
we'll face it together.

690
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,510
Whatever you worry about,

691
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,590
whatever you fear,

692
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,980
I'll solve it all for you one by one.

693
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,020
Nan Heng,

694
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,800
from now on,

695
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,210
you're not allowed to hide anything
from me anymore.

696
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,710
If I catch you

697
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,070
lying to me again,

698
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,940
you'll be kneeling

699
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,150
on a washboard for the rest of your life.

700
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,960
Okay.

701
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,330
I'll listen to you in everything you say.

Song Yimeng!

724
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,110
Nan Heng is dead!

725
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,950
If you choose the righteous path

726
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,280
and testify against him for killing
the Emperor and his brother,

727
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,000
I will spare your life!

728
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,230
Mountains weren't born with peaks,

joy or sorrow,

732
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,930
I have my own hands and feet.

733
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,710
I can trample through thorns

734
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,110
or raise my sword to challenge
the heavens.

735
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
Why should the outcome

736
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,460
of my life be in someone else's hands?

737
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,550
If there is really some rule‑maker

738
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,550
pulling strings behind the scenes,

739
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,400
then the one holding the pen

740
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,670
should be me.

741
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,070
Nan Heng,

742
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,410
thank you.

743
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,350
In the past,

744
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,710
I've run away many times.

745
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,270
But today,

746
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,410
I want to hold everything

747
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,090
in my own hands, just like you.

748
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,090
Even if it costs me my life.

749
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,670
Nan Heng...
