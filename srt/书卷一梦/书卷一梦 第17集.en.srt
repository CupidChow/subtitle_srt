[Episode 17]

3
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,920
What is it?

4
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,850
What's going on?

5
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,960
I heard your Chief Master's called
something like "Liu"?

6
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,800
I'm known as "Thriver" on the streets,

7
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,960
specializing in dealing with these famous
troublemakers in the martial world.

8
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,900
Hurry up

9
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,880
and tell him to come out to see me!

10
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,190
Boss.

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,640
This woman is so pretty.

12
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,960
Miss.

13
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,680
Do I look like your future husband?

14
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,820
More like a fly.

15
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,520
Miss.

16
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,000
So beautiful.

17
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,000
Boss!

18
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,870
Boss!

19
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,210
Are you okay, Boss?

20
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,430
Capture that woman!

21
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,120
Yes!

22
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,960
Stop!

23
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,590
Phantom dragon lurks in the black market.

24
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,380
Radiant lanterns
illuminate the Nightwalkers.

The flute.

32
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,390
Are you the one who's called something
like "Liu?"

33
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,960
On the streets, I go by the name...

34
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,840
Sir,

35
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,840
you ruined our stage.

36
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,520
The fine is

37
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,280
200 taels of silver.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
On the streets, I go by the name...

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,840
Miss,

40
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,280
you broke our wine jar.

41
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,250
The fine is 50 taels of silver.

42
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,560
But this gentleman

43
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,960
disturbed this young lady,

44
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,240
which was truly uncalled for.

45
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,430
In my opinion,

46
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,140
the fine for the young lady

47
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,280
should be put on this gentleman's tab.

48
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,079
Please pay.

49
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,280
On the streets, I go by the name...

50
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,480
Master Thief Shanhu.

51
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,820
It seems this crappy ax

52
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,130
is worth some pennies.

53
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,240
How about

54
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,330
giving it to the young lady

55
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,860
to calm her nerves?

56
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,160
Look.

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,310
Your ax has startled this
young lady again.

58
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,840
Kneel and plead guilty now.

59
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,430
You darn "Liu" something...

60
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,360
Speedy Yunlong.

61
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,190
Even your boss is already on his knees.

62
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,590
What are you waiting for?

63
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,720
Peonies?

64
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,330
Tacky.

65
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,630
Lotuses?

66
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,630
Mediocre.

67
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,240
Roses?

68
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,070
Dull.

69
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,600
A fine sword suits a
noble gentleman;

70
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,720
and jade bamboo is a gift for
a beautiful lady.

71
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,680
Miss, may I ask

72
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,590
your gracious name?

73
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,330
No need for honorifics.

74
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,680
I live in the west of the city

75
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,430
outside the Shiqiao Gate, at the Duke of
Guangping's Residence,

76
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,630
who's Left Vice Minister of the Imperial Secretariat
and concurrently Minister of War.

77
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,040
My name is Song Yiting.

78
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,400
Chu Guihong.

79
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,970
Since you had the guts to shoot him,

80
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,560
how come you don't have the guts
to clean up the mess?

81
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,680
And you come here now, expecting me

82
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,280
to clean up this mess for you?

83
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,240
Well...

84
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,040
Father.

85
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,800
You know,

86
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,630
with Heng's skills,

87
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,270
there's no way he would've failed to
dodge that arrow.

88
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,510
He must have done it on purpose.

89
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,870
He... He had long planned to kick Guihong
out of the capital.

90
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,480
Don't you fall into his trap.

91
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,240
Shut up!

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,380
You useless thing.

93
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,620
Your Majesty.

94
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,190
I am to blame for what happened
at the stables.

95
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,160
But the Seventh Prince

96
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,800
networks with top officials at court,

97
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,510
forges alliances with underworld
forces outside the court,

98
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,430
has control over the major force of
the Xuanjia Army,

99
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,800
and even seeks to strengthen his power

100
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
through a marriage alliance
with the Song family.

101
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,510
Such treacherous ambitions are
blatantly obvious.

102
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,910
Please make a wise decision, Your Majesty.

103
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,280
Your Majesty.

104
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,310
Your Majesty!

105
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:26,950
Your Majesty.

106
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,410
Chancellor Gao and the others have
arrived at the palace gate.

107
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,360
Are they trying to stage a coup?

108
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,970
What do you gentlemen intend to do?

109
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,930
Don't stir up trouble here!

110
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,440
If you anger His Majesty,

111
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,460
I'm afraid you'll face punishment!

112
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,159
Chu Guihong shot the prince,

113
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,390
which is unforgivable.

114
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,600
I, Yao Qian,

115
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,970
beg Your Majesty to judge wisely.

116
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,760
Your Majesty, please judge wisely!

117
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,430
If you keep sighing like that,

118
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,230
you might just sigh my soul away.

119
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,390
Help me up.

120
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,020
Be gentler, okay?

121
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,240
Your Highness,

122
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,659
what a smart tactic.

123
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,600
You used me to irritate Chu Guihong again.

124
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Now His Majesty is furious in the palace,

125
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,750
and you've made a stir
in the entire court.

126
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,280
Don't you think you've gone too far
this time?

127
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,750
Didn't you say my tactic was
old-fashioned?

128
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,040
As long as it works, right?

129
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,830
You...

130
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,920
Only someone like you

131
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,270
would come up with a move that
does even more harm

132
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,930
to yourself than to the enemy.

133
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,630
If I didn't risked myself

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,070
to make Chu Guihong commit
a grave mistake,

135
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,390
how could you break off the
engagement with him?

136
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,560
And I'm telling you,

137
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,390
when they come in a while,

138
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,800
be clear in your mind about

139
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,190
what's safe to say and what's not.

140
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,950
We are on the same boat.

141
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,390
I'm telling you too.

142
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,920
Breaking off the engagement

143
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,000
and marrying you

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,400
are two separate things.

145
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,430
You're the God of Death.

146
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,530
You must keep your word.

147
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Don't try to play dirty, you hear me?

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,289
Do you hear me?

149
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,200
It hurts.

150
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,030
Do you hear me?

151
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,150
Who's the one playing dirty?

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,120
Your Highness, now you know
what pain feels like?

153
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,200
Then why didn't you dodge

154
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,330
that arrow just now?

155
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,240
I...

156
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,960
His Majesty is here.

157
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,010
Your Highness.

158
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,790
Your Highness, are you alright?

159
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,590
Why are you bleeding so much?

160
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,630
Hang in there.

161
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,960
The imperial physician will be here
in no time.

162
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,750
My Lady.

163
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,960
Mother.

164
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,440
Why are you bleeding so much again?

165
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,750
I-It was her.

166
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,790
Just now, she...

167
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,440
My Lady.

168
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,240
It's all my fault.

169
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,790
Sorry for making you worry.

170
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,670
Good girl.

171
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,350
You're just too concerned.

172
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,200
Heng, come on.

173
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,030
Be careful, Your Highness.

174
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,790
Slowly.

175
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,870
Be careful.

176
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,790
Slowly.

177
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,250
Greetings, Your Majesty.

178
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,200
Song.

179
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,390
You rise first.

180
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

181
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,750
You!

182
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,360
Answer me.

183
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,840
Yes.

184
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,250
Your Majesty.

185
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,810
Heng is severely injured.

186
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,020
Might he rise first and answer you?

187
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,550
Your uncle is inciting officials outside
the palace gate

188
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,330
to stage a coup.

189
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,510
What,

190
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,160
are you trying to defy me here as well?

191
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,210
I dare not.

192
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,280
How do you intend to punish Chu Guihong?

193
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,960
Your Majesty.

194
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
Your Highness...

195
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,790
Chu Guihong is the capital prefect

196
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,060
and the only surviving child
of Lord Qianyu.

197
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,280
He's also a great talent to our nation.

198
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,930
If he's to be punished,

199
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,600
I believe all the officials will
be disappointed as well.

200
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
But according to the law of Great Jing,

201
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,800
Article 8 states that

202
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,260
plotting to harm a member
of the royal family...

203
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,840
Plotting to harm a member
of the royal family

204
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,440
shall be regarded as treason

205
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,550
and shall be executed
according to the law.

206
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,350
So, Your Majesty, I'm just as

207
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,600
conflicted as you are.

208
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,790
Being so seriously injured,

209
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,510
yet you're still concerned about

210
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,670
my difficulties.

211
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,720
Heng, you do put the bigger picture first.

212
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,150
But I see your arrow wound

213
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,000
is about an inch above the left
side of your chest.

214
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,920
I suppose it's not very serious, is it?

215
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,810
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

216
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,690
But if Your Majesty would

217
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,000
graciously revoke the decree

218
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,400
and annul the engagement

219
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,280
between Miss Song and Chu Guihong,

220
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,330
then the knot in my heart

221
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,160
would be untied,

222
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,220
and I believe my wounds

223
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,840
would heal faster.

224
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,870
So about what happened at the
stables today...

225
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,270
I was just fooling around

226
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,710
with Chu Guihong at the stables.

227
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,360
We were merely fooling around,

228
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,790
so a few bumps were inevitable.

229
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,050
It's nothing serious.

230
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,720
Since it's a simple misunderstanding,

231
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,450
this should be easy to resolve.

232
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,060
Song.

233
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,030
Tell me,

234
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,840
do you have feelings for General Chu?

235
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,440
Your Majesty,

236
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,440
I have absolutely no improper thoughts
toward him.

237
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,240
Alright.

238
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,960
Though the imperial edict for
your betrothal

239
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,830
was issued 18 years ago,

240
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,270
since there's no affection

241
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,840
between you two now,

242
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,910
I

243
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,440
have no wish to add yet another pair
of ill-fated couple to the world.

244
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,790
I hereby declare that

245
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,200
this betrothal is annulled.

246
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,240
However,

247
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,230
Song is not young anymore,

248
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,480
and Song Yude is already aged.

249
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,200
He has long hoped to see
his children married

250
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,510
and live out his remaining days in peace.

251
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,750
His wishes align closely

252
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,000
with mine.

253
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,360
Although this betrothal has been
cancelled,

254
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,030
it must be

255
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,440
made up for with another.

256
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,790
Liu Mingxi.

257
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,160
Your Majesty.

258
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,310
Bring my jade seal.

259
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,630
Today,

260
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,840
in front of the Noble Consort,

261
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,030
I'll betroth Song as Heng's
principal consort.

262
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,630
Your Majesty, that's not right.

263
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,200
This is supposed to be just a broken
betrothal, Your Majesty.

264
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,030
Thank you for granting our marriage,
Your Majesty.

265
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,840
I...

266
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,160
By the way,

267
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,440
there was an old custom
in the previous dynasty

268
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,910
that once a prince gets married,
he must go and govern his fief.

269
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,790
Now that you've been bestowed
a principal consort,

270
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,270
once you recover from your injury,

271
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,120
you shall set out

272
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,600
for your fief.

273
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,870
Your Maj...

274
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,610
Since you're here,

275
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,400
come have a drink with me.

276
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,810
I never expected

277
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,840
this place

278
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,960
to be so complicated.

279
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,250
The good people I once believed in

280
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,300
might not

281
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,730
be so good after all.

282
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,120
And the ones I thought were bad

283
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,090
might

284
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,580
have their own struggles.

285
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,720
Here?

286
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,300
You mean

287
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,500
you came from somewhere else?

288
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,200
But who's not?

289
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,460
We are all visitors here,

290
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,200
unable to escape from this worldly cage.

291
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,230
Everyone

292
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,800
have responsibilities they can't
walk away from.

293
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,570
You're like this,

294
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,270
so am I,

295
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,550
and so is everyone.

296
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,190
I never noticed before

297
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,080
that as the second female lead,

298
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,140
you're actually quite open-minded.

299
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,080
The second female lead?

300
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,369
It doesn't matter.

301
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,599
What matters is

302
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,310
you're more persistent than me.

303
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,400
You said you wouldn't get married,

304
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,599
and you've held to it.

305
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,839
Don't you think

306
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,750
that's strange of me?

307
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,000
No.

308
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,880
Not at all.

309
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,359
I think it's a good thing.

310
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,240
You should always hold on to

311
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,920
everything you desire.

312
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,440
Don't ever let worldly norms,

313
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,680
responsibilities,

314
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,450
or royal orders weigh you down.

315
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,060
Since you've thought it all through,

316
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,350
why are you still here

317
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,350
drinking away your sorrows with me?

318
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,960
Because things are out of my hands.

319
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,590
The one I like doesn't like me back,

320
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,200
the one I don't like was injured by me,

321
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,960
and there's another one who I want to
run away from but can't

322
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,030
because we're bound by fate.

323
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,930
I understand.

324
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,040
In the past,

325
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,200
I didn't know what love was.

326
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,640
But now that I know,

327
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm not as carefree as I used to be.

328
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,450
You fell in love with someone?

329
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,000
Could it be...

330
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,640
Be...

331
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,000
Be...

332
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Nan Heng?

333
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,550
Of course not.

334
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,980
That's good.

335
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,370
You scared me.

336
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,540
Remember, Song Yiting.

337
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,400
Once you get involved with Nan Heng,

338
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,070
it'll be the beginning of your misfortune.

339
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,200
You must never

340
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,660
have any contact with him,

341
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,960
especially not

342
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,410

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,540
the Seventh Prince

681
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:53,240
won't make a move against the
Eighteenth Prince for the time being,

682
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,950
and his power will be weakened

683
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,310
due to his departure from the capital
to govern a fief.

684
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,000
You cunning old fox.

685
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,790
Perhaps I should let you

686
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,510
sit in my throne for a change.

687
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,590
I dare not.

688
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,480
The sovereign governs and the
minister obeys;

689
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,480
father and son each play their part.

690
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,650
But those who fear aren’t always
the ones of lower rank.

691
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,110
Your Majesty is wise.

692
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,080
My daughter defied the imperial order,

693
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,240
and I'm filled with dread.

694
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,750
What Song Yimeng defied was your order,

695
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,640
not mine.

696
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:39,110
Then what the Seventh Prince defied
was his fate,

697
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,200
not Your Majesty's will.

698
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,880
What if Song Yimeng's fate

699
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,590
is to marry Heng?

700
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,510
Your Majesty.

701
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,150
I believe

702
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,710
my daughter

703
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,840
should marry someone who
truly cares for her

704
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,860
and enjoy their wholehearted love.

705
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,560
Your Majesty's love for your sons
is sincere,

706
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,670
so is my love for my daughter.

707
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,190
Then how do you know

708
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,590
who truly cares for her?

709
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,170
Is it necessarily Chu Guihong?

710
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,639
Song Yude.

711
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:48,670
[Pure of Heart]

712
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:46,000
My consent to Heng and
Song Yimeng's marriage

713
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,760
was supposed to be an expedient
with multiple benefits,

714
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,590
yet you openly defy the imperial edict.

715
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,920
What punishment do you think you deserve?

716
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,620
I deserve to die.

717
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,690
[Pure of Heart]

718
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:02,110
Song Yimeng actually agreed to
the betrothal?

719
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
Could it be that Miss Song

720
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,920
has long been in love deeply
with Your Highness?

721
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,800
Just look at her.

722
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,130
Does she look like someone deeply in love?

723
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,150
Besides, the one she was arranged
to marry today

724
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,280
was Nan Heng,

725
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,280
not Li Shiliu.

726
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,230
Your Highness, you've put on
too many acts.

727
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,560
I really can't tell anymore at this point.

728
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,510
Well,

729
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,550
since Miss Song agreed,

730
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,550
doesn't that mean Your Highness has to
go govern a fief?

731
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,750
What should we do now?

732
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,670
Song Yimeng agreed,

733
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,510
but Song Yude might not.

734
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,150
He wouldn't be willing to

735
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,280
marry his precious daughter off to me.

736
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,540
Your Highness is wise.

737
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,480
I heard from the Song Residence that

738
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,840
Mr. Song locked

739
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,800
Miss Song in the woodshed
in a fit of anger.

740
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,280
She was in despair and trying to
end her life in there,

741
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,440
threatening to starve herself

742
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,570
to resist the order.

743
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,690
She actually threatens to starve herself
in defiance?

744
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,400
I don't understand, either.

745
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,760
Logically speaking,

746
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,670
Miss Song

747
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:53,070
wouldn't starve for Your Highness, right?

748
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,760
She's not doing it for me.

749
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,440
She's only worried about Li Shiliu.

750
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,050
So Miss Song

751
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,090
wants to get out and see Li Shiliu?

752
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,930
Why are you here again?

753
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:06,800
Chief.

754
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,530
Something bad happened in the palace.

757
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,590
The purpose of us coming here today

758
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,630
is to save Mr. Song.

759
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,480
You're doing this for your Song Yimeng,

760
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,400
and I'm doing this for my Yiting.

761
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,150
That's why we must...

762
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,630
That's why you mustn't
act impulsively, Your Highness.

763
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,920
How could I be that kind of person?

764
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,280
I...

765
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,110
Heng.

766
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,630
Stop right there!

767
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,360
What's this supposed to mean?

768
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,360
You didn't even greet me.

769
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,820
Are you looking down on me?

770

Chu Guihong.

771
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,400
His Majesty will surely punish Mr. Song

772
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,200
for defying the imperial edict.

773
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,760
The Song family is in trouble today.

774
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,020
If you've come for the same purpose as me,

775
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,120
why don't we let go of our old grudges

776
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,630
and resolve this matter together?

777
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,630
What do you think?

778
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,320
Mr. Song has a long-standing relationship
with the Qianyu Mansion.

779
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,720
That's only reasonable.

780
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,450
He left just like that?

You defied the imperial edict

and spoke insolently.

785
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,220
You deserve death.

786
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,480
Yet, considering your years of service
to our nation

787

and your considerable merits,

788

I sentence you to the punishment
of 30 lashes.

789
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,840
Do you acknowledge your guilt?

If he were to take the 30 lashes,

00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,710
How can they be punished because of me?

849
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,840
I want to hear it from them personally!

850
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,440
What?

851
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,810
Why are you both silent now?

852
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,140
Don't you both want to marry Song Yimeng?

853
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,400
Aren't you both willing to suffer

854
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,320
physical pain for a woman?

855
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,230
As soon as you heard about
giving up military power,

856
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,590
you both went quiet.

857
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,230
Lost your voices?

858
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,330
Guihong, are you crazy?

859
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,320
Father!

860
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,180
How about

861
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,800
I take the punishment for Mr. Song?

862
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,960
Get lost.

863
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,710
I... I...

864
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,510
Your Majesty.

865
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,400
I'm willing to bear the punishment
in place of Mr. Song.

866
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,030
Good.

867
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:14,830
Your Majesty.

868
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:17,990
However,

869
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,300
your 10,000 Xuanjia Army soldiers

870
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,690
will never return to your command again.

871
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:24,920
Heng.

872
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,000
You'd better think it through.

873
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,630
I have.

874
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,710
Song Yimeng

875
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,630
is the principal consort I
worked so hard to secure,

876
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,760
which makes Mr. Song

877
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,030
my father-in-law.

878
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,230
It's only natural to bear the punishment

879
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,490
for my father-in-law.

880
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,000
In that case,

881
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,710
I'll grant your wish.

882
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,080
Eunuch Liu.

883
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,000
Carry out the punishment.
