00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry.

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sorry.

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry.

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sorry.

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Sorry.

60
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What should we do, Devil?

64
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Rin rebuild normal.

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We're resolved.

66
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000

Can you both try to understand my problem?

86
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:42,700
I Racing

87
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,800
Cool down a little.

88
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,640
Look out for the youth in your favor.

89
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,440
When are there any more songs?

90
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,440
After a while, Shangguan He will come in in a light-colored suit.

91
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,440
When he enters the door, he will break a foot.

92
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,440
And he will tell you that Qianyu's family secretly infiltrated a group of Qianyu soldiers.

93
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,440
The rich and the rich checked the city's layout.

94
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,440
Last night, there was no record of Qianyu soldiers moving.

95
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:22,100
The friends on the way to the

96
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Do you

97
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,440
not want to discuss the key to the king of Qianyu?

98
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,440
What do you mean by dragging it in this early morning?

99
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,440
Am I right?

100
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,440
Come here.

101
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:56,440
.

102
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:06,060
.

103
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,440
To trainer

104
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,980
I'm right, right?

105
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,740
Because everything that happened today,

106
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,740
I've experienced it twice.

107
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,740
What?

108
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,620
Really?

109
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,340
Believe me.

110
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,580
Then...

111
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,180
What will happen next?

112
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,540
Next, His Majesty will be poisoned.

113
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,380
The Song family will be kidnapped.

114
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,880
So we have to split up and stop them from happening.

115
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,080
What are you thinking about?

116
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
He just woke up. How can he believe you?

117
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
I believe him.

118
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,380
This time, you have to listen to me.

119
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,280
You can't act without permission.

120
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,980
Everything today is to promote the second snow of Cheng's Building.

121
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,280
Only when the plan is done,

122
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,280
can I return to the present and arrange the best ending for you.

123
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,680
Where did that stupid goose come from?

124
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,480
Where did that stupid goose come from?

125
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,980
What's wrong?

126
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,680
The window, that butterfly, and the words you said,

127
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,280
everything seems to have happened before.

128
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,980
What do you mean by that?

129
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,280
That's right.

130
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,780
This feeling is very familiar.

131
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,780
Let me ask you.

132
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,280
In this script world,

133
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
have there been any repeated events?

134
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,280
No.

135
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
I don't know.

136
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,580
In this script world,

137
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,380
have there been any repeated events?

138
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,380
There have been, and there have been reincarnations.

139
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,580
Reincarnations?

140
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,580
You mean Wu Xie Liu, right?

141
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,180
Of course.

142
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,180
He experienced it when he first entered the script.

143
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,980
At that time, he kept getting married,

144
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,180
and died again.

145
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,580
Using our words, it's called a card bug.

146
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,580
Died and again?

147
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,380
At that time, didn't he always want to avoid Nan Heng marrying you?

148
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,880
But the plot didn't allow it,

149
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,380
so he kept dying.

150
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,480
Died and reborn?

151
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,280
And then he repeated what happened at that time.

152
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
That's right.

153
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,480
Why are you suddenly asking this?

154
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,280
If he was reborn,

155
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,280
would he have all the memories before he died?

156
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,280
Memories?

157
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,480
That is to say,

158
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,880
he has the ability to predict.

159
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,280
No way.

160
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,680
If that's true,

161
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,480
then all our plans now,

162
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,680
he already knew.

163
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,880
If that's the case,

164
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,680
then I'll have to take the initiative.

165
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,580
I'll take the initiative first.

166
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,380
I'll do it.

167
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,580
Okay.

168
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,580
Father will eat first.

169
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,580
Father.

170
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,980
Look at your clumsy hands.

171
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,980
I'll do it.

172
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,380
That's not right, Father.

173
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,780
Did you peel oranges for me before?

174
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,780
I'm the emperor.

175
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,380
When did I peel oranges for others?

176
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,980
This is the first time.

177
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,980
No,

178
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,180
why do I feel that this factory is so familiar?

179
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,580
You didn't see the oranges just now.

180
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,980
I also feel that you didn't see it for the first time.

181
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,980
I'm sorry.

182
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,680
This is the first time I've seen it.

183
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,280
You're talking nonsense again.

184
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,880
I...

185
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
Your Majesty.

186
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
Your Majesty.

187
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,680
General.

188
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Cousin?

189
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,880
Did I get blind?

190
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,680
What are you doing?

191
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Your Majesty,

192
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,480
this thing has a strong poison.

193
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,480
What nonsense are you talking about?

194
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,880
This red orange was bought by Rui'er for me.

195
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,080
How could it be poisonous?

196
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,180
Cousin, I...

197
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,980
Father,

198
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,380
you never gave me poison.

199
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,780
Even if you gave me ten thousand courage,

200
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,180
I wouldn't dare to do such a thing.

201
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,180
When did I say that you poisoned it?

202
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,780
Chu Gui Hong,

203
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,180
how did you know about this?

204
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,780
I just received the report.

205
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,980
Someone saw the red orange dealer

206
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,280
poisoned the orange

207
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,880
and sold it to 18th Prince.

208
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
I suspect

209
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,680
that there's a thief

210
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,280
who wants to kill His Majesty and 18th Prince.

211
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,480
No, who would do that?

212
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,480
The Empress is in danger.

213
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,680
The red orange is on the way.

214
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,280
The Empress is in danger.

215
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,680
The red orange is the favorite of the Empress.

216
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,080
It's the favorite of the Empress.

217
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,980
Every year at this time,

218
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,080
18th Prince will use the red orange with His Majesty

219
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,180
to look after his old friends.

220
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,080
Why does it feel like

221
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,380
Old Seven said that?

222
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,380
There aren't many people in the palace who know about this.

223
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,780
If I guess right,

224
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,780
the person who poisoned it

225
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,380
must be someone close to

226
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,380
His Majesty and 18th Prince.

227
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,980
Chu Gui Hong,

228
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,980
what do you mean?

229
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,580
How dare you!

230
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
You're talking nonsense!

231
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,980
How dare you frame the Crown Prince!

232
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,280
Yes, Cousin.

233
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,980
Old Seven is already the Crown Prince.

234
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,280
He has no reason to poison His Majesty.

235
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
So what?

236
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,280
The Crown Prince is ambitious.

237
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,580
He's afraid that His Majesty will change his mind

238
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,480
and make another crown prince.

239
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,680
He doesn't know that.

240
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,780
Your Majesty,

241
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,880
this case is about rebellion.

242
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,180
In order to avoid the thief from causing trouble,

243
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,180
you should stay in the palace.

244
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,580
I will also send the Qianyu Army

245
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,180
to protect Your Majesty in the palace.

246
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,980
Chu Gui Hong,

247
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,780
you want to silence me?

248
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,380
The King of Qin is protecting His Majesty.

249
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,980
It's my duty.

250
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,980
I'm tired.

251
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,180
His Majesty has ordered to replace the Qin army.

252
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,780
Send someone to guard the palace immediately.

253
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,380
Without my order,

254
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,180
no one is allowed to enter.

255
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,580
Whoever disobeys the order, behead him.

256
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,180
Yes.

257
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,180
Remember, no matter what method you use,

258
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,780
you must make him write the imperial decree

259
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,380
to punish Nan Heng.

260
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,980
General, please let me go.

261
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,380
I will not let you go.

262
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,380
Don't worry. I will get the imperial decree.

263
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,380
Last time, he acted in advance.

264
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,380
Why is it so early this time?

265
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,580
The Qianyu Army controls the palace so quickly.

266
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,380
Could it be His Majesty?

267
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,580
We must find a way to save His Majesty.

268
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,780
Qi, Qi.

269
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,780
I...

270
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,980
Why are you here?

271
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,180
Who...

272
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,380
Father trusted their orders,

273
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,580
so I sneaked out of the back door.

274
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,180
That's it.

275
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,780
He must have gone crazy.

276
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,780
He dared to imprison His Majesty?

277
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,780
No.

278
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,380
We must find a way to save him.

279
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,580
Qi, listen to me.

280
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,780
When I escaped,

281
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,580
Father told you not to be impulsive.

282
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,380
He will delay the time in the palace.

283
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,780
And Father also said that

284
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,780
Cousin...

285
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,580
Chu Guihong just wanted to get the imperial decree.

286
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,580
If you go there,

287
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,380
you will be in trouble.

288
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,180
He is right.

289
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,580
When His Majesty was in trouble for the first time,

290
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,780
many people in the palace witnessed it.

291
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,580
It was Nanrui who fed His Majesty a poisonous orange.

292
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,580
But this time, it's different.

293
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,180
It's hard to make everyone happy

294
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,980
with just a little talk.

295
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,180
What?

296
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,380
When did I poison it?

297
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,780
Chu Guihong poisoned it.

298
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,980
He's lying to you.

299
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,380
Chu Guihong poisoned the orange?

300
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:30,980
Impossible.

301
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,780
How could he do such a thing?

302
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,180
He just killed the orange himself.

303
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,380
That's right.

304
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,580
Why did Chu Guihong change his plan this time?

305
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,980
Either he predicted our actions in advance,

306
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,180
or...

307
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,780
Did he also enter the Wu County?

308
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,380
Did he leave any memories in the last two rounds?

309
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,380
No.

310
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,180
Then he must have known the news in advance

311
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,380
and changed his plan.

312
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,380
But his ultimate goal...

313
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:54,980
What county?

314
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,380
He wanted to kill you.

315
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:57,980
No.

316
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,580
Why can't I understand?

317
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,380
What Wu...

318
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,580
What county?

319
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,780
I mean, I...

320
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,380
I know the word.

321
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,180
Why do I feel confused when you are in the same place?

322
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,580
I'll explain it to you later.

323
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,380
Now, I'll ask Fugui

324
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,980
to send you and your mother to the Imperial College.

325
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,180
Fine.

326
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,580
We were dragged away the first two times

327
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,180
because we lack of troops.

328
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,180
Then this time,

329
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,180
I have to find someone first.

330
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,780
Stop!

331
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,580
You've secretly sent the army of Qianyu to the capital.

332
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,980
Why do you still have the tiger tally?

333
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,580
I said

334
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,180
I wanted to change my destiny.

335
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,380
I said you don't understand the people.

336
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,580
As long as you finish the official task,

337
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,780
even if you want to be the king of heaven,

338
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,580
I'll help you write it.

339
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,380
Father, why are you so generous?

340
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,180
If I take the throne,

341
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,780
you'll be the emperor.

342
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,580
You are familiar with the cold palace in the palace

343
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,180
in the name of Nan Heng.

344
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,780
In the future,

345
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,380
I'll let you live there for a year.

346
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,580
Chu Guihong!

347
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,980
You promised to let me go back!

348
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,180
If you go back,

349
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,980
my destiny will fall into your hands again.

350
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,780
You...

351
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,380
From now on,

352
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,580
I can only control my destiny.

353
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,580
If you really don't want to live in the cold palace,

354
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,580
Nan Heng, didn't you turn Song Yimeng into a hostage in the script?

355
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,580
What if I arrange this for you?

356
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,580
Stop!

357
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,180
Guards!

358
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,780
Help!

359
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,980
Guards!

360
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,380
Help!

361
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,980
Hurry up!

362
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,380
I'm the king of Qianyu!

363
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,380
What are you doing?

364
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,380
Stay here.

365
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,580
Chu Guihong, you crazy bastard!

366
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,780
You can't die!

367
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,580
If I go back,

368
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,980
I'll kill you a thousand times!

369
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,180
A million times!

370
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,380
It's a pity

371
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,180
that you can't go back.

372
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,180
I'm the king of Qianyu!

373
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,780
You want to rebel against me?

374
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,380
Let me go!

375
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,180
Go!

376
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,180
I'm the king of Qianyu!

377
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:02,980
You...

378
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,980
I'm the king of Qianyu!

379
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,980
You...

380
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,380
Nan Heng!

381
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,380
Help!

382
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,380
Help!

383
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,380
Don't shout.

384
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,380
Nan Heng, Chu Guihong is crazy.

385
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,980
He has arranged 5,000 people outside the city.

386
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,180
When the time comes, he'll surround you.

387
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,180
If you want to live,

388
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,380
you should go to the scene with Song Yimeng.

389
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:57,980
When I go back...

390
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,780
You still want to go to the scene?

391
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,380
Do you know that you've died twice?

392
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,780
Died twice?

393
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,380
When?

394
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,180
Song Yimeng said,

395
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,780
the first time, you were killed by Rong Hua.

396
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,780
The second time, you were killed by Chu Guihong.

397
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,180
I was the one who died for you.

398
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,180
There's really a reincarnation?

399
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,180
Let me tell you.

400
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,180
The reincarnation has begun.

401
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,780
If you want to live,

402
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,180
you should cooperate with me.

403
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,980
Let's fight against Chu Guihong together.

404
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,380
Fight against Chu Guihong?

405
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,780
You're crazy.

406
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,980
I'm just a screenwriter.

407
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,780
I can only write and fight.

408
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,380
Didn't you look down on us before?

409
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,180
I...

410
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,180
What about your ability?

411
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,380
How about this?

412
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,580
You're here,

413
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,180
but you can't just go for nothing, right?

414
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,180
You save me first.

415
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,380
I'll hide myself.

416
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,180
When the time comes,

417
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,380
you'll fight and fight.

418
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,180
I'll never back down, okay?

419
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,780
You still want to hide?

420
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,180
When? Are you a man?

421
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,180
Don't be so mean.

422
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,180
I'm a man of my own will, right?

423
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,180
I'm just a screenwriter, not a man.

424
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,980
I'll leave the best moments of fighting and killing

425
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,180
to you two.

426
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,180
Nanhang.

427
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,180
Heng...

428
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,180
Heng Bao, you...

429
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,580
You've tortured me so badly in real life.

430
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,180
Don't... Don't do this to me.

431
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,180
Don't talk nonsense.

432
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,180
I...

433
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,180
No matter what you are,

434
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,180
you can only be Qian Yu Wang today.

435
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,180
Qian Yu Wang?

436
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,180
You...

437
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,180
Drink some water first.

438
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,180
Thank you.

439
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,180
Nanhang,

440
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,180
can you hold on?

441
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,180
If you really can't hold on...

442
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,180
Don't worry.

443
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,180
I can hold on.

444
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,180
Don't tell me

445
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,180
you'll die again

446
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,180
and turn back into a dead man.

447
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,180
Listen,

448
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,180
I won't let you get hurt this time.

449
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,180
But Chu Gui Hong has 5,000 men now.

450
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,180
And Qian Yu Wang didn't say he wanted to help us.

451
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,180
How can you fight with Chu Gui Hong?

452
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,180
Don't say

453
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,180
you can only rely on your male master.

454
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,180
You said I'm a male master.

455
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,180
A male master must

456
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,180
think of some solutions that a male master can think of.

457
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,180
What solutions?

458
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,180
Uncle said there were 3,000 soldiers outside the city before he left.

459
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,180
I have 3,000 soldiers secretly stationed outside the city.

460
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,180
If you give me a signal,

461
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,180
I can do it.

462
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,180
The Xingzhao Prefecture has not found them yet.

463
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,180
So I asked Yao Xian to take Ye You Shen and the others

464
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,180
to find clues everywhere.

465
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,180
Even if we turn the city upside down,

466
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,180
we must find them.

467
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,180
But you're the one who exposed the crime of Gao Xiang.

468
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,180
Will those private soldiers listen to you?

469
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,180
I asked Yao Xian to take the Crown Prince's order.

470
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,180
Either hide in the west and hide for a lifetime,

471
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,180
or follow my order to settle the rebellion and make up for the mistake.

472
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,180
I think most people will choose the latter.

473
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,180
As long as more people join us,

474
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,180
we can have one more victory.

475
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,180
More people?

476
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,180
Maybe...

477
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,180
Before those private soldiers enter the capital,

478
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,180
we can find more people to help us get the Crown Prince out.

479
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,180
Where?

480
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,180
The officials, the officers, the people in the city,

481
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,180
they can all do it.

482
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,180
My stomach...

483
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,180
No, no, no.

484
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,180
Jia Ruo Ru, listen to me.

485
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,180
You...

486
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,180
Sister-in-law, why doesn't she want to help us?

487
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,180
An Long and I even carried the Night Pearl.

488
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,180
It's a big thing.

489
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,180
People will be afraid.

490
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,180
Especially when they fight Chu Gui Hong, who is heavily armed.

491
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,180
It would be great if the Heavens are on our side.

492
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,180
Sister-in-law, sister-in-law.

493
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,180
Sister-in-law and Lord Song are here.

494
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,180
Father.

495
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,180
Meng, what happened?

496
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,180
Why did you call us here?

497
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,180
Let's go over there.

498
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,180
The Eighteenth Prince is here too.

499
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,180
Nan Hong has something to tell him.

500
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,180
I hope he won't faint after hearing it.

501
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,180
Faint? What happened?

502
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,180
Look.

503
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,180
How was the four- retrouver the flyer of the child?

504
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,180
Did they find her?

505
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,180
The child was lost.

506
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,980
Why the flyer of the child?

507
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,180
Also lost?

508
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,180
We also don' s know what occurred to her.

509
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,180
Your Majesty's mother is still here?

510
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,180
She made some rice cakes for you.

511
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,180
Don't you understand thesė porky bones seemed to be missing with them?

512
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,180
Father.

513
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,180
It's normal to make such a fuss.

514
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,180
Don't feel inferior.

515
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,180
You talk too much.

516
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,180
You should digest it.

517
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,180
Chu Guihong hurt you three times.

518
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,180
But it's all for Xie Haigu.

519
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,180
If you can't do it,

520
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,180
then...

521
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,180
Brother Qi.

522
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,180
You said you died so many times.

523
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,180
It must hurt a lot.

524
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,180
It's all my fault.

525
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,180
If I could find the problem

526
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,180
when I bought the red orange for the first time,

527
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,180
I shouldn't have bought the red orange.

528
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,180
Do you understand what I'm talking about?

529
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,180
Yes.

530
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,180
I can't understand it anymore.

531
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,180
You mean,

532
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,180
you and Ye Wushen will lead Chu Guihong's rebels to Nancheng.

533
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,180
Then I can take 300 black armor troops

534
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,180
to the palace to save father.

535
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,180
But, Brother Qi,

536
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,180
you're just a little bit of a person.

537
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,180
You lost the first two times.

538
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:44,180
What if you die again this time?

539
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,180
But now I...

540
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,180
I have an idea.

541
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,180
Do you think this is a good idea?

542
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,180
I'll take the black armor troops

543
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,180
and ambush in Nancheng in advance.

544
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,180
You'll lead Chu Guihong to come alone.

545
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,180
As long as he's like a dog,

546
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,180
I'll praise him and say,

547
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,180
he must be in a mess.

548
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,180
We'll change our fate.

549
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,180
What do you think?

550
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,180
Brother Qi,

551
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,180
you're a big brother.

552
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,180
Don't say that.

553
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,180
Listen to me. I'll go to Nancheng.

554
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,180
I'll leave the palace to you.

555
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,180
But if I leave you,

556
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,180
I'm afraid I'll go alone.

557
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,180
Then there are 300 black armor troops left.

558
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,180
And there are experts like Ji Xiang in the palace.

559
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,180
They'll definitely save father.

560
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,180
Don't worry.

561
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,180
Nanrui,

562
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,180
you're my brother.

563
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,180
You can do what I can do.

564
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,180
You can do it.

565
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,180
You can do it better than me.

566
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,180
Don't forget.

567
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,180
You're a lucky man.

568
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,180
You're the lucky one of Dajing.

569
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:01,180
Golden眉

570
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,180
Good.

571
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,180
I'm protecting the palace and you're protecting the capital.

572
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,180
We brothers

573
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,180
will get through this time.

574
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:37,660
Wu достаточно

575
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,460
um

576
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,620
do

577
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,900
you

578
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:55,980
this

579
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,180
If it's not just Nan Heng,

580
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,180
we'll be in trouble too.

581
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,180
Oh my god.

582
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,180
What is this?

583
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,180
Okay.

584
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,180
You don't have to explain.

585
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,180
But this thing,

586
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,180
I...

587
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,180
Father,

588
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,180
Great Jin is in trouble.

589
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,180
Would you like to protect the country?

590
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,180
I'm here to do my duty.

591
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,180
I will do my best.

592
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,180
That's enough.

593
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,180
Ting, what about you?

594
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,180
Are you willing?

595
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,180
You don't have to explain.

596
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,180
I'll follow you wherever you go.

597
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,180
Madam, what about you?

598
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,180
Me?

599
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,180
Me?

600
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,180
I...

601
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,180
I'm timid and afraid of death.

602
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,180
I'm weak.

603
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,180
You're not timid when you hit me.

604
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,180
Is this the case?

605
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,180
What about you?

606
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,180
It's okay.

607
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,180
If you're afraid,

608
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,180
you can leave now.

609
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,180
I won't force you.

610
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,180
How can I leave?

611
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,180
There are only four of us left.

612
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,180
But,

613
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,180
there's hope for one more person.

614
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,180
Right?

615
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,180
Crown Prince!

616
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,180
Crown Prince!

617
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,180
Let's go in!

618
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,180
I'll fight against the Song family!

619
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,180
I'll fight against them!

620
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,180
I'll get more sticks.

621
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,180
Where did you get these things?

622
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,180
We found them at the Moon of the Moon.

623
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,180
Put them down.

624
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,180
I didn't want you to go to the battlefield.

625
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,180
Sister Zhang,

626
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,180
what do you want us to do?

627
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,180
I want to take you to Nan City

628
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,180
and with Ye You Shen

629
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,180
to stall Chu Gui Hong and Qian Yu Yuan Jun's meeting.

630
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,180
Me?

631
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,180
Your Highness,

632
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,180
it's Beverlybly thatYo

633
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,180
call me stupid because I'm strong.

634
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,180
Your Highness,

635
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,180
you don't count your anger even though it reminds

636
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,180
you of something like this.

637
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,060
What do you mean,

638
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,180
mark your anger on me?

639
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,180
I have nobody else to count.

640
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,180
Your Highness,

641
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,300
Then let me ask you, who is His Majesty to me?

642
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,460
Father.

643
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,620
Then what about 18th Brother?

644
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,740
Brother.

645
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,340
I told you to protect my father and brother.

646
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,380
You think it's a small matter in the heart of the Wu clan.

647
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,780
Your Highness means that I'm more important than Chu He?

648
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,420
You don't have to compare yourself to others.

649
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,100
You've been born and died with me for so many years.

650
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,020
In my heart, you are already my family.

651
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,820
Do you understand?

652
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:30,020
Your Highness, don't worry. I will definitely complete the task entrusted to me by Your Highness.

653
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,300
Crown Princess Consort, I'm going to protect your father and little Zhu.

654
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,740
I'm going to get out.

655
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,900
Brother and sister, I wasnt bragging.

656
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,740
I was only 15 years old at that time.

657
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:56,020
I encountered some bandits in the

658
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:01,500
human Certificate of sensitive fight in the Cincinnati responsibilities

659
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:01,900
.

660
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,180
How 안atex personally

661
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,140
.

662
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,420
When your second boss was chased by the soldiers in Jiangnan

663
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,020
One of them was beaten 100 times and left in one go

664
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,220
One?

665
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,140
That's amazing

666
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,140
Brother Long, how many can you beat alone?

667
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,140
One

668
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,780
Brother Long, you have the time to admit defeat

669
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,540
One Chu Guihong is enough

670
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,140
Chu Guihong is the God of War in the Great Jin

671
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,940
It's good to leave it to the boss

672
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,540
Let's not interfere

673
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,020
Shangguan He

674
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,620
I think you want to steal again

675
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,260
Sister-in-law, I'm going out to check some news

676
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,260
Take it slow

677
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,980
Have you prepared the clothes for Qian Yujun?

678
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,020
Hurry up, go, go

679
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,020
Don't be stuck, hurry up

680
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,020
Go go go

681
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,580
What is this?

682
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,020
Marriage dress

683
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,020
Marriage dress?

684
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,700
Whose?

685
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,460
You want to marry me?

686
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,380
Yes

687
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,380
Now?

688
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,380
Here

689
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,980
I have to get married anyway

690
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,380
I want to have a wedding with you under the supervision of everyone

691
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,060
I don't care if others see me with three or six pints

692
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,780
Marriage is our business

693
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,940
Since you are willing to marry me

694
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,780
It's better to be a man

695
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,780
Listen

696
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,380
If I can come back alive

697
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,580
I will marry you first

698
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,540
Sister-in-law told me

699
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,100
Every man who makes this kind of promise

700
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,700
The ending will usually be very sad

701
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,700
Some can't even find the tomb

702
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,100
Shangguan He

703
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,100
Today

704
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,100
Either you marry me

705
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,100
Or

706
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,700
I'll cut your hair and tie it together

707
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,900
Married couple

708
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,100
Love is one

709
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,100
The world is the witness

710
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,100
The sun and the moon are the allies

711
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,100
The world is the witness

712
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,100
The white head is the eternal

713
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,100
Song Yiting

714
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,100
Are you willing to marry me?

715
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,100
From now on

716
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,100
Not good

717
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,100
You don't want to

718
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,100
I mean

719
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,100
The wedding speech is not good

720
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,100
Don't other people say that?

721
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,100
I'll say it

722
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,100
I don't want to

723
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,100
I'll say it

724
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,100
Shangguan He

725
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,100
Are you willing to accept me

726
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,100
Become your partner

727
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,100
From now on

728
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,100
No matter poor or rich

729
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,100
Health or illness

730
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,100
Are willing to comfort me

731
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,100
Love me

732
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,100
Protect me

733
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
Respect me

734
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,100
Never leave

735
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,100
Until death

736
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,100
Separate you and me

737
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,100
I am willing

738
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,100
I am willing too

739
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,100
You took the initiative so many times

740
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,100
Give me the initiative

741
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,100
I am willing too

742
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,100
I am willing too

743
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,100
I am willing too

744
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,100
I am willing too

745
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,100
I am willing too

746
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,100
I am willing too

747
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,100
I am willing too

748
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,100
I am willing too

749
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,100
I am willing too

750
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,100

I am willing too

752

I am willing too

753
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,100

I am willing too

755
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,100
I am willing too

756
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,100
I am willing too

757
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,100
I am willing too

758
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,100
I am willing too

759
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,100
I am willing too

760
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,100
I am willing too

761
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,100
I am willing too

762
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,100
I am willing too

763
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,100
I am willing too

764
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,100
I am willing too

765
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,100
I am willing too

766
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,100
I am willing too

767
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,100
I am willing too

768
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,100
I am willing too

769
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,100
I am willing too

770
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:00,100
How many people in my heart

771
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:04,100
I am in the middle of the year

772
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,100
I look at the sky

773
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,100
That person and me

774
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,100
Touch me

775
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,100
In a while, the war is coming

776
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,100
But I haven't found more people

777
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,100
To help us

778
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,100
rest assured

779
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,100
Yao Qing has already passed on the news

780
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,100
Said to have found

781
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,100
The place where those soldiers hide

782
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,100
Really

783
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,100
Are they willing to help us

784
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,100
About two thousand people are willing to join

785
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,100
And before this time

786
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,100
Can reach Nancheng

787
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,100
Great

788
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,100
As long as we can hold on to the chief for an hour

789
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,100
Once the reinforcements arrive

790
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,100
We can definitely change our fate that day

791
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,100
The wind blows

792
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,100
Let me see

793
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,100
The sun rises

794
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,100
Look at the years

795
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,100
Let the heart beat

796
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,100
And turn around

797
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,100
You see me

798
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,100
Will always be

799
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,100
In the blue sky

800
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,100
Look at the world

801
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,100
In the dust

802
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,100
What's wrong? What are you laughing at?

803
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,100
I suddenly thought

804
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,100
The scriptwriter once said

805
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,100
He said in this script world

806
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,100
Everyone is a paper man who has nothing to do with it

807
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,100
But now it doesn't seem to be

808
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,100
You see

809
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,100
Tonight, the Black Armor Army is good

810
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,100
Even the Night God

811
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,100
We all

812
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,100
Are the conquerors of this world

813
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,100
That's right

814
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,100
Tonight there is no arrangement

815
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,100
No paper man

816
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,100
Everyone is the protagonist here

817
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,100
Then I, the heroine

818
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,100
Can't be careless

819
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,100
The previous Song Yimong

820
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,100
Is a salted fish who likes to lie flat

821
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,100
I've been thinking about one day

822
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,100
There will be a hero who is down and up

823
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,100
To help me put everything together

824
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,100
But now I think it over

825
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,100
Indeed

826
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,100
In everyone's life

827
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,100
There will be heroes

828
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,100
But the biggest hero

829
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,100
Must be the one

830
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,100
Not compromise

831
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,100
And not give up on yourself

832
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,100
Then tonight we are together

833
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,100
Do your best

834
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,100
Don't leave regrets

835
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,100
Do your best

836
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,100
Don't leave regrets

837
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,100
Let's go

838
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
Thousand rain and chaos

839
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,100
Great Jin is in danger

840
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,100
You are a thief

841
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,100
You are a traitor

842
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,100
The world is alive

843
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,100
We are together

844
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,100
The king of Qin

845
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,100
Controls the country

846
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,100
We are together

847
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,100
We are together

848
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,100
The recent disaster

849
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,100
I and the main force of the Night God

850
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,100
Will lead Chu Guihong to the south city

851
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,100
The shore dock

852
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,100
The south city road is narrow

853
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,100
It is difficult to pass through the Great Peking River at the same time

854
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,100
Qianyu Army wants to meet with Chu Guihong

855
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,100
Will definitely split into three ways

856
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,100
When attacking Chu Guihong's reinforcements

857
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,100
I'll leave it to you and Shangguan He

858
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,100
Arlong, A'Fu and others

859
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,100
Don't worry

860
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,100
On these three roads

861
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,100
Everyone is ready

862
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,100
At this time

863
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,100
Three hundred Black Armor Army of the rich return

864
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,100
Go to the palace to save the emperor at any time

865
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,100
Grandfather, grandmother, grandfather

866
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,100
Lord Long, Lord Zhao

867
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,100
And the god of wealth, Grandpa Gua

868
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,100
Today is my Nanrui

869
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,100
The day to go out to defend the palace

870
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,100
I am a man of the heaven

871
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,100
I think you guys

872
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,100
You shouldn't leave me alone

873
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,100
Bless me and my father

874
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,100
And brother Qi can return safely

875
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,100
The fengxiu is in a hurry and the peace is in the house

876
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,100
I will definitely find a house

877
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,100
Take good care of everyone

878
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,100
What do I eat then

879
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,100
What do you eat, okay

880
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,100
Please

881
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,100
General Shiba, it's time to go

882
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,100
Boss

883
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,100
Don't hit it, I saw it

884
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,100
You can't beat these eight guns

885
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,100
You are not as good as me

886
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,100
Don't talk nonsense to me

887
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,100
Hurry up

888
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,100
Wait for me

889
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,100
Come on

890
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,100
Come on

891
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,100
Come on

892
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,100
Come on

893
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,100
Come on

894
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,100
Come on

895
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,100
You don't help me get it

896
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,100
Come on

897
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,100
You help me get it

898
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,100
Come on

899
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,100
Come on

900
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,100
General

901
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,100
The Qianyu Army outside the city has been assembled

902
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,100
As long as the general gives orders

903
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,100
We can meet in Nancheng

904
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,100
Brothers

905
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,100
Go straight to Nancheng

906
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
Destroy the traitors

907
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,100
Go straight to Nancheng

908
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,100
Destroy the traitors

909
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,100
Release

910
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,100
Set off

911
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,100
Go straight to Nancheng

912
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,100
The emperor

913
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,100
Give you one last chance

914
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,100
Write a decree to punish the traitors

915
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,100
Nanheng

916
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,100
Otherwise, it will be too late

917
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,100
I can't see you

918
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,100
I'm not able to see you

919
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,100
I can't see you

920
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,100
I don't know

921
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,100
I don't know

922
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,100
I don't know

923
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,100
I don't know

924
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,100
I don't know

925
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,100
I don't know

926
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,100
I don't know

927
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,100
I don't know

928
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,100
I don't know

929
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,100
I don't know

930
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,100
I don't know

931
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,100
You won't have a chance to hold the pen again.

932
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:12,100
Mr. Sun, are you nervous?

933
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,100
I used to be a military secretary.

934
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,100
I'm not nervous.

935
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,100
You're not nervous?

936
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,100
I'm not nervous.

937
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:44,100
Water, electricity, and poison.

938
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,100
Right?

939
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,100
Yes.

940
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,100
I'm not nervous.

941
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,100
I'm not nervous.
