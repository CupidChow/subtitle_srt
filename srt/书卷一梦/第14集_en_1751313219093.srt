1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,100
Ahupeng University

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,700
They taught the girls game

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,700
Play games

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,700
The men are right

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The wine�� our feet

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,400
The young girl is 각Rhett

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sword is heavy.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the deep roots of the earth and the earth.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not as good as the world.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am willing to be a beast.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fire of the Yangtze River.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
A heart that can't be burned.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The four seas are in harmony.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No need to wait. No need to hate.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Write a poem for yourself.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
For all that's broken.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
All the stars are in harmony.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I will write a poem.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fire of the Yangtze River.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The wind is strong and the rain is heavy.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's not regret.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The road ahead is full of hardships.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
For this life and for all lives.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The journey is long.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Dream of Book and Book

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 2

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Dad.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why do you have this?

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What's wrong with your face?

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's not important. It's just a scratch.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Where did you get this note?

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You made this?

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
There's a secret rumor in the room

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
that this is a recipe for cutting the sword.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
A recipe?

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This means

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
your beauty stole my heart.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Dad.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Actually, this is just a simple love story.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It has nothing to do with the cutting of the sword.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You haven't answered me yet.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
How did you get this note?

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's not important.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You just said love words, right?

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You can tell it's love words.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It means you're getting married.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Red or green tea?

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Don't get in my way, dad.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What do you want to talk about in the wedding?

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Today, the rumors about you and the Seventh Prince

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
are spreading in the capital.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's not easy for you and the Song family.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Chu Guihong is already 30 years old.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Your daughter is also 24 years old.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
She's even older.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I was thinking

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
that I should fulfill your engagement.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You guys in the department,

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
besides promoting the relationship,

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
do you have nothing else to do?

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Dad.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Chu Guihong and I have only known each other for a few days.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We don't have any relationship base.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This relationship is built up

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
by two people experiencing things together.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm just worried

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
that if the court is in chaos in the future,

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
no one will protect you.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
My daughter...

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Enough, dad.

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Stop acting.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Just tell me.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Why do you have to let us get married all of a sudden?

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Meng.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You and the Seventh Prince are spreading rumors.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
If it were someone else,

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
maybe I could consider it.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But he's not an ordinary family's son.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He's been a man who has been

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
running around in the Cold Palace since he was a child.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What kind of man

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
is he to you?

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He's always the first one to protect himself.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The kind, gentle and kind people

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
in the world are just a pawn

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
that can be used to plot against him.

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He's as strong as a stone,

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
as strong as a mule.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He's always close to you and plans against you.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't believe anyone.

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That's because no one has ever believed me.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Even you are the same.

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You have to know

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
that the world is not what you think it is.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It might not be the truth.

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If you really want to know me,

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
don't use your eyes.

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yongzhi.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm just worried about Ye Chang and Meng Duo.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You're being used by him.

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I know that Nan Heng is not a good person.

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But I can't sacrifice Chu Guihong's happiness

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
just to save my own life.

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Enough.

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm old and I don't understand what you young people are saying.

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But I can't just watch you jump into the fire.

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
At the banquet,

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
you and Chu Guihong should build up your relationship.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
In the coming days, I'll go to the mansion

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and discuss your marriage.

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's settled.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Dad, I don't agree.

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What's settled?

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He wants to get married?

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I saw it with my own eyes.

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
After Mr. Song and Chu Guihong left the court,

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
they kept talking.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Today I'll give you a gift, tomorrow I'll pay you back.

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
When they were talking about marriage, they were talking about each other.

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
They must have a good relationship.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It seems that Song Yu De is still unwilling to give in.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This is why the marriage is a new day.

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And Song Yi Meng.

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Do you think you can get away from him by relying on Chu Guihong?

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Song Yu De is my father.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Chu Guihong is my fiance.

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Isn't that enough?

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You already have a plan?

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's a good thing to talk about the marriage.

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I want to make Chu Guihong

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
look at Song Yi Meng in front of Ming Liu.

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Why did you choose such a place?

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Cheng Nan is a famous place in the lower wine region.

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's not like us.

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is the capital of the Cangjiang Prefecture.

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm not bad at settling things.

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Today is the day of the seventh prince.

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's also the day of our Black Armor Army.

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Today is the day of our Cangjiang Yue.

143
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's also the day of our Ye You God.

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
In the past, we were strong and powerful.

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We were strong and powerful.

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
In the past, we were powerful.

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
We were powerful.

148
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Today, for the sake of the prince, we will hold this event.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We will call the world to the bright.

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Today, we will hold this banquet for the big boss.

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Today, we will hold this banquet for the big boss.

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
We will call the world to the bright.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Today, we will hold this banquet for the big boss.

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Today, we will hold this banquet for the big boss.

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Today, we will hold this banquet for the big boss.

156
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Isn't this the superior officer of Cangjiang Yue?

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There is a special way to meet the subordinate.

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's not just a matter of doing things for the big boss.

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But this rich man around the seventh prince

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
is usually a kowtow and kneeling in the palace.

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I didn't expect that the leader of the black armor army came.

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The waist is quite straight.

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It seems that the superior officer is very concerned about me.

164
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We knew each other before.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's your misunderstanding.

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm not in a hurry to do something that's not beautiful.

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Spring and autumn are in the past, and there is still the good mood of the prince.

168
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The mountain and river are replaced, which is the prince's chest.

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes.

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The group is handsome and the group is big.

171
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The world is full of talented people.

172
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The great general is out.

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The prince is very handsome.

174
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm leaving.

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Cousin.

176
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Cousin.

177
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What's wrong with you?

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Don't call me cousin.

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I can't stand it.

180
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I've been in the forbidden land for 20 days.

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I haven't seen my family for 20 days.

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Are you really embarrassed to call me brother?

183
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Your Highness.

184
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I've been busy with Meng'er to fix the meal in the south of the city.

185
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I understand.

186
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I understand.

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We are brothers.

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't know who has been with you since childhood.

189
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Who is helping you fight?

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Who is it?

191
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You're wrong.

192
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
General Chu helped you.

193
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Really?

194
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Chu Guihong.

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Meng'er.

196
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Your Highness.

197
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I was wrong.

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I apologize to you.

199
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
No need.

200
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I tell you.

201
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The most important thing in being a prince is the yard.

202
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If you apologize, what are you going to do?

203
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And I've seen Gu'en long ago.

204
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He's an mature adult.

205
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I will never be sad because you care about other women more.

206
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This behavior is very naive.

207
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Very honest and extremely naive.

208
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Three-year-old child.

209
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Don't ask the prince.

210
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Who are you talking about?

211
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
How can you insult me?

212
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And I tell you.

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You and father think I'm a child who can't grow up.

214
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You never discuss with me.

215
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Now, you want me to grow up instantly.

216
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You said all the truth.

217
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The wrong master is all me.

218
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Is there such a truth?

219
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Your Highness.

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
If you really don't care.

221
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Let's find a batch of police officers.

222
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Explain it all.

223
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's a joke.

224
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What are you doing?

225
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Pay attention to the influence.

226
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Don't talk nonsense.

227
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You make people see you are so naughty.

228
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm a monkey.

229
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Why didn't I find it before?

230
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
These two people are interesting.

231
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But don't you plan to make it clear to General Chu today?

232
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
His Highness is right.

233
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
He cares about you most.

234
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
If he knows you like Li Daxia.

235
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Will you be sad?

236
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What can I do?

237
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
He can't fool people with feelings.

238
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Make it clear earlier.

239
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
In case it will delay him.

240
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Is everything arranged?

241
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Don't worry.

242
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Everything is under control.

243
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Chu Guihong will definitely show his face in front of Miss Song.

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's not you.

245
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Come here.

246
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Sorry.

247
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's not related to the ladies' welcome.

248
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Miss Song.

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Aunt.

250
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Why are you with that guy?

251
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm not.

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm not.

253
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm not.

254
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm not.

255
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Why are you with that guy?

256
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
He is so cunning.

257
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But you have to be careful.

258
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yes.

259
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Why didn't I see Li Daxia?

260
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Where is he?

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The Chief has a mission today.

262
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Miss Song has something to say.

263
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I can tell her.

264
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's good that I'm not here.

265
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
In case Chu Guihong knows.

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I don't know what will happen.

267
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Let me take you in.

268
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Is he new?

269
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yes.

270
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Tingting.

271
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Come.

272
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Try these two dishes.

273
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
If you don't have enough, call me.

274
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'll get you more.

275
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The road is bright and the night is bright.

276
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's full.

277
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Meng.

278
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
There's another one.

279
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Sit here.

280
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Sit there.

281
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I have guests.

282
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Come.

283
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The food smells good.

284
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The old house is in full bloom.

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The city is in full bloom.

286
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Why is there you everywhere?

287
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Qingtan is an orphan.

288
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Don't you know?

289
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What did you say to Shang Guanhe?

290
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Does it have anything to do with you?

291
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What?

292
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You have a cold?

293
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Don't be so nice to me.

294
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Just be nice to me.

295
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Thank you.

296
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I just worried

297
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
if you like dishes.

298
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Please tell me if you like them.

299
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Don't let me make you feel wronged

300
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
just as you did in my mansion.

301
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
When did I do that?

302
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Meng.

303
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Did you really go to the Seventh Prince's mansion

304
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
for dinner?

305
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Okay.

306
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Don't ask about him.

307
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
He has a thin face.

308
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Don't embarrass him.

309
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,320
This is the 16th chapter.

310
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,320
The story of the beauty Yechuan's wife and prince's love affair.

311
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
No way.

312
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,760
Why does it sound like

313
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,360
the story of a young general's engagement

314
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,320
and beating a wrong-doer.

315
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,280
What do you mean?

316
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,000
It's a book.

317
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,040
You've read it all.

318
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,080
Who has read it?

319
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,240
Don't talk nonsense.

320
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,360
I don't know what's in the book.

321
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,200
Sister Zhang, it's about Song family's reputation.

322
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,680
Don't you have anything to say?

323
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,040
Of course I have.

324
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,680
The rumors are only for the wise.

325
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,160
Don't explain it to others.

326
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,000
Of course you can't explain it.

327
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,960
You're obviously scheming.

328
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,680
Okay, I'll listen to you.

329
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,200
Your Highness Qi, you're wrong.

330
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,400
Since it's a rumor,

331
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,800
I'll cut it out.

332
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,480
Meng'er is my fiancee.

333
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,160
It's about this book.

334
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,880
I've been thinking about explaining it.

335
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,480
You're all here today.

336
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,880
I'd like to ask you to clarify it in person.

337
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,200
We haven't talked about it.

338
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,200
Why are you so anxious?

339
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,880
You're too unconfident.

340
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,000
Your Highness Qi,

341
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,000
Meng'er and I have been engaged.

342
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,640
You've been pestering us.

343
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,000
What's the reason?

344
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,680
What's the reason?

345
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,320
Don't you know?

346
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:22,840
You...

347
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,800
Enough.

348
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,880
Are you done?

349
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,040
Okay, I'll take this chance

350
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,240
to explain it to you today.

351
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,960
I don't mean anything to you

352
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,840
or to you.

353
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,880
You're so hard to please.

354
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,120
You're all lying.

355
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,320
If anyone behind me

356
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,480
is talking nonsense,

357
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,080
I'll be rude to him.

358
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Stop looking at me.

359
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,080
Let's eat.

360
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,360
Your Highness,

361
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,120
I've heard that

362
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,520
she knew that you and General Chu

363
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,640
were never together.

364
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,720
She even had an affair with you.

365
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,400
She was so anxious that she couldn't stay.

366
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,880
Your Highness,

367
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,520
I suggest

368
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,600
you issue a decree

369
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,120
to punish her severely.

370
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,600
Who caused the snowfall of the north wind

371
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,560
to turn into ashes?

372
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,240
It's so touching.

373
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,960
It's so touching.

374
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
Everyone,

375
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,920
this is the first time

376
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,760
that Ciyan is held in Cangjiang Music Hall.

377
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,240
The owner asked the little one

378
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,600
to come to the first and second floor

379
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,520
to make the hall full of high-rise buildings.

380
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,760
Please pay attention.

381
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,440
It's said that the ancient country of Rulan

382
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,640
was in a state of panic,

383
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,040
but it was in a state of shock

384
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,440
that it was brought up by the Seven Precious Snow Lotus.

385
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,160
Later, a capable general

386
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,440
was appointed by Jingjing

387
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
to create the four seasons.

388
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,160
Today,

389
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,680
a group of people are fighting for the treasure.

390
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,720
They don't want to lose.

391
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,560
This hairpin

392
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,840
is for the talented.

393
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,680
Good.

394
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,560
Good.

395
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,600
I heard that

396
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,800
every time the thousand-year army came back from Kaixiang,

397
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,280
they would sing a military song

398
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,000
to show the world the thousand-year wind.

399
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,520
But unfortunately,

400
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,720
General Chu has been defeated in the past few years.

401
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,840
It's been a long time since I heard it.

402
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,080
I wonder if General Chu has the mood today

403
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,640
to make everyone happy.

404
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,320
Qi,

405
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,560
did you do it on purpose?

406
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,520
The thousand-year army was defeated.

407
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,800
As the prince of the Great Jing,

408
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,680
do you think it's a shame?

409
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,320
In the battle of Pingrong,

410
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,960
General Chu was defeated

411
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,400
and escaped from the battle.

412
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,560
If it wasn't for the seven-prince's clever plan

413
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,280
to rescue General Chu from the cage of He Yuan people,

414
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,160
I'm afraid that the so-called God of War of the Great Jing

415
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,280
is now a pile of bones on the northern border.

416
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,480
Shut up.

417
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,280
You're just a lowly official.

418
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,400
What do you know?

419
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,160
If you're capable, go to He Yuan and fight with me.

420
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,800
Go.

421
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,640
Your Highness,

422
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,400
you're joking.

423
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,200
I'm a civil official.

424
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,880
I know the principle of a dead man fighting a dead man.

425
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,920
Your Highness,

426
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,240
don't you know?

427
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,000
What dead man?

428
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,600
After General Chu's defeat,

429
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,560
he was not punished,

430
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,520
but was punished by His Majesty.

431
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,560
He was promoted twice.

432
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,800
Of course, there are people who don't agree with it.

433
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,120
So I held this moon banquet

434
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,920
to help General Chu regain his morale.

435
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,120
18th Brother,

436
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,840
I meant well.

437
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,040
You...

438
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,960
This moon banquet,

439
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,400
the seven-prince is the master.

440
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,240
I'm the guest.

441
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,600
I'm not the master.

442
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,200
I have no intention of taking the beauty of people.

443
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,280
You're right.

444
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,680
Qi, you're the master.

445
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,760
You should be the first to play the opening song of the moon banquet.

446
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
Fine.

447
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,520
Look at him.

448
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,960
He must be mean.

449
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,360
Everyone,

450
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,400
the opening song of this moon banquet

451
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,840
is very famous.

452
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,400
It's called

453
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,000
Ping Rong Station,

454
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,920
the return of the red carpet.

455
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,440
The return of the red carpet.

456
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,760
Cousin,

457
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,040
isn't this the return of the red carpet?

458
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
Who is he playing?

459
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,360
Why is he so slippery?

460
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,600
18th Prince,

461
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,440
the return of the red carpet is the General Chu

462
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,080
who is brave and good at war.

463
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,080
Cousin,

464
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,680
why is the return of the red carpet playing your role?

465
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,680
Why did you make the return of the red carpet play your role?

466
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,880
I don't know the details of this matter.

467
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,680
Nonsense.

468
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,080
How did it come to this?

469
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,080
Kill!

470
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,680
Kill!

471
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,680
Kill!

472
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,680
Kill!

473
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,480
He's playing the role of General Chu who is good at war.

474
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,480
This is the guest who surrounded the army.

475
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
Don't be sad.

476
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,080
Ping Rong Station, the return of the red carpet.

477
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,880
I think it's Qingtan, the south bank of the Yan River, who is the traitor.

478
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,080
Are you really Prince Jin?

479
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,480
As Prince Jin,

480
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,480
you let your men humiliate the soldiers of Qianyu Army.

481
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,880
I feel so ashamed for you.

482
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,080
Where are you going?

483
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,280
To play drums.

484
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,480
You can play drums?

485
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,480
Sorry, I've learned drumming for two years.

486
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
Prince Jin.

487
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,080
What's going on with the return of the red carpet?

488
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,680
The return of the red carpet is telling me that he's angry.

489
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,080
He insisted on playing the role of the red carpet.

490
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,680
I can't stop him.

491
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,880
I just need to get rid of the red carpet.

492
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,680
Why are you humiliating the soldiers of Qianyu Army?

493
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,280
A battle has begun.

494
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,080
Thousands of soldiers and horses are following us.

495
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,080
We're going to fight.

496
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,080
A battle has begun.

497
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,080
Thousands of soldiers and horses are following us.

498
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,080
Meng is helping me.

499
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,080
Something's wrong with the drum.

500
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,880
What about this?

501
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
The strong enemy is here.

502
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,080
The battle drums are ringing.

503
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,280
Come here.

504
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,880
Men, get theно.

505
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,080
You lots are theOnes of Jing.

506
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,080
Press international force.

507
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
You're so funny.

508
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,960
You're so funny.

509
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,560
You're so funny.

510
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,120
You should go back home and be a maid.

511
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,240
That's right.

512
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Go home.

513
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
You're so funny.

514
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
You're so funny.

515
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,240
Stop making fun of him.

516
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,240
You're so funny.

517
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,240
You're so funny.

518
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
You're so funny.

519
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
It seems that someone can't sit still.

520
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,240
Nan Heng.

521
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,240
Nan Heng.

522
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,240
Nan Heng.

523
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,240
Hold me.

524
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,880
The Black Army концerted the Giseky rains.

I'm not afraid of anything.

599
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
I'm not afraid of anything.

600
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,640
I'm not afraid of anything.

601
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
I'm not afraid of anything.

602
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
I'm not afraid of anything.

603
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,640
I'm not afraid of anything.

604
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,640
You can't turn back time.

605
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
Great.

606
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,640
Great.

607
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,640
Great.

608
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,640
Great.

609
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
Great.

610
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,640
You're such a hero.

611
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,640
Great.

612
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,640
You're such a hero.

613
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,640
You're such a hero.

614
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
You're a hero.

615
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Great.

616
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,640
Great.

617
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
Great.

618
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,640
Great.

619
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
Didn't I come to humiliate Chu Guihong?

620
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,640
Why did I beat him?

621
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
I won.

622
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,480
I can't help but rush when I hear His Highness's voice.

623
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,440
Brother Miao.

624
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,880
I think Lang Qi is helping you.

625
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,040
He's not helping me.

626
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,680
He's helping Meng.

627
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,920
Don't think I don't know why you're helping me.

628
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,360
Listen.

629
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,360
You've made so many rumors.

630
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,320
You and I can't...

631
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,240
You're thinking too much.

632
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,640
I'm helping you

633
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,760
because of your

634
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,520
women's opinions.

635
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,840
Men must help each other.

636
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,040
Why do you think His Highness

637
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,160
is helping Chu Gui Hong and Song Yi Meng?

638
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,880
Is he out of his mind?

639
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,560
I think you're the most confused.

640
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,840
Why did we make this play today?

641
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,880
To humiliate Chu Gui Hong.

642
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,280
Who is Song Yi Meng?

643
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,160
Wei Gui Meng's wife.

644
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,440
Who is Chu Gui Hong's wife?

645
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,480
The enemy of the Four Seas.

646
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,560
I think you know it.

647
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,400
What do you know?

648
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,480
Don't say a word.

649
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,880
We have two songs in this play.

650
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,560
One is called

651
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,120
The Battle of Pingrong and Gui Hong.

652
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,920
The other one is called

653
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,440
The Blue Lake and the South Roof of the South.

654
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,080
I see.

655
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,040
Your Highness won the game.

656
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,480
And you won the love of Miss Song.

657
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,320
Your Highness is so clever.

658
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,760
I have to go

659
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,480
and set the fire for this play.

660
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,520
They're so harmonious.

661
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,920
It seems that they have a secret love.

662
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,200
They even said it was a rumor.

663
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,120
They're lying.

664
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,640
They made a good song together.

665
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,720
The South Roof of the South

666
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,280
is about to have a new chapter.

667
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,360
Your Highness and Miss Song

668
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,520
fought against each other.

669
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,680
The fish and the eagle are in the air.

670
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,920
It's really a great deal.

671
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,080
It's a pity that

672
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,480
there's only one hairpin.

673
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,120
I'm afraid you two can't tell.

674
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Just give it to him.

675
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,800
To be honest,

676
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,560
I've read this love story in the capital.

677
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,280
The two of you are deeply in love.

678
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,520
It's sad to see it.

679
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,440
Since we have this opportunity today,

680
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,040
why don't you let the Seventh Prince

681
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,920
give Miss Song a hand?

682
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,640
So that we can

683
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,440
fulfill our wishes.

684
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,440
Great.

685
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,680
Great.

686
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,840
Great.

687
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,720
Great.

688
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,520
Great.

689
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,320
Great.

690
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,760
Thanks for your hard work.

691
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,520
You've done a great job.

692
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,320
I shouldn't have given that hairpin to you.

693
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,280
If Miss Song now can be with me,

694
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,280
what'll happen?

695
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,600
I'll apply UV fireworks to SAhhhhU

696
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,560
and they're all mine.

697
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,080
Don't apply it to him.

698
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,640
Where's the hell my hairpin?

699
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,000
No.

700
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,440
I can give you a hand.

701
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,040
Look at him.

702
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,760
You need this anyway.

703
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,240
Is it too early?

704
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,920
Chu Guihong,

705
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,840
if I remember correctly,

706
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,040
Miss Song just helped you to take the throne.

707
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,760
It's fine if others don't agree.

708
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,120
You still have a problem?

709
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,160
General Chu,

710
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,040
have you figured it out?

711
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,720
You want to make a wish today?

712
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,360
It's not allowed to make a wish.

713
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,120
But I have a song

714
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,920
that can be a poem.

715
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,720
It's also called

716
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,720
Pingrong War,

717
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,720
Guihong Camp.

718
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,180
105lively

719
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,840
battle with Pingrong

720
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,480
and bring an army to a city.

721
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,200
hundreds of thousands of bugs.

722
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,400
Please save us,

723
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,720
save us,

724
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,480
please save us,

725

the pH

727
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,200
God's rites,

728
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,760
fall into seconds,

729
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,200
and notes,

730
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,400
disease not applied!

sellaire

732
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:28,200
speaking for life

733
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,200
Two.

734
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:59,400
Three…

735
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,760
Nice!

736
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,840
Well!

737
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,280
Well!

738
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,000
Well!

739
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,680
Well!

740
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,520
Good, good, good.

741
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,080
Cousin.

742
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,280
I didn't expect that.

743
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,880
Your Highness,

744
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,560
according to Chu Guihong,

745
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,440
when the battle of Pingrong

746
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,680
was not completed,

747
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,880
the Qianyu Army

748
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,760
had asked us for reinforcements.

749
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:28,880
But we never

750
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,000
saw their personality.

751
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,640
Do you want me to explain it to him?

752
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,880
Can you tell him

753
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,680
he believes it?

754
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,160
Right.

755
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,880
Your Highness, your reputation

756
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,520
is too bad.

757
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,680
No, no.

758
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,960
I mean,

759
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,600
that...

760
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,560
I've prepared

761
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,760
the script for

762
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,520
the battle of Pingrong.

763
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,360
It won't take long.

764
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,120
This script

765
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,480
will spread to the whole Great Jin.

766
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,400
By then,

767
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,600
we must make him lose.

768
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,840
He can't stand in the capital.

769
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,040
Tear it off.

770
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,000
Your Highness,

771
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,600
you don't want to deal with Chu Guihong?

772
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,800
I'll let you tear it off.

773
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,560
Tear it off.

774
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,920
I'll do it now.

775
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,960
Tear it off.

776
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,200
And,

777
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,880
you go and check the letter of the wish.

778
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,040
Chu Guihong's song

779
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,320
really made us happy.

780
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,280
You're right.

781
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,920
Yeah.

782
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,600
Yeah.

783
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,040
Yeah.

784
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,640
Yeah.

785
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,920
So, Nan He,

786
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,640
you should

787
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,560
give in.

788
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,520
Why should I?

789
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,680
Your Highness,

790
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,480
the capital's moon night

791
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,960
is full of mystery.

792
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,680
I've been there for a long time.

793
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,840
I can't help but forget

794
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,240
the suffering of the people on the border.

795
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,680
I can't help but forget

796
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,240
the difficulties of guarding the territory.

797
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,560
Today, this song

798
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,360
has made the Great Jin a great success.

799
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,680
It has brought glory to our country

800
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,120
and made people admire it.

801
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,400
Yeah.

802
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,000
Yeah.

803
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,280
I didn't expect that

804
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,400
what Tingting said is so good.

805
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,840
Princess Consort,

806
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,000
I've made it.

807
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,280
Yes.

808
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,360
Mu Er.

809
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,120
I was at the border

810
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,920
and delayed the meeting for years.

811
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,920
Now I'm back in the capital.

812
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,480
I'm back in the court.

813
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,960
We've been engaged for a long time.

814
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,800
I'm sorry.

815
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,840
Today,

816
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,360
in front of you...

817
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,720
Chu Yao. Chu Yao.

818
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,000
Don't... don't say it.

819
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,240
Will you marry me?

820
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,720
Yu Xin, Kun Yun.

821
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,000
I, Chu Gui Hong,

822
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,360
swear to protect you

823
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,040
with the name of Lord Qian Yu.

824
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,760
Chu Gui Hong, I...

825
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,880
I object.

826
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,840
My marriage

827
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,520
is not the other person's.

828
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,000
Chu Gui Hong.

829
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,280
If I object,

830
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,880
I'll preheat the opera audition and

831
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,680
celebrate the show after預告相見的

832
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,120
and assemble theusional Chamfer.

833
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,400
suite the new

834
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,040
Gulvenar Dungeon

835
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,360
ofaluable schedule.

836
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,100
The future of Glading D conditioned by shows

837
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,320
in Pure White,

838
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,040
doesn't look bright before she Williams.

839
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,000
Chu Gui Hong,

840
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,600
bursts everywhere that she may induced marriage.

841
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,600
Is it marriage or love?

842
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,760
Is it ok or no?

843
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,680
No matter what,

844
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,480
I'll let Chu Gui Hong take the lead.

845
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,080
Come with me, ma'am.

846
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,280
I'll take Chu Gui Hong.

847
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,240
I'll take the lead.

848
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:17,840
Okay?

849
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,200
Why didn't you tell me

850
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,600
that you would come today?

851
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,680
What if I didn't come?

852
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,000
Just wait and see.

853
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,080
I won't let you down today.

854
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,560
Your Highness,

855
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,480
after the eldest daughter of Song family

856
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,360
came to the family,

857
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,080
she became a good person

858
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,640
and was kind and kind.

859
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,440
The seventh prince, Nan Heng,

860
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,840
hasn't married yet in his prime,

861
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,760
he takes care of the production of sutra cake

862
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,600
and mixed it with the happiness and FEF of carat knot.

863
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,960
All the proposals

864
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,960
belong to me?

865
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,440
That's so再见ness.

866
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,120
Okay, Qi.

867
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,320
I know it now.

868
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,320
Today,

869
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,200
it is all destined by you, right?

870
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,320
Youprenelled the sch apresentation of

871
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,240
street hunting in capital city.

872
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,640
Now that cousin just started to make a move

873
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,840
You do such a thing

874
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,240
You have a means

875
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,240
Rui

876
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,640
How can you be so hostile to your brother

877
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,240
Am i wrong

878
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,440
From childhood

879
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,840
Just count his most means

880
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,040
The deepest thought

881
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,240
And back then

882
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,440
I don't know what he used

883
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,840
Caused my mother

884
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,840
Now you are still holding his position

885
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,840
You are the former thief

886
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,440
This little

887
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,240
Lan Rui

888
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,440
I say it again

889
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,440
The death of the late emperor is none of my business

890
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,840
More relevant to my mother

891
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,240
If you dare to be disrespectful to my mother

892
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,640
Don't blame me for being rude to you

893
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,440
What if I say it

894
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,640
Your high-ranking will use some

895
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,040
Can't get on the stage dirty means

896
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,040
Your uncle is like this

897
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,040
Your mother is like this

898
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,640
You

899
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,640
Niangniang

900
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,240
This

901
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,240
Xu Jiaxia

902
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,040
No, the plot has changed

903
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,040
Nan Heng shouldn't be here

904
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,440
Ask Chu Wei Hong to break his face

905
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,040
What's going on

906
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,640
Your Highness

907
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,240
His Majesty has a decree

908
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,040
The selection of the seventh prince and Miss Song enter the palace

909
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,040
This is the recommendation for your Royal Highness

910
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,340
Shouldn't you do something happy

911
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,240
No

912
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,840
fou

913
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,640
you

914
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,740
Ma'' tourism

915
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,660
Miss. Miss.

916
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,780
Be gentle. Be gentle.

917
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,660
Oh no. Oh no.

918
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,660
What should we do?

919
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,660
Why are you so nervous?

920
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,660
Greetings, Second Miss.

921
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,660
My father should be in the banquet at the Juxiang House.

922
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,660
Go with me to find him.

923
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,660
Ask him to enter the palace immediately.

924
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,660
Yiting, is this matter that serious?

925
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,660
Just now, the two princes were fighting with each other.

926
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,660
This is only to attack the emperor's counterattack.

927
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,660
Someone must bear the wrath of the emperor.

928
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:37,580
Song Yimeng, you are too cruel.

929
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,660
When will I kneel here?

930
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,660
Hold it.

931
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,660
Don't pretend to be a star.

932
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,660
You are not enough to trick me.

933
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,660
Who is tricking you?

934
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,660
Giving marriage is the mother's will.

935
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,660
What does it have to do with me?

936
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,660
Yes. Yes. Yes.

937
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,660
Seventh Prince is the most kind person in the world.

938
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,660
How can it be related to you?

939
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,660
Can you stop talking about Yin and Yang all the time?

940
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,660
It's clearly a fight between the three of you.

941
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,660
How can the Eighteenth Prince

942
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,660
be fine with Chu Gunhong?

943
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,660
I didn't do anything, but I kept kneeling here.

944
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,660
Who did I provoke?

945
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,660
The imperial family can do whatever they want.

946
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,660
The emperor is not...

947
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,660
Miss Song.

948
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,660
His Majesty asked you to enter the Yulan House.

949
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,660
Okay. Okay.

950
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,660
Now...

951
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,660
Now...

952
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,660
As long as you don't let me kneel here,

953
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,660
I can do anything.

954
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,660
I'm so numb.

955
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,660
Be careful when you talk to me.

956
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,660
I know.

957
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,660
I'm sorry.

958
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,660
