00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,990
[Liu Jiao'er, Northern Dumb Girl]

347
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,410
Extraordinary!

348
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,410
Yeah!

349
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,750
A little beauty!

350
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,900
She's indeed worth this price!

351
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,680
What are they doing?

352
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,380
Don't you know, My Lady?

353
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,770
This is a dancer captured at the border.

354
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,940
It was prevalent in the capital
a few years ago.

355
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,340
But since the Qianyu Army
lost that battle,

356
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,600
the border market has been closed.

357
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,360
Such goods are rare now.

358
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,120
Goods...

359
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,630
Goods?

360
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,610
How can people be goods?

361
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,730
150 taels of gold!

362
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
200 taels of gold!

363
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,069
500 taels of gold!

364
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,960
I offer 1,000 taels of gold!

365
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,730
I am

366
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,569
Weichi Yan.

367
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,990
I'm really rich.

368
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,160
This girl might not

369
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,220
be worth much in the past.

370
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,960
But what's the situation now?

371
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,910
His Majesty has confined
the Qianyu Army in the capital.

372
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,480
The trade has been cut off!

373
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,110
Rare stuff's worth big bucks!

374
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,240
1,000 taels of gold! Totally worth it!

375
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,960
1,000 is too high.

376
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,640
It's even enough to buy 100 maids.

377
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,270
Yes, too high.

378
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,160
Yes.

379
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,350
It's not worth it.

380
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,710
Jealous, huh?

381
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,710
This is the power of money.

382
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,400
Look at her pretty face!

383
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,550
The waist!

384
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,750
And the body!

385
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,180
This jerk.

386
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,600
Come on.

387
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,730
Here. Drink it.

388
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,170
Drink it!

389
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,750
Get lost!

390
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,200
What?

391
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,270
You bastard!

392
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,120
What a wretch.

393
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,580
Come on. Get up.

394
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,270
If someone forces you to drink again,

395
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,400
just hit him like this.

396
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,160
Got it?

397
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,570
It's okay. Don't worry.

398
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,590
I'm the heroine.

399
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,640
I have no say in the real world.

400
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,980
But the world of this script is my oyster.

401
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,960
Beat the heroine up!

402
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,450
Oh, God. Seriously?

403
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,270
Yingqiu, let's split up and run!

404
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,940
Follow me.

405
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,210
Help me.

406
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,770
Yes, sir.

407
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,000
Let's run.

408
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,720
Stop!

409
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,430
Stop there!

410
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,680
Come on.

411
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,550
Go after them!

412
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,440
They're over there!

413
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,070
This way.

414
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,310
Hurry up.

415
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,270
Excuse me.

416
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,000
Sorry.

417
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,110
Excuse me.

418
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,200
-Stop!
-Make way!

419
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,970
Stop there!

420
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,830
General.

421
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,110
He's here not to kill anyone

422
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,720
but to test weapons, I think.

423
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,720
Tell our men

424
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,380
to retreat.

425
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,740
Alright, safe now.

426
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,610
Don't worry. They didn't catch up.

427
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,980
No need to thank me.

428
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,370
We're both

429
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,760
victims of the scriptwriter,

430
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,690
suffering from bad luck.

431
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,620
It's okay.

432
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,900
Are you okay?

433
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,480
Pay...

434
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,540
Pay for the 1,000 taels of gold

435
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,730
with your life!

436
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,590
How dare he kill people

437
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,250
in the Waning River Crescent?

438
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,270
Do it!

439
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,020
Kill Lady Song?

440
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,150
Kill that plutocrat.

441
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,350
What about Lady Song?

442
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,270
You do it.

443
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,510
Well, well,

444
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,030
you're leaving it to me now?

445
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,880
Why don't you go

446
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,960
eliminate all of them?

447
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,680
So they won't cause us any more trouble.

448
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,480
Okay.

449
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,440
Didn't the Chief tell us

450
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,170
not to kill irrelevant people?

451
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,490
Kill her!

452
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,640
W-Why is the Chief here?

453
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,080
The plan has changed.

454
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,350
Who are you?

455
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,720
Excuse me.

456
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,130
I'm just passing by.

457
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,590
You guys go on.

458
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,170
Kill her again!

459
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,830
Help!

460
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,030
Shangguan,

461
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,670
what does the Chief mean?

462
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,830
-He...
-Something's off.

463
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,290
We'll talk about it later.

464
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,970
What on earth do you mean, sir?

465
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,880
15 minutes.

466
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,550
Do it after 15 minutes when I'm far away.

467
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,580
Understand?

468
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,310
Is he playing the role
of a martial arts master?

469
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,270
Crazy man.

470
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,730
Kill her again!

471
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,110
Didn't you hear me?

472
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,020
Next time you kill someone,

473
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,820
remember to find a remote place.

474
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,350
Didn't I tell you not to make a scene?

475
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,960
I didn't.

476
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,350
It was you who came out of nowhere

477
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,160
and knocked him off.

478
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,510
What about the auction for that girl?

479
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,510
They even killed her.

480
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,640
No, she didn't die.

481
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,160
We saved that dancer.

482
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,510
The auction for the girl

483
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,400
was a shady trade
made by the guest from outside.

484
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,460
None of our people knew it in advance.

485
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,200
We will make the pay for the audacity

486
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,660
to sell people
in the Waning River Crescent.

487
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,510
Chief!

488
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,680
Chief!

489
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,920
What should we do with those plutocrats?

490
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,930
Sir!

491
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,960
Sir!

492
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,750
Where are you, sir?

493
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,070
Sir...

494
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,450
Sir!

495
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:15,880
Stop running!

496
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,890
I...

497
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,410
I finally caught up with you.

498
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,550
Were it not for you,

499
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,450
the dancer and I would have died.

500
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,960
Sir,

501
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,960
w-what's your name?

502
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,300
Where do you live?

503
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,470
Tell me everything.

504
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,440
I must repay you

505
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,750
for saving my life.

506
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,440
It's nothing.

507
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,950
Don't mention it.

508
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,790
Goodbye.

509
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,300
No way.

510
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,690
I need to know

511
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,200
who my savior is!

512
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,440
What a vicious beauty!

513
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,840
How dare she mess around with our chief?

514
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,300
How indecent!

515
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,550
Do it.

516
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,310
Heartbreak Needle.

517
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,300
One needle to end her life.

518
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,640
Get lost!

519
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,400
Sir.

520
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,830
What does he mean?

521
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,160
I-I got it!

522
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,200
The Chief means that

523
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,510
the weapon we use is too small

524
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,940
to kill her in one shot.

525
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,460
How about this one?

526
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,110
Tear-shedding Darts.

527
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,590
Make them cry for pain.

528
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,270
Come on.

529
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,920
Do it.

530
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,640
Sir!

531
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,350
Are you injured?

532
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,410
No.

533
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,510
Don't lie to me!

534
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,790
You're bleeding.

535
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,680
You definitely got hurt
when you tried to save us.

536
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,880
I said no.

537
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:29,880
It's okay.

538
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,070
Sir, you...

539
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,400
You are good in every way

540
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,770
but a bit stubborn.

541
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,520
You didn't just stand by
and see them kill us.

542
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,680
I can't leave you alone like this,

543
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:36,920
right?

544
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,240
Just let me take a look at your wound.

545
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,110
Let me see if you're okay.

546
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,750
It's late at night.

547
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,680
There are only you and me.

548
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,830
We'd better keep a distance.

549
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,350
Keep a distance? No!

550
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,200
My first priority now

551
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,270
is to take you to the clinic

552
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,110
and see if you're alright.

553
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:46,680
Seriously.

554
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,400
Let's go.

555
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,590
Do it.

556
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,990
What's wrong?

557
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,960
Just stretch a bit.

558
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,600
Well...

559
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,780
Now? Here?

560
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,190
A man should train day and night.

561
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,300
Besides, a master

562
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,500
usually practices martial arts at night.

563
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,590
Chief,

564
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,830
what secret are you hiding?

565
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,510
What is it this time?

566
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,010
Keep stretching.

567
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,490
This just never ends.

568
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,030
As expected,

569
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,740
you can't kill her.

570
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,480
Sir,

571
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,400
what

572
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,400
are we...

573
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,040
Don't get me wrong.

574
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,720
I'm not into you.

575
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,350
I didn't say anything.

576
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,010
Why are you two here?

577
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,480
Did I disturb you?

578
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,000
Chief?

579
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,290
The person who saved me

580
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,480
is your chief?

581
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,740
Yes.

582
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,770
That means

583
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,200
he owns the entire

584
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,790
Waning River Crescent?

585
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,880
Of course.

586
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,830
Who else is

587
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,630
this capable besides our chief?

588
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,620
Oh, my goodness.

589
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,350
I just got to know
a really influential person!

590
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,750
Sirs,

591
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,200
come here.

592
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,830
Come over, please.

593
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,310
I have a few questions to ask about

594
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,720
your chief.

595
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,240
Do it.

596
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,880
Calm down, Yunlong.

597
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,440
The Chief told us

598
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,900
not to act rashly again.

599
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,510
I just want to ask a few questions.

600
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,090
Do you need a meeting for that?

601
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:58,760
Miss,

602
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,350
just a minute.

603
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,140
Dude, are you crazy?

604
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,100
How dare you try to kill
the Chief's woman?

605
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,060
Lust can get one killed.

606
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,920
Get killed?

607
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,830
Miss, well...

608
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,310
He said you were cute.

609
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,830
Cute?

610
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,030
He's from the south.

611
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,040
He has an accent.

612
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,570
From the south?

613
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,380
What accent?

614
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,240
Do it.

615
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,640
Yunlong! Yunlong!

616
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,590
"Do it?" Is it the only thing

617
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,270
in your mind?

618
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,830
"Do it?"

619
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,800
Who are you going to fight?

620
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,750
Not fighting!

621
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,110
H-He said...

622
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,240
Chief Lady!

623
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,910
Right, guys?

624
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,440
Yes.

625
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,960
Chief Lady! Chief Lady!

626
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,590
You call me Chief Lady?

627
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,380
I'm not your Chief Lady.

628
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,160
I'm not.

629
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,880
Do it!

630
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,570
Yunlong! Yunlong!

631
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,460
Why is he dragged away?

632
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,710
Is your brother

633
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,510
a bit

634
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,210
out of his mind?

635
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,030
Yes.

636
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,000
Leave him alone.

637
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,530
Let's get down to business.

638
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,790
Business?

639
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,130
What business?

640
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,420
What is this?

641
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,750
Customer registration.

642
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,620
Customer registration?

643
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,960
Name, residence,

644
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,790
height, weight,

645
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,750
hobbies, quirks,

646
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,480
ideal partner.

647
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,830
Can you accept a masked man?

648
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,440
Can you accept an unsocial and boring man?

649
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,760
I've got it done as you said.

650
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,560
Keep every mouth shut.

651
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,750
Those plutocrats won't know what happened

652
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,280
when they wake up tomorrow.

653
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,500
Why did you

654
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,620
strike in the forest just now?

655
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,750
Because I wanted to confirm something.

656
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,160
What was it?

657
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,170
You can't kill Song Yimeng, right?

658
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,890
The Seventh Prince.

659
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,310
What are you trying to say?

660
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,480
I mean,

661
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,110
I'm the only Nightwalker

662
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,180
who knows your real identity.

663
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,600
Given our deep friendship,

664
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,230
why are you even hiding it from me?

665
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,430
I'm heartbroken.

666
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,850
Just do whatever I tell you to do.

667
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,480
Don't ask about anything else.

668
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,040
But I'm curious.

669
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,830
At first,

670
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,490
I just found it quite weird.

671
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,690
You are the Seventh Prince.

672
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,800
You could have
wiped out a weak woman easily.

673
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,200
Why did you have to use

674
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,620
your trump card, Nightwalkers?

675
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:52,190
Or why did you have to do it yourself?

676
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,090
There's only one answer.

677
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,540
There must be some connection

678
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,120
between you and her.

679
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,500
When Song Yimeng's in danger,

680
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,440
you must go save her.

681
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,760
Just like when the plutocrat
tried to kill her

682
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,130
and when Yunlong, Shanhu, and I
attempted to assassinate her.

683
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,160
Am I

684
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,310
right?

685
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,840
I thought you'd only conclude it

686
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,910
as some romantic stuff.

687
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,360
I did think about it that way.

688
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,790
But I know you well.

689
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,790
Even if the ocean is upside down,

690
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,030
and heaven and earth converge,

691
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,450
you, the stubborn bachelor, will never

692
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,300
fall for or court any woman,

693
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,500
let alone give up your principle.

694
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,840
You know what?

695
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,350
I like smart people,

696
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,480
but I don't like people
who are way too smart.

697
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,310
Three years ago,

698
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,310
I got you out of the celestial prison.

699
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,310
Three years later,

700
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,360
I can send you back as well.

701
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,440
Fine, fine.

702
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,600
I see.

703
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,170
My wretched life is in your hands,

704
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:46,930
alright?

705
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,080
What about Song Yimeng then?

706
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,550
How should we deal with her after tonight?

707
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,160
See?

708
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,660
You've been searching for
the method of weapon forging for years,

709
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,720
yet making no progress.

710
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,930
Now the chance is right in front of you.

711
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,700
You never thought about using Song Yimeng

712
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,340
to steal it from Chu Guihong?

713
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,440
If you could come up with it,

714
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,100
don't you think I already did?

715
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,480
Song Yimeng is afraid of me.

716
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,150
But she is cunning

717
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,370
and can't be trusted.

718
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,810
A person who can't work for me

719
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,540
and knows too many of my secrets

720
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:24,790
will be a threat if I keep her alive.

721
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,110
You're wrong.

722
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,330
Song Yimeng is afraid of

723
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,630
[Grace & Elegance]

724
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,350
that stern and aloof Seventh Prince,
Nan Heng.

725
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,550
But your current identity

726
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,230
is Li Shiliu, the chivalrous swordsman

727
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,760
who saved her from danger.

728
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,290
Since she's so mysterious

729
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,820
and on good terms with Chu Guihong,

730
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,190
and she may also know how Chu Guihong

731
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:47,200
and the Eighteenth Prince
plan to fight for the throne,

732
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,320
you might as well
get close to her as her savior

733
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,870
to investigate everything

734
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,340
and move step by step.

735
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,490
Isn't it good?

736
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,540
Look.

737
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,550
The traditional information recording

738
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,550
lacks categorization and summary.

739
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,120
It leads to low efficiency

740
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,200
and difficulty in pinpointing data.

741
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,420
It's different now.

742
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,310
Categorizing the data

743
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:21,080
[Name, Age, Family]

744
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,480
not only makes it so clear

745
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,750
but also archives everything

746
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,090
in an efficient way.

747
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,350
It's indeed so clear now!

748
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,240
A lady from an official family

749
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,440
is really something!

750
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,090
It's nothing.

751
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,700
Just a necessary skill in the workplace.

752
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,000
From now on,

753
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,030
you can use it to evaluate

754
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,890
each visitor's overall profile.

755
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,200
There are no other visitors.

756
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,720
You're the only one who can make our chief
give up his principle.

757
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,590
Me?

758
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,640
But I just met your chief.

759
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,870
I don't even know his name.

760
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:51,830
Exactly.

761
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,030
This

762
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:55,250
is one of our chief's biggest problems.

763
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,640
He loves doing good deeds
but never tells anyone his name.

764
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,440
Of course,

765
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,450
he has many other problems.

766
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,820
For example?

767
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,500
The Chief doesn't like women!

768
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,750
Don't listen to his gibberish.

769
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,300
There's no way
the Chief doesn't like women!

770
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,489
He's swamped with

771
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,659
the gang's affairs every day,

772
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,860
so he doesn't have time
to find himself a wife!

773
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,940
I'm begging you.

774
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,380
Stop messing around.

775
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:19,290
Thanks to our chief's dedication,

776
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,770
we can eat well

777
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,540
dress well,

778
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,880
and don't have to sleep rough

779
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,020
or struggle for our lives.

780
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,889
He's the one and only Chief Master
who means so much

781
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:27,210
to each one of us.

782
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,280
That is Li Shiliu!

783
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,409
Pear pomegranate?
(Sounds the same in Chinese.)

784
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:34,290
There's such an outstanding character
in the script?

785
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,949
Why didn't I notice it before?

786
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,050
The client

787
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,400
asked the Chief

788
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,730
to kill you.

789
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,489
The client asked the Chief to kill

790
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,909
me...

791
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,330
So,

792
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,179
you brought me here on purpose.

793
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,480
It was a trap set by Nan Heng?

794
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,110
Miss Song,

795
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,230
our chief did receive

796
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,690
the Seventh Prince's commission
to kill you.

797
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,890
But he is really
deeply in love with you.

798
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,650
Otherwise, he

799
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,050
wouldn't have stopped us from killing you.

800
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,480
So,

801
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,750
you all want to kill me?

802
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:15,440
No.

803
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,150
Help!

804
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:16,860
Stop!

805
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:18,590
Help!

806
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:18,960
Miss! Miss!

807
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,920
Let me explain.

808
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,760
Don't get us wrong.

809
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,860
This is a misunderstanding.

810
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,130
Stop explaining.

811
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,090
What's the fuss?

812
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,080
Chief Master.

813
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,830
Did they bully you?

814
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,160
No, we didn't.

815
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,240
No, Chief.

816
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,610
We get along well with Miss Song.

817
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,880
Right, Miss Song?

818
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,140
Miss Song,

819
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,700
they are just some

820
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,400
vulgar folks of the martial world.

821
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,600
I hope you don't mind.

822
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,440
However,

823
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,590
we don't intend to participate
in the court fights.

824
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,220
So, Miss Song, please don't tell anyone

825
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,880
about tonight's incident
when you return home.

826
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,400
You mean

827
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,360
you will let me go?

828
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,530
Sir, don't worry.

829
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,790
You saved my life.

830
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,280
I won't cause you any trouble.

831
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,080
Rest assured.

832
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:16,830
Thank you then.

833
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:18,810
Yunlong, Shanhu.

834
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:19,520
Yes, Chief.

835
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,090
Escort Miss Song back.

836
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,140
No.

837
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,210
We have some guests from the army tonight.

838
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,750
Yunlong and Shanhu will go with me
to wrap it up.

839
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,760
They're not available.

840
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,700
What about Huang and Li?

841
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,850
There's a shop in debt.

842
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,030
They have to do the dirty work.

843
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,860
What about Luo?

844
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,110
He's rushing home.
His wife is about to give birth.

845
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,280
No one is available

846
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,480
throughout our Waning River Crescent?

847
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,940
You're available, Chief.

848
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,170
The beauty's way back

849
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,470
is treacherous.

850
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,150
It has to be you escorting her.

851
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,260
Maybe I should go home by myself.

852
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,460
No way.

853
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,530
We Nightwalkers are known for chivalry.

854
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,000
How can we let a weak woman like you

855
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,600
leave on your own?

856
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:58,830
Am I right,

857
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,080
Chief?

858
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,150
Please.

859
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,440
You might as well
get close to her as her savior

860
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,340
to investigate everything

861
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,830
and move step by step.

862
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,750
Isn't it good?

863
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,440
Our chief did receive

864
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,020
the Seventh Prince's commission
to kill you.

865
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,270
But he is really
deeply in love with you.

866
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,030
Otherwise, he

867
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,430
wouldn't have stopped us from killing you.

868
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,390
-Well...
-Miss Song.

869
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,800
You go first.

870
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,040
You go first.

871
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,800
Okay, I'll go first.

872
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,430
Yunlong and Shanhu told me everything.

873
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,150
What did they say?

874
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,480
They said...

875
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,890
They said you

876
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,830
received the mission to kill me.

877
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,410
But you definitely had no choice.

878
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,600
Right, sir?

879
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,770
Yeah.

880
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,750
Of course

881
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,420
I was forced to do so.

882
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,130
Those idiots.

883
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:28,890
Well,

884
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,930
you saved me in the end.

885
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,280
Sir,

886
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,960
although we haven't known
each other for long,

887
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,190
I can tell that

888
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,730
you, Yunlong, and Shanhu are not bad guys.

889
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,090
You're all nice people.

890
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,930
You ended up working

891
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,580
as assassins for others

892
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,420
in the martial world

893
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,340
for some unknown reasons,

894
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,390
right?

895
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,990
What do you want to say, Miss Song?

896
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,230
I mean...

897
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,030
Sir,

898
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,230
although you let me go today,

899
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,630
based on what I know about Nan Heng,

900
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,450
he won't let you go for sure.

901
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,640
What's worse,

902
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:10,420
he will also go after
your treasured Waning River Crescent

903
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,780
as well as your men.

904
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,880
So,

905
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,540
I have a suggestion.

906
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,770
I hope our kind "villagers"

907
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,720
share the same goal

908
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,050
and join hands

909
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,740
to fight that cruel "werewolf."

910
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,070
Okay?

911
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,440
"Werewolf"?

912
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,490
"Villagers"?

913
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,130
Well, you mean

914
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,950
you want me to join hands with you

915
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,430
to fight that high and mighty prince?

916
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,440
Yes, that's what I mean.

917
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,420
It's also for the sake

918
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,890
of your safety.

919
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,630
Why do you think

920
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,960
Nan Heng won't let me go?

921
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,710
Because he is a bad guy!

922
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,220
Bad guy, you know?

923
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,500
He kills without blinking an eye.

924
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,920
Sir, during all these years
in the martial world,

925
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,590
you must have also heard of that.

926
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,550
He's just ambitious,

927
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,530
ruthless,

928
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,080
heartless,

929
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,030
doing all evil deeds,

930
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,920
framing loyal officials,

931
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,980
and hurting women.

932
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,440
Weren't it not for the script rule...

933
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,180
That's ridiculous.

934
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,550
Right?

935
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,830
You also think he's ridiculous, huh?

936
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,230
I just don't get it.

937
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,620
Why can someone like him

938
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,330
keep staying in that high position

939
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:15,190
and doing evil?

940
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,470
There's no justice!

941
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:19,550
Fine.

942
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,480
If Nan Heng were really

943
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,900
as evil as you said,

944
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,190
then tell me—

945
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,010
during the Jinyang Mutiny four years ago

946
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,710
when the Qianyu Army
stepped aside and did nothing,

947
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,590
why would he lead

948
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,630
the Xuanjia Army to fight
for seven days to quell the unrest?

949
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,120
Just for show?

950
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,350
Of course!

951
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,540
You never thought about

952
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,790
why he did this?

953
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:42,650
Why?

954
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,630
Because he coveted Jinyang's mine.

955
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,370
He misappropriated the government's funds

956
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,500
in the name of suppressing the unrest.

957
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,800
Fine.

958
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,660
How about this?

959
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,840
In the Battle of Tancheng five years ago,

960
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,480
the Xuanjia Army was trapped
in Yangu Pass.

961
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,800
Chu Guihong was supposed to back them up,

962
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,220
yet he didn't do anything.

963
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,400
It was Nan Heng
who led 2,000 Xuanjia soldiers

964
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,100
to fight a fierce battle for 49 days
and successfully defend the pass.

965
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,960
What do you have to say about that?

966
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,050
Sir,

967
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,390
it was all because Nan Heng
underestimated the enemy,

968
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,880
acted recklessly,
and fell into their trap.

969
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,940
Otherwise, things wouldn't
have gotten that worse.

970
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,900
Don't blame it on anyone else.

971
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,470
Fine.

972
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,990
Let's forget about them.

973
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,400
Ten years ago,

974
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,030
in the nationwide war against Dongshuo,

975
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,710
5,000 Xuanjia soldiers

976
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,630
confronted 40,000 elite Dongshuo soldiers.

977
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,440
Were it not for Nan Heng who charged

978
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,580
and beheaded the enemy general,

979
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,880
how could they have reversed
the three months of consecutive defeats

980
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,340
and brought ten years
of peace to the border?

981
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:37,960
What's wrong?

982
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,940
Sir, do you hear that?

983
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,700
Hear what?

984
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,810
How reckless Nan Heng was!

985
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,280
5,000 against 40,000.

986
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,480
Was he out of his mind?

987
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,550
He didn't coordinate
and give orders at the back.

988
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,000
As a general, he charged at the front

989
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,190
to steal the show!

990
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,550
You know what, Mr. Li?

991
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:51,960
Nan Heng is...

992
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,360
He...

993
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,400
He might be somewhat insane.
