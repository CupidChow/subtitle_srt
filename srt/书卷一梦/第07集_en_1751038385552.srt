1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Episode 15

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Then we won't fight with them.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Ten years ago, during the battle with Dongshuo,

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
the Black Armor Army had five thousand soldiers and horses,

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and they fought against Dongshuo's forty thousand soldiers.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If Nan Heng hadn't taken the lead in the battle,

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and won the enemy's general's first battle,

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
how could he have turned the tables in the third month

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and changed the peace of the border for ten years?

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What's wrong?

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Listen to me.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What?

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Nan Heng is so arrogant.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Five thousand against forty thousand.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What is he thinking?

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He's not doing well.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He's in the rear-end ranking.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He's a general in the front.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:13,780
He's a

54
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,780
You're right.

55
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,780
He's really out of his mind.

56
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,780
Otherwise, why would I tell you this?

57
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,780
What did you say?

58
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,780
Nothing.

59
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
I mean,

60
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
all the hardships are others'

61
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,560
and all the mistakes are Nan Heng's.

62
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,560
Miss Song is really good at hiding things.

63
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,560
She's really...

64
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,560
So smart and smart.

65
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,560
You can see through Nan Heng's true nature at a glance.

66
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Right?

67
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,560
I know all of this.

68
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
Let me tell you this, Hero Ye.

69
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
In this world,

70
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
the person who knows Nan Heng the most

71
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,560
is me.

72
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
No.

73
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,340
There's another person.

74
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,340
Guess who it is.

75
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,340
I'm not guessing.

76
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,340
I've arrived at Song's Mansion.

77
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,340
See you later.

78
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,340
Hero!

79
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,340
Hero, don't go!

80
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,340
Think about it.

81
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,340
I'm telling you.

82
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,340
Contact me when you're done!

83
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,340
A wild man's ambition.

84
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,340
He's cruel and merciless.

85
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,120
He's not evil,

86
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
but he's a traitor.

87
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,120
He even killed a woman.

88
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
I'm so sick of this evil woman.

89
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,120
A wild man's ambition is cruel and merciless.

90
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,120
He's not evil, but he's a traitor.

91
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,120
Everyone says so.

92
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
You're used to it.

93
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
Your Highness,

94
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
when did you kill a woman?

95
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Get out of here, San Jiang Yue!

96
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
Call Shang Guan He here!

97
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
Yes.

98
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,120
My Highness is as confused as that Shang Guan useless man.

100
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
It hurts!

101
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,120
You're trying to kill me, grandson?

102
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
Brother!

103
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,120
Brother!

104
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
I came as soon as I heard about it.

105
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,120
What happened?

106
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Didn't you say you were being bullied?

107
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,120
How could you do this?

108
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,120
Your Highness,

109
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,120
it's not easy to enter the Yue Hui Manor.

110
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
Li Shiliu?

111
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,120
Is it really Li Shiliu?

112
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,720
Yes.

113
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,320
Miss, you're so lucky.

114
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,240
What?

115
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
Is she that famous?

116
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,840
Of course.

117
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,600
She is the best-seller

118
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,480
of all the women in the capital.

119
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,320
She is also the most popular

120
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,600
among Chu Guihong and General Chu.

121
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,880
Rumor has it that she is cold-hearted

122
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,120
and never shows herself.

123
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,320
But she shows up today

124
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,360
and saves you.

125
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,520
Is this the past life?

126
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,160
She's so affectionate.

127
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,760
Stop. Stop. Stop.

128
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,480
Can you stop being so romantic?

129
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,600
It's all my fault.

130
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,520
I was too focused on the plot.

131
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,000
I didn't expect her to be so popular.

132
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,800
Wait.

133
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,200
Is it possible that

134
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,440
she's not the character in the script,

135
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,960
but the variable of her independent existence?

136
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,200
It's his past.

137
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,480
You don't know much about him.

138
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,800
Go to meet his friends first.

139
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,080
What's this?

140
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,980
500

141
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,580
looks like 16 works.

142
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,720
And he has a Comme?

143
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,520
And this is his?

144
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,900
Ms. Song is quick

145
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,560
to find the antidote.

146
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,840
Don't trouble yourself

147
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,400
by reading many of her 104 books.

148
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,360
You're so unworthy of my words.

149
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,560
What's more,

150
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Your Highness is just a little bit wrong.

151
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,880
You don't have many chances.

152
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,360
You were once tricked by me,

153
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,480
once attacked by the enemy's secret guards,

154
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,040
once robbed of food,

155
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
and once burned.

156
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Those are all young things.

157
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,160
What do you mean by that?

158
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,320
Are you saying that Your Highness is not young anymore?

159
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,840
Stop talking nonsense.

160
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,040
Your Highness is in your prime.

161
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,080
Although you have some wrinkles on your face,

162
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,000
you can still make 80

163
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Say it.

164
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,160
Your Highness,

165
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,080
Shangguan doesn't know the court.

166
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
So I have to say that

167
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,360
you are working hard to manage the silk factory.

168
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,680
You are doing this to secretly train your soldiers

169
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,600
and collect information for later use.

170
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,400
You can't let anyone else know about this.

171
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,200
Even if you want to use Li Shiliu's identity

172
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,520
to ally with Miss Song,

173
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,200
it's hard to guarantee that she won't know

174
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,400
your secret and plan in the future.

175
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,200
If 18th Prince knows about this,

176
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,400
he will be in a bad situation.

177
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,600
He can't come back.

178
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,640
Fugui,

179
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,040
there is no such thing as a simple meal.

180
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,880
You can't be a tiger who doesn't learn from a tiger.

181
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,600
Then you can't take the risk yourself.

182
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Let me ask you.

183
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,400
Do you have any way

184
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,360
to break the mechanism in Song Yunmeng's mouth?

185
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,960
Since you can't break it, you have to use it.

186
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,480
Don't forget.

187
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,200
Tonight, you will attack Chu Guihong.

188
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,760
How do you want to end this?

189
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,760
Why do people in the martial arts world

190
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,520
come to you for your illness?

191
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,440
Is it because of the way to break the knife?

192
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,040
Only one person cares about the way to break the knife.

193
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,400
So I suspect

194
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,120
Li Shiliu is very likely to be a man from Nanheng.

195
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,960
What?

196
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,280
Oh no.

197
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,840
If so,

198
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,640
the card in my hand is more valuable than we think.

199
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,720
Not only that,

200
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,440
the act of thievery is a secret action.

201
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,560
But Li Shiliu seems to know the news in advance.

202
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,360
Your Highness.

203
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,520
I'm afraid

204
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,680
our people may be involved in Nanheng's spy.

205
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,960
No way.

206
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,120
Don't scare me.

207
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,440
I'm afraid you're too cautious.

208
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,760
It's all Nanheng's fault.

209
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,800
How could he make people panic here?

210
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,400
Your Highness.

211
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,600
If Li Shiliu is really a card in Nanheng's hand,

212
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,200
we can't just ignore it.

213
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,440
Yes.

214
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,840
But the point is we don't know

215
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,360
if he has a card in his hand.

216
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,600
We can't just ignore it.

217
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,440
Yes.

218
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,000
But the point is we don't know

219
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,960
if he has a card in his hand.

220
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,000
I have a good idea to confirm it.

221
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,440
But you need to help me

222
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,560
personally.

223
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,280
No.

224
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,320
I disagree.

225
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,960
Your Highness is respected and respected.

226
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,520
Why do you always treat Song Yimeng so well?

227
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,560
But even if you break up

228
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,360
Song Yimeng's marriage with Chu Weihong,

229
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,720
the Song family may not support you.

230
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,520
But if you let the two families get married,

231
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,600
I'm afraid the chief hasn't found a way to break up.

232
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,240
He has lost the chance to get married.

233
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
You're responsible for it.

234
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,200
I won't sit and wait.

235
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,400
Your Highness.

236
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,160
Shut up.

237
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,560
But Li Shiliu is a wild beast.

238
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,200
But Song Yimeng is a noble girl.

239
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,760
It's hard to fall for her.

240
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
So you should be closer to Song Yimeng

241
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,120
as a close friend.

242
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,560
Chu Weihong is a fiance.

243
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,000
He can't be angry.

244
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,480
As long as they have a good relationship,

245
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,240
they will get married sooner or later.

246
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,600
You're so wronged

247
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,200
to make a fool of yourself.

248
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,920
Say it.

249
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,760
It's not entirely right.

250
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,600
I think Li Daxia

251
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,280
is not only a man of the martial arts world.

252
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,320
He is also very kind.

253
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,280
He took in many homeless people in Cangjiang.

254
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,760
I saw them tonight.

255
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,000
They are all kind.

256
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,280
Yes.

257
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,000
The flood three years ago.

258
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,320
The ice disaster four years ago.

259
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,360
These are all because of the political conflict in Nanheng.

260
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,560
It's a disaster.

261
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,280
Song Yimeng.

262
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,640
You're saved.

263
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,120
You're saved.

264
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:18,960
You're saved.

265
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,720
Miss.

266
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,240
I don't understand.

267
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,920
Why?

268
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,600
Look.

269
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,760
The music of the river

270
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,680
is taken in by

271
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,720
the homeless people

272
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,080
because of the evil Nanheng did.

273
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
They must hate Nanheng.

274
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,640
No wonder Li Daxia

275
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,200
asked me so many questions about Nanheng tonight.

276
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,320
So this is testing my position

277
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,240
and testing my determination.

278
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,640
What are you going to do?

279
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,120
To deal with the Seventh Prince,

280
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,280
I need to be the first.

281
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,760
To deal with Nanheng,

282
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,880
I need to be sincere.

283
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,200
If the Seventh Prince knows about this,

284
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,000
what if his identity is exposed?

285
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,960
Then do it in advance.

286
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,680
Kill him.

287
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,840
Here.

288
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,880
What do you mean?

289
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,480
The best way to make friends

290
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,920
is to write a letter

291
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,280
and put your sincerity on paper.

292
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,480
It's the most useful for women.

293
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,680
I don't have that much time.

294
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,880
I do.

295
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,440
Don't look at me.

296
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,120
I have 80 love poems in my mind at any time.

297
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,440
You?

298
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,840
Okay.

299
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,160
I'll see what I can do.

300
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,480
Don't worry.

301
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,080
Leave it to me.

302
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,040
I'm sure I'll do it right.

303
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,880
Miss.

304
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,920
Miss.

305
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,120
Lin Shiliu.

306
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,880
Lin Shiliu is here.

307
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,680
Lin Shiliu?

308
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,600
I'm glad to see you.

309
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,680
The flowers are blooming in the capital.

310
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,040
I'm so grateful for the last meeting with you.

311
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,360
I'll recite a poem for you.

312
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,200
The flowers are blooming in the capital.

313
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,800
I'm so grateful for the last meeting with you.

314
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,240
I'm so grateful for the last meeting with you.

315
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,760
The flowers are blooming in the capital.

316
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,040
I'm so grateful for the last meeting with you.

317
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,360
What's this?

318
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,800
It's been days.

319
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,800
Why are you so tired?

320
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,200
Hero.

321
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,800
Don't read weird poems.

322
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,640
You'll be hurt if you read them all.

323
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,480
It's not good for your body.

324
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Brothers.

325
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,720
The second master ordered

326
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,200
we should turn the most practical bridge into a book.

327
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,520
Let's create a perfect beauty for the boss.

328
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,080
Come on.

329
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,640
Beauty.

330
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,600
No woman

331
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,000
will be touched by a handsome, strong and miserable man.

332
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,480
If there is,

333
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,080
it means he's not beautiful, strong or miserable.

334
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,040
Come on, brother.

335
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,480
Come on.

336
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
Don't copy this.

337
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,800
Come on.

338
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,320
Come on, brother.

339
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,480
Put this book there.

340
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,480
The thousand years of exploration.

341
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,440
Li Shiliu's 99th self-sacrifice.

342
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,160
That's the beauty.

343
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The first love.

344
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,040
Three years old, lost father.

345
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,640
Five years old, lost mother.

346
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,120
The only love dog left him.

347
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,000
Self-study martial arts.

348
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,080
The meridians are broken.

349
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,280
Then the fire is reborn.

350
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,560
When did I have such an experience?

351
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,440
There's more.

352
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,000
The body weighs 128 tons.

353
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,400
Buried in the valley, the meridians are reborn.

354
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,480
I'm not doing this for the sake of the gang...

355
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,800
I'm doing this for you.

356
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,760
Li Xiangci.

357
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,480
Li Xiangci.

358
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,320
Nonsense.

359
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,800
You're so stubborn.

360
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,760
Li Shiliu.

361
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,160
laughter.

362
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,880
Li Shiliu.

363
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,680
Is Li Shiliu dead?

364
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,800
Li Shiliu.

365
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,720
Li Shiliu.

366
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,320
Did you say?

367
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
Yinlan.

368
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,480
Ni Changeds.

369
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,960
Lord is fine.

370
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
I'm sorry.

371
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,160
What does Song Yimeng mean?

372
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,680
Your Highness, be careful of poison.

373
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,920
Let Mr. Shangguan eat it first.

374
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,240
I'll shut up.

375
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,200
What's the matter?

376
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,800
Your Highness.

377
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Song Yimeng

378
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,200
is in trouble.

379
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,200
Your Highness.

380
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,320
His Highness has just sent a letter.

381
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,560
Tomorrow at noon,

382
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,120
the music hall will be opened.

383
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,520
His Highness has a bad temper.

384
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,120
He's like seeing you outside the palace.

385
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,640
A few days ago, Chu Gui was in the music hall.

386
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,880
He just fought with you.

387
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,720
Today, Nanrui sent a invitation.

388
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,000
Interesting.

389
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,840
You're smart.

390
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,080
You dare to take him in?

391
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,920
Are you going tomorrow?

392
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,560
Yes.

393
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,920
It's not a good time.

394
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,240
I'll come back later.

395
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,640
Since he went out,

396
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,280
His Majesty has returned his father's belongings

397
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,720
to the Prince of Qianyu's Mansion.

398
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,160
He said he was the owner of the martial arts club.

399
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,560
He actually wants to threaten you.

400
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,160
He thought that if he had that thing,

401
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,240
he would be like a tiger.

402
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,080
So he decided to cut off his wings.

403
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,360
It seems that Hu's skillful hands

404
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,000
can finally be useful.

405
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,600
Maybe if he has that thing,

406
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,840
he can break the way of cutting the sword.

407
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,040
What are you talking about?

408
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,280
Can you make me understand?

409
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,720
Qianyu's cutting the moon.

410
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,280
What?

411
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,080
Theursé!

412
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,960
In this place,

413
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,040
nowhere can you show love.

414
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,840
In this place,

415
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,320
you can't show love,

416
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,960
as if this is love.

417
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,000
Sり queen Guhere talks with you.

418
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,400
To see whether they love each other or not,

419
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,120
Sко's Legend,

420
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,000
has tried to change it.

421
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,240
Because Sko's Legend

422
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,000
only appears in the worldク

423
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,520
after failing enough.

424
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Don't be afraid.

425
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
Don't be afraid.

426
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,520
Sir.

427
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
Sir.

428
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
Sir.

429
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
Sir.

430
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
Sir.

431
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
Sir.

432
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
Sir.

433
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
Sir.

434
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
Sir.

435
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
Let's go.

436
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
Are you deaf?

437
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
Let's go.

438
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,520
Guys.

439
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,520
Guys.

440
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
Get ready.

441
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,520
Miss Song.

442
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,520
Miss Song.

443
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,520
Why is she here?

444
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
Guys.

445
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,520
When you enter the club later,

446
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,520
you must pay attention to your own behavior.

447
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
Don't make a big deal of it.

448
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,520
In case you disturb our future sister-in-law.

449
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,520
Our general's happiness is in our hands.

450
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,520
Do you understand?

451
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
Yes.

452
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
Go.

453
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Go.

454
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
Go.

455
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,520
Go.

456
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,520
Go.

457
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
Go.

458
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
Go.

459
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
Go.

460
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
Go.

461
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Go.

462
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
Go.

463
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,520
Hu.

464
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
Hu.

465
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Sister-in-law is here.

466
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,520
Sorry to bother you.

467
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,520
Is your boss here?

468
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Boss?

469
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,520
Didn't boss tell you that he's not here today?

470
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
He...

471
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,520
Is he here?

472
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,520
You invited me here today.

473
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,520
What's the matter?

474
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,520
What's the matter?

475
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
What's the matter?

476
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
Yes.

477
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
What's the matter?

478
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,520
Cangjiang Club is very famous in the capital.

479
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,520
Have you been here?

480
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,520
Have you been here?

481
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
I...

482
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,520
I asked you the reason.

483
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
You answer first.

484
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,520
I'm the boss.

485
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
You answer first.

486
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,520
No.

487
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
You...

488
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Why don't you play the cards in the usual way?

489
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,520
Gu Xing is never in the usual way.

490
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,520
I'm Changlin.

491
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
What are you doing?

492
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
What are you doing?

493
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
What's this?

494
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,520
Am I a tiger in your heart?

495
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,520
You are so afraid.

496
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Are you afraid of me today?

497
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
Nonsense.

498
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
I...

499
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,520
What's wrong with my face?

500
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Besides, I'm a man of great virtue.

501
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
When have I ever been afraid of you?

502
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,520
I...

503
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,520
That's good.

504
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,520
If you have any worries,

505
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
just tell me.

506
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,520
Don't let others

507
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,520
hold your nose.

508
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,520
No one else.

509
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,520
Sister-in-law.

510
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
This is the first floor of the club.

511
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
It's called Guan Yue.

512
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,520
Be careful of the steps.

513
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Why is it called Guan Yue?

514
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
Because it's the main business area.

515
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,520
There are games, transactions, songs and restaurants in the hall.

516
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,520
It's all available.

517
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,520
At the same time,

518
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,520
it's also the meeting place for the boss and our Ye You Shen.

519
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
The first floor is the second floor.

520
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
The second floor is more interesting.

521
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
Sister-in-law, follow me.

522
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,520
Coming.

523
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,520
The second floor is called Wang Yue.

524
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,520
There are rooms, bags and quiet places.

525
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,520
Boss's business is always here.

526
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Sister-in-law, look here.

527
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
Slow down.

528
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,520
This is the third floor.

529
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,520
This is the third floor.

530
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
Ming Yue Hiding.

531
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,520
It's the place where Ye You Shen discusses the secret room.

532
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Ordinary people can't come up.

533
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
I'm an ordinary person.

534
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
Then I'll just look around.

535
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Sister-in-law.

536
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
You're not an ordinary person.

537
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
You're one of us.

538
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520
Just look around.

539
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
Look there.

540
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,520
That's the news room.

541
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,520
It's very private.

542
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,520
I'm telling you.

543
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
All people are...

544
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
Stop.

545
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,520
Brother Fu.

546
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,520
You don't have to be so detailed.

547
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
I'm not that interested.

548
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,520
No.

549
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
Sister-in-law is going to be the hostess in the future.

550
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
You have to listen carefully.

551
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
The sooner I die, the sooner I'll die.

552
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
But Brother Fu.

553
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,520
You've been here with me for half an hour.

554
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,520
When can I see your boss?

555
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
The second boss ordered

556
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,520
that you must understand the whole Ye You Shen's business.

557
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,520
And you have to do it as a rule.

558
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,520
I'll show you the fourth floor.

559
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
This is the fourth floor.

560
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
Ming Yue Wan Yue.

561
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,520
You can see the whole Cang Jiang Yue.

562
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,520
Look.

563
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,520
This is the whole country that the boss has built for you.

564
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,520
And the whole fish pond.

565
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
Besides,

566
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
there's another place under the water.

567
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
Ming Yun Yin Yue.

568
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,520
But that's the boss's private territory.

569
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
We don't know what he's doing.

570
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,520
But don't worry.

571
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,520
There's no woman.

572
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,520
A'Long.

573
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
Let's go.

574
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,520
Oh no.

575
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,520
Miss Song has to see him now.

576
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,520
She was like that just now.

577
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,520
It's like she can't see the boss today.

578
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
She's so angry.

579
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,520
I finally gave her a good kiss.

580
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,520
What's the boss doing today?

581
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
Why can't he see anyone?

582
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,520
I don't know.

583
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,520
No.

584
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
Can't you help me find him?

585
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,520
Did you forget what the second boss told him today?

586
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,520
He said that Nan Heng is in Cang Jiang Yue today.

587
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
He told us to be careful.

588
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
Don't act rashly.

589
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,520
The guest is here.

590
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,520
Move.

591
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
Qian Yu Jun is here to arrest someone.

592
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,520
No one is allowed to leave.

593
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,520
Get up.

594
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,520
Hurry up.

595
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,520
Go.

596
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,520
Stand still.

597
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
All of you,

598
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,520
stand still.

599
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Sir,

600
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,520
who are you going to arrest?

601
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
Lan Rui,

602
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,520
if you keep eating like this,

603
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,520
I can't see you anymore.

604
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,520
Even if I don't eat, you can't see me.

605
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,520
Who?

606
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,520
Come in.

607
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,520
Greetings, Your Highness.

608
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
Isn't this Rong Hua?

609
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
Why are you here?

610
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
Your Highness,

611
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,520
I'm here to arrest someone with Qian Yu Jun.

612
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,520
I happened to meet a good news.

613
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,520
I heard that you are here, too.

614
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,520
So I came to say hello.

615
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,520
Who are you going to arrest?

616
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,520
Cang Jiang Yue's Chief, Li Shiliu.

617
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,520
What does Li Shiliu look like?

618
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,520
What did Li Shiliu do

619
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,520
that made you arrest him so seriously?

620
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,520
There are constant losses of the army.

621
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,520
We suspect that it was done by God.

622
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,520
So we set up a trap to lure him out.

623
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,520
Less than an hour ago,

624
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,520
someone showed up.

625
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,520
This person is Li Shiliu.

626
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,520
So many of you

627
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,520
haven't caught him yet?

628
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,520
This person is very cunning.

629
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,520
Under the attack of dozens of people,

630
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,520
he was lucky to escape to this place.

631
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,520
But he was seriously injured

632
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,520
and his actions were not convenient.

633
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,520
I suspect that he is hiding in the bribe.

634
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
We have caught his two people

635
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,520
and are interrogating them.

636
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,520
If you catch him,

637
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,520
you must come and inform us.

638
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,520
Yes.

639
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,520
I'll leave now.

640
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,520
Li Shiliu is in the bribe.

641
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
Are you not afraid?

642
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,520
No.

643
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,520
It's impossible not to be afraid.

644
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,520
The cruel and cruel

645
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,520
who kill people

646
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
are always with the police.

647
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,520
I'm almost blind.

648
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,520
Then you called Qi Xiang in.

649
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,520
Qi Xiang?

650
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,520
No, he...

651
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,520
He...

652
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,520
He went to the gambling house.

653
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,520
He went to the gambling house.

654
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,520
That's strange.

655
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,520
Qi Xiang usually

656
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,520
never cared about you.

657
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,520
Why did he leave you

658
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,520
here today to meet me?

659
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,520
He...

660
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,520
I...

661
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,520
Why don't you take the medicine first?

662
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
Anyway, it's free.

663
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,520
I'll pretend to be Li Shiliu

664
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,520
and put your towel in the window

665
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,520
and pretend to be injured and faint.

666
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,520
Exciting.

667
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,520
And then?

668
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,520
Then you have to go ahead

669
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,520
and check

670
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,520
and pretend to take off my mask.

671
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,520
If Li Shiliu is related to Nan Heng,

672
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,520
then Nan Heng will definitely

673
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,520
stop you from doing so.

674
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,520
I understand.

675
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,520
I understand.

676
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
I understand.

677
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
I understand.

678
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,520
I understand.

679
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,520
I understand.

680
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,520
I understand.

681
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,520
I understand.

682
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,520
I understand.

683
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,520
I understand.

684
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,520
As long as Qi dares to stop me,

685
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
I can find my father

686
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,520
to make him pretend.

687
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,520
Let my father order

688
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
to investigate Qi and Ye Wushan.

689
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,520
Right?

690
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,520
His Majesty knows that

691
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
His Highness is kind and kind.

692
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
He never lies.

693
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
He will definitely believe you.

694
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,520
What if Qi

695
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,520
didn't stop me?

696
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
I can't really

697
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,520
take off your mask

698
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
and let him see

699
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
what you look like.

700
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,520
If Nan Heng didn't stop Tian Xia,

701
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
I would pretend to wake up

702
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
and leave the room quickly.

703
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,520
Your Highness

704
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,520
just need to help me

705
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,520
stop Nan Heng.

706
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,520
No, I'm afraid

707
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
I can't stop him.

708
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,520
Don't worry, Your Highness.

709
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
There are still

710
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
Jixiang and Ronghua

711
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,520
outside to test me.

712
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,520
What if

713
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,520
Qi and Li Shiliu

714
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
are really not related?

715
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,520
You said that

716
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,520
we have done such a big investigation.

717
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,520
In the end,

718
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,520
we just lost the whole game.

719
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,520
If Li Shiliu

720
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,520
is not Nan Heng's card,

721
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,520
we can take this opportunity

722
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,520
to turn him into

723
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,520
the card in your hand.

724
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,520
Then, what do you want to do?

725
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,520
I will take the goods

726
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,520
with the military crabs

727
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,520
and enter the river.

728
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
After I leave,

729
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,520
Ronghua will take people

730
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,520
to search the hotel

731
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,520
and find the military crabs

732
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,520
hidden in the room.

733
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,520
You want to frame me again?

734
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,520
Your Highness, don't worry.

735
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
Let me finish.

736
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,520
After Ronghua finds the military crabs,

737
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,520
there will be a conflict

738
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,520
between Qianyu Jun and Ye You Shen.

739
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,520
By then, Your Highness

740
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,520
can show up and make a bet

741
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,520
and draw a dry song as a jade.

742
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,520
In this case,

743
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,520
Li Shiliu will be willing

744
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
to serve Your Highness.

745
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,520
Your Highness can also take this opportunity

746
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,520
to persuade Li Shiliu and Ye You Shen

747
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,520
to give up the case and surrender to the court.

748
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,520
General, Ronghua has come down.

749
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,520
Hurry up and go.

750
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:36,460
The

751
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,520
Are you waiting for someone?

752
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,520
No.

753
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
Who can I wait for?

754
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,520
I am waiting for you to talk.

755
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,520
Why are you always looking over there when I talk?

756
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,520
Who is it?

757
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
He seems to be unconscious.

758
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520
He seems to be the person in the portrait.

759
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,520
No, he is Li Shiliu.

760
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
Is it?

761
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,520
Qi, don't be afraid.

762
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
There is a?

763
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
I am going to take off his mask today

764
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,520
and see who this person is.

765
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,520
Wait.

766
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,520
Shouldn't you go out and call someone?

767
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,520
Call someone?

768
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,520
Ronghua and Qianyu Jun are waiting outside.

769
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,520
Tell them to come in and catch him.

770
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
I am going.

771
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,520
If you don't dare to go, I will go.

772
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,520
Don't push.

773
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,520
Don't look down on people.

774
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,520
He is unconscious.

775
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,520
Why are you afraid of him?

776
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,520
Today I am going to see his real face.

777
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
Qi, I have already passed.

778
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,520
Don't stop me.

779
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,520
Go ahead.

780
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,520
I won't stop you.

781
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,520
I have already passed.

782
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,520
I can take off his mask right away.

783
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,520
Come.

784
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,520
What did you say?

785
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
I said you are too slow.

786
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,520
Walk faster.

787
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,520
Okay.

788
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,520
I have already walked to his side.

789
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,520
I am going to take off his mask.

790
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,520
What do you want?

791
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,520
What do you want to do?

792
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,520
You want to stop me.

793
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,520
You must want to stop me, right?

794
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,520
If you don't fight, I will fight.

795
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,520
Get in.

796
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,520
Sir,

797
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,520
is the rich man who kidnapped the girl your man?

798
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,520
What's wrong?

799
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,520
He is too fierce.

800
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,520
He hit the big girl who is watching him.

801
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,520
Please go and see him.

802
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,520
Big girl?

803
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
I told you to be prepared.

804
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,520
Why did you bring Song Yi Meng here?

805
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,520
I wrote those letters to let him come here.

806
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,520
It's for your good.

807
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,520
Who knows he has to come here today?

808
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,520
Let me do it.

809
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,520
No.

810
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,520
Let me do it.

811
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,520
I see it.

812
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,520
I see it.

813
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,520
This is my heart.

814
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,520
If you keep talking, I will shave your hair and let you go out.

815
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,520
Why hasn't the general come back yet?

816
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,520
Why hasn't he come back yet?

817
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,520
He doesn't read books in ancient times.

818
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,520
Why is Meng also here?

819
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,520
Fruit Hero, you are finally here.

820
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,520
I'm here.

821
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,520
I'm here.

822
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,520
I'm here.

823
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
I'm here.

824
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,520
You are finally here.

825
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,520
You heroes are interesting.

826
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,520
You are not leaving the gate.

827
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,520
You have to climb the window.

828
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,520
Men are young until they die.

829
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,520
How did he know Li Shi Liu?

830
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
What do you know?

831
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,520
You are familiar with each other.

832
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,520
Why are you so foreign?

833
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,520
Fruit Hero.

834
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,520
Fruit Hero.

835
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,520
Is Li Shi Liu involved in the Mo Er Yue?

836
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,520
Impossible.

837
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,520
Absolutely impossible.

838
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,520
Miss Song.

839
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,520
Hero.

840
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,520
What's wrong with your voice?

841
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,520
Are you having a cold?

842
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,520
I heard that Miss Song had an engagement with the Chu family.

843
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,520
Why are you with me?

844
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,520
So intimate.

845
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,520
I'm sorry.

846
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,520
I almost forgot that you are from ancient times.

847
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,520
Men and women are not close.

848
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,520
I understand.

849
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,520
Hero.

850
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
Since you are here,

851
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,520
let's talk about business.

852
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,520
I'll make you some tea.

853
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,520
Sit down.

854
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,520
Miss Song.

855
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,520
Our boss is here to see you.

856
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,520
Miss Song.

857
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,520
You...

858
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
A new star?

859
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
What new star?

860
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
Your voice is better.

861
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,520
Better?

862
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,520
You guys talk first.

863
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,520
I have something to do.

864
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,520
I'll go first.

865
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,520
Where are you going?

866
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,520
It's weird.

867
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,520
Miss Song, what brings you here today?

868
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,520
I have nothing to do these days.

869
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,520
So I prepared some gifts for you.

870
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,520
Thank you.

871
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
Thank you.

872
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,520
But I have something urgent today.

873
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,520
Let's talk later.

874
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,520
Hero.

875
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,520
Why are you suddenly so cold?

876
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,520
When did I ever be warm to you?

877
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
You told me in the letter

878
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,520
that Chu Guiheng is busy.

879
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
You didn't remember me.

880
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,520
When you are free,

881
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,520
come to the club and have a seat.

882
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,520
I did say that.

883
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,520
Then you can have a seat.

884
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,520
But I really have something urgent today.

885
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,520
Let's talk later.

886
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,520
No.

887
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,520
I have something more important.

888
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,520
I want to talk to you about

889
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,520
Nan Heng.

890
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,520
Nan Heng?

891
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,520
Have few words.

892
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,520
I can tell whenister tell you.

893
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,520
Need to solve your problems peacefully.

894
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,520
Lord god 그렇 punti.

895
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,120
After all, he is a prince.

896
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,120
People in this world

897
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,720
must have a sense of fear for him.

898
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,320
But Hero, have you thought about it?

899
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,120
If one day,

900
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,120
because of the dispute between the Seventh Prince and the Eighteenth Prince,

901
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,720
it will cause a huge chaos,

902
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,520
what should we do then?

903
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,520
It's not easy to deal with a prince.

904
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,720
I need to know what Miss Song's background is.

905
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,320
Song Yu De is my father.

906
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,720
Chu Gui Hong is my fiance.

907
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,120
Isn't that enough?

908
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,720
Meng Er wants to join Li Shiliu

909
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,120
to fight against Man Heng.

910
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,120
I need to know your complete plan.

911
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,320
If there is no complete plan,

912
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,920
I will not risk my brothers' lives.

913
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,520
Goodbye.

914
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,120
Zheng Rui is me.

915
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,520
On the 15th of January,

916
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,520
there will be a Shangyuan meeting in the capital.

917
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,120
The whole city will attend.

918
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,720
Then, that Man Heng will take action.

919
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,920
He will cause a huge chaos in the city.

920
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,720
Many people will die.

921
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,320
Hero Li, if you are willing to believe me,

922
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,920
please stop Man Heng with me.

923
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,720
What do you think?

924
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,720
Shangyuan Festival

925
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,120
will hold a meeting every year.

926
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,120
People are praying for the lights.

927
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,320
Such a common thing,

928
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,120
why is Miss Song so sure

929
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,120
that Man Heng will take action?

930
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,720
But it's because of this common meeting

931
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,720
that it will be a means to suppress the political enemy

932
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,720
and to bring down the power.

933
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,720
The guards in the palace are punished?

934
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,320
The guards in the palace are punished?

935
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,520
His Majesty has been punished five times.

936
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,720
It's not a coincidence.

937
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,720
I'm afraid that he is willing to hand over the position of guard

938
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,120
to Chu Guihong.

939
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,120
At that time, the palace in the capital

940
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,920
will be under the power of Chu Guihong and Prince 18.

941
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,520
It's not enough for him to be a traveler for ten days.

942
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,920
If he is still a official,

943
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,920
he needs a good chance.

944
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,520
Shangyuan meeting?

945
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,720
Once he is appointed as the leader of the meeting,

946
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,120
he will be the leader of the meeting.

947
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,120
I'm afraid that

948
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,520
he will be a dead man.

949
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,320
Hero Li,

950
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,120
I know that you have many questions in your heart.

951
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,520
But this time,

952
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,120
things are really unusual.

953
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,320
If we don't stop Man Heng,

954
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,720
not only Chu Guihong,

955
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,320
but also many other innocent people

956
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,720
will suffer the same fate.

957
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,320
Hero Li,

958
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,520
you have the faith of love and trust.

959
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,720
Are you really going to let him go?

960
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,920
Gu Mingming hasn't made a plan yet.

961
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,320
But Song Yimeng has already said so much.

962
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,320
Does he and Chu Guihong

963
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,520
want to create chaos and bring home the valley,

964
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,120
and thus create a good chance for Chu Guihong?

965
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,120
Hero Li,

966
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,120
think about it.

967
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,120
In the past years,

968
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,920
has Nan Heng done many bad things?

969
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,720
If you are afraid of his identity as a prince

970
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,320
and worry about the resistance against Heng,

971
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,920
I can let Chu Guihong join us.

972
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,920
The three of us will work together to kill Nan Heng.

973
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,320
We are destined to be entangled in the wrong and become mature

974
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,520
The wind blows gently in the ear

975
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,320
The black night's attempts

976
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:05,320
The eyes and hands are confused

977
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,120
When will we return

978
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,320
The years pass by

979
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,320
The pain of fate is unwavering

980
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:22,720
Like a dream, like a dream

981
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,720
How can love and hate be hidden

982
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,920
The years pass by

983
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:35,920
The future is uncertain

984
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,720
If the day is uncertain

985
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,920
How can we end it

986
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:48,920
Please stay by my side

987
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,120
The years pass by

988
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:16,120
The pain of fate is unwavering

989
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,720
Like a dream, like a dream

990
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,720
How can love and hate be hidden

991
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,920
The years pass by

992
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,920
The future is uncertain

993
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,320
If the day is uncertain

994
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,520
How can we end it

995
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:45,920
Please stay by my side
