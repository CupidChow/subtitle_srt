1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sword is heavy.

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the root of the enemy's weakness.

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,800
It's not as good as the dust.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am still the same.

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
The same old life.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
A heart that never changes.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
The four seas are always the same.

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
No need to wait. No need to hate.

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Write the script.

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
For all that's broken.

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,800
I will write my whole life.

13
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
The wind that blows.

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
The wind that blows.

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
I will not be afraid of the wind.

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
I will not regret my youth.

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,800
I will be the one who makes the journey.

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
For this life and for all that's left.

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
I will sacrifice myself.

20
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
A Dream of managereتي

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,960
I am dead

22
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,260
Bop

23
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,260
It's a drop

24
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,940
Drop it

25
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,580
Dout

26
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,360
Let's afford

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,880
They know you here are well-read.

28
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:23,880
But the

29
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,220
The

30
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,880
My friendship is always strong!

31
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,740
Can't you feel the Wellnessagent's power?

32
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:38,860
Yan!

33
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,340
Yan!

34
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,280
Are you fine?

35
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,220
God, look at all of you,

36
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,480
you're a bit fat!

37
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,300
You're having a low energy level,

38
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,440
so you're giving me a real beating!

39
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,820
Are you hakkrissed with me,

40
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,580
you dear friend of aqua?

41
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,660
Unlike you,

42
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,860
Damn it!

43
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,300
Are there any dogs swarming in the shorts?

44
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,780
Do you have one?

45
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:55,780
Don'tarrowly

46
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,340
Liternal

47
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,060
Five, we're here

48
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,180
It's the P Malaysian Gang

49
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,820
Why are you here to help?

50
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,840
Want toifique Jin De and Ye Ming Zhu again?

51
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,360
fresÁ

52
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,380
You gotta die

53
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:13,660
Li Sh brands�ера

54
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,300
What did your grandfather of appointment do worse than you?

55
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,700
you never touch me

56
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,900
he can't recognize

57
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,660
I will help him

58
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,300
Yes.

59
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,700
Who is playing tricks?

60
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,260
Someone who wants to kill you.

61
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,340
General, let's go.

62
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,180
He is clearly provoking you.

63
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,340
There must be a trap on this road.

64
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,460
Don't be impulsive.

65
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,020
Go that way.

66
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,300
Come on.

67
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,820
Hurry up.

68
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,260
I'll give you a taste of my medicine.

69
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,220
Why are you here?

70
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,660
We're not here to help you.

71
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,140
Come on. Give it to me.

72
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,420
Hurry up.

73
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,420
Let's go.

74
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:15,700
If you're after the

75
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,480
science

76
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,580
Nan Heng

77
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,400
Today

78
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,120
Your time is up

79
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,400
Italy

80
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,280
What do you want me to say

81
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,280
You have no idea

82
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,280
what you are fighting with me

83
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
I'm afraid your army

84
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
can't come

85
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Boss

86
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
The army of Qianyu has been finished by us

87
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
When the army of Gao Xiang arrives

88
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,280
Chu Gui Hong should kneel and beg for mercy

89
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Really?

90
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,280
I'm sorry

91
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,280
The number of people is wrong

92
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,280
Chu Gui Hong lost 5000 soldiers

93
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
Now there are only a few people

94
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,280
Could it be

95
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,280
Could it be that they went to the outside of the city to stop the enemy

96
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
You are here to set up a trap

97
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,280
You know that our young general

98
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,280
will not set up a trap outside the city

99
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,280
The reinforcements of the south

100
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,280
can't come

101
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,280
10 miles outside the city

102
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
The army of Gao Xiang

103
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,280
is trapped

104
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,280
I'm afraid they can't even

105
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,280
climb up

106
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
Qianyu army, listen to my order

107
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,280
The south is poisoned by the emperor

108
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
The army of Gao Xiang is being manipulated

109
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,280
The crime is unforgivable

110
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,280
Today we will

111
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,280
take revenge

112
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,280
and kill the traitors

113
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,280
Take revenge

114
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,280
Kill the traitors

115
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,280
Take revenge

116
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,280
Kill the traitors

117
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,280
Take revenge

118
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Kill the traitors

119
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Qianyu army, listen to my order

120
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,280
What's going on

121
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,280
What's going on

122
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,280
I am the king of Qianyu

123
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
I killed Chu Gui Hong

124
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,280
to rebel

125
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
You all should come with me

126
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
to kill the traitors

127
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
What's going on

128
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Didn't the young general say that the one who was poisoned was the king of Lan

129
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,280
What's going on

130
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,280
Then who should we listen to

131
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
He is the king of Qianyu

132
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,280
I will obey the order of Qianyu

133
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,280
I can't stop laughing

134
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,280
I'm alone

135
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
Who is not proud of you

136
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,280
People are strange

137
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Time tests

138
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,280
I am like a knife

139
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,280
It's hard to find tomorrow

140
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,280
I played well

141
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,280
The first two times we were shot

142
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,280
It's all because of lack of troops

143
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,280
But this time

144
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,280
I have to find someone first

145
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
No matter what you are

146
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Today you can only be the king of Qianyu

147
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,280
King of Qianyu

148
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,280
King of Qianyu

149
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Everyone, Qianyu soldiers

150
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
My father has been practicing martial arts for many years

151
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
He is not ordinary

152
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
He is a man who is trained by the country

153
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,280
This man has no strength

154
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,280
It's clearly a traitor who is hard to find

155
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,280
It can't be my father

156
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,280
Everyone, if you still think about your father's old affection

157
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,280
Just kill them with my knife

158
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
Kill them for the sake of the country

159
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,280
Kill them for the sake of the country

160
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Go

161
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,280
stick

162
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Behind

163
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,280
Behind

164
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Behind

165
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,520
Stop, I'm not...

166
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,020
Ji, you're slobbering

167
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,720
Ji Xiang

168
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,980
No no again

169
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,440
Jixiang

170
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,240
Jixiang

171
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,540
You can't die

172
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,600
Jixiang

173
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,180
And protect them.

174
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,960
With a horse-sicion.

175
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,120
Good, good.

176
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,500
General, general, general.

177
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
I...

178
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,860
I'll ask you one last time.

179
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,460
Sheng Zhi,

180
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,020
can you explain?

181
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,420
Nan Hen is my son.

182
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,100
What do you think?

183
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,500
I...

184
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,940
Father! Father!

185
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,740
Father! Father!

186
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,620
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

187
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,740
I'm here. I'm here.

188
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,380
What you did is late.

189
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,520
Fine!

190
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,740
Just be someone's substitute!

191
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,140
Who says there's only such a thing?

192
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,220
I, Lu Renqian,

193
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,380
barriers down.

194
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,100
I've ruled the Tar grenades sector.

195
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,900
I, Lu Renyi,

196
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,740
also한테 no gifts or September's bribes.

197
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,020
I, Lu Renging,

198
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,460
I didn't expect that I can come back alive today!

199
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,860
I, Wu Ming Shi, will die in the southern city today!

200
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,260
I, Qu Zhou Jing, swear to follow the Crown Prince!

201
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,220
And my mother!

202
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,740
And me! I will take revenge!

203
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,580
Please, take care!

204
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,780
We will take revenge!

205
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,020
We will take revenge!

206
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,100
We will take revenge!

207
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,300
We will take revenge!

208
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,500
We will take revenge!

209
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,660
We will take revenge!

210
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,380
We will take revenge!

211
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,700
Chu Beihong!

212
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,420
These people have been blessed by the Night God and Nan Heng.

213
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,900
But they are not here to repay their kindness.

214
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,220
They are here to tell us

215
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,780
that whoever makes the Great Jin fall into battle

216
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,700
and makes the people leave their homes,

217
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,620
who will be their enemy?

218
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,140
We will take revenge!

219
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,420
Soldiers!

220
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,460
My son, Han Si Hu,

221
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,100
has been to the southern city of the Northern Battle with King Qian Yu.

222
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,380
My father, Han Ping Liang, is a war criminal.

223
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,220
I don't understand

224
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,380
why you didn't kill the enemies

225
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,500
and let our own people

226
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,780
take the revenge!

227
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,500
It doesn't matter if you are born to be a hero

228
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,900
I'm still afraid of fate

229
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,100
Soldiers!

230
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,900
You were once heroes who love the country and defend the border.

231
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,300
Now you are a man who protects the country.

232
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,620
Do you really want to be a man who defends the country

233
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,500
and go on an expedition?

234
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,500
I, Nan Heng, promise you

235
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,700
that I will kill all the enemies

236
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,700
and kill all the people.

237
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,220
Whoever loves the country

238
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,500
will be punished!

239
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,020
The more I dream, the more I doubt

240
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,900
I still want to prove myself

241
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,820
I can't help it, I have no regrets

242
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,100
I can't help it, I have no regrets

243
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,100
I can't help it, I have no regrets

244
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,100
Are you going to go after me?

245
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,300
Get ready for me

246
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,100
I'm the only one in the world

247
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,900
I'm the only one in the world

248
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,900
I'm the only one in the world

249
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
Don't you have confidence in the Chief?

250
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,300
He can handle it.

251
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,700
If you don't stop, you will stop

252
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,300
The wind and the snow are all on the ground

253
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,500
You are so brave

254
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
You are so brave

255
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Sister-in-law, have you found out

256
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,700
that the Chief's counter-attack is weak?

257
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,500
Don't worry, Chu Gui Hong is no match for him.

258
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,100
I can't help it, I have no regrets

259
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,300
I can't help it, I have no regrets

260
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,100
It's impossible

261
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:11,500
I can't help it, I have no regrets

262
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:18,500
I can't help it, I have no regrets

263
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:24,100
I can't help it, I have no regrets

264
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:31,300
I can't help it, I have no regrets

265
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:39,300
I can't help it, I have no regrets

266
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:46,300
I can't help it, I have no regrets

267
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:55,300
I can't help it, I have no regrets

268
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:03,300
I can't help it, I have no regrets

269
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,300
Chu Gui Hong, you are trying to rebel, you have no choice

270
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,300
Today I won't kill you, everything will be decided by His Majesty

271
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,060
Chu Gui Hong, you may go

272
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,300
But don't go

273
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:39,300
''You won't get rid of your senior in the

274
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:51,300
palace, but to leave your senior individuality there

275
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,660
You must report to our king

276
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:59,380
Siming, are you satisfied?

277
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:05,620
It will be your fate

278
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:19,980
Yes

279
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,620
Today's path

280
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,400
all I choose

281
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,220
Therem operator

282
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,100
I fuckin gorgeous

283
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,880
Kin gyrelf

284
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,480
With a toilet

285
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,100
So I have to leave the Hunan Village right now!

286
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:53,620
Yes.

287
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:11,920
Go to new skills of the

288
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,620
Nan 86, look

289
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,300
This is the great Jin

290
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,100
Our Chu family

291
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,060
With your route

292
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,300
to protect the country of Great Jin.

293
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,500
Isn't it beautiful?

294
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,660
When we grow up,

295
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,660
we'll guard the country of Great Jin together.

296
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,660
We'll ride our horses and use our swords.

297
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,500
We'll watch our enemies pee.

298
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,500
We'll let everyone in Great Jin know

299
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,380
the names of Nan Heng and Chu Guihong.

300
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:43,980
Is that okay?

301
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,140
Okay.

302
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,340
according to the emperor's will.

303
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,100
I can kill thousands of people with just one wave.

304
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:01,100
But in the end, I used the identity of the person to help everyone.

305
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,100
Who said I was the person?

306
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,100
I am the God of War, King Qianyu.

307
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,100
Then may I ask why are you still here?

308
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,100
Do you want me to accompany you to meet you in the open?

309
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,100
How dare I?

310
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,100
I just want to understand one thing.

311
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,100
You are right.

312
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,100
Everyone in this world, whether it is the leading role, the supporting role, or the leading role,

313
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,100
is a living person.

314
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,100
I was too shallow before.

315
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,100
I always want to write down everyone's fate.

316
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,100
That's good.

317
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,100
By the way, let me ask you.

318
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,100
Does the script mechanism still exist?

319
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,100
Why does Nan Heng seem to be fine?

320
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,100
Actually, a lot of things have changed.

321
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,100
Think about it again.

322
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,100
Did you not hear the arrow sound for a long time?

323
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,100
When Nan Heng used the mechanism to defeat the mechanism,

324
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,100
the heroine was in danger, the heroine must be rescued.

325
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,100
The mechanism that the scene must occur has already failed.

326
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,100
Plus, now all the producers are awake.

327
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,100
The mechanism that changes the scene must be reversed has also failed.

328
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,100
That is to say, now not only are you not controlled by fate,

329
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,100
even I am.

330
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,100
When I saw the people just now

331
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,100
were protecting their families and ignoring the danger,

332
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,100
I suddenly have a feeling

333
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,100
that my soul is coming out of my chest.

334
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,100
Just talk about it.

335
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
You still have a soul coming out of your chest.

336
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,100
It's true.

337
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,100
Maybe in a few days, you won't be able to find me again.

338
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,100
I'm already back.

339
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,100
Okay, then I wish you

340
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,100
that you can never write a bad script again.

341
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,100
Goodbye.

342
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,100
Forget it.

343
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,100
Give me a hug, scriptwriter teacher.

344
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,100
Why are you hugging me?

345
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,100
Boss, I'll go cut his hands.

346
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,100
No need.

347
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,100
I'll go beat him.

348
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,100
Let's go.

349
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,100
Let's go.

350
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,100
Didn't you say you wanted to beat him?

351
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,100
Is it so easy to seduce a married man?

352
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,100
Yuxing...?

353
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,100
Is it so easy to seduce a married man?

354
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,100
It's you.

355
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,100
Su tamu.

356
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,100
Professor is back.

357
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,100
Surapper.

358
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,100
Student.

359
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,100
Cho לב iç?,

360
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,100
gone.

361
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,100
How long didn't you pay for Bride's tea?

362
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:10,500
If the world here changes in the future,

363
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,620
that must not be her intention.

364
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,020
Because everything in the script

365
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,540
has been already in everyone's hands.

366
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,500
Crown Princess Consort, didn't you say

367
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,500
that our fate is in our hands?

368
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
What?

369
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,900
Then who do you think Zhixia and I will marry?

370
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,620
According to the script,

371
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,420
it might be

372
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,900
A'Long, A'Hu, Qi Xiang, Fu Gui.

373
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,900
Then I won't marry her.

374
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,380
The script?

375
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,820
What is that?

376
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,620
The script is

377
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,860
the male lead and the female lead.

378
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,060
The male lead's brother, the female lead's best friend,

379
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,900
the male lead's servant, the female lead's servant.

380
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,300
Anyway, it's probably

381
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,300
the old-fashioned way.

382
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,300
Then...

383
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,100
Crown Princess Consort,

384
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,900
do you have any unspoken literature?

385
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,900
Unspoken literature?

386
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,700
I... I do.

387
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,900
Yingqiu,

388
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,500
who do you want to unspoken with?

389
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,300
Totally her.

390
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,700
Hahaha.

391
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,300
How did you get away?

392
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,360
You're really держ著大ittle removed.

393
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,340
I only came by because I was with these people,

394
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,340
but go!

395
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,100
Like if I go,

396
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,500
With all the men of Travel King.

397
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,860
Take time apart.

398
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,140
I'll do my best

399
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,940
to please the 1977 Xuanyu Empire.

400
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,260
Senior amazing?

401
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,180
Yes, Deputy Master.

402
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,700
Are you seriously un dependant?

403
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,300
I've been taking care of it all the time.

404
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,780
You look the best today.

405
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,100
And you also ½ of me.

406
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,620
I am your son.

407
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,780
I like you.

408
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,100
the best in the world.

409
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,180
Yesterday, you didn't see

410
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,380
when that Si Long and Si Cheng saw me,

411
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,100
they were all very polite

412
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,740
and very kind.

413
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,700
So,

414
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,300
in terms of the common people's style,

415
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,420
you still have to rely on me.

416
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,900
It's you.

417
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,820
Hey!

418
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,500
Your Majesty!

419
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,500
Your Majesty!

420
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,500
Your Majesty!

421
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,100
Ying Qiu and Nanrui's story

422
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,100
has just started so miraculously.

423
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,700
Ying Qiu longs for simple and pure feelings.

424
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,100
So does Nanrui.

425
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,700
But under the circumstances,

426
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,900
love is like a summer's cotton,

427
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,900
a winter's cold and sun.

428
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,100
If the two of them don't get married,

429
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,900
it doesn't bring any extra value.

430
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,900
If you want to say something meaningful,

431
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,900
you have to apologize.

432
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,700
47,

433
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,300
78,

434
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,500
356,

435
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,700
621,

436
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,700
701.

437
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,700
Have you all counted?

438
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,900
Not yet.

439
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,100
Your Majesty,

440
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,100
you've been counting the accounts for a day.

441
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,700
It's time to rest.

442
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,700
How about having some tea first?

443
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,900
Your Majesty, what do I want to do?

444
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,100
You men

445
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,300
are useless.

446
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,300
How can I let my grandma do this kind of work?

447
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,100
You're so embarrassed to show me

448
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,700
a copy of Excel?

449
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,900
Show it to me!

450
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,100
A copy of official document.

451
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,500
8 wrong characters.

452
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,700
You're taught this by a PE teacher?

453
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,900
What's your business?

454
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,900
Long,

455
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,900
you don't write the invitation letter, but the name.

456
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,900
Are you a ghost?

457
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,900
You can't invite people.

458
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,100
How can you be a man?

459
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,900
Second wrote it.

460
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,900
Actually, the second master

461
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,700
gave me this form.

462
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,700
The official document is also like this.

463
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,700
The second master also said

464
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,100
he would give all the opportunities to young people.

465
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,500
Really?

466
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,100
Yes.

467
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,300
That's right, the second master.

468
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,900
They're all telling the truth.

469
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,900
Where's Shangguan He?

470
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,300
Where is he?

471
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,300
Where is he?

472
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,100
There's no wife upstairs.

473
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,100
I'm going to take a walk.

474
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,900
Go ahead.

475
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,100
I'm going to take a walk.

476
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,100
Go ahead.

477
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,100
Ting,

478
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,900
I want to discuss something with you.

479
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,900
Say it.

480
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,100
Didn't you say you wanted a child?

481
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,700
You see, I'm so generous.

482
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,900
You're talented and righteous.

483
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,900
Do we have to

484
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,900
give birth to a next world's heroine?

485
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,500
What?

486
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,100
You're not satisfied with being a supporting role?

487
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,700
You want to be a star?

488
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,500
I didn't mean that.

489
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,500
I'm not

490
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,900
in love with you?

491
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,700
What are you pretending?

492
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,700
You just feel that you're not free with me.

493
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,100
You want to use a child to send me away.

494
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,300
Then you can live the life

495
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,300
of wandering around the world, right?

496
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,500
No, no.

497
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,500
But it's not impossible.

498
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,300
Chu Li is a screenwriter, right?

499
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,100
Before he left,

500
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,900
I made a wish to him.

501
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,500
I hope that men can also get pregnant.

502
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,500
After you have a baby in October,

503
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,500
you can go wherever you want.

504
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,700
I will never stop you.

505
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,900
No wonder I feel fat recently.

506
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,300
You're not serious, are you?

507
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,500
You really made this wish?

508
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,900
Ting!

509
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,500
Don't joke with me!

510
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,900
Ting Ting!

511
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,700
You're not serious, right?

512
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,900
Tell me, you're not serious.

513
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
Yes.

514
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,100
I'm not ready for this stage.

515
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,700
Tell me, is it true?

516
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,900
Walk slowly.

517
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,100
Don't move too much.

518
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,500
I'm so angry.

519
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,100
Look at this.

520
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,700
I saw it in Yangzhou before.

521
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,100
Do you think this color

522
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,300
suits our age?

523
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,900
Let me see.

524
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,500
The color is so beautiful.

525
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,300
I think we should take it

526
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,100
and give it to our sisters.

527
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,500
Then we can go shopping together.

528
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,900
As Maor said,

529
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,700
this is called bringing goods.

530
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,100
That's a good idea.

531
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,900
Then tomorrow, I'll go to Yangzhou.

532
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,500
Let's give it a try.

533
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,900
It will be effective.

534
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,100
Okay.

535
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,700
Your Highness,

536
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,900
you haven't come to the front line with me for three months.

537
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,900
If this continues,

538
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,500
I'm afraid you'll forget

539
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,700
what I look like.

540
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,700
Right?

541
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,100
Madam,

542
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,100
no matter how good this place is,

543
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,300
it's not a home.

544
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,100
You don't care about me,

545
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,100
but you care about

546
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,100
the things you do every day.

547
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,900
Take it.

548
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,700
I don't want to be involved in

549
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:00,020
the business of the

550
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,700
world.

551
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,100
What's yours?

552
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,300
The world is so big.

553
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,700
I want to see it.

554
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,500
What does this mean?

555
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,900
Don't just stand there.

556
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,900
Go after it.

557
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,100
What is this?

558
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,700
What?

559
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,900
Go after the fire funeral.

560
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,900
I don't understand this.

561
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,500
I don't understand.

562
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,900
Madam.

563
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,700
Your Highness.

564
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,700
Madam.

565
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,500
Your Highness.

566
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,900
Madam, wait for me.

567
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,900
Madam.

568
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,700
Wait for me.

569
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,500
Madam.

570
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,500
As for wealth,

571
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
he fought with Nan Heng

572
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,700
for his whole life.

573
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,500
He used to help Nan Heng

574
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
guard the city and the Seven Royal Houses.

575
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,700
Where is Nan Heng?

576
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,300
His home is there.

577
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,700
But now,

578
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,900
Nan Heng is concerned about

579
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,900
the whole Great Jin.

580
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,500
So,

581
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500
the Great Jin's state should also be guarded

582
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,100
by him,

583
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,900
rich and rich.

584
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,100
This one.

585
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,900
Brother Gui.

586
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,900
Brother Gui.

587
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,900
Long time no see.

588
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,300
Brother Gui, you are getting better.

589
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,300
You are really

590
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,700
a hero.

591
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,300
You are a general.

592
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,300
I am

593
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,900
a man

594
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,300
who can carry a thousand miles.

595
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,300
Bu Xiaoqian.

596
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,300
What are you doing here?

597
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,300
I am protecting the new

598
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,100
3,000 soldiers

599
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,300
to join the Black Armor Army.

600
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,300
In the future,

601
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,700
I will be your deputy general.

602
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,300
Please remind me.

603
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,300
Stop.

604
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,300
Why do you want to remind me?

605
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,300
Hurry up and tell me.

606
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:24,900
Yes.

607
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,700
Let's go.

608
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,100
Gui.

609
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,700
Go back and tell His Majesty and Her Majesty

610
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,900
that the border is peaceful.

611
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,700
This is the new

612
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,900
deputy general of the Black Armor Army.

613
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,900
Stop talking nonsense.

614
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,500
Yes.

615
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,100
Brother Gui.

616
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,900
You said I was talking nonsense.

617
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,100
I can't understand it.

618
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,900
The border is peaceful.

619
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,700
The people are rich.

620
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,900
This is the Great Jin Nan Heng wants.

621
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,300
It is also the peace

622
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,500
that everyone here is looking forward to.

623
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,900
Father is kind.

624
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,500
Nan Heng ascended the throne.

625
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,900
From then on, he realized what he said.

626
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,300
He has the ideal of the world.

627
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,900
Are you okay?

628
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,300
I'm fine.

629
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,700
And I

630
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,300
finally became the female emperor

631
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,900
and ascended the throne.

632
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,700
But

633
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,100
you think he took me to the throne once.

634
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,100
From now on,

635
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,900
I have to be

636
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,300
the empress of the Great Jin

637
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,700
who will take care of the harem for him.

638
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,100
Of course not.

639
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,500
Brother.

640
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,900
Where is Song Yi Meng?

641
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,900
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

642
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,500
I know where she is.

643
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,300
Where?

644
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,700
Your Majesty.

645
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,500
Two months ago,

646
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,100
a scout met you on Weicheng Street.

647
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,500
He said you were teaching the people

648
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
to use a shared carriage.

649
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,100
Shared carriage?

650
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,900
Your Majesty.

651
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,500
Last month, you held a

652
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,300
paper-cutting recruitment in Jiangnan.

653
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,900
It is said that if a woman wants to find a job,

654
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,900
she can register her skills on the side.

655
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,700
Then someone will contact her.

656
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,300
What is Song Yi Meng doing?

657
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,500
Your Majesty.

658
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,900
The empress is back.

659
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,900
Lai Er Hang.

660
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,100
Lai Er Hang.

661
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,100
I'm back.

662
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,900
You're back.

663
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,500
It's summer.

664
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,100
You're wearing a coat,

665
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,700
making a stove,

666
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,300
and even having a fire.

667
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,700
Aren't you hot?

668
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,900
What's wrong?

669
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,500
I don't know if it's the opposite.

670
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,300
I feel cold all the time.

671
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,700
And I can't sleep at all.

672
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,900
My bones are also sore.

673
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Right.

674
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,300
You're sweating.

675
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,100
You're still pretending to be here.

676
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,900
Why don't you care about me at all?

677
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,100
I care about you.

678
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,300
I always care about you.

679
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,500
Here, let me help you.

680
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,300
Here, drink some water.

681
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,700
It's hot.

682
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,500
You're not cold anymore?

683
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,700
I'm not cold anymore.

684
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,900
I've been too busy these days.

685
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,500
You told me that

686
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,300
you stayed with me in the palace for half a month.

687
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,300
And you've been busy with your own business for half a month.

688
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,100
But you've been gone for three months.

689
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:52,900
And your news

690
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,500
was told to me by others.

691
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,700
I've been gone for three months?

692
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,900
Yes.

693
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,300
Nan Heng,

694
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,900
isn't it just three months?

695
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,900
It's just a play.

696
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,900
If I knew you were so clingy,

697
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,900
I would have been in the crew

698
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,100
with Nan Feng

699
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,900
and watched a three-month play.

700
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,500
What Nan Feng?

701
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,300
She's not as pretty as me.

702
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,900
Am I not as tall as her?

703
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,700
She's not as...

704
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,300
She's not as tall as you.

705
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,300
She looks like a tortoise.

706
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,500
How could I

707
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,300
be different from my husband?

708
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,300
I like a tortoise.

709
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,500
Right?

710
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,700
But I heard from the screenwriter

711
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,900
that when actors are filming,

712
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,300
they often send some

713
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,300
intimate scenes.

714
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,900
Mr. Screenwriter, you're a good person.

715
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,700
You left without me knowing.

716
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,900
Don't you forget to dig a hole for me?

717
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,900
Okay, okay.

718
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,900
Nan Heng.

719
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,900
Nan Heng.

720
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,300
Heng.

721
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,700
Heng Bao.

722
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,900
Don't be angry, okay?

723
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,900
He can play a big role in the sky.

724
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,900
I can't like him.

725
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,900
I promise you.

726
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,500
If I like Nan Feng,

727
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,900
I'll hit him with a thunderbolt.

728
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,300
Don't talk nonsense.

729
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,300
Anyway, I didn't care about you before.

730
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,700
From now on,

731
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,500
I'm the only one who can act with you.

732
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,700
You promised me.

733
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,700
Whitehead, thin heart.

734
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,300
You're pretty good.

735
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,700
You speak English fluently.

736
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,100
Of course.

737
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,900
I remember you wrote something last time.

738
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,300
A carp hits a fish,

739
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,700
a fish is sweeping the inside.

740
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,300
Right?

741
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,700
Let me ask you.

742
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,700
Do you know what is a fish sweeping the inside?

743
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,100
Of course I know.

744
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,900
It's a kind of delicious fish.

745
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,900
Right?

746
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,900
Delicious fish.

747
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,100
I'm not that delicious fish.

748
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,500
I'm not that delicious fish.

749
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,100
I'm not that delicious fish.

750
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,100
I'm not that delicious fish.

751
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,100
I'm not that delicious fish.

752
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,100
I'm not that delicious fish.

753
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,100
I'm not that delicious fish.

754
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,100
I'm not that delicious fish.

755
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,100
I'm not that delicious fish.

756
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,100
I'm not that delicious fish.
