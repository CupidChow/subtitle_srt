[A Dream Within A Dream]

00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:58,009
[Episode 36]

3
00:01:59,150 --> 00:01:59,950
Nan Heng,

4
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,790
the script world is governed
by certain rules.

5
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,040
Apart from the two you know,

6
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,120
there are two more.

7
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,280
One is

8
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,259
about how I get back to where I'm from.

9
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,590
As long as Song Yimeng and you

10
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,870
finish all the iconic scenes

11
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,870
till the finale,

12
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,280
I'll be brought back to the modern times.

13
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,760
The other one is,

14
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,940
changes of iconic scenes will backfire

15
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,400
on those who induce them.

16
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,180
[Trouble finds those
who change the iconic scenes]

17
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,970
Backfire?

18
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,640
Then Song Yimeng...

19
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,590
She'll be fine.

20
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,770
Think about it.

21
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,070
What has she changed?

22
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,079
She did fall into the water
in the royal garden

23
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,070
as the script says.

24
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,400
She was rescued by a hero
at the Lantern Festival

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,280
as the script says.

26
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,630
She did defy the Song family

27
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,650
as the script says.

28
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,030
She even caught you
in bed with Song Yiting

29
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,590
as the script says.

30
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,130
The only change happened

31
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,430
on the wedding day,

32
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,079
when you used the script rules

33
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,630
to break the script rules.

34
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,400
So, Nan Heng,

35
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,950
in the script world,

36
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,060
you're the only one character

37
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,470
who can change the iconic scenes.

38
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,150
That's good.

39
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,750
Good?

40
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,560
If the upcoming plots go

41
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,150
further and further
into the opposite direction--

42
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,800
for example, Song Yiting
marries Shangguan He--

43
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,200
then you,
who induced the initial changes,

44
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,010
will be hurt even worse,

45
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,710
till you die.

46
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,870
Understood?

47
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,030
So this is why you helped
to forge a marital union

48
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,760
between Song Yiting and Shangguan He?

49
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,520
Hold on.

50
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,520
What did he tell you?

51
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,610
My uncle said,

52
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,290
based on his years of study on storybooks,

53
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,050
only an external force was needed to

54
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,000
compel Shangguan He
to express his love for Yiting,

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,840
and that I was

56
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,520
this force.

57
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,690
I didn't mean to be this cruel to you,

58
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,260
but Song Yimeng stubbornly

59
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,350
refused to play along with the plots.

60
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,240
Nan Heng,

61
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,430
take my advice.

62
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,960
If you want to stay alive,

63
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,280
then just abide by

64
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,940
the rules of the script world.

65
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,380
If I had ever played by the book,

66
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,020
how could you have been brought here?

67
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,510
Still acting tough, aren't you?

68
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,610
To be honest,

69
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,680
if you still try to change the story,

70
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,920
you will die

71
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,180
in less than a month.

72
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,410
When that happens,

73
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,800
how do you think I will hurt Song Yimeng?

74
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,120
Or maybe I should just wait

75
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,780
till you die, huh?

76
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,470
Chu Guihong.

77
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,050
Do you know who you are protecting?

78
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,790
Someone who can help me
return to the capital.

79
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,310
It's my father, of course.

80
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,580
Would your father ever

81
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,430
behave like this?

82
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:03,870
Open your eyes and look...

83
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,600
Nan Heng,

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,260
people would only believe
what's in their best interests.

85
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,950
I'm no exception.

86
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,500
This is what you taught me.

87
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,240
Those who are seen as villains

88
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,680
will be praised for doing

89
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,070
just one good deed.

90
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,630
Now, Miss Song Yiting

91
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,430
and Shangguan He are engaged.

92
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,880
It was my father who helped to make

93
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,890
this beautiful thing happen.

94
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,690
And you...

95
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,720
You're just a loser who's slowly dying.

96
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:42,540
Dad,

97
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,570
the wind is rising.

98
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,400
Let's go.

99
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,720
You...

100
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,030
I already had Rong Hua
figure out the truth.

101
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,400
At Pingrong Battle,

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,950
my father was indeed killed
by Heyuan people.

103
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,550
He had no chance of survival.

104
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,830
Confess now.

105
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,070
Who really are you?

106
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,630
What does "character" mean?

107
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,870
What is "the script world"?

108
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,510
Also,

109
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,750
who am I?

110
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,070
Jixiang,

111
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,800
did you see?

112
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,430
Even Uncle couldn't formally conclude
the long overdue engagement

113
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,240
between Yiting and He.

114
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,430
But I had it done

115
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,630
at my first attempt.

116
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,830
I really am Cupid in human form.

117
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,000
Your Highness, you don't have to talk

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,270
when you feel upset.

119
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,160
What's the matter with you?

120
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,000
Y-Y-You...

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,430
D-Don't call out my lie.

122
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,480
Your Highness!

123
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,040
Yiting?

124
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,810
Why are you out here?

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,510
Why did you help me

126
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,740
in the Waning River Crescent's Hall?

127
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,750
Yiting,

128
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,070
though it was Uncle's request
for help that brought me here,

129
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,710
I did mean to do you a favor.

130
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,440
Actually, during these days,

131
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,480
I've done a lot of thinking.

132
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,440
It's time I stopped pestering you,

133
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,000
since you're way out of my league.

134
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,970
What do you mean?

135
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,180
Yiting,

136
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,120
no other girls in the capital...

137
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,920
No.

138
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,789
No other girls in Great Jing
are better than you.

139
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,549
You have your own insights on everything.

140
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,870
You dare to go against conventions.

141
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,510
But what about me?

142
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,500
I'm just a silly boy

143
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,100
who has no opinions of his own

144
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,580
and hides behind his father all the time.

145
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,840
I'm neither knowledgeable,

146
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
nor astute

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,960
in politics.

148
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,250
I'm not good enough for you.

149
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,270
After thinking that through,

150
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,730
I actually felt relieved.

151
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,870
Now, I wish you and Shangguan He

152
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,510
a happy marriage.

153
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,440
Thanks for your blessings.

154
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,040
But, Your Highness,

155
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,270
you shouldn't sell yourself short.

156
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,040
Academic and political achievements

157
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,150
aren't enough to define a man.

158
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,510
Similarly, a woman shouldn't be judged

159
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,910
by her temperament
and marriage status.

160
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Your Highness
was born into the royal family,

161
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,330
yet you're pure of heart

162
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,320
and kind.

163
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,360
Not everyone can be like you.

164
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,700
You are cheerful

165
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,700
and outspoken.

166
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,110
These traits are as valuable

167
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,010
and priceless as academic

168
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,780
and political achievements.

169
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,680
So, I believe Your Highness

170
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,320
will find a girl you love,

171
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,030
who truly loves you back.

172
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,150
Thanks.

173
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,480
Yiting.

174
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,670
Wait.

175
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,480
Did you say that because I'm stupid?

176
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,870
Your Highness is not stupid at all.

177
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,470
You're a man of great wisdom.

178
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,840
You reflect on yourself
without others' reminders.

179
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,570
You're tolerant and generous.

180
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,810
You dropped a grudge
that lasted for ten-odd years,

181
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,260
and peacefully accepted

182
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,720
that your brother became the crown prince.

183
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,240
You also kindly helped a girl
fight for her true love,

184
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,240
though she had rejected you before.

185
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,300
Not everyone

186
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,150
is capable of doing these.

187
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,830
Right.

188
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,370
I always know it.

189
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,750
I’m still the remarkable chosen one,

190
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,620
who symbolizes good fortune.

191
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,080
Well, Yiting,

192
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,030
will you

193
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,030
be friends with me,
the man standing for

194
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,160
auspiciousness?

195
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,450
It'll be my honor to be friends

196
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,610
with Your Highness.

197
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,920
That's great.

198
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,290
I've told you the gist.

199
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,100
In the script world,

200
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,840
Nan Heng is the male lead.

201
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,720
He will kill his brother
and ascend the throne at last.

202
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,520
As for you, the cannon fodder...

203
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,120
I mean the second male lead.

204
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,880
You will be killed by Nan Heng

205
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,000
and completely vanish

206
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,480
after he becomes the Emperor.

207
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,840
He has done tons of evil,

208
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,270
including causing my father's death

209
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,930
and stealing my fiancée away.

210
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,620
He'll even tread me under foot in the end?

211
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,270
Why?

212
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,320
Because he's the male lead.

213
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,280
Then what about me?

214
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,420
Why can't I be the protagonist?

215
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,390
How am I inferior to him?

216
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,630
Y-Y-You...

217
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,050
You're not inferior to him.

218
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,290
W-W-Well...

219
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,720
How about...

220
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,670
How about this?

221
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,150
If you play along

222
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,550
with the plot of choosing
one out of the two hostages,

223
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,480
I'll change the ending

224
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,850
w-when I'm back to the modern times.

225
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,670
I'll make you the male lead!

226
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,260
As it turns out,

227
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,720
you'd like to make a deal with me.

228
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,810
Do you know

229
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,360
what I want now?

230
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,840
Of course I do.

231
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,440
You want to kill Nan Heng

232
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,670
and help your cousin Nan Rui
ascend the throne, right?

233
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,200
I do want Nan Heng dead.

234
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,600
But I also want to hold my fate

235
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,410
in my own hands.

236
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,360
In this vast world,

237
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,410
nobody can constrain me anymore.

238
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,640
You want to ascend the throne yourself?

239
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,310
What are you doing?

240
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,680
You...

241
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,730
Don't do anything stupid.

242
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,160
What exactly are you going to do?

243
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,240
If you are to make a deal with me,

244
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,140
meet me in two hours

245
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,240
in Qianyu Mansion.

246
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,440
How am I supposed

247
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,500
to go back this way?

248
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,390
You're sick!

249
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,630
You make me sick!

250
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,840
I didn't

251
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,040
portray him as a crazy guy in the script.

choosing to save one
out of the two hostages on the city tower]

254
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,610
Heng suffered a lot
in the cold palace when he was little.

255
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,440
He then spent years

Now, he has finally
come back alive from the borders.

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,840
His life has just become safer and better.

259
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,370
How did this misfortune
suddenly befall him?

260
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,950
I've ordered an investigation.

261
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,200
Song Yude said,

262
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,630
when the servants in the Song Residence
discovered Heng,

263
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,000
he had sunk into a coma.

264
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,550
Nobody was around him.

Your Ladyship.

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,030
Your Majesty.

Your Ladyship.

The royal physicians have rushed
to the crown prince's residence.

had a medical emergency.

There will be results soon.

00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,670
Yes.

274
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,760
Don't worry.

275
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,200
Heng is a blessed child.

276
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,000
He'll surely get better.

277
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,840
His unfortunate life is attributed to me,

278
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,440
his useless mother.

279
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,860
The biggest regret of my life

280
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,740
is not being a good enough mother to Heng.

281
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,840
It is I

282

not you.

284
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Do you ever plan to tell me the truth?

285
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,000
You used to deceive me
with two identities.

286
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,210
Now, you've been seriously wounded.

287
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,080
Why are you still withholding the truth?

288
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,320
I...

289
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,870
Seeing me act like a fool

290
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,080
and worried sick about you,

291
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
are you happy?

from being stabbed twice

297
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,670
on our wedding day.

298
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,340
Why are you still lying?

299
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
Physician Qin has told me

300
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,750
that your wounds this time

301
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,550
are completely different
from the previous ones.

302
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,530
I'll tell you the truth then.

303
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,910
I was attacked...

304
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,180
by Lord Qianyu.

305
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,950
Lord Qianyu?

306
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,330
Did he meet you in private?

307
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,200
He failed to persuade you,

308
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,460
so he came to talk to me.

309
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,820
I refused to collaborate
and play along with the plots,

310
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,250
so he poisoned me,

311
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,490
trying to coerce me into a concession.

312
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,550
That means

313
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,210
there's poison in you now?

314
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,390
Where is the antidote?

315
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,790
Does Lord Qianyu have it?

316
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,800
I've attained the antidote.

317
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,480
I'll recover in just a few days.

318
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,069
You...

319
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:08,579
Do you really have the antidote now?

320
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,190
Are you lying to me or not?

321
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,240
I'm not.

322
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,960
Well,

323
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,240
I'd better ask Physician Qin about it.

324
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,300
Come back!

325
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,589
The scriptwriter is here.

326
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:22,829
This is a secret.

327
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,400
Letting it out won't do

328
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,450
any good.

329
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,750
Besides, think about this.

330
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,270
I'm the male lead he created.

331
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,330
He won't let me die so easily, will he?

332
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,310
He's just punishing me

333
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,890
for refusing to cooperate

334
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,830
and

335
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,240
to go through the plots.

336
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,400
Is that all?

337
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,510
Nothing else?

338
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,640
Nothing.

339
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,460
Then tell me.

340
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,000
In the Waning River Crescent's Hall,

341
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,350
why did he try so hard to fix

342
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,880
Yiting and Shangguan He up?

343
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,310

344
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,830
then you, who induced the initial changes,

345
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,620
will be hurt even worse,

346
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,470
till you die.

347
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,440
Understood?

348
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,550
I think

349
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,970
he was roping Shangguan He
and the Nightwalkers

350
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,270
into fighting me.

351
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,570
Is he stupid or what?

352
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,680
What makes he think
Shangguan He would betray you?

353
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,000
He just assumes everyone here is naive.

354
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,530
You and I won’t obey him.

355
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,450
Shangguan He
will definitely not betray us either.

356
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,900
Nan Heng,

357
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,790
you must promise me

358
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,750
that from now on,

359
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,770
you won't keep your plans from me anymore.

360
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,030
If I ever find you have lied to me again,

361
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,720
I'll condemn you

362
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,720
to eternal punishment.

363
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,070
Got it.

364
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,350
You have my word.

365
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,070
What is it now?

366
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,810
I'll feed you medicine soup.

367
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,590
Why that smile?

368
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,310
You're feeding me medicine
from a small bowl.

369
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,240
I'm adapting to it.

370
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,800
This...

371
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,880
Come on.

372
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,170
Open your mouth.

373
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,640
Here it goes.

374
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,000

376
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,400
Slow down. Easy with it.

377
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,350
I didn't realize until recently

378
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,610
that Your Grace is from another world.

379
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,360
You've not only spared me from death,

380
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,550
but also advanced my relationship
with my beloved woman.

381
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,680
I'm grateful

382

for Your Grace's generosity.

383
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,170
How come it seems to me

384
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,330
that you have a different purpose?

385
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,710
Nothing can escape
Your Grace's observation.

386
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,030
You see,

387
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,000
tiny story characters

388
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,110
can't hold a candle to gods, can they?

389
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,780
I'm here today

390
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,560
to show fealty to Your Grace.

391
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,560
If Your Grace

392
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,260
deigns to let me join you
in your future action,

393
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,410
I promise I'll be at your disposal.

394
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,840
"Deign" is too strong a word
to be used here.

395
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,000
Despite my poor choice of words,

396
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,530
I do mean everything I said.

397
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,270
You're working to get the storyline
back on the right track.

398
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,440
How may I be of service?

He's probing for information.

401
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,160
To be honest,

402
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,190
when Nan Heng was busy
dealing with various forces in the palace,

403
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,790
I already took the reigns

404
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,680
of the Waning River Crescent.

405
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,090
So, all you need to do now

406
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,710
is point out a target for me.

407
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,310
Then I'll go after it.

408
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,000
Take me with you on every mission.

409
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,590
You'll surely be benefited.

410
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,760
If I point at the sky,

411
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,850
can you fly up high?

412
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,460
If I point at the earth,

413
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,190
can you burrow into the depths?

414
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,260
This entire world was created by me.

415

If you want to stay safe and sound,

416
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,180
just remember one thing.

417
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,790
What is it?

418
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,430
That is,

419

Let me walk you out.

426
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,000
No need for this. No need.

427
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,340
How can I trouble you

428

for such a trifle?

429
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,810
It'll make me
seem inconsiderate, won't it?

430
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:31,920
Go get some rest!

431
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,240
Okay.

432
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,400
I'm going back then.

Right.

Fugui checked the plans
of garrison defenses.

443
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,590
There are no records
of Qianyu Army being deployed last night.

444
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,960
Shanhu then asked some friends

in relevant fields,

446
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,110
and found out that those people

447
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,590
were soldiers secretly transferred

448
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,390
from the borders by Chu Guihong.

449
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,240
I recall it now.

450
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,220
According to the script,

451
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,000
after Nan Heng ascends the throne,

452
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,070
the ostracized Chu Guihong comes back
to the capital without permission

453
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,720
and deploys troops in secret,

454
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,160
hence leading to the iconic scene
of choosing one out of the two hostages.

455
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,960
Does it mean

456
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,320
the plots will remain the same?

457
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:57,830
Don't worry.

458
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,830
We've beaten down our fate once.

459

We can definitely do it again.

460
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,240
Now, as long as we get hold of the proof

461
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,200
that Chu Guihong
illegally deployed troops,

462

Yes.

write a letter to your father

470
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,110
and ask him to bring Song Yiting
to the palace.

471
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,510
The palace is heavily guarded.

472
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,970
This might deter
Chu Guihong and his father.

473
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,960
As long as Yiting and you don't show up
on the gate tower at the same time,

474
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,640

If Chu Guihong’s reinforcements
have arrived,

478

I'm afraid the guards
and Xuanjia soldiers in the capital

479
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,640
can't fight them off.

480
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,200
Don't worry.

481
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,880

Even if they can't arrive in time,

why I'm doing this?

you saved my life

513
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,920
on the battlefield.

514
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,720
At the moment you rescued me,

515
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,200
I already made up my mind

516
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,720
to do anything

517
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,880
you ask me to

518
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,830
in the future.

519
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,990
Even if you tell me to die,

520
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,090
I'll do it without asking a question.

521
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,200
Good.

522
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,840
Rong Hua,

523
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,850
you're the only one

524
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,270
I can trust now.

525
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,110
Remember,

526
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,950
if my father gives you any tasks,

527
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,510
just take on them.

528
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,340
But

529
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,860
you don't have to follow every word.

530
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,000
Physician Qin found

531
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,060
the crown prince just oddly fell ill,

532
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,880
as if he had suddenly
had a drawn-out illness

533
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,000
and suffered from poor blood circulation.

534
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,960
The physicians can't think of
a suitable therapy right now.

535
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,960
They can only make some prescriptions
to help His Highness feel better.

536
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,360
Keep the truth
from the Noble Consort for now.

537
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,300
Your Majesty.

538
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,400
Your Majesty,

539
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,130
the Eighteenth Prince is here.

540
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,440
Let him in.

541
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,350
Yes.

542
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,240
Father.

543
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:42,830
Father,

544
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,510
I heard Heng got sick.

545
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,750
You must be upset.

546
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,930
I didn't know what I could do to help,

547
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,520
so I bought some red tangerines for you.

548
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,750
Aren't they your mother's favorite?

549
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:55,830
Yes.

550
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,620
Mother's death anniversary
is in a few days.

551
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,770
Now, you're worried
about Heng's condition.

552
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,110
I thought these red tangerines

553
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,720
could bring you some comfort.

554
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,640
You've really grown up, Rui.

555
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,520
Look how attentive you are now.

556
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,590
Come on.

557
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,510
Sit down.

558
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,240
Father,

559
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,200
let me peel a tangerine for you.

560
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,720
Okay.

561
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,680
Father...

562
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,710
You're a grownup now,

563
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,740
but you can't even peel a tangerine right.

564
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,460
Well...

565
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,260
When Mother was alive,

566
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,480
she'd always peel tangerines for me.

567
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,770
I've never

568
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,560
peeled a tangerine for anyone.

569
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,830
Look how clumsy you are.

570
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,400
Let me peel it.

571
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,550
Okay.

572
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,810
Father, you eat it first.

573
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,520
Tastes sweet.

574
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,840
Only because I bought it.

575
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,510
I feel like you grew up

576
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,720
in just a blink of an eye.

577
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,000
Physically, I'm stronger now.

578
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,880
But intelligently, I'm not.

579
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,750
I did a lot of silly things before

580
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,180
and let you and Mother down.

581
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,590
Saplings can't grow into big trees

582
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,590
without proper cultivation.

583
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,750
Saying that you didn't turn out well

584
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,920
is denying my ability to
act as a decent gardener.

585
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,590
Maybe

586
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,090
I'm not a wise ruler,

587
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,550
but at least I should be a good father.

588
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,930
As long as you are healthy and safe,

589
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,200
I won't

590
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,920
feel ashamed when I meet your mother again

591
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,030
in heaven.

592
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,830
Father,

593
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,030
where-

594
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,090
where is this pessimistic talk from?

595
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,310
Father,

596
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,160
Heng's condition must worry you

597
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,310
so much that you are

598
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,510
feeling too tired, lethargic

599
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,830
and even depressed.

600
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,680
Father,

601
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,730
I've actually

602
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,590
asked the Imperial Astronomical Bureau
in private.

603
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,790
Heng fell ill

604
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,440
probably because he was invaded

605
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,720
by something evil.

606
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,920
To cure him,

607
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,750
we must use the righteousness
deep within our souls

608
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,000
and heartfelt joy

609
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,220
to suppress the evil.

610
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,680
I was going to suggest you

611
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,960
issue an imperial edict

612
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,350
to forbid disheartening remarks

613
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,480
in the palace,

614
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,440
as a way to pray for Heng

615
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,110
and for Great Jing.

616
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,550
Liu Mingxi.

617
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,790
I think I have over ten memorials to read.

618
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,680
Fetch them now.

619
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,340
Yes.

620
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,440
Father, why are you ignoring me?

621
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,720
Did I say anything wrong?

622
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,520
It's not that.

623
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,520
I'm just eating this tangerine.

624
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,310
It's so delicious.

625
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,000
Okay then.

626
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,790
Very tasty.

627
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,560
That's good.

628
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:06,720
Father,

629
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,920
will you issue

630
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,400
an imperial edict

631
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,330
to draw that evil thing out of Heng?

632
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,280
Father, are you alright?

633
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,400
You must've chocked on that tangerine.

634
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,330
Have some water.

635
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,050
Father,

636
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,880
what's happening to you?

637
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,920
Father.

638
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,790
Father!

639
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,880
Father!

640
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,650
Father!

641
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,590
I'm worried.

642
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,680
Father!

643
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,790
Royal physicians!

644
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,070
Your Majesty!

645
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:41,400
What's wrong?

646
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,630
I'm frightened!

647
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
Guards!

648
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,920
The Eighteenth Prince
poisoned the Emperor!

649
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,030
Help!

650
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,240
The Eighteenth Prince
poisoned the Emperor!

651
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,310
Help!

652
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,030
No.

653
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,070
No.

654
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,310
I didn't.

655
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,390
Father...

656
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,540
Run...

657
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,220
Ask Heng for help...

658
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,540
Your Highness.

659
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,410
Jixiang, Jixiang!

660
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,830
People are chasing after me.

661
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,000
They said I poisoned Father,

662
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,880
but I didn't.

663
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,270
I really didn't!

664
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,000
I know.

665
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,440
Let's go

666
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,310
find the crown prince.

667
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:15,750
Okay.

668
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:25,880
Guihong,

669
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,030
you came just in time.

670
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,720
Father somehow got poisoned.

671
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,250
Come with me to check it out.

672
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,110
Qianyu Army is ordered
to defend the sovereign

673
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,510
and seize the culprit
who poisoned the Emperor.

674
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,310
Take him down!

675
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,190
Back off!

676
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,520
Nan Rui, you're the culprit.

677
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,420
Are you defying the order?

678
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,240
I...

679
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,550
He did nothing wrong.

680
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,550
He's not the culprit.

681
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,080
How is he defying the order?

682
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,730
What a stubborn offender.

683
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,480
Qianyu Army

684
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,510
will still carry out its duties.

685
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,910
When swords are wielded,

686
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,090
there may be

687
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,640
bloodshed.

688
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,070
Strike!

689
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,680
Jixiang...

690
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,860
Jixiang.

691
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,190
Jixiang.

692
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,240
Jixiang.

693
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,730
Don't trust Chu Guihong.

694
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,340
Your Highness,

695
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,140
go find the crown prince now.

696
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,240
I know.

697
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,000
I know.

698
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Stop talking.

699
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,320
Where are the royal physicians?

700
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,260
Royal physicians...

701
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,480
Where are the royal physicians?

702
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,040
Get me a royal physician!

703
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:43,980
Jixiang.

704
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:44,850
Jixiang!

705
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,110
Let go of me!

706
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,640
Jixiang!

707
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,550
Jixiang!

708
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,690
Please don't die,

709
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,560
Jixiang!

710
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,160
I've lost everything.

711
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,890
You're all I have now, Jixiang!

712
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,620
Jixiang!

713
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,820
Let go of me!

714
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,030
Jixiang!

715
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:11,920
Guihong...

716
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,480
Why?

717
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:14,880
Why?

718
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,340
Why are you doing this to me?

719
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,380
Do you have something to do
with Father being poisoned?

720
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,960
Answer me.

721
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,389
Answer me now!

722
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,550
Give me an answer!

723
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,000
Xuanjia Army is here executing

724
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,710
the crown prince's order
to take the Eighteenth Prince away!

725
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,719
General Chu,

726
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,210
free the prince now.

727
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
Release him.

728
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,780
Your Highness,

729
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,590
what should we do

730
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,990
in this critical moment?

731
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,880
I beg for your instructions.

732
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,880
The Ministry of Justice has interrogated
the red tangerine vendor.

733
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,840
The eunuchs guarding outside
the Emperor's bed chamber and Liu Mingxi

734
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,170
have all given their statements.

735
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,570
It is proven
that the Eighteenth Prince

736
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,300
personally fed
those tangerines to the Emperor.

737
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,190
This...

738
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,030
This is solid evidence.

739
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,780
Your Highness.

740
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,360
What's the situation like?

741
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,550
Your Highness,

742
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,510
the royal physicians
have carefully examined

743
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,000
the poison found
in the Eighteenth Prince's residence

744
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,320
by Qianyu Army.

745
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,670
It is identical to the poison
in the red tangerines.

746
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,670
I'm asking about the Emperor!

747
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,510
His Majesty is unconscious

748
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,110
with shallow breaths now.

749
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,280
According to Physician Qin,

750
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,030
this poison is highly toxic.

751
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:02,890
It is likely...

752
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,570
It is likely to endanger
His Majesty's life!

753
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,750
Go tell Physician Qin

754
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,690
to save the Emperor's life

755
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,050
with whatever potent drugs

756
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,510
or by any means necessary.

757
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,710
I'll bear all the consequences

758
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,900
that may lead to.

759
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,650
Yes.

760
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,070
Here comes the crown prince.

761
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,590
Your Highness.

762
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,760
Your Highness!

763
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:26,970
Your Highness,

764
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,190
there are witnesses
and physical evidence.

765
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,480
The Eighteenth Prince Nan Rui is a rebel
who attempted to murder the Emperor.

766
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,230
This is an unpardonable offense.

767
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,550
Your Highness must punish him severely.

768
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,320
Yes.

769
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,840
The court is in turmoil now.

770
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,300
Danger is lurking around.

771
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,920
Your Highness must
take decisive measures now,

772
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,670
or the court will be mortally disturbed

773
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,230
and the country deeply shaken...

774
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:43,800
Shut up!

775
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,030
Nan Rui is my brother.

776
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,630
No one knows him

777
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,000
better than I do.

778
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,590
No matter who asks me,

779
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,000
be it an official, a citizen,

780
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,670
or anyone else,

781
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,130
I'll give the same answer.

782
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,590
That is, Nan Rui can't be the culprit.

783
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,440
Do you hear me?

784
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,820
Your Highness,

785
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,990
should the Ministry of Justice

786
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,230
investigate this case or not?

787
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,550
Keep investigating it,

788
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,080
till the truth is revealed.

789
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,960
Yes.

790
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,360
What are the odds?

791
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,240
Shortly after Nan Heng fell ill,

792
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,740
the Emperor was poisoned.

793
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,230
How could it have been done by Nan Rui?

794
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,780
Your Highness!

795
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,710
The royal kitchen
has sent you food three times.

796
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,440
Please eat something.

797
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,190
No, I don't have an appetite.

798
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,140
There must be hidden secrets.

799
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,770
Even so,

800
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,070
you can't proceed with the case

801
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,760
with an empty stomach.

802
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,290
Word from the royal medical office

803
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:02,130
says the Emperor might die tonight.

804
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,670
When the crown prince ascends the throne,

805
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,280
there will be many issues

806
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,010
for Your Highness to attend to.

807
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,530
Ascend the throne?

808
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,760
How could I forget about this?

809
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,960
By the time the hostage situation happens,

810
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
Nan Heng has become the new emperor.

811
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,920
Nan Heng!

812
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:21,980
[A Dream of Qingning]
[Scene 19, Episode 37]

813
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,230
You don't deserve the throne

814
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,000
for persecuting faithful officials

815
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,360
and committing regicide and patricide!

816
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,440
If you want to save these women,

817
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,770
then take your own life right here!

818
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,110
How dare you threaten me?

819
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,670
Zhixia,

820
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:31,840
where is Shangguan He?

821
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,030
He has gone to the Song Residence
to pick up Miss Yiting.

822
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,230
Have someone deliver him a message.

823
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,480
Tell him to protect Yiting

824
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,400
and to stay close to her.

825
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,280
Do you get it?

826
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,110
Go do it now!

827
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:39,800
Yes.

828
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:43,960
Yingqiu,

829
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,760
go borrow a Xuanjia troop for me.

830
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,070
I have something to do outside the palace.

831
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:47,810
Yes.

832
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,710
Jixiang...

833
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
couldn't make it.

834
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,210
As for the Emperor,

835
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,720
Physician Qin has done his best.

836
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,030
I'm afraid

837
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,270
Father won't make it through the night.

838
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,290
I believe you are innocent.

839
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,670
I'll also get to the bottom
of this case for you.

840
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,370
But before the truth is out,

841
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,280
you must stay here,

842
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,150
in case anyone stirs up chaos again.

843
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:08,920
Do you hear me?

844
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,800
It is you who caused

845
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,440
this dire situation.

846
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,630
Who are you showing

847
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:33,070
this self-defeating attitude to?

848
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,510
Heng.

849
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,320
Don't go.

850
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,150
You gave me advice before.

851
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,000
So did Jixiang.

852
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,590
But I still chose to believe Guihong.

853
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,630
What happened in the end?

854
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,590
Father is dying because of me.

855
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,200
Jixiang lost his life also because of me.

856
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,550
They are the ones

857
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,190
who care most about me.

858
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,150
Don't you think

859
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,230
I should just die?

860
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,360
At this point,

861
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,440
what's the use of saying all this?

862
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,230
Will the situation be improved

863
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,890
because you beat yourself up?

864
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,590
What can I do now?

865
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,230
Look at me.

866
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,910
I'm a giant failure!

867
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,010
A giant failure!

868
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,730
I've never

869
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,630
accomplished anything in my life.

870
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,510
I've never done anything right.

871
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,880
I'm stupid and ignorant.

872
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,880
I caused Jixiang's death.

873
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,190
Father is dying because of me.

874
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,590
Why must they die?

875
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,800
Shouldn't I be the one to die?

876
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,590
Why?

877
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,400
Why?

878
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,150
Why?

879
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,440
Why? Why? Why?

880
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,230
Why must they die?

881
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,190
Why?

882
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,510
Why?

883
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,520
Would anything change if you died?

884
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,230
Could it bring Jixiang back to life?

885
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,070
Could it cure Father?

886
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,890
Listen, Nan Rui.

887
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,130
If there's any resolution left in you,

888
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,150
then pull yourself together

889
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,360
and stand with me

890
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,490
to solve the crisis.

891
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,280
But...

892
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,590
I'm seen as a perpetrator now.

893
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,770
What exactly can I do?

894
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,550
All you need to do now

895
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,800
is think about

896
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:06,230
if there has been anything suspicious

897
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,510
since you bought the red tangerines,

898
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,310
so you can prove your innocence.

899
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,600
What's more,

900
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,400
I need you now.

901
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,740
I need you to work the problems out

902
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,770
and to bring Father
back to health with me.

903
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,210
Do you understand?

904
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:27,920
Heng,

905
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:30,800
can I make it?

906
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:40,230
You're a prince of Great Jing

907
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,550
and my brother.

908
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,360
I believe you can make it.

909
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,210
Do you hear me?
