1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry for your loss.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry for your loss.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,600
The world is so vast

10
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,600
No need to wait, no need to hate, write your own script

11
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,200
For all that's left, I'll write my own story

12
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,600
The wind that blows in the western wind

13
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,600
The wind that blows in the western wind

14
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,600
The world is so vast

15
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,600
For this life, and for all lives

16
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Who will be the victor?

17
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,800
The Legend of Chusen

18
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Episode 1

19
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
You wait outside.

20
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Yes, Crown Princess.

21
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
Yu Jie is here.

22
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Come, come, come.

23
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Sit, sit, sit.

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
His Majesty was poisoned, and Nanrui was framed.

25
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
You did all of this, right?

26
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,800
In order to make the famous scene happen quickly,

27
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
you actually hurt innocent people.

28
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
If a person wants to fill his stomach,

29
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
he will plant crops in the ground.

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
In the spring and autumn,

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
the seeds grow into fruit,

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
and at last, they are trampled.

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
This is the world's rule.

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Just like this sweet potato.

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,800
When you eat it, will you feel cruel?

36
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,800
In your eyes, people's lives are just sweet potatoes.

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
You are really absurd.

38
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
They are just a group of people

39
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
that I created myself.

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Their lives are higher than sweet potatoes.

41
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Even if they are just sweet potatoes,

42
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,800
aren't they written by you?

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Don't you have feelings for them?

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Don't you have your heart?

45
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
In front of the keyboard,

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
they are just a bunch of people

47
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
who are being changed and deleted.

48
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
If an emperor dies today,

49
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,800
I can write ten, one hundred, one thousand tomorrow.

50
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Su Xiaoyu,

51
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,800
you are the one who is not sober.

52
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
What is the difference between people in this world

53
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
and the eight toys you used to play when you were young?

54
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
They are all fake.

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
I really misjudged you.

56
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
In the real world,

57
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
you are a trash screenwriter

58
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
who doesn't care about the characters.

59
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,800
And you are a crazy person who kills innocent people.

60
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
So what?

61
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
I have the ability to kill and save people.

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Do you want to know

63
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
how Nan Hong's illness came?

64
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Didn't you poison her?

65
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
I poisoned her?

66
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,800
I'm the one who is lazy to use this kind of dirty tricks.

67
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Do you really think

68
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
there are only three mechanisms

69
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
I told you about in the script world?

70
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Let me tell you.

71
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
In the script world,

72
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
there are four...

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
There are three mechanisms.

74
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
There are other mechanisms.

75
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
It has nothing to do with Nan Hong's illness.

76
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Didn't Nan Hong tell you the truth?

77
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Okay, then I'll tell you.

78
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
The fourth mechanism is

79
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
the one who changes the scene of the play will be punished.

80
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
What about Nan Hong?

81
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
What will happen to Nan Hong?

82
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,800
If the plot is getting more and more out of order,

83
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Nan Hong will become weaker and weaker

84
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
until she dies.

85
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Song Xiaoyu,

86
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
don't you love her?

87
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Do you love the script world?

88
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Let me ask you.

89
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Are you going to violate my plot

90
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
and watch Nan Hong die?

91
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Or will you help me to go back to the scene of the play

92
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
and go back together?

93
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
So that she can still live?

94
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Shang Xiang.

95
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Today is the first day of the first lunar month.

96
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,800
In order to pray for the second lady's marriage,

97
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Madam took this lady to Yue Lao Ci this morning.

98
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Yue Lao Ci?

99
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Hurry up.

100
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Look, so many people.

101
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
That's great.

102
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Hurry up.

103
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
I told you

104
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
that I don't believe you if you want to pray for yourself.

105
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Whether the marriage is smooth or not

106
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
depends on your own relationship and management.

107
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
I can't even tell

108
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
what will happen to her in the future.

109
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
I'm afraid that hope

110
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
will be lost in these trivial things.

111
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
What are you talking about?

112
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
The lunar month is coming.

113
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,800
You can't just leave her alone.

114
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
What are you doing?

115
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
The lunar month is coming.

116
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
You should be more careful.

117
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
What the hell.

118
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
The lunar month is coming.

119
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
I, the daughter of the emperor,

120
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
am willing to live for three years.

121
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
I hope to bless my daughter

122
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,800
with a safe marriage and a smooth marriage.

123
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
I pray for you.

124
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
I pray for you.

125
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
What are you doing?

126
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Why are you standing there?

127
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Hurry up and make a wish.

128
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Hurry up.

129
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
I pray for you.

130
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
I pray for my daughter.

131
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Please bless my daughter with a safe marriage.

132
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Please bless my daughter with a smooth marriage.

133
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Mom,

134
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
a few days ago,

135
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
you made a lot of mistakes

136
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
in choosing Shangguan He.

137
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
You said he was a

138
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
pervert who wanted to steal flowers.

139
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
He said he would definitely take the money in the future.

140
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
You also said

141
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
he was short and half-inch

142
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
and he was just afraid of being bullied.

143
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
You also said

144
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
he was my husband.

145
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
I will regret it in the future.

146
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
You don't care about me even if I cry to death.

147
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
What?

148
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
You said something like this today?

149
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
What nonsense are you talking about?

150
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Hurry up.

151
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
You should respect me.

152
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Yue,

153
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
please don't mind my bad behavior.

154
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Don't get it wrong.

155
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
The bride said

156
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
the old man in the family is dead.

157
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
He is a pervert and short-inch.

158
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
I'm not talking about

159
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
my daughter's husband.

160
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Don't get it wrong.

161
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
Please, Yue.

162
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Please.

163
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
I'll give you three headshots.

164
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Yue, please bless me.

165
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
May my daughter's marriage go smoothly.

166
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,800
May my Atin be safe and sound.

167
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Madam,

168
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Tong Xinjie is here.

169
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
That's great.

170
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Hurry up.

171
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Tie it up.

172
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Hang it higher.

173
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
The higher you hang it, the better.

174
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Why are you so stupid?

175
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Come on.

176
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Give it to me.

177
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
I'll do it myself.

178
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Oh, my.

179
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
This one.

180
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
This one.

181
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
I didn't say I believed in these.

182
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,800
But since it's a wedding,

183
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,800
I'll try to do it to the best.

184
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
I'll experience it thoroughly.

185
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
You're so bad.

186
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
And these.

187
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Tell me, where should I hang it?

188
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,800
I'm glad there aren't many people praying today.

189
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
It's finally like my heart.

190
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,800
I hope God will bless you in the future.

191
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
I hope you can be happy.

192
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
Uncle Feng, wake up.

193
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Let's go home.

194
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Uncle Feng.

195
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Uncle Feng.

196
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Uncle Feng.

197
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Mother, something happened.

198
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Something happened to my daughter.

199
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Mother, something happened.

200
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
What's wrong?

201
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
What are you doing?

202
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,800
I know it's hard for you to make this decision.

203
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
But if you still resist,

204
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,800
I can only attack the Song family.

205
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
For example, your sister.

206
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
What do you want?

207
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Your Highness.

208
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
Rong Hua sent it, right?

209
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Yes.

210
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
What did you do to Tian?

211
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
You'll know when you open it.

212
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Now I just cut off one of his fingers.

213
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,800
But in the future, the Song family will be either alive or dead.

214
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
It's up to you.

215
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
You.

216
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
If you dare to touch them again,

217
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
I will kill you first.

218
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
Today is a beautiful day.

219
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,800
The plot of the second-chosen one in the city building must be very exciting.

220
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Mother, you've been busy for a long time.

221
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
I'll be here.

222
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
You go back and rest.

223
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
The doctor said

224
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,800
your father might not make it this time.

225
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,800
I just want to see him again.

226
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,800
So even if there is a chance,

227
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
I hope you can be with him.

228
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
In the future,

229
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
I will think of him.

230
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
It won't be just those years.

231
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
We are both cold and cold.

232
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
The grudge is fighting.

233
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Your Majesty.

234
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
I'll go find Qingyuan.

235
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
Okay.

236
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

237
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
I've sent someone to find the antidote.

238
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
You'll be fine.

239
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
I think

240
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
it's all Chu Gui's doing.

241
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,800
I will be careful and find out the truth.

242
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,800
I also ask Your Majesty to order the military to be transferred to the army.

243
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
I have already applied.

244
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Shitong finalist

245
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Han

246
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
You're awake.

247
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
Thank you, your majesty

248
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Rui'er is always by my side

249
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
Come

250
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Go

251
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
Yes

252
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Go

253
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Don't worry, your majesty

254
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
I have arranged the situation for 18th brother

255
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
I also want to assure you

256
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
I will do my best to protect him

257
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
I won't let anything happen to him

258
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Rui'er

259
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
What is your majesty's order?

260
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,800
Rui'er never calls me your majesty

261
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Don't let me hear you call me father

262
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
I am sorry

263
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Rui'er

264
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Can you

265
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Can you

266
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,800
Father

267
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Father

268
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
What are you doing here?

269
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
Father

270
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Father

271
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Your majesty, today is your birthday

272
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
This snow tiger

273
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,800
It is the birthday gift from the seventh prince

274
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
You are not good at learning

275
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,800
You only know how to make trouble

276
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Go back

277
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Yes

278
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
Forget it, since it is his wish

279
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Take it

280
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Your majesty

281
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
Your majesty, how are you?

282
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
I told you to watch Nanrui

283
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Why are you here?

284
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
This is the crown princess

285
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
She went to the mansion of the late prince

286
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
She didn't know what she told the prince

287
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
She didn't let the black armor army follow her

288
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Then she went alone with the prince

289
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
And let the black armor army bring her back

290
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Nan He, you lied to me again

291
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
Next life, I will punish you

292
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,800
For many many many many mistakes

293
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Go to the black armor army

294
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
Follow me to the city

295
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
Yes

296
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Don't blame me

297
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
If I didn't want to go back

298
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
I wouldn't do this to you

299
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Remember what you promised me

300
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
If A Ting and Song family are in danger

301
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
I will not let you go

302
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Even if I go back

303
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
The black armor army, how can you do this to me?

304
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
A Ting, Sister Chang

305
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
A Ting

306
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
A Ting, Ye Zuyang

307
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
You should let her go

308
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
We can't let her go until we finish the scene

309
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Sister Chang

310
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
The black armor army is in their hands

311
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
This has nothing to do with the lady

312
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
You should let her go now

313
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Otherwise, I won't cooperate with you

314
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Don't worry

315
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
She is in the carriage

316
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
She fainted because of the medicine

317
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
You know my purpose

318
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
What's the benefit of killing people?

319
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
You are right

320
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
Hurry up

321
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
Finish the scene

322
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
I promise I will send them back safely

323
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
Sister Chang

324
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
You don't believe her

325
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
Instead of being in someone else's hands

326
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
You should risk your life

327
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Fight against her

328
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
A Ting

329
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
I'm sorry

330
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
I got you into trouble

331
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
Don't worry

332
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800
I will save you

333
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
After a few hours

334
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Everything will be over

335
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Song Yimou

336
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
What are you doing?

337
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Tell me clearly

338
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Song Yimou

339
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Don't worry, A Ting

340
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
I will not let anything happen to you

341
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
I will not let anything happen to you

342
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
Yes

343
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
After the scene is over

344
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
I promise I will send them back

345
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Tie yourself up

346
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Your Highness

347
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
The troops are ready

348
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Why doesn't Shangguan He come?

349
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
It's about Song Yiting and Song Yimou's safety

350
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Shangguan He will come

351
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
No

352
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Must it be him?

353
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
You have something else to do

354
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Chief

355
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
What happened?

356
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
When I arrived

357
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Song Yiting was taken away by the Qianyu Army

358
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
We met a ambush on the road

359
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
I was the one who dragged them

360
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Chief

361
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
They caught a large number of Qianyu Army

362
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Your Highness

363
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
There are only 300 soldiers in the army

364
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
We have no chance

365
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
The soldiers on the border are on the way back

366
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
But at least three days

367
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
We have to hold on before that

368
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
How about this

369
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
You find someone to go to the Sanyang Courtyard

370
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
Let Ye Youshen go to support Erlong A Hu

371
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Make sure they hold the hands of the Qianyu Army

372
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
At least two days

373
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Chief

374
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
You are like this

375
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
You go back first

376
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Leave Erxun to me

377
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Choose a ghost

378
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
You save yours, I save mine

379
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
I have to go

380
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Ok

381
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Then tell me how to cooperate

382
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Chief

383
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
It's really snowing

384
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
I told you

385
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Destiny can't be changed

386
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
Any resistance

387
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Is self-sacrifice

388
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
In the end

389
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Still come back here

390
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
To make this ending

391
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Even if it's the same tower and snow

392
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Even if I am today

393
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
I am willing to cooperate with you to finish the plot

394
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
That doesn't mean

395
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
Other people

396
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Will live according to your ideas

397
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Because everyone

398
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
It's not the army

399
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
Everyone is not able to control

400
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Everyone is not able to control

401
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Everyone is unable to control

402
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
General Liao

403
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
They are coming

404
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Bring Song Yitian here

405
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Yes, bring him here

406
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Chu Li

407
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
I am coming

408
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Release

409
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
Chu Li

410
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Nanhang

411
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
Listen

412
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
I have the antidote

413
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
The evidence of Lanrui poisoning

414
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Is also in my hands

415
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
If you don't want to be

416
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
The criminal who killed the emperor

417
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Release the arrow immediately

418
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
You know what I want

419
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
Today in the tower

420
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
As long as you don't go to the second choice

421
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
Everything

422
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Won't end

423
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Nanhang

424
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
In this world

425
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
I didn't do anything

426
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
To help everyone

427
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
But today

428
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
If you can die

429
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
To change your whole Song family's

430
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
To change your whole Song family's

431
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
I admit

432
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Song Yimu

433
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
You said that

434
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Destiny can change

435
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
I don't believe in destiny

436
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
You can't believe it

437
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Did you hear

438
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
When is it

439
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Still boldly

440
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Decide

441
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
Song Yimu

442
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
Come down

443
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
Hurry

444
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Chu

445
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Ting

446
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
Nanhang

447
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
How about it

448
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Other girls have

449
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
We have to have

450
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,800
Don't move

451
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
I count to three

452
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Your master's life

453
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Change our Tingting to go

454
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
If you don't want

455
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
Then see whose knife is faster

456
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Ronghua, save me

457
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Ronghua, save me

458
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
I'm not afraid

459
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
I'm not afraid

460
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
I'm not afraid

461
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Ronghua, save me

462
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Don't lose

463
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
What are you doing

464
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
He is King Qianyu

465
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
You killed him

466
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
I don't recognize King Qianyu

467
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
I only recognize the general

468
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
General of the Qianyu army, listen

469
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
Nanhang's subordinates

470
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Their goal is you

471
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
By the order of the young general

472
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Nanhang and the West Party

473
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
Black Armor Army, listen

474
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Today with me

475
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Yes

476
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
General Chu

477
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,800
His Majesty's bed is actually you can find

478
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Chu Gui Hong

479
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
What do you want

480
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Naturally, it was ordered to kill

481
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
The crown prince colluded with Liu Mingxi

482
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
The king killed the emperor

483
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
I have no choice

484
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
I had to kill him

485
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,800
The king killed the emperor

486
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
What are you talking about

487
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Before I came

488
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
I have prepared a person for today's

489
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
The emperor's age

490
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
The old love of the late queen

491
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
I intended to change the old

492
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Passed to the eighteen sons of Nanrui

493
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Who knows that the crown prince Nanhang was not angry

494
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Fake the hand of Nanrui

495
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Killing the emperor

496
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Your Highness thought

497
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Record this part

498
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
On the future history

499
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Is there anything wrong

500
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
You want to rebel

501
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Heng will never let you go

502
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Heng will never let you go

503
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Black Armor Army is still on the border

504
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
In the capital, there are a thousand soldiers

505
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Your good son

506
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
Almost dead in the city

507
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
How can you fight with me

508
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,800
Three hundred Black Armor Army in the capital

509
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,800
Against five thousand soldiers

510
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
Even if he is a god

511
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Don't want to come out alive

512
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Who is going to hurt this person

513
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
Good

514
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
Fugui, take him away first

515
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
No

516
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
Listen to me

517
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Fugui, hurry

518
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,800
I can't go

519
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
I want to live with fire, I want to die with you

520
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Protect him

521
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
You

522
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
Stop the Black Armor Army

523
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Don't let them support

524
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
Fire

525
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Uncle Shang

526
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
Uncle Shang

527
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,800
Uncle Shang

528
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
Uncle Shang, are you okay

529
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,800
I was going to be a hero

530
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,800
but I didn't expect you to see me so down

531
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,800
It's her

532
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,800
What's going on? You're still joking

533
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
Let's go home

534
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Listen up, Song Yiting

535
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,800
From now on, you can't kill any man

536
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Feng Gui

537
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
Ting

538
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
Listen up, Song Yiting

539
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Some things can be done by men

540
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,800
For example, open your mouth and move your heart

541
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,800
The more you do, the less I can do

542
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,800
But fortunately, I have one last thing to do

543
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,800
That is to protect you with my life

544
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,800
Shangguan He

545
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,800
Shangguan He

546
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,800
Shangguan He

547
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
Ting

548
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
Shangguan He

549
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Feng Gui, take him away

550
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Let go of me

551
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,800
Shangguan He

552
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,800
Take him away

553
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,800
Take him away

554
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Take him away

555
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
Take him away

556
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
Look

557
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
The princess is in danger

558
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,800
She's in trouble

559
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Take him away

560
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
Take him away

561
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Tang He, you're right

562
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,800
You're the hero

563
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,800
So you'll be fine

564
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,800
Right?

565
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,800
Tang He

566
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
You can't die, do you hear me?

567
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,800
Do you hear me? You can't die, do you hear me?

568
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,800
Answer me, do you hear me?

569
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,800
I hear you

570
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,800
I hear you

571
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Don't worry

572
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,800
I'm your hero

573
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
I won't die

574
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
Tang He

575
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Tang He

576
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Can you hold on a little longer?

577
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,800
You're mine, can you hold on?

578
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,800
You can't die

579
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
You're the only one in this world

580
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
You know that

581
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
I have no one else

582
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
You're the only one

583
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
I beg you, don't die

584
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
I beg you

585
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
Okay?

586
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
I

587
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
I

588
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
I

589
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,800
I

590
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,800
Tang He

591
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,800
Tang He

592
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
I

593
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
I'm dead

594
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Here

595
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,800
I'm not a person

596
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Here

597
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,800
I'm really alive

598
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
So

599
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
So

600
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
So

601
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
So

602
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,800
Hold on

603
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Hold on

604
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Tang He

605
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
Tang He

606
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Don't die, Tang He

607
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
Tang He

608
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,800
Tang He

609
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
Tang He

610
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Are you awake?

611
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
I'm afraid you'll run away

612
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
You won't tell me

613
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
I'm sorry

614
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
I made you worry

615
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Tang He

616
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,800
Don't die

617
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,800
Don't die

618
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,800
Tang He

619
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,800
Tang He

620
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,800
So

621
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
In the future

622
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,800
No matter what happens

623
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,800
I'll face it with you

624
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,800
Everything you have

625
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
Everything you have

626
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,800
I'll solve it for you

627
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Then

628
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,800
From now on

629
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,800
Don't do anything in the future

630
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Don't hide from me

631
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,800
If I find out again

632
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Then this life

633
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,800
You just kneel down

634
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,800
Okay

635
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,800
I'll listen to you

636
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Follow me to find the ideal

637
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,800
Let me be more than me

638
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,800
I'm in love

639
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,800
How many waves of waves

640
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,800
To light up my heart

641
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Let the sun read my blood

642
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,800
Let me be the next

643
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Let me be the next

644
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,800
You remember

645
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,800
You're just a paper liar

646
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
You said the heroine of the film

647
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,800
I have to look like this

648
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
I'm the prince

649
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,800
I can't really say it in the future

650
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,800
You can't say it

651
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,800
Let the wind follow me to find the ideal

652
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,800
Let the pen draw my teeth

653
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
Let the pen draw my teeth

654
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
How many waves of waves

655
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,800
To light up my heart

656
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,800
Let the sun read my blood

657
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,800
Let me be the next

658
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,800
Let me be the next

659
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,800
Let me be the next

660
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,800
Let me be the next

661
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,800
The moon burns paper

662
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,800
The paper

663
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,800
The paper

664
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,800
The paper

665
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,800
The paper

666
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
Song Yi Meng

667
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,800
Nan Heng has died

668
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,800
If you give up the case

669
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,800
I'll kill you with my army

670
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,800
I'll spare your life

671
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,800
Add glaze

672
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,800
The mountains are not born to have wind

673
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,800
The road is not born to be flat

674
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,800
Even if you insult your Fu導

675
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,800
It's fine to humiliate my father, but it's fine to leave me with a sad face.

676
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,800
I have my own rules.

677
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,800
I can break the rules and keep the world.

678
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,800
Why should I be held in someone else's hands when I'm about to die?

679
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,800
If there are rules and controls behind this world,

680
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,800
then I should be the one who's forcing me to do so.

681
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,800
Nan Heng, thank you.

682
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,800
I've escaped many times in the past.

683
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,800
But today, I want to be like you.

684
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,800
I want to hold everything in my own hands, even if it means death.

685
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,800
Nan Heng...

686
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,800
I'm sorry.

687
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,800
I'm sorry.

688
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,800
I'm sorry.

689
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,800
I'm sorry.

690
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,800
I'm sorry.

691
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,800
I'm sorry.

692
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,800
The End
