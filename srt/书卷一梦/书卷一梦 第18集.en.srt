but your loyalty and righteousness are holding you back.

173
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,090
Do you remember that book?

174
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,480
Father,

175
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,750
Nan Heng said

176
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,470
he already burned the Qianyu Military Manual.

177
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,320
Didn't you also send people to search for it?

178
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,720
Why don't you believe it?

179
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,670
Promise me,

180
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,390
if one day

181
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,520
you find Nan Heng still has that thing,

182
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,720
you must destroy it completely.

183
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,050
It contains the method of weapon forging.

184
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,440
Do you hear me?

185
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,190
Chu Guihong,

186
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,790
if anyone dares bully you in the future,

187
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,670
just tell me.

188
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,330
I'll take care of them for you.

189
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,000
You're just bragging.

190
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,060
I'm the one who's been dealing with the eunuchs for you.

191
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,450
Killing Nan Heng again?

192
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,960
Mr. Li,

193
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,120
calm down.

194
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,120
We're not killing him—

195
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,250
we're exposing him.

196
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,500
You see,

197
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,550
Nan Heng wants to search for the method of weapon forging with you.

198
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,440
You must have evidence that he has been secretly researching the forbidden method.

199
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,270
If we hand this evidence

200
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,720
to His Majesty,

201
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,360
his rebellious ambition

202
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,630
will be fully revealed.

203
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,440
By then, we won't even need to act—

204
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,510
he'll be doomed.

205
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,440
Our engagement

206
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,840
will collapse on its own.

207
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,890
Rebellious ambition?

208
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,240
Even now,

209
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,200
your opinion of Nan Heng

210
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,460
hasn't changed at all?

211
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,000
It has.

212
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,480
I know

213
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,650
he's not just a one-dimensional villain.

214
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,870
He's a living person.

215
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,870
Also, his suspicion,

216
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,150
cunning,

217
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,270
and ruthlessness

218
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,600
all have their reasons.

219
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,010
Since I was nine,

220
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,130
I was banished to the cold palace,

221
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,440
bullied,

222
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,200
and left hungry.

223
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,510
If it weren't for being trapped

224
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,440
in the cold palace all those years,

225
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,670
and for every time he fought desperately

226
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,150
on the battlefield

227
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,350
only to be treated unfairly afterward,

228
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,160
he wouldn't have become the Nan Heng he is today, I think.

229
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,120
Since you understand all this,

230
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,350
why do you still want to harm him?

231
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,910
How is that harming him?

232
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,000
He's the one who wants to find the method of weapon forging.

233
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,360
And rebellion is something he will definitely attempt in the future.

234
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,510
It's true that I want to expose him early

235
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,440
to save my own life,

236
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,670
but I also want to prevent

237
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,550
more people from getting hurt.

238
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,670
Why can't you understand,

239
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,480
Mr. Li?

240
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,630
You'd rather believe in vague fate

241
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,320
than trust a living, breathing person.

242
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,720
How do you expect me to understand?

243
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,380
Besides, from what I've seen,

244
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,910
Nan Heng has been sincere with you.

245
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,640
How could he possibly kill you?

246
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,360
Mr. Li, why are you acting so strange today?

247
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,320
Why do you keep defending him?

248
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,240
Am I wrong?

249
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,950
Maybe he doesn't want to kill me,

250
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,650
but I will definitely die because of him.

251
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,870
This is the rule.

252
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,670
It's fate.

253
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,120
Then break the rule

254
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,270
and destroy fate.

255
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,620
You don't understand.

256
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,670
This fate can't be destroyed.

257
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,600
The iconic scene will inevitably happen.

258
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,440
Right now,

259
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,670
we can only use the rule

260
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,110
and strike first.

261
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,040
But have you thought about this—

262
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,470
if his search for the method of weapon forging becomes public,

263
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,070
His Majesty will be enraged,

264
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,200
and Nan Heng will die.

265
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,020
Or do you simply...

266
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,250
not care whether he lives or dies?

267
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,670
I...

268
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,030
Not really.

269
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,240
I just...

270
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,630

What are you two doing here?

298
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,070
Who is it?

299
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,880
Shangguan, you're finally here.

300
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,550
Last night, Chief Master came back from the Song Residence

301
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,680
and locked himself in all night.

302
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,960
He spent the whole night sharpening his blade?

303
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,750
No.

304
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,270
I'd rather he did that.

305
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,160
There's no sound from inside—

306
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,240
it's eerily quiet.

307
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,680
Yunlong and I are worried.

308
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,480
Do you think Chief Master might…

309
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,310
You two go and do something else.

310
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,570
I'll handle this here.

311
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,070
Forget it.

312
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,550
Why are you sitting here without a word?

313
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,790
You're injured, and you drank that much.

314
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,790
Do you want to die?

315
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,030
I see.

316
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,960
You went to see someone last night,

317
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,750
and she upset you again.

318
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,960
She doesn't care whether I live or die.

319
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,270
But that's not surprising.

320
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,290
I should have expected it.

321
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,160
Then why are you so down?

322
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,640
I told you,

323
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,440
this game of playing two roles

324
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,270
will only trap you in.

325
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,350
See?

326
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
Just as I thought.

327
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,470
So what should you do now?

328
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,590
Cut off all your feelings for her

329
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,750
and get rid of her?

330
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,640
Unfortunately, she can kill me,

331
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,030
but I can't kill her.

332
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,510
I know.

333
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,120
Even if you could,

334
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,990
I know you couldn't bring yourself to do it.

335
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,270
But I have to remind you.

336
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,720
About the engagement,

337
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,510
you finally seized it

338
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,480
from Chu Guihong.

339
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,030
If you act on impulse

340
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,790
and think about giving it up now,

341
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,250
everything you've done will be for nothing.

342
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,950
How did you become so haggard

343
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,830
after just one day apart?

344
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,120
Don't mention it.

345
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,640
Mr. Li's words

346
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,270
nearly broke me.

347
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,270
I need to eat something and recover.

348
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,550
Oh, Master…

349
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,960
He came back from the palace last night

350
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,790
with a dark face

351
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,640
and refused to see anyone.

352
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,370
We couldn't even get the chance to plead with him.

353
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,750
My father

354
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,230
is still not giving up.

355
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,270
He's trying everything he can to break off the engagement.

356
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,070
What a pity.

357
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,810
He won't get what he wants.

358
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,880
How do you know?

359
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,000
It's a fixed setting that Nan Heng

360
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,600
wants the Song family's power, even if he dies.

361
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,720
I'd better

362
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,480
save my strength

363
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,080
and figure out how to convince Mr. Li to help me.

364
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,040
[Gentle Breeze]

365
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,640
Your Highness,

366
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,720
you're finally back.

367
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,640
Mr. Song has been

368
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,040
waiting for quite a while in the residence.

369
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,480
Your Highness.

370
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,790
I didn't know you were visiting.

371
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,250
Sorry to keep you waiting.

372
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,110
Please, sit.

373
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,810
Your Highness, you're too polite.

374
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,070
You...

375
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,790
took the punishment for me,

376
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,160
so of course I should come and thank you.

377
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,920
These are some medicines I prepared

378
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,200
for your lash wounds.

379
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,030
Please accept them.

380
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,070
Thank you.

381
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,490
I assume you didn't come

382
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,200
just to deliver medicine? Indeed not.

383
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,110
I'm here because I have something

384
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,480
I'd like to ask you, Your Highness.

385
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,830
Your Highness,

386
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,500
what you did outside the Imperial Study yesterday—

387
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,920
how much of it was sincere,

388
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,770
and how much was out of self-interest?

389
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,220
You are a sensible man,

390
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,890
so I won't beat around the bush.

391
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,170
If I had no selfish motives,

392
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,240
I wouldn't insist on marrying her.

393
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,320
If I had no sincere feelings,

394
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,140
I wouldn't have willingly clipped my own wings.

395
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,510
Your Highness,

396
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,960
please forgive my words,

397
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,480
but the path you're on is dangerous.

398
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,400
One wrong step,

399
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,000
and there's no turning back.

400
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,640
If one day you lose power,

401
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,880
fall from a prince to a prisoner,

402
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,400
are forced to live under someone's thumb,

403
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,720
stripped of freedom—

404
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,550
or worse,

405
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,240
lose your life—

406
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,640
how will you protect Yimeng?

407
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,550
Your Highness.

408
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,790
Yimeng lost her mother young.

409
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,510
She may seem carefree,

410
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,330
but she carries everything in her heart.

411
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,440
In the future, if you succeed,

412
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,200
she'll be trapped in the palace forever.

413
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,030
If you fail,

414
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,350
her life will be in danger.

415
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,640
As her father,

416
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,920
I can't accept her

417
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,520
marrying into such a future—

418
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,790
let alone

419
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,440
living in constant fear

420
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,120
for the rest of her life.

421
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,550
Therefore,

422
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,830
I beg you, Your Highness,

423
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,240
please let her go.

424
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,420
If you agree to break off the engagement,

425
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,830
I'll owe you a great debt,

426
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,310
and I will repay it.

427
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,790
Please rise.

428
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,550
I understand

429
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,280
everything you've said.

430
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,880
In fact, on my way back just now,

431
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,790
I was wondering

432
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,240
whether I should let go of my obsession

433
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,200
and let her go.

434
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,530
But I just can't.

435
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,870
Everything I did before was to protect myself.

436
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
But in the future,

437
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,880
I want to clear the misunderstandings between her and me

438
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,010
and even become her lifelong partner.

439
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,960
I also promise you

440
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,960
that I will do everything I can

441
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,360
to keep her safe for life.

442
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,440
Of course,

443
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,480
I want to ask her opinion too.

444
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,440
I want to give myself

445
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,240
one last chance.

446
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,200
So, I'm afraid I can't

447
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,500
grant your request.

448
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,260
Protect His Highness!

449
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,970
Hurry, protect His Highness!

450
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,160
What are you laughing at?

451
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,560
What are you laughing at?

452
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,720
This is the honorable Seventh Prince's Residence.

453
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,510
Guarding it

454
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,480
is our duty as royal guards.

455
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,680
Stay alert.

456
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,160
You guys,

457
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,110
go check over there.

458
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,750
Yes.

459
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,240
I was so scared.

460
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,640
What was that?

461
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,920
Wait for me!

462
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,200
Rong Hua,

463
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,000
let's go.

464
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,080
[Song Residence]

465
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,190
Just let me see Miss Yiting.

466
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,030
Although Mr. Song wasn't saved by me yesterday,

467
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,160
I did play a part.

468
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,020
Does Miss Yiting know about this?

469
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,350
Just go back.

470
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,750
Back where? Back where?

471
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,440
Come on. Since she doesn't know,

472
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,550
you have to tell her first.

473
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,480
Our lady said

474
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,480
it's absolutely impossible between you two.

475
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,160
Please stop bothering her.

476
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:52,750
When did I...

477
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,880
How is this bothering?

478
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,550
Come on.

479
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,480
Open the door first.

480
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,280
Open the door.

481
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:56,770
Yiting?

482
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,030
Yiting!

483
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,750
It's...

484
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,990
[Song Residence]

485
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,030
What are you waiting for?

486
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,240
Hurry up and call me Mother-in-law.

487
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,480
Are you Mrs. Song?

488
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,400
Greetings, Mrs. Song.

489
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,400
Come on, come on.

490
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,110
Here.

491
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,240
Take this.

492
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:35,240
Here is Song Yiting's full schedule for this month.

493
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,070
Your Highness,

494
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,070
I have high hopes for you.

495
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,070
This is as far as I can help.

496
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:43,830
From now on,

497
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,830
don't let me down.

498
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,000
I will...

499
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,720
No.

500
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,750
Thank you, Mother-in-law.

501
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:51,790
Alright, alright.

502
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,830
I'll go in now.

503
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,310
Goodbye.

504
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,070
Miss Yiting,

505
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,160
the trendiest fabrics and dresses

506
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,230
in our shop

507
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,590
are all here.

508
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
Take a look

509
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,760
and see which style you like.

510
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,830
I'll go with whatever you decide.

511
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,110
After all, it was my mother

512
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,160
who arranged for me to have these clothes made.

513
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,820
There's no need to pretend to ask for my opinion.

514
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,730
Madam did it for your own good.

515
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,440
In the capital's noble families, every young lady

516
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,170
has several proper dresses prepared in advance,

517
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,960
so she's ready for the new year

518
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,020
and the chance to find a good husband.

519
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,720
Find a husband?

520
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,440
Will a girl die

521
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,640
if she doesn't?

522
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,830
Now that my measurements are done,

523
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,880
I'll leave now.

524
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,960
Miss Yiting,

525
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,960
wait.

526
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,450
Here's an umbrella for you.

527
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,490
Yiting,

528
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,090
what a coincidence

529
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,000
running into you here today.

530
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,350
It must be fate.

531
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,030
Perfect timing—

532
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,480
I just booked a banquet at a restaurant.

533
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,110
Miss Yiting, please…

534
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,200
Eighteenth Prince,

535
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,270
in just three days,

536
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,410
we've run into each other 21 times.

537
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,300
Do you think I'd believe that?

538
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,030
Are... are there really that many times?

539
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,480
No matter what tricks or methods

540
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,480
you used,

541
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,280
let me make it clear to you today.

542
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,030
I don't like men like you

543
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,720
who only listen to their father

544
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,310
and spend their days doing nothing worthwhile.

545
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,550
Stop wasting your energy.

546
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,400
Yiting...

547
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,640
Yiting!

548
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,880
Jixiang,

549
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,680
stop her!

550
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,880
Eighteenth Prince,

551
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,920
what are you doing?

552
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,480
Do you have any manners or shame?

553
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,270
Come on.

554
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,000
I don't mean to offend you.

555
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,750
But there's one thing

556
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,920
I must tell you.

557
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,200
You asked me before

558
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
why I wanted to get married.

559
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,960
I thought about it for a long time

560
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,000
and finally figured it out.

561
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It's not because of my father,

562
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,200
nor because I want to compete with Heng.

563
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,270
It's because

564
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,160
it was my mother's last wish.

565
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,440
She was the former empress of Great Jing.

566
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,880
You have to listen to her, right?

567
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,480
Yiting,

568
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,240
Yiting!

569
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,880
Come on.

570
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,960
My nanny told me

571
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,310
my mother hoped that when I grew up,

572
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,720
I would marry an educated woman.

573
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,640
Someone I can talk to

574
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,270
and connect with,

575
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,640
so we can live in harmony.

576
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,440
And my mother also said that

577
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,480
if I marry a girl,

578
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,110
I must love her with all my heart for life.

579
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,570
Enough!

580
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,030
Stop following me.

581
00:30:59,240 --> 00:30:59,750
Yiting!

582
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,700
Yiting!

583
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,680
Don't worry.

584
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,510
Even if you and my mother both fell into the river,

585
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,310
I'd save you first!

586
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,640
Cherries!

587
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,270
Cherries!

588
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,590
Fresh cherries!

589
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,350
Cherries!

590
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,920
Sir,

591
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,070
want some cherries?

592
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,450
Are they sweet?

593
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,960
Just try one, sir.

594
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,550
How is it?

595
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,880
Sweet.

596
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,740
But not as sweet as you.

597
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,680
Cherries!

598
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,880
Cherries!

599
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,480
The rain is too heavy!

600
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,200
Run!

601
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,720
Are you okay?

602
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,270
We're fine.

603
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,000
Don't get wet.

604
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,400
Here.

605
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,230
Thank you, sir.

606
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,070
Be careful!

607
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,270
Stop!

608
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,680
Whose carriage is being so rude?

609
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,590
My brocade robe

610
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,040
is a new style from Jiangnan.

611
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,030
Pay up!

612
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,510
You pervert!

613
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,240
This Song Yiting

614
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,240
is so arrogant

615
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,960
and disrespectful.

616
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,480
There I was, a handsome and charming man,

617
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,310
standing right in front of her,

618
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,000
yet she called me a pervert.

619
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,720
Is there such a handsome pervert

620
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,230
like me?

621
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,750
Ridiculous.

622
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,880
It's just a robe.

623
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,550
I'll give you the money

624
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,610
to buy another one.

625
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,270
Is the robe important?

626
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,750
What matters is my whole outfit

627
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,810
and the mood of strolling in the rain.

628
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,680
Just you wait.

629
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,240
I'll pull her down from that pedestal.

630
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,270
Let me remind you,

631
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,480
she's Song Yimeng's sister.

632
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,160
Don't mess with her.

633
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,550
She's not even your sister-in-law yet,

634
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,210
and you're already meddling.

635
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,270
I've already checked.

636
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,160
Song Yiting was born to Mrs. Zhou

637
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,110
and isn't close to your Yimeng.

638
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,930
Whether they're close or not, she's still a Song family daughter.

639
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,030
Don't forget,

640
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,310
the matter after you saved her last time

641
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,920
isn't over yet.

642
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,640
Don't cause me any trouble.

643
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,450
If there's nothing else, go back.

644
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
Use the back door.

645
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,960
I always use the back door.

646
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,440
Also,

647
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,400
am I the one causing her trouble?

648
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,000
It's that woman who keeps bothering me.

649
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
What can I do?

650
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,320
Haven't I told you

651
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,110
not to touch things in my study?

652
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:22,760
You...

653
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,400
Don't go too far in provoking me.

654
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,400
If you really dislike me,

655
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,880
fine, I'll quit being the Second Master.

656
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,880
Just send me back to prison.

657
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,840
Let's go now.

658
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,639
It was not you?

659
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,889
There's a thief?

660
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,880
[Righteousness and Virtue]

661
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:57,570
[Three days later]

662
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,160
It took you three days

663
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,650
to find the secret room.

664
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,590
General Chu,

665
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,000
you are useless.

666
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,190
Tell me,

667
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,280
what are you looking for?

668
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,190
Nothing.

669
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,510
There are bandits in the capital.

670
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,670
While chasing the bandits,

671
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,840
I stumbled in here by accident.

672
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,280
Even before His Majesty,

673
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,840
I'll say the same.

674
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,520
Chasing bandits to the Seventh Prince's Residence?

675
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,630
That excuse

676
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,280
is way too clumsy.

677
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,760
Whatever you say.

678
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,190
If you leave,

679
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,630
you will never get

680
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,550
what you want.

681
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,600
You came here three days ago

682
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,800
but you were careless

683
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,440
and left a trace.

684
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,480
So I had Fugui watch secretly.

685
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,240
For three days straight,

686
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,360
you searched my entire residence.

687
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,000
But the place you came to most

688
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,150
was this study.

689
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,590
So I think...

690
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,840
this is what...

691
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,630
you're...

692
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,520
[Qianyu Military Manual]

693
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,080
looking for.

694
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:44,760
Nan Heng,

695
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,840
the Qianyu Military Manual belongs to the Chu family.

696
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
Give it back to me.

697
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,360
If I remember correctly,

698
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,850
you personally gave it to me

699
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,150
19 years ago.

700
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,320
Give it back to me!

701
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,690
I gave it to a friend back then.

702
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,590
Now,

703
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,410
you're no longer a friend of mine.

704
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,150
Come to think of it,

705
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,070
once you give something away,

706
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,630
how can you take it back?

707
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,230
And I'm curious.

708
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,840
Why do you want this book so badly?

709
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,070
Is there any secret

710
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,320
hidden in it?

711
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,490
It's none of your business.

712
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,560
And you have no right to know.

713
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,550
Fine.

714
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,840
In that case,

715
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,550
I'll just...

716
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,060
Nan Heng,

717
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,990
this is the only thing my father left me!

718
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,550
He's dead.

719
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,880
You killed him!

720
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,400
You keep saying I killed him.

721
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,400
Do you have any proof?

722
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,400
My biggest regret in this life

723
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,400
is trusting you wrongly

724
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,280
and having a friend like you who abandoned me in my most critical moment!

725
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,440
I abandoned you?

726
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,420
When I was trapped in the cold palace,

727
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,870
who abandoned me?
