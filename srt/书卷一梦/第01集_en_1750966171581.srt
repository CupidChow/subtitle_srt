1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sword is heavy.

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the deep roots of the enemy.

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,800
It's not as good as the dust.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am willing to be a beast.

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
I am willing to be a beast.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
A heart is not a sword.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
The four seas are in harmony.

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
No need to wait. No need to hate.

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Write a poem for myself.

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
I will follow all the wishes.

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,800
I will write a poem with my life.

13
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
The wind blows.

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
I am not capable of running away.

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
I have no regrets in my youth.

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
I will be a man of my word.

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,800
I will sacrifice my life for this life.

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
I will sacrifice my life for the sake of all beings.

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
I will sacrifice my life for this life.

20
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
I will sacrifice my life for the sake of all beings.

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,820
The

22
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,820
The

23
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,820
The

24
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,820
The

25
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
The

26
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,820
The

27
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,820
The

28
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
The

29
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
The

30
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
The

31
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
The

32
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
The

33
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
The

34
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
The

35
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
Episode 8

36
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,780
I'm afraid that the

37
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,780
evil spirit will appear again.

38
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,780
I'm afraid that the evil spirit will appear again.

39
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,780
I'm afraid that the evil spirit will appear again.

40
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,220
If it doesn't appear again,

41
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,620
it will be too late.

42
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,220
Chu Gui Hong!

43
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,020
You're finally here.

44
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,020
The hatred of killing a father and the hatred of taking a wife.

45
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,220
Today, I will take revenge and take revenge.

46
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,220
I will take your demon's life.

47
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,020
If you want to take my life,

48
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,820
it depends on whether you have the ability.

49
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,820
General Chu!

50
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,820
General Chu!

51
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
Meng Er!

52
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,820
General Chu, I've made up my mind.

53
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,820
Why must you force me?

54
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,820
Meng Er, how can I watch you

55
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
marry such a evil spirit?

56
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
You're making a huge mistake.

57
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
You'll be in jail for life!

58
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
What's wrong with killing a spirit?

59
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,820
What's wrong with being evil?

60
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
Even if this is a mistake,

61
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
I'm willing to make it up to you.

62
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,820
I'll make it up to you!

63
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,820
Meng Er!

64
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,820
Good.

65
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,820
A traitor,

66
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,820
a woman of mine,

67
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,820
an old lover of mine,

68
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,820
but when I'm getting married,

69
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,820
in front of the people,

70
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
you're kissing me.

71
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,820
Do you really think I'm dead?

72
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,820
Meng Er!

73
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
Your Highness!

74
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,820
Your Highness,

75
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
you've misunderstood me.

76
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,820
I'm deeply in love with you.

77
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
Deeply in love?

78
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
Fine.

79
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,820
Then,

80
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,820
prove it to me.

81
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,820
Nan Heng!

82
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
Let her go!

83
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,820
I'll make you pay for your sins.

84
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
The red silk on your chest,

85
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,820
the love you said,

86
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,820
is really hard to get rid of.

87
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,820
Meng Er.

88
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,820
General Zhu.

89
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
She said she'd steal the star pot.

90
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,820
I've let you down this life.

92
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
In the next life,

93
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,820
I'll definitely take the grass and the flowers.

94
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,820
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,820
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
Meng Er!

97
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
You're so happy.

98
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
Your Highness.

99
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,820
What's wrong?

100
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,820
Didn't you say you'd do anything for me?

101
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,820
Those who hurt her will die!

103
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,820
Those who hurt her will die too!

104
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
Today,

105
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
I'll beat you to death!

106
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,820
You bitch!

107
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
You're a big bastard!

108
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
Don't mess with me.

109
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
I'll beat you to death.

111
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,820
I'm sorry, director.

112
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,820
I'm sorry. Let me interrupt.

113
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
I'm not sure if this is the right scene.

114
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,820
I'm not sure what this scene is about.

116
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,820
Nan Heng is the main character of this drama.

117
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,820
How can he write this script so well?

118
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,820
He can't even predict that Nan Er is going to stab him.

119
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,820
There's no formation.

120
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
He's just waiting to be stabbed.

121
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,820
Teacher Na, it's like this.

122
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
The triangle chain spinning wheel.

123
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,820
It's a classic scene from a drama.

124
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,820
Everyone likes this scene.

125
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,820
I like it too.

126
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,820
But have you ever thought about this?

127
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,820
This is the second time the heroine is married.

128
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
What does it mean?

129
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
It means to make the audience happy.

130
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,820
Now, the hero doesn't have any high-light or low-light.

131
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
In the whole three-night drama,

132
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,820
Nan Feng is just a word.

133
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,820
How can the audience fall in love with the hero?

134
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,820
Not only the audience,

135
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,820
but also you.

136
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,820
You fall in love with him?

137
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
I don't know if he falls in love with me.

138
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,820
He's quite good at math.

139
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,820
Shut up.

140
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
Sister Na, it's not that serious.

141
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,820
It's a series of TV series.

142
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,820
It's just one scene.

143
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,820
There are many more scenes to take advantage of the hero.

144
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
Where is it, director?

145
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
Actually, our demand is not difficult.

146
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,820
900 scenes.

147
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
I hope all the heavy scenes and scenes

148
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,820
can fall on our hero.

149
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
If you encounter any problem or difficulty,

150
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
let the hero solve it.

151
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,820
Let the audience fall in love with the hero again and again.

152
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,820
Actually,

153
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
we don't mean to make the crew difficult.

154
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,820
To be honest,

155
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
with our current KV,

156
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
the flow, the drama, and the variety show

157
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,820
are always going on.

158
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
Our last hero's drama

159
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
ended in a month and a half.

160
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,820
This time, we are especially in a hurry.

161
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,820
It's 45 days.

162
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,820
It's also because we trust the screenwriter and the director.

163
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,820
So,

164
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,820
I think when we encounter problems,

165
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,820
we shouldn't think about doubting the artist.

166
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
We should solve the difficulties together.

167
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,820
There are also

168
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,820
literary, martial arts, light, hand, and naked.

169
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,820
If we don't remember,

170
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,820
we can take a picture of it.

171
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
We are not bad actors.

172
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
Can we be suffocated by this difficulty?

173
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,820
Right?

174
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,820
Yes.

175
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
We will pay attention to

176
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
the current issues of the male team.

177
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,820
We will solve it before the shooting.

178
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,820
We will make it, okay?

179
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,820
Thank you, director.

180
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
I know that our crew

181
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
is a team of angels.

182
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,820
It's professional.

183
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,820
The name of the show is wrong.

184
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
How can it be called a dream?

185
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,820
It has nothing to do with our hero Nan Heng.

186
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
The font is also wrong.

187
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,820
You use the font.

188
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
The momentum is broken.

189
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
It's better to be thicker and bigger.

190
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,820
Also,

191
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
we don't accept kissing scenes.

192
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,820
Fans can't bear it.

193
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,820
They don't let it.

194
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,820
They can't be elegant.

195
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,820
They can't jump off the cliff.

196
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
The artist is afraid of heights.

197
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
They have to be careful in the play of the coffin.

198
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,820
Our industry

199
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
affects luck and bad luck.

200
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
There is also the issue of treatment.

201
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
We are a little special.

202
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
We need a generation of 19.

203
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
One driver, two nannies,

204
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
four assistants, six bodyguards.

205
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
Two other foreign managers, two private painters.

206
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,820
And?

207
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
And a teacher.

208
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
And a chef who can cook French food.

209
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,820
Yes.

210
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,820
How do you know?

211
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,820
I've heard a lot about it.

212
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,820
Actually,

213
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
our artist doesn't care about these things.

214
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
But as an agent,

215
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
I have to think about it carefully.

216
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
Our fan Nan Heng's fighting power

217
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
I think everyone knows it.

218
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
The canvas is empty.

219
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
He has never lost.

220
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,820
If we keep enough time for this play,

221
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
then we have to guarantee the quality.

222
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
Artists need works.

223
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,820
But the works also need artists.

224
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,820
Fans also hope that the owner gets the right treatment.

225
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
I don't want everyone here

226
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
and the studio to be exposed.

227
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,820
OK.

228
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,820
Let's change the script.

229
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
No position.

230
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
If there is a play of jumping off the cliff,

231
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
you go on it for you.

232
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
I'll do the play of the coffin.

233
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
There are other actors in this play.

234
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,820
How about we listen to their opinions?

235
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,820
Do you need help?

236
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,820
You come in person.

237
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,820
Thank you, teacher.

238
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,820
Thank you.

239
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,820
I'm OK.

240
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
You are more professional than me in the script.

241
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,820
You just decide.

242
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,820
Good actor.

243
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,820
Good actor.

244
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,820
Thank you.

245
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,820
Where is Xiaoyu?

246
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
Director, teachers.

247
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,820
This is the first time I have taken on such a big play.

248
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
This is not good acting.

249
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,820
There are too many lines.

250
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,820
How about this?

251
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,820
I'll faint when I come out of the sedan.

252
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,820
No lines.

253
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
I don't even have to talk.

254
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,820
Just kidding.

255
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,820
I'm serious.

256
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,820
I think it suits her character.

257
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,820
No, no, no.

258
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,820
That two teachers.

259
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,820
This is not OK.

260
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,820
This play shows the triangle relationship of this group of characters.

261
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,820
You are dizzy.

262
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,820
Yes, yes.

263
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
Triangle relationship is very important.

264
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,820
So, I come out of the sedan.

265
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
I fall directly under Fengfeng's feet.

266
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
Fengfeng, you don't have to care about me.

267
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,820
You just kick me directly to the feet of Liang Chen.

268
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,820
Is this OK?

269
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,820
Teacher Bianjing.

270
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,820
Triangle relationship.

271
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,820
OK.

272
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
Kick out a triangle relationship.

273
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,820
OK.

274
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,820
It's settled.

275
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,820
Go back and change the script.

276
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,820
OK.

277
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,820
It's not early today.

278
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,820
Let's stop here.

279
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Let's continue tomorrow.

280
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,820
Thank you, director.

281
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,820
Thank you, director.

282
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,820
Thank you.

283
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,820
Thank you.

284
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,820
Thank you.

285
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,820
Thank you, director.

286
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,820
Thank you all.

287
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Thank you, director.

288
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,820
Pack up.

289
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,820
Bye, director.

290
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,820
Bye.

291
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,820
Oh my god.

292
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,820
Is it so difficult?

293
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,820
Pack up.

294
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,820
See you, director.

295
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,820
Bye.

296
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,820
Don't be shy.

297
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,820
Please come to the stage.

298
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Please stand up.

299
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
Don't be shy.

300
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
Don't be shy.

301
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,820
Please come to the stage.

302
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
Fengfeng, don't be shy.

303
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
Let's have a good time.

304
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,820
Ren Hong is good.

305
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
There are people waiting for him.

306
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,820
You don't have to say it.

307
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
His sister Na is like a machine gun.

308
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,820
She's a good shooter.

309
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
I think the most tiring thing she did today

310
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,820
is playing her string for the whole afternoon.

311
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,820
Are you jealous?

312
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,820
Are you thinking of being famous?

313
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,820
You are fighting for me.

314
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,820
I let you wear a little bit of freshness.

315
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,820
Let's also get some people's enthusiasm.

316
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,820
Look at what you wear.

317
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,820
Tell me who is shooting.

318
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
Didn't you see the dress the company prepared for me?

319
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
Shen Wei, the dress is here.

320
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,820
How can I wear it?

321
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
If I wear it, I will be killed by her little pumpkin.

322
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,820
Sister, we don't have a lot of traffic in this car.

323
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,820
We don't have a lot of traffic.

324
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,820
We don't have a lot of traffic.

325
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,820
I finally got you a variety show last month.

326
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,820
You are so good.

327
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,820
You don't steal the camera or be a good person.

328
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
You actually sleep with me in there.

329
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
Isn't that a variety show?

330
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,820
You are slow.

331
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,820
Who do you think is slow?

332
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,820
Song Xiaoyu, Teacher Song, Sister Song.

333
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
If you don't want to eat this dinner,

334
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,820
you can give me a discount.

335
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,820
Don't affect my monthly KPI.

336
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,820
I will follow you back to Xinbei.

337
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,820
What's wrong?

338
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,820
Why are you angry?

339
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,820
Old Huang.

340
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,820
Old Huang.

341
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,820
Old Huang.

342
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
Didn't we agree to talk about the work?

343
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
Stop. Stop. Stop.

344
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,820
Work.

345
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
I will say it again.

346
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,820
This time you can play the leading role.

347
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,820
Not because I can be better.

348
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,820
Not because the producer thinks you have potential.

349
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
Mainly because the director

350
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,820
is willing to play the supporting role for Nanfeng

351
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,820
and all the female actors in the second half.

352
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,820
He did it all.

353
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,820
This is what we got.

354
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,820
Do you know what I mean?

355
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
I know. I know. I know.

356
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,820
So don't worry.

357
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,820
I will do my best.

358
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
I will not let our little old Huang be embarrassed.

359
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
Make up tomorrow. Don't be late.

360
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,820
I have to go now.

361
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,820
I'm leaving.

362
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,820
Be careful.

363
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,820
What's going on?

364
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
I was born in the same year.

365
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
I majored in acting in the college.

366
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
I also thought

367
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
I could be a big actor who kept making promises.

368
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,820
But I

369
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,820
I have to rely on the sky to make a living.

370
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,820
Forget it.

371
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,820
It's good to have a few shots.

372
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,820
What bike do you want?

373
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
Come on, Song Xiaoyu.

374
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,820
Get up and work.

375
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
Qingning Yimeng.

376
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,820
This name is not good.

377
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,820
It doesn't match our Bunga's position.

378
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,820
Song Yimeng's mother died since childhood.

379
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,820
Although she was cold to her mother,

380
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,820
she was covered by her father's love.

381
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
She has a weak personality.

382
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,820
She thought she would get married to Chu Huihong,

383
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,820
who had set a engagement with her childhood.

384
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,820
Until the flower banquet at the imperial garden that day,

385
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,820
the first kill of the encounter.

386
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,820
The seventh prince, Nanke.

387
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,820
TV bell console

388
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
It's just a must-watch play in his anti-war drama.

389
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,820
I'm familiar with the plot.

390
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
I have left this few play the last few times.

391
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,820
This time, I will engage in another romantic play.

392
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,820
Run!

393
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,820
Run!

394
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,820
Run!

395
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,820
Run!

396
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,820
Get up!

397
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,820
Go!

398
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,820
Be careful!

399
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,620
Your Highness, are you all right?

400
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,020
Are you hurt anywhere?

401
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,620
It's just a small wound. I'm fine.

402
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,820
But you...

403
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,220
Who told you to leave Gu City so easily?

404
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,820
Your Highness.

405
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,820
I...

406
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,820
I...

407
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,820
I...

408
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,820
I...

409
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,820
I...

410
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,820
I...

411
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,820
Your Highness.

412
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,420
I won't run away again.

413
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,620
I won't leave you again.

414
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,220
No way, Sister.

415
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,220
You fell in love with him?

416
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,420
It's not that bad to be a boss, right?

417
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,220
You have to be cool even if you have no difficulties.

418
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,620
You have to love each other even if you don't have a plot.

419
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,020
Don't be silly.

420
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,220
There's nothing so silly as being in love.

421
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,420
I'm very happy when I can spend time with my dear sister.

422
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,020
Miss Gu.

423
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,420
My dear sister.

424
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,020
Mr. Song.

425
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,020
Since you came to Gu City.

426
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,820
What happened to the тоqaf Trainer?

427
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,320
Miss Gu, it's already a worldwide program these days.

428
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,720
When will they bring about another program?

429
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,220
Whose program?

430
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,020
The Korean one.

431
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,020
You shameless daughter

432
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,020
The face of the Song family

433
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,020
You threw it all in

434
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,020
Dad

435
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,020
Chu Gui Hong and I

436
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,020
We are only father and daughter

437
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,020
We have no feelings

438
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,020
But I'm different from the Seventh Highness

439
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,020
We two are truly in love

440
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,020
Even if there is a trick

441
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,020
He has a problem

442
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,020
I will live with it

443
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,020
If he becomes a shell

444
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,020
I will live and die

445
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,020
So today

446
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,020
Even if it is the father's order

447
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,020
The family's abandonment

448
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,020
I will definitely not marry Chu Gui Hong

449
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,020
You

450
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,020
What kind of love brain club is this?

451
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,020
No more family and career

452
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,020
Just for a scumbag who has seen it twice

453
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,020
If it continues like this

454
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,020
Will it be digging wild vegetables?

455
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,020
Song Yi Ting

456
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,020
He is your brother-in-law

457
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,020
I was a brother-in-law

458
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,020
From now on

459
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,020
I'm a husband

460
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,020
You talk nonsense

461
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,020
You talk nonsense

462
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,020
You talk nonsense

463
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,020
Don't do anything

464
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,020
You don't have to do it

465
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,020
Get out

466
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,020
What the hell

467
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,020
Dare to hit a woman

468
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,020
This is my brother

469
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,020
I usually kill you

470
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,020
What kind of traffic code is there on this mountain?

471
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,020
I don't even play this set of short films

472
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,020
I didn't dig the wild vegetables

473
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,020
Not as good as Wang Baochuan

474
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,020
What are you doing?

475
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,020
Snowy night

476
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,020
Red clothes

477
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,020
Big sister, you are scared

478
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,020
Don't tell me you're going to jump off the building

479
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,020
It's not your it's not you

480
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,420
Flip the Avenue

481
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,020
waves

482
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,020
Fruit

483
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,020
Let's go

484
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,020
Come out

485
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,020
Liang Hong!

486
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,900
You killed your father and your husband.

487
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,020
You don't deserve to be the emperor.

488
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,020
Today, we will avenge General Chu.

489
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,820
Both of them have your children.

490
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,580
If you want them to live,

491
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,420
you will die here.

492
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,620
How dare you threaten me?

493
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,180
Your Majesty, please save me.

494
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,060
I'm Yiting, Your Majesty.

495
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,060
Liang Hong!

496
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,340
You said

497
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
you will never be mine.

498
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
If you still have some conscience...

499
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,500
Shoot!

500
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,020
Are you all right?

501
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,020
It turns out that everything from the beginning to the end

502
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,020
is fake.

503
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,020
The End

504
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,020
Is this a story that can be written by people?

505
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,020
This guy is so bad.

506
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,020
The plot has no logic.

507
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,020
The heroine is also like a gun.

508
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,020
How can I act?

509
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,020
The heroine fell from the wall.

510
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,020
She's still alive.

511
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,020
She even became a hostage.

512
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,020
Editor,

513
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,020
be a man.

514
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,020
What's going on?

515
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,020
I can't move.

516
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,020
The End

517
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,020
This...

518
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,020
What is this place?

519
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:59,020
When did my brother become a royal minister?

520
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,020
I don't have a vest.

521
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,020
I'm in a dream.

522
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,020
I'm still asleep in the studio.

523
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,020
Wake up.

524
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,020
Hurry up.

525
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,020
I'm going to take a makeup photo today.

526
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,020
If I dare to be late,

527
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,020
Xiao Luwen will definitely kill me.

528
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,020
Hurry up.

529
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,020
This...

530
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,020
This...

531
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,020
This is...

532
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,020
This is...

533
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,020
This is...

534
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,020
This is...

535
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,020
This is...

536
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,020
This is...

537
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,020
This...

538
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,020
What's going on?

539
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,020
There's so much gold in the tomb.

540
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,020
I can't sleep for a while.

541
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,020
I don't want to wake up.

542
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,020
These gold is so bad.

543
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,020
Think about it.

544
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,020
I roll over on such a big bed every day.

545
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:24,020
There are so many gold and silver jewelry.

546
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,020
I'm so happy.

547
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,020
This must be a dream.

548
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,020
This must be a dream.

549
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,020
Miss.

550
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,020
You're awake.

551
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,020
Please change your clothes.

552
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,020
I'm still in a dream.

553
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,020
I'm still in a dream.

554
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,020
Who am I?

555
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,020
Where is my car?

556
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,020
Miss, what's wrong with you?

557
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,020
Ying Jiu, go call the doctor.

558
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,020
Wait for me.

559
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,020
Ying Jiu?

560
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,020
Isn't she the maid in the script?

561
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,020
I...

562
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,020
Miss.

563
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,020
Miss.

564
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,020
Miss.

565
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,020
Miss.

566
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,020
A letter from the doctor.

567
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,020
Let me ask you.

568
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,020
Is this

569
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,020
the letter from the doctor

570
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,020
sent by the Minister of War

571
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,020
at the gate of the Great Jin Dynasty?

572
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,020
Yes, Miss.

573
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,020
This is the letter from the Doctor

574
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,020
at the gate of the Great Jin Dynasty

575
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,020
at the gate of the Great Jin Dynasty.

576
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,020
Then what about me?

577
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,020
Am I the one

578
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,020
who is a lucky girl

579
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,020
who was born in a bad time?

580
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,020
Yes.

581
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,020
You're the one

582
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,020
who was born in a bad time.

583
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,020
You're the lucky girl.

584
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,020
You're the lucky girl.

585
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,020
Miss, how can you say that

586
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,020
on a happy day?

587
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,020
It's so ridiculous.

588
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,020
I finally get to wear it.

589
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,020
Now that I'm in the script,

590
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,020
I'm still the unlucky girl.

591
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,020
I'm still the lucky girl.

592
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,020
No, I have to...

593
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,020
Miss.

594
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,020
Let go of me.

595
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,020
Please.

596
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,020
I'm leaving, Miss.

597
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,020
Put on the wedding dress.

598
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,020
Let me.

599
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,020
Marry?

600
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,020
Let go of me.

601
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,020
I'm telling you, I won't marry.

602
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,020
Who wants to be killed by Nan Heng?

603
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,020
Who will marry him?

604
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,020
Miss.

605
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,020
Miss.

606
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,020
What's going on?

607
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,020
General Chu's

608
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,020
wedding team is coming.

609
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,020
It's too late to be in a hurry.

610
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,020
What did you say?

611
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,020
It's too late to be in a hurry.

612
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,020
No, no.

613
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,020
What did you say last time?

614
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,020
General Chu Gui Hong's

615
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,020
wedding team is coming.

616
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,020
So the one I'm going to marry

617
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,020
is Chu Gui Hong?

618
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,020
Yes.

619
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,020
Not Nan Heng?

620
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,020
Of course.

621
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,020
I...

622
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,020
How did I forget about this?

623
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,020
In the original script,

624
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,020
Song Yi Meng

625
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,020
was going to marry Chu Gui Hong for the first time.

626
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,020
It was a trick

627
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,020
that made him run away

628
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,020
and marry Nan Heng.

629
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,020
Then I won't run away this time.

630
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,020
This beautiful life

631
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,020
is mine.

632
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,020
Change.

633
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,020
Thank you so much.

634
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,020
You brought so many water bottles.

635
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,020
Thank you, brothers and sisters.

636
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,020
What time is it?

637
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,020
Still playing around?

638
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,020
You're so nice to me.

639
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,020
Meng.

640
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,020
You've lost your memory since you were a child.

641
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,020
I wanted to keep you in Guizhong

642
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,020
for a few more years.

643
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,020
I never thought that

644
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,020
Chu Gui Hong has always asked for His Majesty's permission.

645
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,020
Fine.

646
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,020
Although he has been fighting outside for a long time,

647
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,020
his character is pure.

648
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,020
He treats you sincerely.

649
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,020
Meng.

650
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,020
Live a good life.

651
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,020
Master.

652
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,020
You don't have to worry.

653
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,020
Song Yi Meng

654
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,020
is going to the Mansion of the King of Qianyu.

655
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,020
That's a good price.

656
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,020
When you go there,

657
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,020
don't forget your sister.

658
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,020
Xue Yi is really something.

659
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,020
Her eyes

660
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,020
can't be practiced

661
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,020
for more than ten years, right?

662
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,020
She's a good mother.

663
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,020
She's a good mother.

664
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,020
She's a good mother.

665
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,020
She's a good mother.

666
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,020
Plus, she's a beautiful sister.

667
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,020
She's exactly the same as the script.

668
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,020
Mom, don't say that.

669
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,020
Do you really think everyone is like her?

670
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,020
Is she a vain and vain woman?

671
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,020
You...

672
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,020
Why are you talking like this?

673
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,020
The good morning will come soon.

674
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,020
Bride,

675
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,020
it's time.

676
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,020
We should go out.

677
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,020
The bride is going out.

678
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,020
She's exactly the same as the script.

679
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,020
It's time.

680
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,020
The wedding ceremony is about to start.

681
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,020
Congratulations!

682
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,020
Congratulations!

683
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,020
Congratulations, bride!

684
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,020
Congratulations, bride!

685
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,020
I thought

686
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,020
the script was made up

687
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,020
by the scriptwriters.

688
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,020
I didn't expect the wedding ceremony

689
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,020
to be so grand.

690
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,020
The nuns are really noble.

691
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,020
We should

692
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,020
make this a great show.

693
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,020
We'll win if we start.

694
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,020
Young mother,

695
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,020
this bride is really beautiful.

696
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,020
I like her.

697
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,020
You're so pretty.

698
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,020
So,

699
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,020
this is what it feels like to be the top.

700
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,020
Good people are all around.

701
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,020
Good words are all around.

702
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,020
No wonder everyone is so young.

703
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,020
Stop!

704
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,020
Where are you going?

705
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,020
Stop!

706
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,020
The prison guards are here.

707
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,020
The prison guards are here.

708
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,020
The prison guards are here.

709
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,020
Protect the bride.

710
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,020
Stop!

711
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,020
It doesn't matter if he's here or not.

712
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,020
Stop!

713
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,020
Anyway, we have to meet

714
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,020
the wedding today.

715
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,020
Stop! Don't run!

716
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,020
Stop!

717
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,020
Go away!

718
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,020
I'll die on the first day of the lunar month.

719
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,020
Why is it so dark?

720
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,020
This...

721
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,020
Dad,

722
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,020
why am I

723
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,020
back again?

724
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,020
Greetings, Miss Guo.

725
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,020
Please get dressed.

726
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,020
What does this mean?

727
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,020
The wedding of the Chu family is coming.

728
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,020
It'll be too late if you keep mumbling.

729
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,020
Wait.

730
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,020
I'll find a way to eat one and get one.

731
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,020
There's one thing

732
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,020
I have to do now.

733
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,020
I'm a doctor.

734
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,020
I'm a doctor.

735
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,020
Let's make a flower sedan chair together.

736
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,020
I'm a doctor.

737
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,020
I'm a doctor.

738
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,020
The Song family's technology is fire.

739
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,020
I'm a doctor.

740
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,020
Go away.

741
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,020
Don't be nervous.

742
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,020
I've strengthened the rhythm.

743
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,020
Our life-changing

744
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:58,160
life of a

745
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,020
How come he's married again?

746
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,020
What do you mean by married again?

747
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,020
The last time he used General Chu's wife,

748
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,020
he was going to hang himself.

749
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,020
He's going to hang himself.

750
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,020
What a bitch.

751
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,020
Where's the bandit?

752
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,020
The bandit.

753
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,020
The bandit.

754
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,020
What's wrong with him?

755
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,020
The bandit.

756
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,020
Why can't I hear it?

757
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,020
Give it back to me.

758
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,020
Give it back to me.

759
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,020
Stop.

760
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,020
Madam.

761
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,020
Good.

762
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,020
There's a child without a bandit.

763
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,020
The same routine.

764
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,020
You're going to punish me twice, right?

765
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,020
Why are you...

766
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,020
Why haven't you changed your wedding dress?

767
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,020
The Chu family's wedding team is coming soon.

768
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,020
You'll be late if you keep struggling, right?

769
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,020
Other people travel.

770
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,020
The flower sedan chair is broken.

771
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,020
It's my turn.

772
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,020
The flower sedan chair is dying.

773
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,020
Okay.

774
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,020
You're playing with me, right?

775
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,020
Get dressed for me.

776
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,020
Get dressed for me.

777
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,020
I'm going to marry Chu Gui Hou.

778
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,020
Report.

779
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,020
I don't believe it.

780
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,020
Mother.

781
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,020
This bride is so beautiful.

782
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,020
I like her.

783
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,020
Why is she getting married again?

784
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,020
What do you mean by getting married again?

785
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,020
Don't talk nonsense.

786
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,020
If you talk about General Chu's wife without permission,

787
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,020
you'll be beheaded.

788
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,020
Full speed ahead.

789
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,020
The half of the village will be killed.

790
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,020
Yes.

791
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,020
Give it back to me.

792
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,020
Give it back to me.

793
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,020
Stop.

794
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,020
Stop.

795
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,020
I'll obey your order.

796
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,020
Protect the lady.

797
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,020
I...

798
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,020
Are you okay?

799
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,020
I have to put on a safety mask.

800
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,020
Miss.

801
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,020
Miss.

802
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,020
Mr. Gu and Rong Hua went to catch the bandits.

803
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,020
Do we have to go to the mansion first?

804
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,020
The bridegroom hasn't arrived yet.

805
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,020
Is it really appropriate for you to do this?

806
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,020
Yes.

807
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,020
It's not appropriate.

808
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,020
Wait for you.

809
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,020
Hurry up.

810
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,020
Hurry up.

811
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,020
Hurry up.

812
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,020
Hurry up.

813
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,020
Hurry up.

814
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,020
Hurry up.

815
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,020
Hurry up.

816
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,020
Miss.

817
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,020
No.

818
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,460
G Aquaッ

819
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,020
marathon

820
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,100
Scarf

821
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:36,700
let's go

822
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,940
Are you OK

823
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,700
She is burning

824
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,100
тора

825
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:54,940
She is burning

826
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,300
Girl

827
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:01,840
Are you kidding me?

828
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,460
That hurts.

829
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,260
I burn myself!

830
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,220
What are you doing?

831
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,320
I'll take you to the panic section!

832
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,860
But it so much more fun when there's a little fish between us!

833
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,520
In this predicament,

834
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,140
no one will come look for us.

835
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,000
I should be gentle all the time

836
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,640
and wait for indicating our weakness.

837
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,580
But snacks are bound to fall out of the door.

838
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,120
Help me!

839
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,420
Press, press, press, press...

840
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,960
Wait, wait, wait...

841
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,220
Then I can make him bow over, no?

842
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,480
A lot of trouble for coming all the way here.

843
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,540
Drinking with a glass of wine.

844
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,020
My stomach.

845
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,020
Miss, what's wrong?

846
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,020
Miss! Miss!

847
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,020
Miss, did you get poisoned?

848
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,020
Who poisoned you?

849
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,020
It doesn't matter who poisoned me.

850
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,020
I'm dead.

851
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,020
I can't die.

852
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,020
Miss! Miss!

853
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,020
God, stop playing.

854
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,020
I don't want to play this role.

855
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,020
Miss!

856
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,020
Miss!

857
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,020
Miss!

858
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,020
Miss!

859
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,020
Miss!

860
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,020
God.

861
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,020
The End
