1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sword is heavy.

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the deep roots of the earth and the universe.

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
The moon crosses the thousand miles.

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,800
It's not as good as the dust.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am willing to be a beast.

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
I am willing to be a beast.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
A heart is not a sword.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
The four seas are in harmony.

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
No need to wait.

10
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
No need to hate.

11
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Write a poem for myself.

12
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
For all that I have.

13
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,800
I will write a poem with my love.

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
The wind blows.

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
I will not leave my side.

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
I will not regret my youth.

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,800
I will be a man of my word.

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,800
For this life and for all lives.

19
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
I will give my all.

20
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
A new generation of Happy Stars

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,800
is coming to you.

22
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
A poem for yourself.

23
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Episode 16

24
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
It's okay. Go.

25
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
It's bad.

26
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Meng.

27
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Don't go in. It's dangerous.

28
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
There are people inside.

29
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Li Shiliu is also there.

30
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Li Shiliu.

31
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Ready to catch them.

32
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
What time is it?

33
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
You want to catch them.

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
You should go in now and save them.

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Chu Ge Hong.

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Meng.

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
The unidentified assassin

38
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
is the responsibility of Qianyu's elite.

39
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,800
I am willing to be a beast.

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,800
A heart is not a sword.

41
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
It's not as good as the dust.

42
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,920
To build a different life

43
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,000
A heart is more than the sea

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,060
No need to be soignment

45
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,080
Write�� the script

46
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,060
To completely destroy

47
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,480
All the shortcomings

48
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,080
My dream is now a Columbia

49
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,680
Mr Li

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,520
Take this two disasters away

51
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,400
Ok, Mr Li

52
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,080
Don't cry

53
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,980
You are OK

54
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,740
Thank you.

55
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,380
Okay.

56
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,420
Take them back.

57
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,220
Thank you.

58
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:37,980
Hurry up.

59
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,700
Thank you.

60
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,220
Go.

61
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,580
Mr. Li,

62
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,780
are you hurt?

63
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,460
Are you okay?

64
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,500
I'm fine. Don't worry.

65
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,020
Great.

66
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,180
General,

67
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,140
are you still holding on?

68
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:03,900
Um.

69
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,780
Li Shiliu.

70
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,300
You planned to assassination the prince

71
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,100
to destroy the Lan continuity.

72
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,660
Will I let you

73
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,460
lo Hunter here?

74
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,180
So drunk, Chu Gui Meng.

75
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,260
One soul archaeologist un Ank l

76
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,340
Even dare to hit me?

77
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,180
Uh?

78
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,980
I'm here to do my duty.

79
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,980
Put down your weapons and come back with me.

80
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,980
What if I don't?

81
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,980
Then don't blame me for being ruthless.

82
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,980
Chu Gui Hong.

83
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,980
With your broken sword,

84
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,980
you want to take me?

85
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,980
The sword of Qian Yu and Zhan Yue

86
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,980
has been made into a hundred-leaf clover.

87
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,980
It's as weak as mud.

88
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,980
What a coincidence.

89
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,980
My weapon

90
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,980
is also made of black iron.

91
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,980
It's unbreakable.

92
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,980
Come on.

93
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,980
Try it.

94
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,980
Come on.

95
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,980
The sword is not of good quality.

96
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,980
It has nothing to do with me.

97
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,980
Impossible.

98
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,980
It's impossible.

99
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,980
Ready to catch him.

100
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,980
Boss, we're coming.

101
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,980
I'm the grass.

102
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,980
I'm the flower.

103
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,980
Boss, we're here.

104
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,980
We left as soon as we got the news.

105
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,980
It's not late.

106
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,980
What are you talking about?

107
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,980
Brothers, save the fire.

108
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,980
Come on.

109
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,980
It's not true that time is not enough.

110
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,980
Finally, two pieces of yellow are left.

111
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,980
Handsome.

112
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,980
What are you doing here?

113
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,980
Go to save the fire.

114
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,980
General, how about we...

115
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,980
Impossible.

116
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,980
I know.

117
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,980
This is the treasure that your father left you.

118
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,980
But saving the fire is the most important thing.

119
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,980
Someone must have changed my sword.

120
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,980
You...

121
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,980
No matter how long the fire lasts,

122
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,980
the people around will suffer with you.

123
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,980
You still want to use your sword?

124
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,980
Look at yourself.

125
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,980
The person you want to catch is saving the fire.

126
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,980
He didn't go anywhere.

127
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,980
He didn't even care about life and death.

128
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,980
What are you doing here?

129
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,980
What are you doing here?

130
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,980
Save the fire.

131
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,980
Hurry up.

132
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,980
Come on.

133
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,980
This is not bad.

134
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,980
Such a good sword.

135
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,980
Such a waste.

136
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,980
Let's wait and see.

137
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,980
I'm here to help you, Hero Li.

138
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,980
Nanrui set fire to the gas station?

139
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,980
How is that possible?

140
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,980
It's true. The news has spread in the capital.

141
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,980
It's said that Prince 18 was drunk and burnt a cigarette

142
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,980
and lit the gas station.

143
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,980
That's how it became a big fire.

144
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,980
How could it be Nanrui?

145
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,980
That's impossible.

146
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,980
According to the plot, it must be Nan Heng.

147
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,980
Could it be that Li Shiliu changed the plot again?

148
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,980
Changed the plot again?

149
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,980
Stop it. I'm going out.

150
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,980
Miss, you can't go out at this time.

151
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,980
It's so chaotic on the street.

152
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,980
People are discussing.

153
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,980
His Majesty ordered to investigate it thoroughly.

154
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,980
Don't make any more trouble.

155
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,980
But...

156
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,980
Miss, Miss.

157
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,980
His Lordship wants to see you.

158
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,980
Your Highness, Prince 18 has been in there for two hours.

159
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,980
It seems that he was scolded badly this time.

160
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,980
How should His Majesty punish him?

161
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,980
Punish him to be grounded?

162
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,980
That's too easy.

163
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,980
Punish him to be exiled?

164
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,980
That's not the point.

165
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,980
He won't be directly investigated, will he?

166
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,980
People are so mad.

167
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,980
People?

168
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,980
When we were students of the prince,

169
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,980
it's really different to choose the right master.

170
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,980
Look at you now.

171
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,980
Look at me now.

172
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,980
Your Highness, His Majesty wants to see you.

173
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,980
Chuan Ki Yat, pay respect to your father.

174
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,980
You king and ROM are discussing,

175
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,260
What's the meaning ofور father?

176
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,980
Meng Er.

177
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,980
Green and red tea.

178
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,820
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,900
It's a big deal.

180
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:51,900
Father,

181
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,900
do you have any specialties?

182
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,420
You drink black tea and green tea

183
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,540
and you need to be careful with your words.

184
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,060
I told you before.

185
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,220
I forgot everything.

186
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,900
Let me ask you.

187
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,780
What's the most important thing in a career?

188
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,540
Eat well, drink well, play well.

189
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,460
Wrong.

190
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,540
Let me tell you again.

191
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,060
One cup of red tea, one cup of green tea.

192
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,940
I drink one left.

193
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,820
One more cup.

194
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,020
No one can tell

195
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,860
my preference.

196
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,100
It's still yours.

197
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,860
Or,

198
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,460
the most trusted person in the court

199
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,780
is you, Mr. Song.

200
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,420
You're so smart.

201
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,620
You think

202
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,540
you can learn as much as your father.

203
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,740
No, father.

204
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,580
Why are you staring at me?

205
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,300
You were angry last night.

206
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,540
Didn't you hear what Chu Weihong said to you?

207
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,340
Should I have heard it?

208
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,260
Shouldn't you have heard it?

209
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,420
Should I have heard it?

210
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,420
Shouldn't I have heard it?

211
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,820
Father, what do you want to ask?

212
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,220
The court said

213
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,220
it was 18th Prince who worked with Chu Weihong

214
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,460
to assassinate the Seventh Prince.

215
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,140
What?

216
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,420
Nanrui assassinated Nan Heng?

217
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,900
Who said that?

218
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,660
It's nonsense.

219
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,500
His Majesty also thinks so.

220
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,380
And His Majesty thinks

221
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,420
it was the Seventh Prince who released the news.

222
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,620
Come on.

223
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,420
That's...

224
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,420
I heard that the person who assassinated you last night

225
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,420
is a wild horse.

226
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,420
Are you familiar with him?

227
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,420
Your Majesty,

228
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,420
I dare not collude with the person who is the third?

229
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,420
Stop pretending in front of me.

230
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,420
I have ordered Chu Guihong to investigate this case.

231
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,420
Your Majesty,

232
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,420
There are rumors in the court today.

233
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,420
I wonder if Your Majesty have heard of it?

234
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,420
What rumors?

235
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,420
It's just a rumor.

236
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,420
You dare to tell me?

237
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,420
Yes.

238
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,420
But I'm willing to investigate the truth.

239
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,420
Investigate the truth?

240
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,420
What if the source of this rumor is you?

241
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,420
I'm willing to take my own life.

242
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,420
Good.

243
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,420
I'll take my own life.

244
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,420
Get up, Huihua.

245
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,420
Even if this rumor is not spread by you,

246
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,420
it has nothing to do with you.

247
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,420
You've always suspected that Rui'er wants to kill you.

248
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,420
Okay.

249
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,420
I'll show you today

250
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,420
whether she dares to kill you or not.

251
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,420
Rui'er, kill her.

252
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,420
No, no, Father.

253
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,420
I dare not kill anyone.

254
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,420
Take it.

255
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,420
No, no, I dare not.

256
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,420
Kill her.

257
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,420
I dare not.

258
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,420
I'll make the decision for you.

259
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,420
I dare not.

260
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,420
Get up.

261
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,420
Did you see that?

262
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,420
Rui'er has been a big boy since childhood.

263
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,420
She doesn't even dare to kill a chicken.

264
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,420
How dare she kill you?

265
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,420
You're the killing god of the Ming Dynasty.

266
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,420
Even I heard this name,

267
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,420
I was afraid.

268
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,420
I dare not.

269
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,420
I'm willing to investigate the case of suicide

270
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,420
and clear the case of 18th Brother.

271
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,420
After all,

272
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,420
you just don't want Chu Guihong to investigate this case.

273
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,420
I think you're the one who's guilty.

274
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,420
I dare not.

275
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,420
I dare not.

276
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,420
I'm willing to investigate the case of suicide.

277
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,420
I'd like to see what tricks you can play.

278
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,420
Thank you, Your Majesty.

279
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,420
Your Majesty.

280
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,420
I have another request.

281
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,420
Speak.

282
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,420
The city south is flooded.

283
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,420
The way of defense is damaged.

284
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,420
The people hope that Your Majesty will deal with the victims.

285
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,420
You want me to deal with Rui'er?

286
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,420
I dare not.

287
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,420
I know that Your Majesty and 18th Brother are deeply in love.

288
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,420
So,

289
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,420
I'm willing to take the responsibility of rebuilding the repair and reconstruction

290
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,420
for 18th Brother's death.

291
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,420
No, no, no.

292
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,420
Father, he's definitely not that kind.

293
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,420
How could he help me?

294
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,420
He must be a bad guy.

295
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,420
Father, he...

296
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,420
Enough.

297
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,420
You don't have to worry about this.

298
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,420
Chu Guihong is Jin Zhaoyun.

299
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,420
He's always careful in his work.

300
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,420
He'll take care of the reconstruction.

301
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,420
Then I thank you on behalf of my cousin.

302
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,420
I really don't understand.

303
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,420
Aren't these two sons of His Majesty?

304
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,420
Why is His Majesty so biased?

305
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,420
Could it be because of the death of the empress?

306
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,420
Keep your voice down.

307
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,420
Don't worry, Father.

308
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,420
Didn't you just close the door and windows?

309
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,420
No one can hear you.

310
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,420
You are still too simple.

311
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,420
Today, I'll teach you the full plan.

312
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,420
Shangyuan Lantern Festival.

313
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,420
It was Chu Guihong's victory

314
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,420
outside the palace

315
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,420
to support the seventh prince.

316
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,420
If nothing goes wrong,

317
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,420
His Majesty will help him to help the future Chu army.

318
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,420
It's hard to say.

319
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,420
But in this situation, who has the most profit?

320
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,420
Who?

321
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,420
Nan Heng.

322
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,420
That's right.

323
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,420
Let's look again.

324
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,420
Last night, Nanrui set the fire.

325
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,420
Why did 18th Prince set the fire?

326
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,420
Because he...

327
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,420
Because he was drunk.

328
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,420
Why did he get drunk?

329
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,420
Because...

330
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,420
Because he was scolded.

331
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,420
Who scolded him?

332
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,420
His Highness.

333
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,420
Why did His Highness scold him?

334
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,420
Because you appeared in the prison.

335
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,420
That's right.

336
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,420
Why did you go to the prison last night?

337
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,420
Is this the point, Father?

338
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,420
Didn't you say you would give me the full plan?

339
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,420
You can continue.

340
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,420
That's right.

341
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,420
To be honest,

342
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,420
Nanrui set the fire

343
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,420
because of the seventh prince.

344
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,420
He can still plan?

345
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,420
He can calculate the time and place.

346
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,420
He can also calculate Nanrui's fire.

347
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,420
You...

348
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,420
How can you let me put my heart in it?

349
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,420
You can't think too simple.

350
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,420
Father,

351
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,420
according to your calculation,

352
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,420
Nan Heng's assassination

353
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,420
was also planned by him.

354
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,420
That's right.

355
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,420
Nan Heng designed to assassinate himself.

356
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,420
That's a good guess.

357
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,420
Stop. Stop. Stop.

358
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,420
Father, stop thinking.

359
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,420
You should do less of the full plan.

360
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,420
I'm worried that you won't be able to thank me in advance.

361
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,420
What do you mean by thank you?

362
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,420
His Majesty's new eyes

363
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,420
are all on Lin State.

364
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,420
It was 18th Prince's plan.

365
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,420
It's fine if he doesn't do it.

366
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,420
We didn't pay him in advance.

367
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,420
His Majesty still gave this job to Chu Guihong.

368
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,420
Why?

369
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,420
The fire last night was an accident.

370
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,420
I thought it was over.

371
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,420
But I didn't expect Nanrui

372
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,420
to do this because of a mistake.

373
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,420
So, what Song Yi Meng said last night

374
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,420
is true.

375
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,420
Don't you think it's a bit strange?

376
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,420
So, Song Yi Meng is the person who planned it?

377
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,420
He's the enemy you're hiding in the dark.

378
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,420
It can't be him.

379
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,420
Do you have evidence?

380
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,420
No need for evidence.

381
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,420
I know him.

382
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,420
He would never use other people's lives

383
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,420
to plan it.

384
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,420
Song Yi Meng

385
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,420
can control you with magic

386
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,420
and also has the ability to predict.

387
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,420
This woman has too many secrets.

388
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,420
In my opinion,

389
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,420
we should know her completely first.

390
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,420
Your Highness, the eldest daughter of Song's family,

391
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,420
Song Yi Meng, is here to see you.

392
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,420
Oh, no.

393
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,420
Your Highness's mask,

394
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,420
mask, and machine arm.

395
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,420
This is the Prince's mansion.

396
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,420
She wants to see the Seventh Highness.

397
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,420
Why don't you go out?

398
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,420
I heard you entered the palace today.

399
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,420
How is it?

400
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,420
His Majesty didn't punish you, did he?

401
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,420
Why is he so weird?

402
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,420
It seems that I came to see him as a joke.

403
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,420
No, I have to change another one.

404
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,420
Your Highness,

405
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,420
the assassination case yesterday,

406
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,420
you're also a victim.

407
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,420
Are you hurt there?

408
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,420
Let me see.

409
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,420
Seeing you like this,

410
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,420
I feel like I'm going to die.

411
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,420
Seeing you like this,

412
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,420
it really hurts in my heart.

413
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,420
It hurts.

414
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,420
Mom, that's too fake.

415
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,420
Your Highness,

416
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,420
I heard that you were the one who investigated

417
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,420
the assassination case yesterday.

418
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,420
Is there a possibility

419
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,420
that he is a misunderstanding?

420
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,420
No, no.

421
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,420
The target is too obvious.

422
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,420
He definitely won't let go easily.

423
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,420
If I can't,

424
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,420
I'm going to use my killer sword.

425
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,420
Your Highness.

426
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,420
What's wrong?

427
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,420
This...

428
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,420
I haven't gone to see you yet.

429
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,420
You came to the door yourself.

430
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,420
You...

431
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,420
Are you disappointed

432
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,420
to see me alive?

433
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,420
I...

434
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,420
I'll do it.

435
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,420
I'll do it.

436
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,420
Your Highness,

437
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,420
I was not sensible last night.

438
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,420
I was impulsive.

439
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,420
Please forgive me.

440
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,420
I almost died last night.

441
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,420
How can I forgive you?

442
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,420
You always wanted to kill me.

443
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,420
You came many times.

444
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,420
Even if we're

445
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,420
in the same room,

446
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,420
we're

447
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,420
just friends.

448
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,420
Your Highness.

449
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,420
Your Highness.

450
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
Let go.

451
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,420
I know.

452
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,420
Your Highness,

453
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,420
you've suffered a lot

454
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,420
in the palace today.

455
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,420
You've suffered a lot

456
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,420
in your heart.

457
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,420
But Your Highness,

458
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,420
you've done a lot.

459
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,420
Don't

460
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,420
be angry with me.

461
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,420
Enough. Stop acting.

462
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,420
I know who you are.

463
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,420
Tell me.

464
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,420
What are you going to do?

465
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,420
I'm sorry.

466
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,420
I did the assassination.

467
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,420
I was set free by 18th Prince.

468
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,420
You didn't do anything

469
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,420
but got criticized.

470
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,420
So I came here today

471
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,420
to apologize to you.

472
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,420
You wanted to kill me last night, right?

473
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,420
Why are you apologizing today?

474
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,420
I'm sorry.

475
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,420
I'm sorry.

476
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,420
I'm sorry.

477
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,420
I'm sorry.

478
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,420
I'm sorry.

479
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,420
I'm sorry.

480
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,420
Because...

481
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,420
Because you're a human.

482
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,420
People will be wronged.

483
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,420
If you're wronged,

484
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,420
you'll feel unfair

485
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,420
and you'll be extreme.

486
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,420
I couldn't

487
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,420
care about the outside world.

488
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,420
But now,

489
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,420
in my own script,

490
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,420
I can't let anyone

491
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,420
suffer the injustice.

492
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,420
Okay.

493
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,420
I'll think about it.

494
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,420
But

495
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,420
it depends on your sincerity.

496
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,420
I knew

497
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,420
you're wise

498
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,420
and generous.

499
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,420
Well...

500
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,420
Your Highness.

501
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,420
What about Lin Shiliu?

502
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,420
He's a good man.

503
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,420
He's a good man.

504
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,420
He's a good man.

505
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,420
He's a good man.

506
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,420
What about Lin Shiliu?

507
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,420
Can you

508
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,420
let him go too?

509
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,420
You're not playing with the white treasure

510
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,620
for the sake of that

511
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,420
wild grasshopper, right?

512
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,420
You care about him.

513
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,420
You care about him.

514
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,420
What if I

515
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,420
just don't want to let him go?

516
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,420
No way.

517
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,420
He's mine.

518
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,420
You can't touch him.

519
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,420
He's yours?

520
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,420
Yes.

521
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,420
You can't touch him.

522
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,420
You can't touch our Song family.

523
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,420
Our Song family

524
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,420
is not a vegetarian.

525
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,420
Don't talk to me.

526
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,420
Okay.

527
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,420
Okay.

528
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,420
You may go.

529
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,420
Your Highness, you...

530
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,420
What do you mean?

531
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,420
You mean

532
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,420
you agree to let him go?

533
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,420
I'll send someone

534
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,420
to against

535
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,420
Can Jiangyue

536
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,420
no matter how nagging you are.

537
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,420
Kill that Lin Shiliu.

538
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

539
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,900
Thank you, Your Highness!

540
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,700
Thank you, Your Highness!

541
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,100
Thank you, Your Highness!

542
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,860
If it's an orphanage,

543
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,780
you won't let her go?

544
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,180
She's my person.

545
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,220
You're touching her,

546
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,700
so you're touching our Song family.

547
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,540
Our Song family isn't jealous.

548
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,660
Don't bother me.

549
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,500
Down with Le implementing county procurement!

550
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,620
Hurry up.

551
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,940
I work for His Royal Highness.

552
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,740
Nothing ever happens to me.

553
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:41,860
Your Highness has hele

554
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,900
Your Highness.

555
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,060
Oldnaires.

556
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,180
Oldmer,

557
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,540
I don't think it's necessary.

558
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,220
Prince Yihuai,

559
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,220
I grew up with His Highness.

560
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,020
When I was his student,

561
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:51,940
you didn't know where I was.

562
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,660
You entered the school after a long journey.

563
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,660
Can you compare with me?

564
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,580
Don't think you can beat me

565
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,020
with the broken earring

566
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,460
of the second master of the Cangjiang Academy.

567
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,780
You can compare with me.

568
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,900
What are you talking about?

569
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,260
What do you mean?

570
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,980
Say it clearly.

571
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,940
Fu Gui,

572
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,820
the subordinate who can't figure out the last intention

573
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,980
is to be suspended.

574
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,220
Do I need to figure it out?

575
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,940
Your Highness, you're so stubborn.

576
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:27,900
You...

577
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,700
Where is he?

578
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:31,900
Come back!

579
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,740
What's wrong?

580
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,100
Your Highness,

581
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,020
you look so worried.

582
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,500
I made some delicious food.

583
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,620
Do you need us to...

584
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,220
No need.

585
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,580
Do you need the Court of Judicial Review

586
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,700
to investigate the assassination?

587
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,420
No need.

588
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,700
Then, no need.

589
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,900
What do you want?

590
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,100
How about this?

591
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,300
You go find three dead balls

592
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,500
and make them into Li Shiliu.

593
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,100
Then,

594
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,180
you can kill them all.

595
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,540
I'll go to the Court of Judicial Review.

596
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,540
I'll go to the Court of Judicial Review.

597
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,580
I'll go to the Court of Judicial Review.

598
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,380
Li Shiliu and A'long and A'hu

599
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,180
are the ones who fake the Cangjiang Yue

600
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,820
and commit the assassination.

601
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,580
I got it.

602
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,300
Your Highness wants to clear the Cangjiang Yue?

603
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,380
What about Chu Guihong?

604
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,020
Should we put the mastermind of this matter

605
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,740
on him

606
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,340
and clear it?

607
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:26,980
No need.

608
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,700
I'm afraid that if we investigate this matter,

609
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,580
it will implicate the Cangjiang Yue

610
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,700
and Song Yi...

611
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,420
I got it again.

612
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,820
Your Highness not only wants to clear the Cangjiang Yue

613
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,380
but also wants to protect Miss Song's mansion.

614
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,940
Anything else?

615
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,740
You can go out if you have nothing else.

616
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,100
Your Highness,

617
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,180
is that something

618
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,260
given by Miss Song?

619
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,940
I know

620
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,300
Miss Song very well.

621
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,620
I just read

622
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,140
Miss Song's life experience.

623
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,660
Why don't I take a look with you?

624
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,380
You?

625
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,420
You are so mean.

626
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,820
What do you want to know?

627
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,660
Just ask me.

628
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,340
Then I'll ask you

629
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,460
what the script is.

630
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,420
Of course I know.

631
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,140
The script

632
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,340
is to gather the money first.

633
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,220
Your Highness, are you going to open a store?

634
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,980
Let's gather the money first

635
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,500
and then find a forgotten shop

636
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,300
in the market area.

637
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,140
I'm asking you again.

638
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,980
What is the main character?

639
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,060
What is the supporting character?

640
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,020
Oh, no.

641
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,420
I know that feelings are killing,

642
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,340
and I can't sleep.

643
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,940
If I don't do it, I don't know what's going on.

644
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,700
What is the supporting character?

645
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,540
What is the supporting character?

646
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,260
Your Highness.

647
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,860
Your Highness, why are you leaving?

648
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,700
Your Highness.

649
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,620
Give me another chance, Your Highness.

650
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,740
Hero Li,

651
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,660
you also want to participate in this repair?

652
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,860
The chaos in Nan City

653
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,140
caused many people to leave their homes.

654
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,420
The outsiders know

655
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,860
that I am the master of the Cangjiang Courtyard

656
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,340
and I have been in the world for a long time.

657
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,220
But I didn't know

658
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,340
that I also have the ambition to save the world.

659
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,940
Hero Li is really gentle and kind.

660
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,540
He saves people and cares about the people.

661
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,060
But this repair

662
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,540
is the court's project.

663
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,940
Nan Heng is a sinister person.

664
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,260
If he knows that you are still in the capital,

665
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,540
it will be a trouble.

666
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,220
The assassination has been over.

667
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,580
Although I don't know who

668
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,940
helped us to escape the punishment,

669
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,340
but the court has already settled the case.

670
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,500
So I don't know who did it.

671
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,420
I am a pure person.

672
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,340
I can't be afraid for a lifetime

673
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,500
because of a moment's mistake.

674
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,100
But...

675
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,780
Don't worry.

676
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,860
I have been in the capital for many years.

677
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,820
I still have the ability to protect myself.

678
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,820
Although Nan Heng is

679
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,180
a sinister person who does not know the means,

680
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,420
plus he holds the power,

681
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,820
there is no doubt that

682
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,140
he is smart and talented.

683
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:34,900
I...

684
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,740
Anyway,

685
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,060
I have promised

686
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,820
to cooperate with Miss Song to deal with Nan Heng.

687
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,700
I will not leave the capital alone.

688
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,020
So I will definitely

689
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,900
take the responsibility for Nan Heng.

690
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:49,740
Hero Li,

691
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,660
you are really a good person.

692
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,940
This hero is a hero in the end.

693
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,660
The gap is opened in a second.

694
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,140
Then I will go with you tomorrow.

695
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,020
I will build a house for everyone with you.

696
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:14,900
Okay.

697
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,620
A sinister person who does not know the means.

698
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,740
Something wrong with you?

699
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,980
Say a few words of concern to let him trust me.

700
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,020
What's wrong?

701
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,260
Although it is true,

702
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,860
you can't say anything that will displease the Seventh Prince.

703
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:37,860
Isn't it exciting?

704
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,580
It was before,

705
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,380
but now I am Li Shiliu.

706
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,100
Is there a problem?

707
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,340
No problem.

708
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,420
It's just that you used to

709
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,420
put in all your effort to kill him.

710
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,100
Now you put in all your effort for him.

711
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:56,500
What a good-hearted and kind-hearted Li Shiliu.

712
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,100
If I were a woman,

713
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,500
I would have fallen in love with you long ago.

714
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,300
First,

715
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,420
I am not you.

716
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,420
I am lazy and jealous.

717
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,820
Second,

718
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,380
it is true that I am cultivating the fan.

719
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,780
And I am not alone.

720
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,420
The whole Cangjiang Yue will participate in cultivating the fan.

721
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,220
Including you.

722
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,580
And me?

723
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,100
Am I suitable to go to cultivate the fan?

724
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,220
You are so cool.

725
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,500
I have to let you go out and show off.

726
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,180
I am the most beautiful person.

727
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500
You are not lacking in style.

728
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:32,620
Your Highness,

729
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,380
if the officials are not willing to go,

730
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,940
then there are capable people willing to work for you.

731
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,620
That's great.

732
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,100
I have participated in

733
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,860
the cultivation of the fan of our Black Armor Army.

734
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,420
And I often go to the Ministry of Works

735
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,740
to make a living.

736
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,700
I have a lot of experience in cultivating the fan.

737
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,820
If Your Highness is willing to...

738
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,500
I am not willing.

739
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:49,900
I am telling you.

740
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,540
In the future, when I am Li Shiliu,

741
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,260
stay away from me.

742
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,500
You will make people doubt you.

743
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,140
Your Highness,

744
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,580
you have been appearing

745
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,980
as Li Shiliu for a long time.

746
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,460
I can't work for you anymore.

747
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,300
I don't need you.

748
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,620
Brother,

749
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,180
you and I

750
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,180
are just a match made in the image.

751
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,420
Flowers,

752
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,580
green leaves,

753
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,580
and lights.

754
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,340
Brothers,

755
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,300
the glory of the boss

756
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,700
is the glory of every night god.

757
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,020
The boss's love

758
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,660
is the love of every one of us.

759
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,260
To be righteous

760
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,460
and to save the country

761
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,660
is our mission.

762
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,140
Let's work hard

763
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,860
on our dream.

764
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:37,900
Yes.

765
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:38,940
Let's go.

766
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,580
Great.

767
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,540
Great.

768
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,700
No one is ever allowed to sit

769
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,180
on his feet during the Imperial Court affair.

770
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,420
Take these Ж Pardoners away.

771
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:14,780
Yes.

772
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,920
Yes.

773
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,900
Chu Ruiheng,

774
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,740
what are you

775
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,420
on your mind about?

776
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,140
You are asking your Does acart chewy?

777
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,820
Chewy?

778
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,020
Go check around.

779
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,020
What nonsense.

780
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,980
If you are

781
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,980
I'm not afraid of you.

782
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,180
Meng,

783
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,100
the cultivation of the mountain is the state affair.

784
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,900
Li Shiliu is a man of the martial arts world.

785
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,540
He's involved in the assassination of the Seventh Highness.

786
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,180
If His Majesty hadn't asked for it,

787
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,620
he would have been a fugitive.

788
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,180
How could such a person

789
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,420
participate in the cultivation of the mountain?

790
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,700
It's ridiculous.

791
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:46,980
Fine.

792
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,300
Then I want to ask you

793
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,460
what the state affair is.

794
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,380
The state affair is about the reputation of the people.

795
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,620
What is the reputation?

796
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,300
The daily life of ordinary people

797
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,380
is about the food and clothing.

798
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,900
You're a guard at the border for a long time.

799
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,460
You don't even know how much a bag of rice is worth.

800
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,180
Can you be more flexible than General Cang?

801
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,300
You can't.

802
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,140
But they're different.

803
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,140
The Night God

804
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,500
has been mixed with the south of the city.

805
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,980
There are many refugees here.

806
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,620
How about the folk customs?

807
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,660
What kind of wood is cheap and easy to use?

808
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,100
They know it too well.

809
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,020
So, Chu Guihou,

810
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,380
why don't you take the free labor

811
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,740
that was sent to us?

812
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:31,780
Mu'er,

813
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,620
it's not as simple as you think.

814
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,220
If they're not guilty,

815
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,020
or...

816
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,020
Or what?

817
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,380
After all,

818
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,940
you still don't believe it.

819
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,980
You forgot that fire.

820
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,460
Who didn't care about safety

821
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,660
and saved the people

822
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,900
along with the whole Canjiang.

823
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,020
You must neck a technique.

824
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,820
Get down immediately.

825
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,340
Yes, yes.

826
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,620
You see,

827
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,780
I'm opening this content without any Listener.

828
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,420
Well,

829
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,020
there are some people

830
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,140
who even pretend to be grandparents

831
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,160
in front of the poverty

832
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,740
and think about their weapons.

833
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,540
Mu'er,

834
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:21,900
don't say it.

835
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,020
Yes.

836
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,020
Miss Song.

837
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,020
Aren't you afraid that

838
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,020
I will tell your private relationship with His Highness

839
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,020
and that Jianghu friend?

840
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,020
Don't talk nonsense.

841
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:01,020
When did I have a private relationship with your master?

842
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,020
Yi Hua Garden.

843
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,020
You two are...

844
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,020
Huangzi Lake Garden.

845
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,020
You two are...

846
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,020
You two know...

847
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,020
Stop.

848
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,020
Which Dingliu

849
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,020
didn't come to the right place?

850
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,020
I know.

851
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,020
It's not easy for you to be a dog.

852
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,020
You just want to make some money.

853
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,020
The wind and fire fee.

854
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,020
Forget about those...

855
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,020
Okay.

856
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,020
Gu Yi, take it.

857
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,020
I won't forget you if there is a good thing in the future.

858
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,020
If you take the money...

859
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,020
Gao Duo.

860
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,020
What is Dingliu?

861
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,020
What is dog?

862
00:41:54,020 --> 00:42:01,020
The city is crowded with cold mist.

863
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:12,020
You and I are fated to be entangled in the wrong.

864
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:19,020
The sky is clear in the ear.

865
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:24,020
The sky is clear in the ear.

866
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,020
The dark night's ambition.

867
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:33,020
The eyes and hands are confused.

868
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:37,020
When will we return?

869
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:41,020
Although the wind blows and the water flows,

870
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:46,020
it's not like the fates that tell us to stay together.

871
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,020
The flowers and the stars seem to be in a dream.

872
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:54,020
How can love and hate be hidden?

873
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:58,020
The years pass by like wind and rain.

874
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:03,020
The past life is not destined.

875
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,020
If it's not decided one day,

876
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,020
how can we write the ending?

877
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:43,020
The sky is clear in the ear.

878
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:47,020
The flowers and the stars seem to be in a dream.

879
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,020
How can love and hate be hidden?

880
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:55,020
The years pass by like wind and rain.

881
00:43:55,020 --> 00:44:00,020
The past life is not destined.

882
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,020
If it's not decided one day,

883
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,020
how can we write the ending?

884
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:13,020
The love and hate are still in the eyes.
