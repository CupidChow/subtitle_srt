[Episode 28]

3
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,630
You're clearly still alive,

4
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,240
why didn't you come find me?

5
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,010
Say something.

6
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,750
Speak up!

7
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,329
Speak up.

8
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,400
Speak up!

9
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,680
Guihong! Guihong!

10
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,190
Stop!

11
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,800
Guihong!

12
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,870
Don't hit him!

13
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,360
Wait.

14
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,770
W-Who exactly is he?

15
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,380
The Scout of Qianyu Army Sixth Battalion.

16
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,370
Lu Yi.

17
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,079
No, no, stop!

18
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,310
Wait, wait, let me think.

19
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,670
Let me remember.

20
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:52,800
You're

21
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,680
the scout who delivered

22
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,010
that distress message.

23
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,360
You're alive?

24
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,200
Two armies crossed blades

25
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,840
and all your comrades died,

26
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,240
yet you alone survived.

27
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,620
Lu Yi,

28
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,590
you deserted.

29
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,760
You abandoned everyone

30
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,770
and ran away!

31
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,390
Junior General!

32
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,630
I didn't!

33
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,430
I didn't!

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,960
Twenty thousand lives,

35
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,180
do you know how they all died?

36
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,400
[The 6th day of Pingrong Battle]

37
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,080
General.

38
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,250
Junior General.

39
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,310
Any news from the Xuanjia Army?

40
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,800
It's been two days and nights,

41
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,310
and even Lu Yi

42
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,840
has disappeared without a trace.

43
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,770
The Xuanjia Army

44
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,890
probably won't come anymore.

45
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,160
You said the Xuanjia Army would come
to our rescue,

46
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,220
and told us to wait.

47
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,600
We've waited for two days,

48
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,730
and what have we got?

49
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,959
Say something!

50
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,240
Nan Heng is the one

51
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,250
who selfishly

52
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,240
refused to help us.

53
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Is this the Junior General's fault?

54
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,920
If he hadn’t pinned his hopes
on that
God of Death,

55
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,750
we could have tried other tactics
long ago!

56
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,310
We wouldn’t have been besieged like this!

57
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,040
Enough!

58
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,070
The battle is imminent,

59
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,470
yet you're speaking such defeatist words.

60
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,200
If reinforcements come,

61
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,270
we'll fight together against our enemy.

62
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,680
If reinforcements don't come,

63
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,950
what would stop us Qianyu Army

64
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,140
from fighting to the very last man?

65
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,270
Father,

66
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,770
I've made my decision.

67
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,870
Tonight I'll lead men into the enemy's
camp

68
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,510
to assassinate Fang Shiming.

69
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,480
If we succeed,

70
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,040
the Heyuan forces will surely fall into
chaos.

71
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,900
The Qianyu Army

72
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,430
can then seize this opportunity

73
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,630
to turn the tide of battle in one stroke.

74
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,480
Good!

75
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,070
Kill them!

76
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,650
Twenty thousand Qianyu soldiers

77
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,600
died bearing the shame of defeat,

78
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,050
and their injustice has yet to be cleared
to this day.

79
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,190
All this happened

80
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,040
because Nan Heng didn't send troops to help

81
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,640
during the Pingrong Battle.

82
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,510
Lu Yi,

83
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,600
tell me,

84
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,280
that letter I passed to you,

85
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,870
did you deliver it or not?

86
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,970
Was it Nan Heng

87
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,690
who caused my father's death?

88
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
You're suddenly mute now?

89
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,310
Say something!

90
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,090
Junior General,

91
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,870
I've failed you

92
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,920
and the Old General.

93
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,510
All of this

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,480
was forced upon me by Nan Heng.

95
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,600
He received the letter.

96
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,100
He received the letter.

97
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,920
I knew it,

98
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,400
he should have sent troops.

99
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,970
Why didn't you speak up earlier?

100
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,970
Where were you when the Ministry of War
was investigating?

101
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,390
Where were you when the Qianyu Army

102
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,360
was facing disaster?

103
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,430
It's useless.

104
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,070
Nan Heng's power is overwhelming.

105
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,950
It's not that I didn't want to speak up,

106
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,390
I simply couldn't.

107
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,420
That day,

108
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,550
when I traveled a hundred li at night to
reach Youcheng,

109
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,550
he had already planned everything.

110
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,830
He deliberately wanted those 20,000 troops
dead.

111
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,159
Only this way

112
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,120
could he alone

113
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,820
claim all the battle honours.

114
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,280
What happened after that?

115
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,840
Since you made it to the capital,

116
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,370
you must've had countless chances to
find me.

117
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,680
Where did this courtyard come from?

118
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,720
And how did you get this business?

119
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,430
He bought you off,

120
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,490
didn't he?

121
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,880
Junior General,

122
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,830
I'm useless.

123
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,630
Nan Heng took away my wife and children.

124
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,510
I... I truly had no choice.

125
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,600
I deserve to die.

126
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,510
I'm not human.

127
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,630
Just kill me.

128
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,680
He...

129
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,160
Don't! Don't!

130
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,190
How could the Qianyu Army

131
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,480
have such a servile coward like you!

132
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:31,800
Guihong!

133
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,600
Let me kill him!

134
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:32,909
Calm down!

135
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,870
Let me kill him!

136
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,080
Listen to me, listen.

137
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,150
Spare his life.

138
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,270
If what he says is true,

139
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,440
you should keep him alive

140
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,039
to testify against Nan Heng.

141
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,930
If the Junior General could trust me
once more,

142
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,510
give me eight hours.

143
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,070
Let me make arrangements for my family,

144
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,440
and I'll testify against Nan Heng.

145
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,100
I'll be waiting for you, General,

146
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,050
at the Jiangsong Forest outside the city,

147
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,540
at midnight today.

[Qianyu Mansion]

149
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,980
These are all the files

150
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,050
from the Qianyu Army regarding
the Pingrong Battle.

151
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,390
Now we have a witness too.

152
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,550
Once we get Lu Yi's testimony,

153
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,530
we can convict Nan Heng.

154
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
Guihong,

155
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,910
although I'm a bit slow-witted,

156
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,000
I've been thinking about this.

157
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,240
Don't you find Lu Yi's appearance

158
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,510
rather sudden?

159
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,080
Should we investigate him further?

160
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,000
We should at least find out

161
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,200
where he's been staying

162
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,630
since returning from Pingrong,

163
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,000
right?

164
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,320
And who he's met with?

165
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,080
What if

166
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,790
he did not telling the truth today?

167
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,320
The Qianyu Army never lies.

168
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,670
Your Highness doesn't know what I went
through in that battle,

169
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,930
nor could you possibly understand what

170
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,580
my actions now truly mean.

171
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,550
Guihong,

172
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,630
I understand.

173
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,080
Clearing the Qianyu Army's name

174
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,120
means more to you than anything.

175
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,840
Your Highness need not involve yourself
in this matter.

176
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,300
Once I've cleared the name

177
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,320
of my father and the Qianyu heroes,

178
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,930
and eliminated Nan Heng and his faction,

179
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,150
Your Highness can look forward to
securing the throne.

180
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,000
But that doesn't mean we should...

181
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,860
Your Highness.

182
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,250
Your Highness.

183
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,080
General.

184
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,670
It's almost midnight.

185
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,480
Guihong.

186
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,440
I'm coming too!

187
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,320
Wait for me!

188
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,670
Don't walk so fast!

189
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,660
[Jiangsong Forest]

190
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,360
We've been

191
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,840
waiting for 15 minutes now.

192
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,200
Why is there no sign of anyone?

193
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,000
Wait.

194
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,750
Do you think

195
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,840
he changed his mind?

196
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,040
Wait.

197
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Wait, wait for me!

198
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,270
Who's that person?

199
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,720
Something's wrong.

200
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,360
Retreat.

201
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,640
What are you all doing here?

202
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,320
G-Guihong.

203
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,590
A dead body!

204
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,120
Be careful.

205
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,240
Why did you kill Lu Yi?

206
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,030
Boss,

207
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,480
I've told you many times,

208
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,150
we don't know any Lu Jia or Lu Yi,

209
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,510
we were just passing by.

210
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,870
He was already dead when we passed by.

211
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,240
Even if you're blind,

212
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,320
your ears are working, aren't they?

213
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,780
I'll ask you one last time.

214
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,390
Did Nan Heng order you two

215
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,670
to kill him to silence him?

216
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,030
Enough with this nonsense.

217
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,360
What do others have to do with this?

218
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,440
If you want to fight,

219
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,240
do it now,

220
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,600
Quit acting like a big shot.

221
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,630
Cut the crap.

222
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,390
General,

223
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,710
these two are close friends with Nan Heng,

224
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,940
yet they're still acting clueless.

225
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,280
I think, like Shangguan He,

226
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,720
they'll be unwilling to testify for us.

227
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,240
We might as well kill them!

228
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,960
No.

229
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,240
We need them alive as witnesses.

230
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,860
Behind the Pingrong Battle

231
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,750
are the lives of people from three cities

232
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,720
and 20,000 Qianyu Army soldiers.

233
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,150
This time,

234
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,640
I won't let Nan Heng off easily

235
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,240
like I did with the Jiangnan case.

236
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,220
Bah!

237
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,030
So you want us to give false testimony?

238
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,280
Keep dreaming.

239
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,870
Those 20,000 dead Qianyu soldiers

240
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,120
had the worst luck having a treacherous
person like you

241
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,010
as their general.

242
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,420
What are you doing?

243
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,070
People who disrespect the Qianyu Army,

244
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,110
die.

245
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,620
Let him go!

246
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,790
Use these on them

247
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,910
one by one, properly.

248
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,440
At the Three Bureaus' Joint Interrogation,

249
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,170
I will make them confess everything

250
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,130
in front of Nan Heng.

251
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,320
Guihong.

252
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,630
Guihong.

253
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,320
What if Yunlong and Shanhu aren't lying?

254
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
What if they really didn't kill him?

255
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,430
Who killed Lu Yi doesn't matter.

256
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,700
What matters is that I need witnesses

257
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,090
to convince Your Majesty

258
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,590
that Nan Heng killed the messenger
that day,

259
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,550
planting the seed of doubt.

260
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,240
This way,

261
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,220
only then will Your Majesty believe

262
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,550
that all the crimes of the Pingrong Battle

263
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,510
were planned by Nan Heng.

264
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,120
So...

265
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,270
The reason you tortured them

266
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,330
is to force them to incriminate Heng?

267
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,520
The Jiangnan case from three years ago

268
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,550
was reopened by Shangguan He.

269
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,120
Now I have Yunlong and Shanhu in my
custody.

270
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,380
Using the same method,

271
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,690
reopening the Pingrong case

272
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,230
is certainly possible.

273
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,540
Guihong,

274
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,360
you've changed.

275
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,910
You weren't like this before.

276
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,750
You would never torture people
for confessions.

277
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,750
Before, I wasn't betrayed by everyone,

278
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,840
nor did Nan Heng cause the death of
my father and brothers-in-arms.

279
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,750
No, but even so,

280
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,390
you can't become like Nan Heng.

281
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,140
Make them stop for a while.

282
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,840
Your Highness has always been someone

283
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,270
who only knows how to hide behind me,

284
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,130
who talks but doesn't dare to act.

285
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,400
What right do you have to lecture me?

286
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,300
I...

287
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,740
I've prepared all the documents
related to the Pingrong Battle

288
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,890
and I'll request a Three Bureaus' Joint
Interrogation tomorrow.

289
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,600
Guihong.

290
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:07,910
Guihong.

291
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,600
Now that Chancellor Gao is dead,

292
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,510
Lu Yi is dead,

293
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,550
and the letter of appeal is also missing,

294
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,960
all witnesses and evidence are gone.

295
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,910
Besides, the Ministry of Justice is filled
with Nan Heng's people.

296
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,410
Even if you reopen the case,

297
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,500
what different outcome
could you possibly get?

298
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,830
That's where I need Your Highness's help.

299
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,360
What do you need me to do?

300
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,680
Your Highness only needs to truthfully

301
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,910
tell everything you heard and saw

302
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,730
during the meeting with Lu Yi.

303
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,240
His Majesty trusts Your Highness the most.

304
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,640
If you speak up,

305
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,930
it's as good as having Lu Yi's testimony.

306
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,980
Along with Yunlong and Shanhu

307
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,160
as witnesses to Nan Heng's murder,

308
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,380
it's enough to make him pay for
the tragedy at Pingrong.

309
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,160
What's wrong?

310
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,610
Your Highness is unwilling?

311
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,440
Everything the Qianyu Army and I did,

312
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,640
whether on the battlefield

313
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,720
or at the capital prefecture's office,

314
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,000
all of those efforts

315
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,310
were to pave the way for Your Highness.

316
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,599
I never expected that
when the time has come,

317
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,180
you would be so cowardly.

318
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,069
Guihong,

319
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,440
that's not quite right.

320
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,730
Your fighting on the battlefield

321
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,560
was for the stability of Great Jing.

322
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,690
Your service at
the capital prefecture's office

323
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,080
was for the safety of the people.

324
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,480
How can you say

325
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,640
it was all for me?

326
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,100
Your Highness is different
from before too.

327
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,960
You're starting to lecture me

328
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,350
with your righteous talks.

329
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,110
No.

330
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,440
Don't you hate Nan Heng the most?

331
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,720
Why is it that
when it's time to fight him,

332
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,850
you became a coward?

333
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,900
No, I just think,

334
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
if you use Nan Heng's methods against him,

335
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
can such a victory

336
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,400
really be called winning?

337
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,560
When you sit on the throne in the future,

338
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,420
you'll understand that how you win
doesn't matter.

339
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,830
At the Three Bureaus' Joint Interrogation,

340
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,900
I'll take the lead against Nan Heng.

341
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,720
Your Highness may remain as you are,

342
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,370
hidden behind me,

343
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,860
a clean and pure little prince.

344
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,920
It's just that

345
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,580
you're the only witness who has met Lu Yi,

346
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,710
my only hope to overturn this case.

347
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,000
If you refuse to testify for me,

348
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,850
then from now on,

349
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,300
don't call me your cousin anymore.

350
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,680
I...

351
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,350
Gui...

352
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,680
Let's go.

353
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:55,920
Forgive me, Your Highness.

354
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,480
Forgive me, Your Highness.

355
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,270
This, this...

356
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,170
Quickly back off.

357
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:58,930
Yes.

358
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,840
My goodness.

359
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,240
Jixiang.

360
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,950
Don't you think Guihong has changed?

361
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,350
He's become

362
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,580
terrifying.

363
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,410
He wasn't like this before.

364
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,190
Since we were children,

365
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,360
he has never yelled at me so fiercely.

366
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,640
Most importantly,

367
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,440
he would never

368
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,040
punish someone without knowing
all the facts.

369
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,510
Why on earth

370
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,310
has he become like this?

371
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,960
Forget it,

372
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,430
you wouldn't understand anyway.

373
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,840
You're all the same,

374
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,840
thinking I'm just a fool
who understands nothing.

375
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,870
If even Guihong
can't figure out this case,

376
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,010
how could I possibly understand it?

377
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:52,890
Your Highness.

378
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,590
You are a prince,

379
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
not a fool.

380
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,350
Do whatever you want to do.

381
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,750
Jixiang.

382
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,990
Thank you.

383
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,920
You're right.

384
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,750
Who am I?

385
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,350
I am heaven's chosen one.

386
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,810
I know what to do now.

387
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,780
He is my cousin,

388
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,760
and I simply cannot watch him
jump into the fire pit.

389
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,780
I must pull him back from the edge.

390
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,420
This is my duty

391
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,160
as heaven's chosen one.

392
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,680
Let's go.

393
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,980
What are you doing?

394
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,920
Hurry up,

395
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,260
it's your turn.

396
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,980
Miss Song Yiting,

397
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,900
I was too keen with my agreement earlier.

398
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,590
You're the remarkable woman who can paint 73 drawings

399
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,000
in just three days.

400
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,720
I'm just a useless person.

401
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,110
Playing chess for 12 hours straight,

402
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,950
I really can't take it.

403
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,610
Since you're aware that you're useless,

404
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,540
you should stop talking nonsense.

405
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
With your natural talent,

406
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,720
at your grown age,

407
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,270
your chess skills remain so poor.

408
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,530
That simply comes down to your laziness.

409
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,020
Since you've entered the Song Residence,

410
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,020
you should be strict with yourself.

411
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,160
Hurry up.

412
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,350
Yiting,

413
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,510
there's something I want to say...

414
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,160
Speak.

415
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,350
Not everyone truly has

416
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,880
perseverance and determination like yours.

417
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,310
I don't care whether others have it,

418
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,200
but you must.

419
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,270
I'm just a useless wanderer

420
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,200
with no ambition for power or position.

421
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,640
Why am I working so hard

422
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,680
to practice chess with you?

423
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,830
What’s the point?

424
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,000
It may seem meaningless now,

425
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,000
but what about when we get married?

426
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,680
When husband and wife play chess together,

427
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,590
if they aren't evenly matched,

428
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,050
where's the fun in that?

429
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,160
Wait, why are you
still thinking about this?

430
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,680
I've always been alone,

431
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,740
marriage isn't...

432
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,680
Mr. Li,

433
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,410
don't speak so definitively.

434
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,750
Time reveals a person's true heart,

435
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,880
and feelings develop with companionship.

436
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,080
The moment you met me,

437
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,160
you've already lost.

438
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,950
Yinzhu,

439
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,330
bring my qin.

440
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,940
Yes.

441
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,200
There's even music?

442
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,040
[Wang Family Cheese]

443
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,400
It's quite fresh.

444
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,380
Yes,

445
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,110
take your time picking them.

446
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,630
Chancellor.

447
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,160
Come here.

448
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,370
Have some melon.

449
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,030
Reporting to you, Chancellor,

450
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,030
Lu Yi is dead.

451
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,480
Those two from Waning River Crescent

452
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,560
were also lured to the scene as planned.

453
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
Chu Guihong

454
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,650
has now taken the bait

455
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,830
and will surely investigate thoroughly.

456
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,920
However, Chancellor,

457
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,050
there's one thing I don't understand.

458
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,790
If you just wanted to use Chu Guihong

459
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,080
to eliminate His Highness,

460
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,950
why didn't you let me kill him

461
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,960
on the night we killed Lady Song?

462
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,560
Heng rarely spoke as a child.

463
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,560
Every year, at the turn
of spring to summer,

464
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,110
I would always find excuses

465
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,350
to bring him home from the palace

466
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,750
and serve him melons
chilled in well water.

467
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,760
Back then, he asked me a question.

468
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,510
He said,

469
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,520
"Humans have parents.
Do plants have them too?

470
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,200
If they do, how can we eat them?"

471
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,620
They say a child's character
is set by age three.

472
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,510
If Heng could feel such compassion

473
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,510
for a mere melon,

474
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,370
how could he ever rule as emperor?

475
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,790
Sit.

476
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,260
Yes.

477
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,070
That's when I understood.

478
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,000
If he were to shoulder the responsibility
of ruling Great Jing

479
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,920
beyond scholarly and military skills,

480
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,720
the more important trait to have

481
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,650
is ruthlessness.

482
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,960
At the pinnacle of power,

483
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,320
one must be solitary.

484
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,550
Without everyone betraying and abandoning
him,

485
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,240
how could he truly stand alone

486
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,840
and be the ruler of the realm?

487
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,610
Everything I've orchestrated

488
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,340
is for Heng,

489
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,680
for the High family,

490
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,150
and ultimately for the empire.

491
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,750
Even though I saved your life,

[Dream Edition Beanbag Chair]
[Dream Edition Gua Sha Tool]

our relationship

494
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,920
is just casual friends at best.

495
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,030
Hiding from Yiting at my place,

496
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,490
don't you think that's a bit
inappropriate?

497
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,840
Your sister is too draining.

498
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,440
Have you ever seen a chess match that lasts
from dawn till dusk?

499
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,390
Have you seen hands blistered
from playing qin?

500
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,160
No matter how hard Yiting pushes you,

501
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,550
it's for your own good.

502

She's motivating you.

503

Think about your Chief, Nan Heng.

Following him,

you have to live rough,

Your little sister tirelessly pursues art
day and night.

515
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,070
And your Chief orchestrate political
schemes

516
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,000
down to the second.

517
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,750
Your sister paints 80 masterpieces a day,

518
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,920
wearing her brush down to the nub.

519
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,920
Your chief reads 80 military manuals
a night,

520
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
nearly going blind from it.

521
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,550
How could my Chief compare to your sister?

522
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,920
She’s the most relentless person in
all of history.

523
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,510
How could my sister compare to your Chief?

524
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:59,170
He’s the most competitive person in
Great Jing.

525
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,900
They're pretty much the same.

526
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,750
A pair of geniuses indeed.

527
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,240
We just want an easy life,

528
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,680
to enjoy some comfort.

529
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,480
Why is that so difficult?

530
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,050
Tell me about it.

531
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,200
If I had known,

532
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,750
I would have given up martial arts for
academics

533
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,070
and become a top scholar,

534
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,550
rather than falling victim to your sister
today.

535
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,730
Then leave.

536
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,920
You keep saying you don't want this,

537
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,750
yet you're still staying at the
Song Residence.

538
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,000
Don't tell me

539
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,270
you're staying for my sister's salary.

540
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,760
Do you think that's possible?

541
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,160
Then what's the problem?

542
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,250
You follow Yiting around all day,

543
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,890
but refuse to admit you like her,

544
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,470
you're quite something.

545
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,310
My lady,

546
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,000
isn't this all for your sake?

547
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:46,790
What do you mean?

548
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,720
Look.

549
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,750
One assassination attempt has the entire
Waning River Crescent community

550
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,200
out hunting for assassins.

551
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,160
Fugui searched through so many records
that he's going bald.

552
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,400
The key is that

553
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,590
I,

554
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,790
a renowned hero of the jianghu,

555
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,750
unparalleled, charming and elegant,

556
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,550
have now been reduced

557
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,810
to a mere household guard because of you.

558
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,400
You mean,

559
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,010
Nan Heng sent you here?

560
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,510
What else?

561
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,100
Why is it that in your love story,

562
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,830
I'm always the one who suffers?

563
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,390
Look.

564
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,250
You and I,

565
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,880
we're both laid-back people,

566
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,440
with no grand ambitions.

567
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,890
Don't we just want a peaceful, comfortable
life?

568
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,170
But if, in your whole life,

569
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,440
you never meet even one or two people

570
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,170
worth risking everything for,

571
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,770
and you just merely exist,

572
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,930
can you say you’ve truly lived?

573
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,450
But what if taking risks

574
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,610
endangers your family's lives?

575
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,100
If I don't leave soon,

576
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,570
what comes next

577
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,540
is a wedding day disaster with the three
of us stabbing each other.

578
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,760
Let me ask you.

579
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,110
Can you truly

580
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,740
control what your heart wants?

581
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,550
Nonsense!

582
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,750
The records in the Ministry of War

583
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,480
were all recorded by the Director,
Vice Minister

584
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,270
and myself

585
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,480
through multiple levels of confirmation.

586
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,960
How can they be changed simply as you
wish?

587
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,030
What's recorded in those files

588
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,510
is merely Nan Heng's side of the story.

589
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,920
Now I want to correct it,

590
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,750
why can't I?

591
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,720
You mentioned a scout delivering a letter

592
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,550
to request help from the Xuanjia Army.

593
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,510
Apart from you and your confidants,

594
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,400
no one can testify to it.

595
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,880
Isn't that also one-sided?

596
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,040
As an official of Great Jing,

597
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,070
how can you use your position for personal
vendettas?

598
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,350
Does being a Great Jing official

599
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,270
mean submitting to Nan Heng's tyranny?

600
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:48,920
You!

601
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,750
Sir, you have no ties to the Chu family.

602
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,160
If you're unwilling to help clear the name
of my father

603
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,020
and the late Qianyu Army, so be it.

604
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,510
I only ask that

605
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,830
you hand over all the files to me.

606
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,030
I'll bear

607
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,970
all consequences myself.

608
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,330
Stop this madness!

609
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,750
Stop!

610
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,100
I said, stop!

611
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,880
You!

612
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,040
Stop!

613
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,160
[Good Virtues]

614
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,880
Chu Guihong,

615
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,730
my father told you to stop.

616
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,130
Didn't you hear him?

617
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,400
Yimeng!

618
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,000
Are you siding with Nan Heng again?

619
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,960
I'm not taking anyone's side.

620
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,760
I just don't want our Song family

621
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,720
be dragged into this mess between
you and Nan Heng.

622
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,240
You claim not to take sides,

623
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,570
yet time and again you stand with him

624
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,350
against me.

625
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,450
Why is that?

626
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,770
Three months ago,

627
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,490
it was you who encouraged me to
pull myself together.

628
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:04,180
It was Mr. Song who advised me to
investigate the Waning River Crescent.

629
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,440
Weren't you both supporting me then?

630
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,910
Why...

631
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,200
Why now, when I only want to

632
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,660
reveal the truth about the Pingrong
Battle,

633
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,920
to bring Nan Heng, who caused

634
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,790
the death of 20,000 men, to justice,

635
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,200
you wouldn't help me?

636
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,400
Why are you shouting?

637
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,200
Chu Guihong!

638
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,400
20,000 Qianyu soldiers died for their
country.

639
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,990
What killed them might have been fate,

640
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,110
might have been war,

641
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,830
might even have been your own helplessness
as their commander,

642
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,740
but why must it only be Nan Heng?

643
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,520
You're pushing all the blame

644
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,110
onto him alone

645
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,920
just because you want to escape
responsibility,

646
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,250
not because of the truth you claim to
seek.

647
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:44,880
Yimeng!

648
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,590
How can you say that?

649
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,180
What have I done wrong?

650
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,200
What have I done wrong?

651
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,030
Enough!

652
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,170
Yimeng,

653
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,070
stop arguing with him.

654
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,520
No one can wake someone who's
pretending to sleep.

655
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,120
Even the gods can't help him.

656
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,160
General Chu!

657
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,670
The Song family has no intention of
getting involved in this dispute.

658
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,860
The affairs of the Ministry of War

659
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,120
are certainly not for you to meddle with.

660
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,590
Please leave.

661
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,920
What does this mean?

662
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,000
It's Baili Wine.

663
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,480
I'm gifting this to you.

664
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,820
I, uh, have

665
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,120
something to ask you.

666
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,400
Sit.

667
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,550
Well,

668
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,590
about

669
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,510
Chancellor Gao's death,

670
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,790
was it you who did it?

671
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,570
See, you're always like this.

672
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,640
It's simply a "yes" or a "no."

673
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,510
Is it so hard to give me an answer?

674
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,750
Petroleum

675
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,070
and thunder bombs

676
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,210
are all common military items.

677
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,920
Trying to frame me

678
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,650
with such despicable methods.

679
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,240
Whether you and Chu Guihong

680
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,590
are investigators

681
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,880
or the ones framing me,

682
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,739
I have no patience left to waste words
with you anymore.

683
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:11,260
What about Lu Yi?

684
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,239
Did you send someone to kill Lu Yi?

685
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,320
Who is Lu Yi?

686
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,070
The scout who Guihong sent

687
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,030
to deliver the request for reinforcements
to you,

688
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,880
Lu Yi.

689
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,580
I've told you so many times,

690
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:24,280
I never received any request for
reinforcements.

691
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,190
That was just an excuse Chu Guihong
made up

692
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,590
to cover his own failure.

693
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,590
How is that possible?

694
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,880
Chancellor Gao told this to Guihong

695
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,800
with his dying breath.

696
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,070
How could that be false?

697
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,130
Wait, aren't you two on the same side?

698
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,810
What did Chancellor Gao tell Chu Guihong?

699
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,929
I never thought this day would come.

700
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:49,120
You actually visited us voluntarily.

701
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,840
It must be timely fate.

702
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,940
Remember when we first met in the palace,

703
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,680
how glorious you were, Jixiang.

704
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,920
Relying on His Majesty's favor toward
the Eighteenth Prince,

705
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,980
you always had the upper hand over me.

706
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:03,900
What a pity,

707
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,760
no flower blooms forever.

708
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,230
You went to great lengths to deal with
our Seventh Prince,

709
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,150
but in the end,

710
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,280
Waning River Crescent is still ours.

711
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,220
Regret it now?

712
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,320
I told you long ago,

713
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,110
choosing the right master is most crucial.

714
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,920
For old times' sake,

715
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,510
if you beg me now,

716
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,360
I might arrange for you

717
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,920
to serve in our ministry.

718
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,320
Are you talking to me?

719
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,050
I didn't say anything.

720
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,510
Using the conflict between Chu Guihong
and I

721
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,550
to set up such a flawless,

722
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,670
scheme.

723
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,320
What a brilliant move.

724
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,400
You mean

725
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,440
someone is plotting against you?

726
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:06,700
You came to Waning River Crescent today
just to ask these questions?

727
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
And if I answer,

728
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,630
you'd believe me?

729
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,510
I would.

730
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,950
Actually, I came here today

731
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,950
because I also need a favor from you.

732
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:20,840
Speak.

733
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,150
Um...

734
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,360
Well...

735
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,510
Could you

736
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,840
take the blame

737
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,000
for the Pingrong Battle?

738
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,670
I...

739
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,960
No, no, don't be quick to scold me.

740
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,840
I know this request is very disrespectful.

741
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,320
But Guihong is now obsessed

742
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,840
with bringing you down.

743
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,480
He's being led by the nose and manipulated

744
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,440
by the person behind the scenes,

745
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,710
I'm afraid if this continues,

746
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,880
something terrible will happen.

747
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,000
Whether he's obsessed or not,

748
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,500
what does it have to do with me?

749
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,300
How can you say it's not related?

750
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,360
Heng, listen.

751
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,110
If you just admit to this crime,

752
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,150
so Guihong can let go of this matter,

753
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,870
I will now...

754
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,640
I will immediately...

755
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,080
I will instantly give up the throne
to you.

756
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,940
What do you say?

757
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,700
You really do care deeply for him.

758
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,600
Of course.

759
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,760
He's my only brother,

760
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,280
I have to protect him.

761
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,840
[Clear Waters, Graceful Woods]

762
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,070
Heng, Heng, listen.

763
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,590
I can make a written promise before
Father,

764
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,390
and I'll never go back on my word.

765
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,880
No, no, no.

766
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,190
Heng, listen to me, listen.

767
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,020
Here's the thing.

768
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,360
Once you're on the throne,

769
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,840
you'll have control over everything.

770
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,760
Even if you did harm someone in the
Pingrong Battle,

771
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,440
there won't be any consequences.

772
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,510
Do you even understand what you're saying?

773
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,710
I do, I do.

774
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,890
Look, Heng,

775
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,200
for the sake ur sharing the same father,

776
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,860
just this once.

777
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,710
Please?

778
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,110
I'm begging you, isn't that enough?

779
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,970
Didn't you say he's your only brother?

780
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,890
Nan Rui,

781
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,840
do you even understand the difference in

782
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,070
degrees of closeness between insiders
and outsiders?

783
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:04,880
I...

784
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,660
I know I'm foolish,

785
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,710
but at this point,

786
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,550
even a fool should understand.

787
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,720
The throne is secondary,

788
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,240
brotherhood is primary.

789
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,650
I know I can't compete with you.

790
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,210
But losing the throne doesn't matter.

791
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,110
If I lose Guihong,

792
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,320
then I truly have nothing left.

793
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,950
The luckiest thing happened to Chu Guihong

794
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,600
is having such a foolish brother like you.

795
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,590
I...

796
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,990
The matter of succession

797
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,210
isn't something you and I can decide.

798
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,120
Furthermore,

799
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,510
I will never admit

800
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,510
to something I didn't do.

801
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,150
-I...
-Fugui.

802
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,960
Escort the Eighteenth Prince.

803
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,760
Yes.

804
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,610
Eighteenth Prince,

805
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,690
this way please.

806
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Father,

807
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,770
Is the Three Bureaus' Joint Interrogation

808
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,030
really such a big deal?

809
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,070
The Seventh Prince holds royal status.

810
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,320
The Pingrong Battle

811
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:31,720
is a major case involving the deaths of
20,000 soldiers.

812
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,150
The trial must be jointly handled by the
Ministry of Justice,

813
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,880
the Court of Judicial Review, and
the Censorate,

814
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,880
to be official.

815
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,170
Isn't the Minister of Justice Yan Yi

816
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,320
one of Nan Heng's people?

817
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,040
Not only that,

818
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,190
both the Censorate and the Court of
Judicial Review

819
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,120
are dominated by civil officials,

820
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,280
and Chancellor Gao has long controlled

821
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,410
the civil official factions at court.

822
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,850
I remember now,

823
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,120
that Yao Qian from the Censorate

824
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,970
is also Nan Heng's people.

825
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,640
Now that Chancellor Gao is dead,

826
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,180
all these forces

827
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,560
have fallen into the Seventh Prince's hands.

828
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,560
That's why

829
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,840
Chu Guihong chose to delve into the
war records.

830
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:24,230
In that case,

831
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,710
Father,

832
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,710
if these three departments investigate
Nan Heng,

833
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,890
he...

834
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,440
Should be fine, right?

835
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,640
You're still thinking too simply.

836
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,350
All government offices face south,

837
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,110
and in their halls

838
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,800
hang signs of the sun and moon,

839
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,460
symbolizing justice for all.

840
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,180
But for justice to shine forth,

841
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,880
it depends on whether the sun and moon
above

842
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,360
provide any light at all.

843
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,330
What the Seventh Prince faces now

844
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:58,110
is precisely dark clouds blocking the sun

845
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,800
and the moon sinking below the horizon.
