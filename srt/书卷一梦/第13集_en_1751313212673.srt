1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Jail

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The world is a battlefield

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The enemy is the root of the enemy

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The moon is the root of the enemy

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's better to be a man than to be a man

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I am a beast

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I am a beast

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
A heart that can't be burned

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
A heart that can't be burned

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No need to wait, no need to hate

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Write your own script

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I will follow all the stars and clouds

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I will write my own script

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The wind that blows in the western wind

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I will run away from the dark

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I will not regret my youth

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I will still be a big star

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For this life, and for all life

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I will sacrifice my life

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The Legend of Chusen

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Episode 16

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's so late at night

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You don't go back to your own house

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why are you here in this noble manor?

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Your Highness has something on your mind

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I want to talk to you

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Your Highness has something on your mind?

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why don't you tell me?

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
No, I have to ask you first

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He is now trapped by love

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He is troubled

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't be too hard on him

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Trapped by love

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's that girl again

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Fugui

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The 7th Prince's urgent

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Should it be your urgent?

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Then you are the first person around the prince

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Should I share some worries for the prince?

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Fugui

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Don't worry

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Your Highness's situation

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I will be rich

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Have you remembered everything I told you?

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't worry, sir

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We are old partners with Mr. Shangguan

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This first hand information you gave

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And the best assistant I have ever experienced

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
How to hold back this love in the capital

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's just a hand in hand, sir

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Remember

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This matter has nothing to do with Shangguan Fei

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If the prince asks

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Do you know how to answer?

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
understand

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Everything is the credit of Fugui

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Sir

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Thank you sir

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Your Highness, please be careful

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
His Majesty doesn't like the secret sword

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Too sweet

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Come on, take the secret sword away

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
7th Prince

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Mother

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Heng

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The doctor told me

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Your leg is weak and can't walk

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Your Highness

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Your Highness

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The queen also fell today

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Your Highness has no idea

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
His Majesty has never come to Fanghua Palace since three years ago

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The queen also has no way to get rid of this

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
All right

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
All these years

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Although he only has Sister Chu in his heart

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But for the sake of the high price

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
After all, it gave me the title of the noble consort

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
As long as I can enter the imperial forest in the future

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's enough to bury it by his side

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Mother

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You said you were going to be a princess

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm not a princess

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Mother

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What are you talking about?

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
All right, all right, I won't say it

93
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Heng

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The recent affairs in the court are very troublesome

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It seems that it has been cut off

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I just came back to the capital

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And the emperor gave him a lot of official affairs

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It doesn't matter

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The emperor is willing to use you

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This time I came back to the capital

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The emperor has taken care of me

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's good

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Since the emperor is willing to change his mind and give you grace

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Then Heng will have to do his job well

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
In this way, he will be pleased

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I understand

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
After all, the family is not as good as the border

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
In addition to the emperor's orders

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I have to listen to your uncle

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The Gao family has been in decline since the last generation

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If your uncle didn't cherish the beauty

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I don't know what kind of mistake I would have been in

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Your family is shameless

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I have to give your mother to the emperor

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I also want to steal my aunt's style

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The Gao family doesn't have a good thing

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What do you say

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Your mother is very good

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
She didn't do me wrong

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The emperor doesn't go to see you

122
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He is fighting with the high-ranking

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I know

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Heng

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The emperor is good to you

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So many years

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Should you change your mouth and call him father?

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Shut up

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Don't let me hear you call me father

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm sorry

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm sorry

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm sorry

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I have a plan for this

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You don't have to worry

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But you must take care of yourself

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If you think too much

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
When the emperor comes, it will be inappropriate

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
it is good

139
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
By the way, mother

140
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Do you still have those toys I used to play?

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Your Highness, please

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Since the prince left the palace and went to the battlefield

143
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The queen ordered people to put everything here

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No one has ever touched it

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What do you want to find

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I can help

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I can find it myself

148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You can go first

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Go

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Horse

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Green onion and green eyes

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Horse

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Star-shaped netting cake

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Waiting for the dragon day

156
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The moon is not on the wine

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Write it down

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Horse

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'll give you the Qianyu ice skill

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Do you want it?

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll give you the Qianyu ice skill

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Do you want it?

163
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll give you the Qianyu ice skill

164
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Do you want it?

165
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll give you the Qianyu ice skill

166
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Do you want it?

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll give you the Qianyu ice skill

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Do you want it?

169
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll give you the Qianyu ice skill

170
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Do you want it?

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll give you the Qianyu ice skill

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Do you want it?

173
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll give you the Qianyu ice skill

174
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Do you want it?

175
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'll give you the Qianyu ice skill

176
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Do you want it?

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'll give you the Qianyu ice skill

178
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Do you want it?

179
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll give you the Qianyu ice skill

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Do you want it?

181
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What is this?

182
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Maiden's Meditation

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Are you kidding?

184
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This is the weapon that Chu Guihong gave me when I was young

185
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Later I was sent to the palace

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Prince Qian Yu asked me to search

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's what I was looking for

188
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But even if this is a knife-cutting technique, look at the embroidery on it.

189
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's strange, we can't understand it.

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
How to decipher?

191
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But we do know a strange person.

192
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Who? You?

193
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What me? Song Yi Meng.

194
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Song Yi Meng.

195
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Haha.

196
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Song Yi Meng often says some strange things.

197
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And he said he was going to help me find a knife-cutting technique.

198
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Maybe he can really decipher it.

199
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That makes sense.

200
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Why didn't I think of it?

201
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's you, boss. You thought of him at once.

202
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You can still get along with him when you're deciphering the embroidery.

203
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm talking about something important.

204
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I called him here for the sake of the public.

205
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Okay, I won't call him.

206
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You break the sword for me.

207
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I can't.

208
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Only Miss Song can do it.

209
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
He's not enough.

210
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Come on.

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Song Yi Meng needs someone to watch her when she's working on the knife-cutting technique.

212
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
If the embroidery is really a knife-cutting technique,

213
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
it can record her process of making it.

214
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So as not to leave any details.

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I didn't expect the height to be so suitable.

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
There's no other way. You can only take on the task of the sharpening.

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Me?

218
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I... I'm actually her?

219
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm not suitable to answer the question of the woman you like?

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I definitely can't. I'm Li Shiliu now. I can only be a good person.

221
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So I have to leave this kind of dirty work to you.

222
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I...

223
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I...

224
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Don't be so nervous.

225
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What's the matter?

226
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
We'll talk about it when you wake up.

227
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's only noon. Stop sleeping.

228
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
This cousin has already repaired the south of the city.

229
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
When will you remove my ban?

230
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Don't worry.

231
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
After the storm, I'll help you.

232
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Okay. Let's talk about my business.

233
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What about Qi's business?

234
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He went to Song's house a few days ago.

235
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
He secretly colluded with the court officials

236
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
to steal my position as the crown prince.

237
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Rui'er, let me ask you.

238
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He colluded with the court officials

239
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
to steal your position. Do you have any evidence?

240
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I...

241
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
No, father.

242
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Qi is so cunning.

243
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
How can I have any evidence?

244
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Besides, father, you don't believe me?

245
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I believe you. Do you believe all the court officials?

246
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Rui'er, you're not young anymore.

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The court officials only do little misdeeds.

248
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'll help you.

249
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What if I die one day?

250
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
How can you sit in this position?

251
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
How can you command the court officials and control the world?

252
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Then I can...

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I can help...

254
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm so annoyed.

255
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Your Highness.

256
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Let him go.

257
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I...

258
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Since his mother died,

259
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I've been favoring him in every way.

260
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I didn't expect that I could raise him

261
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
with such a bad temper.

262
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
He's been in my mind all night.

263
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Tell me.

264
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Am I wrong?

265
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Your Majesty.

266
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Your Majesty, the Seventh Prince wants to see you.

267
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Let him in.

268
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Your Majesty.

269
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Your Majesty.

270
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm here to visit the palace.

271
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
All the documents here

272
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
are written by your people.

273
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's for Chu Guihong.

274
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Why?

275
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I dare not to collude with the ministers.

276
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Chu Guihong should be rewarded

277
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
for his contribution.

278
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The ministers are all honored.

279
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You don't have to come here.

280
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You're a man of no power.

281
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What do you want this time?

282
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Your Majesty.

283
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I went to Fanghua Hall yesterday.

284
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
My mother was bedridden for days.

285
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
She couldn't eat or drink.

286
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I miss you.

287
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Please come to see my mother tomorrow.

288
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Your Majesty.

289
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Please go back to your room.

290
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's okay.

292
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'll go.

293
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Your Majesty.

295
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Please go.

296
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Your Majesty.

297
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Your Majesty.

301
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
18th brother can also join Qingtan's monthly banquet with me.

302
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Are you talking about the conditions with me?

303
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You came to the palace to help Chu Guihong,

304
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and helped Rui'er to get rid of the Jin clan.

305
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Is it just to let me visit your mother?

306
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The emperor has a great merit, and the Qin and Si are harmonious.

307
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It was the emperor's teaching.

308
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I remember it in my heart, and I will never forget it.

309
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Shiyi,

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I beg you to go visit your mother.

311
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You know that the emperor has a great merit, and the Qin and Si are harmonious.

312
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But you don't know the principle of this thing being reversed.

313
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You are talking to me about the conditions.

314
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Is this the attitude you should have towards me?

315
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Your Majesty is the emperor, I dare not to be rude.

316
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Since you dare not to be rude,

317
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
then you can kneel here and recite the filial piety ten times.

318
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I will go to Fanghua Hall to visit your mother.

319
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

320
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You and I are fated to be entangled in the world.

321
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The wind blows in the ear,

322
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
the black night's map.

323
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The eyes are closed, the hands are lost.

324
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
When will we return?

325
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The wind blows in the ear,

326
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
the black night's map.

327
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The words are lost,

328
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
how can love and hate be hidden?

329
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You are the one who brought the assassin here, right?

330
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Your Majesty, it's not me.

331
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
This is not the way to escape the palace.

332
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Why are you guys going through here?

333
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Say it!

334
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Mother brought me here to die,

335
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
to capture the map.

336
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Fanghua!

337
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Father!

338
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Shut up!

339
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Don't let me hear you call me father!

340
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The thing I regret the most in my life

341
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
is that I gave birth to you, you bastard!

342
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Your Majesty, the matter has come to this.

343
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
He is the blood of the royal family.

344
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And he is still young, he can't be the mastermind.

345
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The flower has withered,

346
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
the color has faded.

347
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
How can love and hate be hidden?

348
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The years have passed,

349
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
but the fate has not changed.

350
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The life is not destined to be a lie.

351
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
How can I thank you for the ending?

352
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The love and hate have faded.

353
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The life is not destined to be a lie.

354
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
How can I thank you for the ending?

355
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The End

356
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
This is...

357
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The Sword-cutting Room.

358
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
After the last time the assassination failed,

359
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
the Chief has been thinking about

360
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
how to get Miss Song out of the control of the Seventh Prince.

361
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
He wants you to come

362
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
and develop the Sword-cutting Room.

363
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Even a hero wants to find the Sword-cutting Room?

364
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The fastest sword in the world

365
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
means the strongest military power.

366
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
The Chief is doing it for your own good.

367
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
That's strange.

368
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I remember in the script that

369
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
the Sword-cutting Room is the secret of the royal family.

370
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
How did the Demon of Night know about this?

371
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Miss, you can not believe me,

372
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
but you can not believe the Chief?

373
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The last time the Sword-cutting Room was in the Southern City,

374
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
it was always in the mess.

375
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That's right.

376
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
If Hero Li is a bad person,

377
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
there will be no good people in the script.

378
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
If he gets the Sword-cutting Room,

379
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
he will be better than Nan Heng.

380
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
This is the clue we finally found.

381
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Miss, you can try it.

382
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
When the Chief returns,

383
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
if there is good news,

384
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
he will be very happy.

385
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Wait.

386
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Three-eyed Iron?

387
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Why is it the chemistry room?

388
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You really know?

389
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Shangguan.

390
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Shangguan.

391
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Hello.

392
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm a little stupid.

393
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
An ancient drama.

394
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Where did the chemistry formula come from?

395
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Is this really a clue left by the scriptwriter?

396
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
If it wasn't because my chemistry formula was not fair,

397
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
how could I choose literature?

398
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
If I didn't choose literature,

399
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
how could I be an actor?

400
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
If I didn't become an actor,

401
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
how could I come here?

402
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
In the end, I have to do chemistry here.

403
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
What kind of fate do I have?

404
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
What's this?

405
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
What's this?

406
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
This is good.

407
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
This is good.

408
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Let's do more.

409
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
This is good.

410
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
This should be fine.

411
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It should be fine.

412
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
This should be fine.

413
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Oh, no.

414
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
This can't explode.

415
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,080
My fazlaque.

416
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Miss Siu! Miss Siu, are you okay?

417
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Miss Siu!

418
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Anyway, congratulations.

419
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Go!

420
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,400
You are...

421
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
What's wrong with you?

422
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I told you.

423
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm not good at chemistry.

424
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Why do you force me to do this?

425
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
What's going on?

426
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Why is it exploding?

427
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,000
Boss, here's the thing.

428
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
We asked someone to calculate it.

429
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
They said Miss Song has a fire in her life.

430
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
So she burns it wherever she goes.

431
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It's true.

432
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
But boss, don't worry.

433
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
We are doing the grassland business.

434
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Your life is heavy.

435
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
She can hold it.

436
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Okay, shut up.

437
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
What's going on?

438
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Miss Song, a master can destroy a city.

439
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Go, go, go.

440
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Go.

441
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Okay, I'm leaving.

442
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Come out.

443
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Why is Song Yi Meng so serious?

444
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Boss, for the sake of my life,

445
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
let Song Yi Meng go.

446
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Let me go too.

447
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I'm always the one who's hurt.

448
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Last time, my sister was killed by me.

449
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
This time, she almost scared me.

450
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm not a useless person.

451
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm a unlucky person.

452
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Song Yi Meng.

453
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I'm here.

454
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Mr. Li.

455
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It's really you.

456
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
What's wrong?

457
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You're not afraid of the fire and you're afraid of the medicine?

458
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I'll say it again.

459
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm not afraid of the fire.

460
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I just added some small ingredients.

461
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Okay, come on.

462
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Turn around and I'll give you the medicine.

463
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Mr. Li, just put the medicine there.

464
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I'll do it myself.

465
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You go out first.

466
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm not Nan Heng.

467
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
What are you afraid of?

468
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You're Nan Heng, so I'm not afraid.

469
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Come on, turn around and listen to me.

470
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
No, no, no.

471
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Boss.

472
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
It's okay.

473
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Boss, it's really not convenient for me to see people today.

474
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It's okay.

475
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
You go out first.

476
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
You go out first.

477
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I've said it, boss.

478
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It's not convenient for me to see people today.

479
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm sorry.

480
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm sorry.

481
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'm sorry.

483
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm sorry.

484
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm sorry.

485
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm sorry.

486
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm sorry.

487
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm sorry.

488
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I'm sorry.

489
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm sorry.

490
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'm sorry.

491
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm sorry.

492
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I'm sorry.

493
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm sorry.

494
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm sorry.

495
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm sorry.

496
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I'm sorry.

497
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm sorry.

498
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm sorry.

499
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm sorry.

500
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I'm sorry.

501
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm sorry.

502
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm sorry.

503
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I'm sorry.

504
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'm sorry.

505
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm sorry.

506
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm sorry.

507
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm sorry.

509
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm sorry.

510
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm sorry.

511
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm sorry.

512
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'm sorry.

513
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm sorry.

514
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm sorry.

515
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I'm sorry.

516
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm sorry.

517
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm sorry.

518
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm sorry.

519
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm sorry.

520
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I'm sorry.

521
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I'm sorry.

522
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm sorry.

523
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I'm sorry.

524
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm sorry.

525
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm sorry.

526
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I'm sorry.

527
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm sorry.

528
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I'm sorry.

529
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I'm sorry.

530
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I'm sorry.

531
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I'm sorry.

532
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I'm sorry.

533
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm sorry.

534
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm sorry.

535
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm sorry.

536
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I'm sorry.

537
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm sorry.

538

539
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I'm sorry.

540
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm sorry.

541
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm sorry.

542
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm sorry.

543
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000

I'm sorry.

545
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I'm sorry.

546
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm sorry.

547
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm sorry.

548
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I'm sorry.

549
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm sorry.

550
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm sorry.

551
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm sorry.

552
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm sorry.

553
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm sorry.

554
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'm sorry.

555
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I'm sorry.

556
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm sorry.

557
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm sorry.

558
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I'm sorry.

559
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm sorry.

560
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm sorry.

561
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm sorry.

562
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm sorry.

563
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm sorry.

564
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm sorry.

565
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I'm sorry.

566
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I'm sorry.

567
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm sorry.

568
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm sorry.

569
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I'm sorry.

570
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I'm sorry.

571
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm sorry.

572
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm sorry.

573
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm sorry.

574
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I'm sorry.

575
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm sorry.

576
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'm sorry.

577
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I'm sorry.

578
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I'm sorry.

579
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I'm sorry.

580
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I'm sorry.

581
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I'm sorry.

582
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I'm sorry.

583
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm sorry.

584
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I'm sorry.

585
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm sorry.

586
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I'm sorry.

587
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I'm sorry.

588
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm sorry.

589
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I'm sorry.

590
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I'm sorry.

591
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I'm sorry.

592
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm sorry.

593
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm sorry.

594
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm sorry.

595
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm sorry.

596
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm sorry.

597
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm sorry.

598
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
In the world and in heaven,

599
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
among the stars our love is forever.

600
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,600
The Fast U unknown

601
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,200
Well

602
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,980
You are blushing

603
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
How can it be

604
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,600
I amпazd

605
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,660
Never blush

606
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,660
You see for yourself.

607
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,660
Gao Yuan Hong.

608
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,660
This time it's my fault. Next time I'll be with you.

609
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,660
Next time?

610
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,660
The main thing is that if we don't get the cutting-edge technique,

611
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,660
we can't fight against Nan Heng.

612
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,660
That's true.

613
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:51,660
Do you think there are really two people who hate each other in this world?

614
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,660
The cutting-edge technique is the foundation that His Majesty left to 18th Prince to protect himself.

615
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,660
Nan Heng always wanted to get it. Why?

616
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,660
Because he wanted to rebel.

617
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,660
Rebellion means a lot of people will die.

618
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,660
So even if I get this cutting-edge technique, I won't give it to him.

619
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,660
Why are you so sure that he's trying to rebel?

620
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,660
Because it's written in the script.

621
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,660
It's the script.

622
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,660
If he wants to rebel, what are you going to do?

623
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,660
I don't know. I haven't thought about it.

624
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:39,660
It's already hard to stop him now.

625
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,660
But I want to find another way.

626
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,660
A way to let Nan Heng let go of his hatred.

627
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,660
Have you ever thought about it?

628
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:58,660
If I tell others what you told me, what should you do?

629
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:02,660
Impossible. You are a hero.

630
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:10,660
You are the most new person I have in this world.

631
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:26,660
Miss Song, people are different.

632
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,660
You believe in others so easily.

633
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,660
You are the only one who is hurt.

634
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,660
I'm not a good person.

635
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:37,660
I'm not a good person.

636
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,660
Hero Li, I'm not a person who believes in others.

637
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,660
But you are different.

638
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,660
I'm not different from others.

639
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,660
I'll ask Shangguan He to send you back.

640
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,660
I have to go.

641
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,660
Hero Li.

642
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,660
It's strange.

643
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,660
What's wrong?

644
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,660
I don't know.

645
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,660
Boss, she's back.

646
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,660
Look at you. You are the one who provokes others.

647
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:56,660
You are the one who refuses others. What are you thinking about?

648
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,660
Look at this.

649
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,660
Isn't this the ghost painting on the way of the broken road?

650
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,660
She filled it out.

651
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,660
I didn't expect it either.

652
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:12,660
But this character is different from the one in the thousand-word weapon.

653
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,660
It's not necessarily the way of the broken road.

654
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,660
How about this?

655
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,660
You go and find the missing person right now.

656
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,660
See if anyone knows this kind of text.

657
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,660
I know.

658
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,660
Wait.

659
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,660
I plan to hold the Qingtan Moon Banquet at the Cangjiang Moon.

660
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,660
Why?

661
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,660
These days, we have the God of Wealth.

662
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,660
I've been collecting information everywhere.

663
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,660
Searching for clues about the broken road.

664
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,660
The capital is very expensive.

665
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,660
I intended to transfer the capital of the Wang family.

666
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,660
But unfortunately, every flow of the Wang family

667
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,660
has to be monitored by the internal affairs department.

668
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:54,660
Every move has to have a starting point and a proof.

669
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,660
So you want to use the opportunity to hold the Qingtan Moon Banquet

670
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,660
to transfer the capital to this place?

671
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,660
That's right.

672
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,660
That's a big banquet. How many people are there?

673
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,660
It takes a lot of time to prepare.

674
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,660
And you know those young men and women are not easy to deal with.

675
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,660
It's a headache.

676
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,660
You should move to another place.

677
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,660
That's okay.

678
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,660
I'll go to your house to work.

679
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,660
I'm in the Cangjiang Moon Banquet.

680
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,660
Are you okay?

681
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,660
Good two month circular.

682
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,660
Beautiful.

683
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,660
It's just beautiful.

684
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,660
Who do you like the most?

685
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,660
I like the SimaTu thousandнесomal.

686
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,660
What are you saying?

687
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,660
You'll ruin my yard.

688
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:53,900
Yes.

689
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,420
I can't. I can't.

690
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,900
I've asked around.

691
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,140
The 18th prince will also come to the moon banquet.

692
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,500
You're not good at poetry and singing.

693
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,180
Isn't this a good chance

694
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,940
for the heaven to show you in front of the prince?

695
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,820
What do you think I am?

696
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,980
Playing the zither, playing the zither, selling talents,

697
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,820
and making the workers play with the zither.

698
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,220
What's the point of all this?

699
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,020
This... This is of course meaningful.

700
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,020
Think about it.

701
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,820
If it weren't for these,

702
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,420
how could you have come out of

703
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,420
so many big families

704
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,420
in disguise as a woman?

705
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,260
You're a noble man.

706
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,620
Then, am I living in this world

707
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,620
just for a marriage?

708
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,620
Isn't that for the sake of the family?

709
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,460
Do you still have to go to the imperial examination

710
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,380
and be an official?

711
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,940
Why not?

712
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,060
Even so,

713
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,820
you have to be the empress.

714
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,180
Let the emperor change your mind.

715
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,720
Please.

716
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,140
Please.

717
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,420
Calm down.

718
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,280
It hurts.

719
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,420
Long pian Shapes might be better than short ones, Miss.

720
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,100
They haven't given me any ointment yet.

721
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,380
Why are they leaving so suddenly?

722
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,380
You mean Li Shiliu?

723
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:31,380
But the most important thing now is not the attitude of Li Daxia.

724
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,380
But you are going to get married.

725
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:38,380
We thought we were General Chu Guihong.

726
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,380
Who knows Li Shiliu and the Seventh Prince came later.

727
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,380
How can the word Seventh Prince appear here?

728
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,380
It's here.

729
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,380
The love of the capital is written like that.

730
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,380
Don't play with us.

731
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,380
What love?

732
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,380
Love of the capital.

733
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,380
Love of the capital?

734
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,380
The servants in the mansion have secretly passed by these two days.

735
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,380
They said that the girl and the Seventh Prince were born in the same family.

736
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,380
They are a couple.

737
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,380
They quarreled with the CP.

738
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,380
They made a fool of themselves.

739
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,380
They are so hard to get.

740
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,380
I'm used to it.

741
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,380
I won't blame them.

742
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,380
She is not a person who has done this kind of bad operation once or twice.

743
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,380
Why are you so sure it's the Seventh Prince?

744
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,380
You still don't know the rebels.

745
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,380
What kind of person is Nan Heng?

746
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,380
He is a dead man.

747
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,380
I'll leave it here today.

748
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,380
If it wasn't for him, I would have taken my head off.

749
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,380
I said that this rumor is definitely unreliable.

750
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,380
The girl still has Li Shiliu in her heart.

751
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,380
Don't talk nonsense.

752
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,380
There is no one.

753
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:48,380
Moreover, her attitude towards me is always abnormal.

754
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,380
I really can't understand her.

755
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,380
Then why can't you ask her directly?

756
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,380
If I ask her directly,

757
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,380
will it seem a little...

758
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,380
What's there to ask?

759
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,380
Didn't I already tell you?

760
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,380
It's a cooperation relationship.

761
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,380
That's right.

762
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,380
How can a girl like Hero Li?

763
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,380
I haven't even seen her face.

764
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,380
Maybe it's because she's full of scars.

765
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,380
She's out there, and she's not even a little girl.

766
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,380
And if you think about it,

767
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,380
it's very possible that her character is not good.

768
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,380
She kills people, kills them, and rob them.

769
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,380
Maybe she...

770
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,380
Stop.

771
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,380
What nonsense are you talking about?

772
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,380
She is a good and righteous person.

773
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,380
High and rich.

774
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,380
And she has property.

775
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,380
Although the work is not stable,

776
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,380
but no matter what,

777
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,380
it's still a small enterprise.

778
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,380
You still say you don't like it.

779
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,380
I can't hear any of these shortcomings.

780
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,380
Girl, you're 25 years old when you start spring.

781
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,380
When are you going to show your feelings to Hero Li?

782
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,380
The Kunfu must choose the latest style.

783
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,380
Should we choose the south or the north?

784
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,380
And this Qin Xie, he must...

785
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,380
Stop.

786
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,380
Can you two not talk about emotional problems to me when you go out?

787
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,380
Do you know that in the TVB,

788
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,380
there's a saying that a man is married.

789
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,380
It's a curse.

790
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,380
You talk about it all day and night.

791
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,380
Look for me, look for me, look for me.

792
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,380
Is it over?

793
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,380
It's so annoying.

794
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,380
Girl, the master asked you to go there.

795
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,380
What's up?

796
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,380
Talk about marriage.

797
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,380
This is not a story.

798
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:43,380
It's like the ancient ancient people's golden door.

799
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,380
What does it mean?

800
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,380
Dad.

801
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,380
Why do you have this?

802
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,380
What's wrong with your face?

803
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,380
It's not important.

804
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,380
A little scratch.

805
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,380
Where did you get this note?

806
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,380
You know this?

807
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,380
Secretly spread in the room.

808
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:21,380
Said this is a formula for cutting the knife.

809
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,380
I'm sorry.

810
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,380
I'm sorry.

811
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,380
I'm sorry.

812
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,380
I'm sorry.

813
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,380
I'm sorry.

814
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,380
I'm sorry.

815
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,380
I'm sorry.

816
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,380
I'm sorry.

817
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,380
I'm sorry.

818
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,380
I'm sorry.

819
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,380
I'm sorry.

820
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,380
I'm sorry.

821
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,380
I'm sorry.

822
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,380
I'm sorry.

823
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,380
I'm sorry.

824
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,380
I'm sorry.

825
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,380
I'm sorry.

826
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,380
I'm sorry.

827
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,380
I'm sorry.

828
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,380
I'm sorry.

829
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,380
I'm sorry.

830
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,380
I'm sorry.

831
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,380
I'm sorry.

832
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,380
I'm sorry.

833
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,380
I'm sorry.

834
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,380
I'm sorry.

835
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,380
I'm sorry.

836
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,380
I'm sorry.

837
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,380
I'm sorry.

838
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,380
I'm sorry.

839
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,380
I'm sorry.

840
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,380
I'm sorry.

841
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,380
I'm sorry.

842
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,380
I'm sorry.

843
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,380
I'm sorry.

844
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,380
I'm sorry.

845
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,380
I'm sorry.

846
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,380
I'm sorry.

847
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,380
I'm sorry.

848
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:55,380
I'm sorry.

849
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,380
I'm sorry.

850
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:59,380
I'm sorry.

851
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,380
I'm sorry.

852
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,380
I'm sorry.

853
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,380
I'm sorry.

854

I'm sorry.

856
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,380
I'm sorry.

857
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,380
I'm sorry.

858

863
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,380
I'm sorry.

864
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,380
I'm sorry.

865
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,380
I'm sorry.

866
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:31,380
I'm sorry.

867
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,380
I'm sorry.

868
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,380
I'm sorry.

869
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,380

870
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,380

I'm sorry.

874
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,380
I'm sorry.

875
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,380
