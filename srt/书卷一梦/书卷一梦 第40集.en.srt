why are you still here?

How dare I?

396
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,130

397
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,930
You're right.

398
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,550
In this world,

399
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,680
no matter if you're the lead,

400
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,240
a supporting character,

401
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,270

everyone is a living person.

403
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,200
I was too shallow before,

404

to dictate everyone's destiny.

406
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,750
It's good that you realize that.

407
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,310
By the way,

408
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,110
let me ask you.

409
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,510
Does the script rule still exist?

410
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,270
Why does Nan Heng

411
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,600
seem to have recovered?

412
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,720
Actually,

413
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,920
many things have changed long ago.

414
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,710
Think about it carefully.

415
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,640
It's been a while since you last heard
the sound of typing, right?

416
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,550
When Nan Heng disrupted the original
rule mechanism with a new one,

417
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,550
the old rules like "the male lead must
save the heroine in danger"

418
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:42,080
and "iconic scenes must play out
as scripted"

419
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,640
had already ceased to work.

420
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,200
Besides,

421
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,810
now that all the fictional characters
have awakened,

422
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,880
the rule that "anyone who
alters iconic scenes

423
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,310
will suffer backlash"

424
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,240
has also lost its effect.

425
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,160
In other words,

426
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,980
now,

427

I'm free from it too.

429
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,050
Just now, when I saw the people

430
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,480
risking their lives
to protect their homeland,

431
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,400
I suddenly felt...

432
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,880
Felt like I had an out-of-body experience.

433
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,370
Yeah, right.

00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,240
You just recovered after resting
for three months.

506
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,900
Can you really work like this?

507
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,690
I've recovered for a long time.

508
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,880
Come on, Jixiang.

509
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,250
Jixiang.

510
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,260
Tell me, why is there such an excellent

511
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,270
chosen one as me

512
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,790
in our Great Jing Dynasty?

513
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,270
In terms of being a prince,

514
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,220
I'm as good as Heng.

515
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,110
And when it comes to growing rice,

516
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,880
I accidentally became

517
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,120
the best in the world.

518
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,310
You didn't see it.

519
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,480
When the Deputy Director of
the Ministry of Revenue

520
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
saw me yesterday,

521
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,270
he showed 30% respect

522
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,920
and 70% admiration.

523
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,880
So,

524
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,720
when it comes to ensuring
the people's prosperity,

525
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,480
Heng

526
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,740
still has to rely on me.

527
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,890
It's you?

528
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,550
Your Highness! Your Highness!

529
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,640
Are you alright, Your Highness?

530
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,370
Your Highness. Your Highness.

531
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,110
And so, the story of Yingqiu and Nan Rui

532
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,340
began in such a magical way.

533
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,640
Yingqiu longs for simple and pure love.

534
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:09,940
So does Nan Rui.

535
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,390
But as for Zhixia,

536
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,660
she believes that love

537
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,030
is like a cotton jacket in summer

538
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,960
or a fan in winter.

539
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,240
It can't solve urgent problems,

540
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,720
nor does it bring any extra value.

541
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,890
If anything is truly meaningful,

542
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,820
it has to be

543
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,800
making money.

544
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,480
47.

545
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,440
78.

546
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,270
356.

547
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,520
621.

548
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,350
701.

549
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,670
Have you memorized them all?

550
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,550
Not yet.

551
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,630
Chief Master.

552
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,030
Look,

553
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,200
you've been checking the ledger all day.

554
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,790
You should give your hands a break.

555
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,400
Why not

556
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,610
have some tea first?

557
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,880
Do you think this is something
I want to do as Chief Master?

558
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,170
If even one of you men

559
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,390
were any good,

560
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,290
would I really have to

561
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,190
do this work myself?

562
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,270
You actually had the nerve

563
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,090
to show me a spreadsheet like this?

564
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,550
Take it back and revise it.

565
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,110
In one official document,

566
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,370
there are eight typos.

567
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,560
Did your P.E. teacher teach you Chinese?

568
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,760
What's your problem?

569
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,140
[On May 18, a zither gathering will be
held at the Waning River Crescent's Hall.]

570
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,140
[We respectfully hope Your Honor
will kindly spare time to attend.]

571
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,510
Yunlong.

572
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,830
An invitation without the name of
the person you want to invite?

573
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,790
Are you inviting ghosts or what?

574
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,840
We can't even invite any guest over.

575
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,820
How exactly should we grow and
strengthen our business?

576
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,820
Look at you all.

577
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,880
It was Second Master who wrote this.

578
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,920
Actually, this form

579
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,750
was also assigned to me by Second Master.

580
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,870
As well as this official document.

581
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,860
Second Master also said that

582
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,240
all the opportunities should
be left to the young people.

583
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,240
-Yes.
-Right.

584
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,440
That's right, Chief Master.

585
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,920
They're telling the truth.

586
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,750
Where is Shangguan He?

587
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,350
Where is he?

588
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,110
Where?

589
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,110
Where!

590
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,860
Accompanying his wife upstairs.

591
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,590
Yiting,

592
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,200
I want to

593
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,720
discuss something with you...

594
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,250
Go ahead.

595
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,860
Didn't you say a while ago
you wanted to have a child?

596
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,830
Look, I'm so dashing and charming,

597
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,070
and you are so talented and versatile.

598
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,470
Shouldn't we hurry up and

599
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,170
create the next world's female lead?

600
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,200
What?

601
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,590
Are you not satisfied,

602
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,310
being a supporting character?

603
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,880
Do you want to flip the table?

604
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,350
That's not what I meant.

605
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,550
I just...

606
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,040
Like you.

607
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,760
Stop pretending.

608
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,730
You just feel you're not free around me.

609
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,400
You want to use a child to get rid of me,

610
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,510
and then go back to

611
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,030
your old wandering, carefree life,

612
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:42,510
right?

613
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,640
No, no.

614
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,640
But

615
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,720
it's not entirely unacceptable.

616
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,310
Isn't Chu Li the screenwriter?

617
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,280
Before he left,

618
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,020
I made a wish to him,

619
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,620
wishing men could get pregnant too.

620
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,590
After you've carried the baby
for 10 months,

621
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,310
you can go wherever you want.

622
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,150
I definitely won't stop you.

623
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,800
No wonder I feel like
I've gained weight recently.

624
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,800
You're not serious, are you?

625
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,460
You really made that wish?

626
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,440
Yiting!

627
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,480
Don't joke with me.

628
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,010
Yiting.

629
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,710
Yiting.

630
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,750
You're not serious, right?

631
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,070
Tell me you're not serious.

632
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:27,720
I am.

633
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,070
I'm not ready to step into this stage yet.

634
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,430
Tell me.

635
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,890
-Is it true?
-Walk slowly.

636
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,200
Don't upset the baby.

637
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,030
This...

638
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,790
You almost scared me to death.

639
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,000
Check this out.

640
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,200
I instantly liked it

641
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,920
back in Yangzhou.

642
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,410
Don't you think this color

643
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,510
suits the skin tone of people our age
very well?

644
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,310
Let me see.

645
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,730
The color is really pretty.

646
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,550
I think

647
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,640
we should put it on

648
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,510
all our sisters later,

649
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,700
and then we go shopping together.

650
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,160
According to Yimeng,

651
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,960
this is called "live selling."

652
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,240
Good idea.

653
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,190
Tomorrow,

654
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,200
I'll go to Yangzhou

655
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,750
and bring in another carriage of goods.

656
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,030
Okay.

657
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,280
I'm sure they'll sell really well.

658
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:08,960
Okay.

659
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,230
Noble Consort.

660
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,250
You haven't come to see me
for three months.

661
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,190
If this goes on,

662
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,760
you might even forget

663
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,800
what I look like,

664
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,670
right?

665
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,120
Darling.

666
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,440
No matter how nice this place is,

667
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,920
it's not your home.

668
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,199
Even if you don't miss me,

669
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,360
you should miss

670
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,020
the flowers and plants
you usually take care of.

671
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,360
Take this.

672
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:42,370
[Divorce Letter]

673
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,880
As for a loveless marriage,

674
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,440
I'd rather not have it.

675
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,090
