He has...

173
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,870
a body double for nude scenes?

174
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,670
You don't?

175
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,000
How can we be brought down
by a little problem like this?

176
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,720
Am I right?

177
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,650
Yeah. Totally.

we'll take it very seriously.

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,080
We'll sort it out

181
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,510
before filming starts.

182
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,860
Thank you, Director.

183
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,440
I knew this production team

184
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,230
was a hidden gem.

185
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,560
You're so professional.

the title's not quite right.

201
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,510
You should bold it and make it bigger.

Also…

203
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,790
When was the poster shot?

Why didn't they inform us?

Don't worry. We'll shoot later.

In this business,

211

Nan Feng is a little special.

He needs 19 staff.

Yes.

Actually,

Nan Feng doesn't care about any of that.

228
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,120
But as his agent,

229
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,670
I need to think things through.

Since we've cleared
enough time in his schedule for this show,

237
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,720
we have to make sure
the quality is up to par.

238
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,510
Actors need good roles,

239
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,000
but roles need good actors just as much.

playing such an important role.

that suits her character.

fiddling with his prayer beads.
