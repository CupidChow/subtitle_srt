1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sword is heavy.

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the deep roots of the enemy.

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,800
It's not as good as the dust.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am willing to be a beast.

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
I am willing to be a beast.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
A heart is not a sword.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
The four seas are in harmony.

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
No need to wait. No need to hate.

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Write a poem for myself.

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
I will follow all the wishes.

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,800
I will write a poem with my love.

13
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,800
The wind blows.

14
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
I am not good at fighting.

15
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
I don't regret my youth.

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,800
I will be a man of my word.

17
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,800
For this life and for all lives.

18
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,800
I will give my all.

19
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
The Legend of Chusen

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Episode 16

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Nau Heng.

22
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Nau Heng.

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,800
It's snowing.

24
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
A goose feather.

25
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,800
River flowers.

26
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Earthly Qi.

27
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
This is...

28
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
A dog that looks like a cat.

29
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
A cat that looks like a dog.

30
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
I want a...

31
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,800
A dog that looks like a cat.

32
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
A cat that looks like a dog.

33
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
A horse that can ride a horse.

34
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
I also want a big house.

35
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
A snowman in the summer.

36
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
A lotus in the winter.

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
A driver who doesn't have to work.

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
No PPT. No POA.

39
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
I can't meet Pu Xin Nan when I go out.

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
I will meet you online.

41
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
I will meet you online.

42
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
I will meet you online.

43
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
I will meet you online.

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
People I like,

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
they are small dogs during the day and small dogs at night.

46
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
When I have time,

47
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
I will pet that dog that looks like a cat.

48
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
I will meet you online.

49
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
I will meet you online.

50
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
I will meet you online.

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
I will meet you online.

52
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
I will meet you online.

53
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
I will meet you online.

54
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
I will meet you online.

55
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
I will meet you online.

56
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
I will meet you online.

57
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
I will meet you online.

58
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,800
I will meet you online.

59
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
I will meet you online.

60
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
I will meet you online.

61
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
I will meet you online.

62
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Do you want to meet my friends?

63
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,800
From the packet.

64
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
I don't need to pay for your coffee or strengths.

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
I can find one as much as you want.

66
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Just take two sleep.

67
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,800
I want to several people in our family.

68
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,800
You may have one later!

69
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,800
vet not want to get wronged.

70
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
But this one

71
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,800
is the most similar one I can make.

72
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,800
You also said that you want to work for four seasons a year.

73
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Don't want PPT, don't want POA.

74
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Although I don't know what PPT and POA are,

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,800
but I probably know the word work.

76
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Mr. Song said that you didn't like to be a female worker since you were young.

77
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,800
So when we're together in the future, you naturally don't have to do it.

78
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Also, this land of the Cangjiang Courtyard is for you.

79
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
My salary is also for you.

80
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,800
You can buy whatever you want.

81
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
I won't let anyone bully you.

82
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,800
As for Pu Xin Nan and Jian Lan Xia,

83
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
I know nothing about them.

84
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Little wolf and little milk dog, I also have no clue.

85
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Although you always say things that I don't understand,

86
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,800
although you have the same thoughts and thoughts that I can't figure out,

87
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,800
but no matter what,

88
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,800
I want to protect you for the rest of my life.

89
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
So,

90
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,800
can you give me one more chance to get married?

91
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,800
I want to be with you.

92
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
No.

93
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
I know

94
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,800
that everything you did is what I want.

95
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
But Nan He,

96
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,800
don't do these things for me anymore.

97
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Why?

98
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,800
Because I really can't marry you.

99
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,800
I really can't.

100
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Song Yi Meng!

101
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
What's going on?

102
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Song Yi Meng.

103
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Song Yi Meng, why don't you want to marry me?

104
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Stop asking, okay?

105
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Wait, Song Yi Meng, can you tell me the reason?

106
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Okay.

107
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Since you want to know the reason,

108
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,800
I'll tell you today.

109
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
How is that possible?

110
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Everything is in place.

111
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Don't women like these things?

112
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Could it be that she's not a woman?

113
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Don't you want to know why I'm leaving?

114
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Why can't I be with you?

115
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,800
This is the answer.

116
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
What is this?

117
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,800
These are the famous scenes in the script.

118
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
I've said it before.

119
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,800
This is a world in a picture book.

120
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,800
The stories in the picture book will happen.

121
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
In this world,

122
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
everyone's birth

123
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,800
is a picture book that was written in advance.

124
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,800
And in the end, it will lead to a

125
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,800
ending that you can never change.

126
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,800
So the picture book is the script you're talking about?

127
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
How is that possible?

128
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,800
You mean the world we're in

129
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,800
is in the picture book?

130
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
But we're both living people.

131
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Why don't you believe me?

132
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Think about it.

133
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Why did I come here

134
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,800
and tell you the secret?

135
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,800
You're right, Your Highness.

136
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Why did I know that the Lantern Festival

137
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,800
would have a big event and the Purple Golden Pavilion?

138
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,800
It's because I've read the script in advance.

139
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Whenever I'm in danger,

140
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,800
you'll come to save me.

141
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Whenever the plot changes,

142
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
will the sounds of typing

143
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,800
appear in our minds?

144
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,800
And then you bring the story back to the main story.

145
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Think about it.

146
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Is that true?

147
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,800
That day, you controlled it.

148
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
You controlled it too?

149
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Song Yi Meng,

150
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,800
no matter where he is,

151
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,800
his body will be out of control to save him.

152
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
So the last night's chaos

153
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
is still going on.

154
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Don't you think it's a bit strange?

155
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Because it's written in the script.

156
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
It's the script again.

157
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
He's the male lead.

158
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
He can escape death,

159
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
and he can be killed.

160
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
He has golden fingers.

161
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Jump with me.

162
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Are you crazy?

163
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
I'll die if I jump.

164
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Just trust me once.

165
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Jumping in this world

166
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
will not kill you.

167
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
I trust you, you bastard!

168
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
You're dead!

169
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
How can you die?

170
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
So,

171
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,800
I'm the main lead in this script.

172
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
And you...

173
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
That's right.

174
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
I'm the one

175
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,800
who was dragged into this world.

176
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
Just think of me as

177
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
someone from the outside world.

178
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Nan He,

179
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
I know it's hard for you to accept this.

180
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
But this is the truth.

181
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
If we continue to be together,

182
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
I'll be a hostage to you,

183
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
and the whole Song family

184
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
will be killed.

185
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
So you're far away from me.

186
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
You want to leave here

187
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
to protect the Song family.

188
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
You want to leave here to protect the Song family.

189
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Song Yi Meng,

190
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
although I can't fully understand

191
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
what you're saying now,

192
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,800
I hope you can give me some time.

193
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
I'll think of something.

194
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
But before that,

195
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
don't leave,

196
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
okay?

197
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
I'll go.

198
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
This is a good move.

199
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
I lost.

200
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,800
You didn't lose, right?

201
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Chief Qi,

202
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
look at it again.

203
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Mr. Chen.

204
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
You won me,

205
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,800
so you have to promise me one thing.

206
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Your Majesty, let's do it again.

207
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Song Yi Meng's marriage,

208
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,800
what do you think now?

209
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
This old fox,

210
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
don't play tricks on me.

211
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,800
He used to marry Chu Gui Hong,

212
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,800
he's been in the Gui Ge for many years.

213
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Now you're speaking the whole capital,

214
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
except for the old fox,

215
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,800
who else can you find to match him?

216
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Let me tell you,

217
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
I, the Crown Prince,

218
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,800
in terms of literature, martial arts, and stars,

219
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
I'm not picky.

220
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,800
What else are you not satisfied with?

221
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
Your Majesty,

222
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,800
I have a very bad temper,

223
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,800
I can't take the position of future empress.

224
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
You're not good at being calm.

225
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Yes.

226
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,800
But you're good at being calm.

227
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,800
I think it's not bad.

228
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Your Majesty, you didn't think so.

229
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Don't talk about the past.

230
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
I don't understand.

231
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
I should understand the situation.

232
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
They two,

233
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
made so many troubles,

234
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
the palace has been through,

235
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
the execution ground has been cut,

236
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,800
love and hate are both there.

237
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Sometimes, the young people

238
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,800
have to be treated as parents,

239
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,800
and the parents have to be treated as their children.

240
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Don't you think so?

241
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Jin Xiang, when you see Cousin,

242
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
he'll be mad at me for the Crown Prince.

243
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
You should be more careful.

244
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
You said he should be angry, but it's okay.

245
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
If he really wants to kill me,

246
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
you must protect me.

247
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
Did you hear me?

248
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
My foot!

249
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
How could you...

250
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
You...

251
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Cousin, are you crazy?

252
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Nan Heng is the Crown Prince now.

253
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,800
You assassinated him, it's a rebellion.

254
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,800
When did I say I would assassinate Nan Heng?

255
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
We've been brothers for more than 20 years.

256
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,800
Don't I know what you're thinking?

257
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,800
Rong Hua.

258
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
Did you hear what I said?

259
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
Your Highness,

260
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
you met with an accident tonight.

261
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Go back to your room and sleep early.

262
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Forget everything you should have forgotten.

263
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
You don't have to worry about anything.

264
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
What nonsense are you talking about?

265
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
I can't help it.

266
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,800
If you really care about my life,

267
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
you'll have to pay the three-way trial.

268
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Why did you go to Nan Heng?

269
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,800
I... I just wanted to help you.

270
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
I don't need it.

271
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
When Shu Yuan Xian lost the battle and returned to the capital,

272
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
you couldn't help me.

273
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
When Nan Heng almost drove me out of the capital,

274
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
you couldn't help me either.

275
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Did you help me

276
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,800
or Nan Heng?

277
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
I... I just wanted to help you.

278
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
No need to explain.

279
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
I don't need your help.

280
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
I don't care

281
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
who you're on your side.

282
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
I just hope

283
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
that the incompetent people

284
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
can show their incompetence.

285
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Just like how you used to hide behind me

286
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,800
and fight with Yuan Xian.

287
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,800
Can't you?

288
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
Apologize.

289
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Ji Xiang, you're right.

290
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Since I was little,

291
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,800
he was always protecting me.

292
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Cousin,

293
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
I couldn't help you

294
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,800
with the past.

295
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
I'm sorry.

296
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
But this time,

297
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,800
I really don't want you to keep making mistakes.

298
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
I'm sorry.

299
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Forget it, Ji Xiang.

300
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Let's go.

301
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,600
My

302
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,800
Ji Xiang

303
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,800
is only 18 years old.

304
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
He wouldn't understand

305
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,080
my children's case in case they got involved

306
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
with someone I awards,

307
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
and that she went off the test.

308
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
Such thoughts

309
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
be due to my weakness

310
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
and not my mom.

311
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,060
Emily,

312
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
what makes you think

313
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
that my dad presented me

314
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
to you?

315
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
What harm did I do to you?

316
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
How is that possible?

317
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,800
But you and I are both living people.

318
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
You're so stupid!

319
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
You're so stupid!

320
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
You're so stupid!

321
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
You're so stupid!

322
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
You're so stupid!

323
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
You're so stupid!

324
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
You're so stupid!

325
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
You're so stupid!

326
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
You're so stupid!

327
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
You're so stupid!

328
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
You're so stupid!

329
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
You're so stupid!

330
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
You're so stupid!

331
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,800
You're so stupid!

332
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Is this world fake?

333
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
The road ahead is locked

334
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,980
The

335
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,980
road ahead is locked

336
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,980
The road ahead is locked

337
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,980
The road ahead is locked

338
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,980
The road ahead is locked

339
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,980
The road ahead is locked

340
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,980
The road ahead is locked

341
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,980
The road ahead is locked

342
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,980
The road ahead is locked

343
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,980
The road ahead is locked

344
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,980
The road ahead is locked

345
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,980
The road ahead is locked

346
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,980
The road ahead is locked

347
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,980
The road ahead is locked

348
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
The road ahead is locked

349
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,600
The road ahead is locked

350
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,400
You would be left alone

351
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
I know

352
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,680
But none of me

353
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,840
Dare suppress

354
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,020
What is my sight looking at?

355
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,980
The calm breeze

356
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,980
I finally found you, Your Highness.

357
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,980
Where have you been?

358
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,980
What happened?

359
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,980
Your Highness, why are you injured?

360
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,980
Say something!

361
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,980
Your Highness, I'm fine.

362
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,980
I'm fine.

363
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,980
I'm fine.

364
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,980
I'm fine.

365
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,980
I'm fine.

366
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,980
I'm fine.

367
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,980
I'm fine.

368
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,980
I'm fine.

369
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,980
I'm fine.

370
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,980
Are you worried about me?

371
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,980
Of course!

372
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,980
Why?

373
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,980
We have been together since we were young.

374
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,980
You treat me so well.

375
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,980
I don't care about you.

376
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,980
Your Highness, let's talk when we get back.

377
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,980
Sit.

378
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,980
I'm asking you.

379
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,980
If all these are fake.

380
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,980
Fake?

381
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,980
I mean, if

382
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,980
the world we live in

383
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,980
is a world in a painting book,

384
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,980
what would you do?

385
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,980
In a painting book?

386
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,980
If it's in a painting book,

387
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,980
what would you do?

388
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,980
I don't know.

389
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,980
If it's in a painting book,

390
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,980
is it true that you treat me so well?

391
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,980
It's true.

392
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,980
Can I eat enough every day?

393
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,980
Yes.

394
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,980
Can I eat eight steamed buns every meal?

395
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,980
Yes.

396
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,980
Can I stay with you?

397
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,980
It's more meaningful than Shangguan He.

398
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,980
Of course.

399
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,980
That's it.

400
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,980
As long as I can stay with you,

401
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,980
I can do what I want to do.

402
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,980
What can I do in the painting book?

403
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,980
Even you can figure it out.

404
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,980
I'm still trying to do something.

405
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,980
Even if it's a painting book,

406
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,980
it's enough to do what I want to do.

407
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,980
Your Highness, what do you want to do?

408
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,980
I want to be the Crown Prince.

409
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,980
I want to build the Great Jin Empire

410
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,980
and bring good fortune to the world.

411
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,980
I also want to protect the people of the world.

412
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,980
I want to protect the people of the world.

413
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,980
I want to protect the people of the world.

414
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,980
Even if it's a painting book,

415
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,980
I

416
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,980
will do what I want to do.

417
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,980
I will take control of my own destiny.

418
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,980
Because you're my daughter.

419
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,980
I don't want to be your daughter.

420
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,980
That's the reason why I child go to Nanshan.

421
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,980
Father,

422
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,980
you clearly know I don't want to marry Nan Heng.

423
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,980
Why would you accept the marriage code?

424
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,980
The Crown Prince of today

425
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,980
is Huna slightly- habits crown prince.

426
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,300
Different views.

427
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,340
Father,

428
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,940
just because Nan Heng is the Crown Prince,

429
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,980
you don't care about my opinion?

430
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,100
Isn't the one who climbs the high stairs

431
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,780
a woman?

432
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,220
Song Yi Mo,

433
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,860
to tell you the truth,

434
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,460
His Majesty gave me the last notice.

435
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,620
Either

436
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,700
you marry the Crown Prince and be the Crown Princess,

437
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,580
or

438
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,900
you don't want to be the Minister of the Wei family.

439
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,620
If you want the whole family to drink the Western and Northern Wind,

440
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,540
I'll go to the palace and get you a paper.

441
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,300
I...

442
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,020
I'll go see him.

443
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,780
Did I show my face?

444
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,380
You said the Crown Prince

445
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,100
really gave me a hard time this time.

446
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,780
By the way,

447
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,820
he said I climbed the high stairs.

448
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,740
What are you doing?

449
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,060
Why didn't you say no to him?

450
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,700
Is this a face?

451
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,100
Song Yi Mo,

452
00:26:59,060 --> 00:26:59,860
where are you going?

453
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,460
I'm going out for a walk.

454
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,260
You don't understand me.

455
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,300
I'm going to the front gate.

456
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,260
Come with me.

457
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,780
Come on.

458
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,140
Father is not a man who goes to the Western and Western Wages.

459
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,020
But he's not a fool.

460
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,220
You did everything for the Seventh Prince.

461
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,340
You can see it clearly.

462
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,900
I don't like him because I saved him.

463
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,020
I like him doesn't mean

464
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,220
I'm going to marry him.

465
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,300
You're just being stubborn.

466
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,620
You're afraid that after marrying him,

467
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,020
the Song family will bring trouble

468
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,980
and the whole family will be killed.

469
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,100
Song Yi Tian,

470
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,900
how did you know?

471
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,740
Nan Heng told father.

472
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,380
Father knew it?

473
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,020
He knew why he had to help Nan Heng?

474
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,580
Father has been a official for a lifetime.

475
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,940
How could he not understand this?

476
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,700
He was willing to help Nan Heng

477
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,420
all for you.

478
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,380
He wanted you to face your heart

479
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,740
and be afraid that you would regret it in the future.

480
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,100
But if one day,

481
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,980
the Song family is in trouble

482
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,540
because of my choice,

483
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,060
I will really regret it.

484
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,900
You risked the risk of being against His Majesty

485
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,100
and robbed Dong Wengu.

486
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,700
When you killed Nan Heng,

487
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,380
why didn't you think of bringing the Song family into trouble?

488
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,220
Song Yi Meng,

489
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,660
it's easy to find an excuse to escape,

490
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,460
but you can never fool your heart.

491
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,180
The air outside

492
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,580
is really good.

493
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,900
Nan Zhu Manor?

494
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,900
Song Yi Ting,

495
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,340
you were also bribed by Nan Heng.

496
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,220
Didn't you say that the Song family

497
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,900
can't be brought down for a moment?

498
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,100
It's a good time to change a place to relax.

499
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,580
You go by yourself.

500
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:32,900
Song Yi Meng.

501
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,700
Don't grab me.

502
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,100
Let go of me.

503
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,900
Song Yi Ting.

504
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,700
Song Yi Ting.

505
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,700
Song Yi Meng.

506
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,580
Song Yi Ting.

507
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,860
My hair industries are bad here.

508
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,620
I have some addictions with my hair.

509
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,500
I'll take care of it.

510
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,700
Your Highness.

511
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,480
Without me around,

512
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,580
you've shown everyone

513
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,860
that I'm here.

514
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,460
This is the way you want?

515
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,700
I don't understand what you're saying.

516
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,820
But

517
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,940
since you're here,

518
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,740
just stay here for a few days.

519
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,580
Who wants to stay here?

520
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:23,980
The horses and snakes in my mansion

521
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,900
have been sent out.

522
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,580
If you want to go home,

523
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,580
you can only walk.

524
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,180
It's very far.

525
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,420
Nan Heng,

526
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,220
it's useless for you to do this.

527
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,580
I...

528
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,620
I really can't

529
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,580
agree to marry you now.

530
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,060
I can't do it now.

531
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,780
It doesn't mean I can't do it in the future.

532
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,460
I have time.

533
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,740
I'm willing to wait.

534
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,340
Love story?

535
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,060
Love story is usually useless.

536
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,820
Then

537
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,460
what kind of story do you like?

538
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,100
I can choose.

539
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,740
Whatever story you change now,

540
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,220
it can't change the future.

541
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,540
I can't make it clear to you.

542
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,140
I...

543
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,420
I'm going to have lunch.

544
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,540
How about

545
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,220
staying here for lunch together?

546
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,020
No need.

547
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,740
I'm not hungry.

548
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,700
Eat something.

549
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,100
It's all ready.

550
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,580
Don't you love hot pot?

551
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,220
There's no fried rice.

552
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,380
It's not good.

553
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,500
There's no pearl milk tea.

554
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,780
But I can't eat it.

555
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,300
How is it?

556
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,180
Can you eat it now?

557
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,980
I haven't had hot pot for a long time.

558
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,420
It's me.

559
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,220
It's the day we get married.

560
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,060
If you want to eat,

561
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,740
use or drink anything during this period,

562
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,140
just tell me.

563
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,020
Stop.

564
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,020
I'll go home after eating this hot pot.

565
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,020
Miss, we're here.

566
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,220
Why are you here?

567
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,820
Your Highness.

568
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,540
Your Highness.

569
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,860
You're so unlucky.

570
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,220
You came to the wrong place.

571
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,260
You're so unlucky.

572
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,260
You're so unlucky.

573
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,220
You're so unlucky.

574
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,220
You're so unlucky.

575
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,220
You're so unlucky.

576
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,220
You're so unlucky.

577
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,220
You're so unlucky.

578
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,420
You didn't tell us

579
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,820
you were staying at His Highness's mansion.

580
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,740
When did I say I was coming here?

581
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,940
His Highness told us.

582
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,220
Your marriage with His Highness is important.

583
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,500
There are many things to discuss.

584
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,700
So I came here first.

585
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,900
Miss, we're a family.

586
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,060
We're not that far apart.

587
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,100
Your Highness,

588
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,500
where is our house?

589
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,700
Over there.

590
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,300
It's so dirty.

591
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,060
It's so dirty.

592
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,820
Whose maid are you?

593
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,420
Miss, look.

594
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,020
These hair clips are more beautiful than those in the palace.

595
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,300
Miss, look.

596
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:20,560
It looks like a

597
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,220
Miss,

598
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,340
don't you like

599
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,620
a life without money?

600
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,020
Marry His Highness.

601
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,020
Be a princess.

602
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,820
You can live the life you want.

603
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,100
Yes, Miss.

604
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,940
Look.

605
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,860
You like His Highness.

606
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,060
His Highness likes you too.

607
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,260
You two are a perfect match.

608
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,220
If a relationship

609
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,540
doesn't work out,

610
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,740
it's better not to start

611
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,700
than to lose.

612
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,540
My brother from the Three Kingdoms Academy

613
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,500
asked me to ask you

614
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,060
if there's anything

615
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,900
I can do for you in your marriage.

616
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,820
For example, we can prepare more

617
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,780
for cats and dogs.

618
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,460
No need.

619
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,220
No need to prepare anything.

620
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,820
Actually, I asked Song Yuanting

621
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,860
for information.

622
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,940
Song Yunmeng doesn't mean no to you.

623
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,660
Besides, the imperial decree

624
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,260
has set the date of marriage.

625
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,620
You have the person.

626
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,940
Can this matter change?

627
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,380
The marriage

628
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,860
is about mutual love.

629
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,820
I don't want to force her.

630
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,060
As long as she remembers,

631
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,780
I can't marry her.

632
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,780
I think

633
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,540
we should

634
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,620
respect her and be considerate

635
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,620
for her.

636
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,620
Your son

637
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,820
is just like her sister.

638
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,660
Will do nothing

639
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,060
but grow tired

640
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,620
and can't eats any food or drinks.

641
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,140
So,

642
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,620
we have to

643
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,060
let go of her worries

644
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,540
in order to get away from her frustration.

645
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,700
Your Majesty,

646
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,300
the position of Prime Minister of Great Jing is short-lived.

647
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,780
I want to recommend someone

648
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,820
to be the Prime Minister.

649
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,900
Which one do you want to recommend?

650
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,740
Minister Song of the Ministry of War.

651
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,740
Song Yu De has always been a loyal and loyal man.

652
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,660
He has never been beaten or beaten since he entered the court.

653
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,700
He is indeed the best candidate for the position of Prime Minister.

654
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,340
But

655
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,260
you just became the Crown Prince,

656
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,660
you have to recommend your own father-in-law.

657
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,940
I'm afraid it's hard to convince him.

658
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,380
Your Majesty is right.

659
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,020
I dare not think too much.

660
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,740
But

661
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,700
if this is done,

662
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,420
it will make the officials upset.

663
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,580
I beg Your Majesty to give me another imperial decree

664
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,820
to punish me.

665
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,300
How?

666
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,500
If I have any bad news in the future,

667
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:06,980
Minister Song,

668
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,140
you can write to the officials

669
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,780
to remove me from the position.

670
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,260
Nonsense.

671
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,660
If so,

672
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,420
the country will be in danger.

673
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,260
Your Majesty,

674
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,460
the country that was first defeated

675
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,540
should be handed over to the virtuous.

676
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,100
Only then can it be guarded.

677
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,180
With this imperial decree,

678
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,420
Minister Song can speak directly to the officials

679
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,500
and be free from any concerns.

680
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,140
I will also be free from politics

681
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,140
and dare not have any slack.

682
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,620
You did this

683
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,860
because you were influenced by Song Yi Meng, right?

684
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,620
I don't believe it.

685
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,340
If someone else

686
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,780
took the position of prime minister,

687
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,620
you would do the same.

688
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,700
Your Majesty is right.

689
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,620
I did this

690
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,900
for Song Yi Meng.

691
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,060
I don't want Minister Song to please me

692
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,540
because of his daughter.

693
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,620
I don't want Song Yi Meng to be influenced

694
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,620
by my father.

695
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,020
I don't want her to be influenced

696
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,180
by my father.

697
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,500
I don't want her to be influenced by my father.

698
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,300
So,

699
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,980
this is a promise

700
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,380
I made to Song Yi Meng.

701
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,580
No matter what she does in the future,

702
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,460
she will not be influenced by Song's...

703
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,380
Nonsense.

704
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,060
You are the crown prince.

705
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,660
You are full of love.

706
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,180
You dare not to think about it.

707
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,020
You did this

708
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,860
for a woman.

709
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,620
You even came to ask for the position for her father.

710
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,180
Your Majesty,

711
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,100
Minister Song

712
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,860
is indeed the pillar of the country.

713
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,900
He deserves to be the prime minister.

714
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,380
I beg Your Majesty

715
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,300
to grant my request.

716
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,620
I know.

717
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,740
Get out.

718
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,180
Thank you, Your Majesty.

719
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,500
Go get water sir.

720
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,220
Father.

721
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,420
I got the news and came back soon.

722
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,420
Why are you hiding here?

723
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:55,020
This is the imperial edict of the Prime Minister of Feng Nian?

724
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,140
Your Highness, you entered the palace today.

725
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,140
In addition to recommending me as the Prime Minister,

726
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,140
you also persuaded His Majesty to give you the order.

727
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:11,140
This is the Song family's single-book iron ring.

728
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,740
Single-book iron ring?

729
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,340
This is the Golden Card of Death?

730
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,940
That's right.

731
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,660
The coming of the Crown Prince,

732
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,660
no matter how the court changes,

733
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,660
no matter how good or bad your relationship with him is,

734
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,660
the Song family can all be spared a death.

735
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,660
This Holy Dragon Ring,

736
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,660
since the founding of the Qing Dynasty,

737
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,660
has never been used by any family.

738
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,660
Meng Er,

739
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,980
for the sake of a future that you call a hazy one,

740
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,180
Nan Heng being able to do it to this extent,

741
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:59,180
is enough to see his feelings for you.

742
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,780
You are so afraid to say goodbye to your marriage.

743
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,780
What are you afraid of?

744
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,780
Maybe I'm afraid of

745
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,300
the unknown ending.

746
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,700
You are so beautiful.

747
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,700
What are you afraid of that hasn't happened yet?

748
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,700
Indeed,

749
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,300
I'm afraid that Nan Heng will hurt me.

750
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,300
But I'm also afraid of letting him down.

751
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,900
Because I don't belong to this world.

752
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,700
If...

753
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,220
If I leave this place one day,

754
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,220
what will Nan Heng do?

755
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,220
Your father

756
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,220
has never been a brave person.

757
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,220
But for your mother who was born in Han Wei,

758
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,020
marrying her and giving birth to you,

759
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,020
was the bravest thing your father has ever done.

760
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,020
Father,

761
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,540
this seems to be the first time

762
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,540
you've told me about your mother.

763
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:26,540
Your mother gave birth to you and left you alone.

764
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,540
She couldn't bear to part with you.

765
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,740
It's the biggest regret in the world.

766
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,260
But the days when you were with your mother

767
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:45,260
were also the best times in your father's life.

768
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,260
Mao Er,

769
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:02,260
love in this world is not all about perfection.

770
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:07,780
But if you leave behind a regret in your relationship,

771
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:11,780
it will be more painful than not being able to share a hand.

772
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:17,780
Nan Heng must have thought the same way.

773
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,780
I'm sorry.

774
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,780
I'm sorry.

775
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,780
I'm sorry.

776
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,780
I'm sorry.

777
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,780
I'm sorry.

778
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,780
I'm sorry.

779
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,780
I'm sorry.

780
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,780
I'm sorry.

781
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,780
I'm sorry.

782
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,780
I'm sorry.

783
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,780
I'm sorry.

784
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,780
I'm sorry.

785
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,780
I'm sorry.

786
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,780
I'm sorry.

787
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,300
I'm sorry.

788
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,300
I'm sorry.

789
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,300
I'm sorry.

790
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,300
I'm sorry.

791
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,300
I'm sorry.

792
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,300
I'm sorry.

793
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,300
I'm sorry.

794
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,300
I'm sorry.

795
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,300
I'm sorry.

796
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,300
I'm sorry.

797
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,300
I'm sorry.

798
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,300
I'm sorry.

799
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,300
I'm sorry.

800
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,300
I'm sorry.

801

I'm sorry.

802
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,820
I'm sorry.

803
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,820
I'm sorry.
