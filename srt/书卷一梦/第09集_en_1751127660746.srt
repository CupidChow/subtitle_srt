1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
Until it falls apart

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:23,800
Will starts again

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sword is heavy.

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the deep roots of the enemy.

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's better to be a man than to be a man.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am willing to be a beast.

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I am willing to be a beast.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
A heart that can't be controlled.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The four seas are in harmony.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No need to wait. No need to hate.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Write a poem for yourself.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
For all that I've been through.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,120
A close bond is forever.

15
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,500
I cut the destroyer's heart into more than one pair.

16
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:44,500
I am going to chase the evil restaurant's¡ epispies.

17
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,760
Eternal Love of Dream

18
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,900
painting by Wuhan Told by theista

19
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,300
Episode 26

20
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,320
Please come down.

21
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,180
Hey,언 он за,genfore they have met each other right?

22
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,780
Understand why they are busy in both comprehensively discussing?

23
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,660
What can they discuss while one is not about?

24
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,500
The Untamed

25
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,500
Episode 16

26
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,500
Cousin,

27
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
what are you thinking here alone?

28
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Am I.)

29
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
Rong Hua and the others are fine.

30
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,500
They are just injured from the scourge.

31
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
You can rest assured.

32
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Father will not

33
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
sit idly and watch

34
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
what will happen today!

35
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
When my aunt passed away,

36
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
I thought it was the last time.

37
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Father died in the Ping Long City.

38
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,500
I thought it was the last time.

39
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,300
I didn't expect that when I returned to Qingcheng,

40
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,300
I would know what is true evil.

41
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,900
Your Highness, can I entrust you with something?

42
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,900
Look, what do you mean by entrust?

43
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,900
Tell me.

44
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,100
I want to go to the Ministry of Rites to look at the documents recorded in the past year's lantern meeting.

45
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,100
Nan Heng doesn't want me to stay in the capital.

46
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:45,900
Okay, don't let him see who can laugh until the end.

47
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,500
Okay, cousin.

48
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,700
With your words, I can rest assured.

49
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,300
As long as our cousin and I work together,

50
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,100
even if we have another 100 lanterns,

51
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,100
we will definitely not be our opponents.

52
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,500
Right?

53
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,300
Here.

54
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,700
Why is the wine like this?

55
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,700
It's not comparable to the wine that can be made with the wine that can be made with the wine.

56
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,100
General, Your Highness.

57
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,500
Why are you here?

58
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,100
Look over there.

59
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,500
This is...

60
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,100
This is the fireworks specially made by the merchants.

61
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,900
I'm sure that they didn't have it before.

62
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,500
General, we have decided.

63
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,900
This year's lantern meeting is a blessing.

64
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,100
Qianyu Army will give all the people

65
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,500
a firework that will make them know that we are on the battlefield.

66
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,700
It's also a great honor to help the capital.

67
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,100
Tell me.

68
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,500
What do you think?

69
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,100
Your Highness, I've already said that

70
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,300
this Song Yi Meng is a bad person.

71
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,900
He's not to be trusted.

72
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,300
Mr. Shang Guan is also very self-willed.

73
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,700
I think that he's just being selfish.

74
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,900
I think that he's just being selfish.

75
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,300
That's why he's being so selfish.

76
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,500
I suggest that we punish Mr. Shang Guan

77
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,900
and let him stay away from His Highness.

78
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,300
Fu Gui, we are colleagues for 3 years.

79
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,100
I don't think this is appropriate.

80
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,700
I can at least help my Chief to solve problems.

81
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,500
What can you do for him?

82
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,100
As his personal bodyguard,

83
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,100
he's a top-class soldier.

84
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,300
You didn't even find out that you had the high-ranking officer secretly buried the bomb.

85
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,700
What can he do for you?

86
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,700
Can you two even say something useful?

87
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,100
What's the use of me asking you two?

88
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,700
But this high-ranking officer

89
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,300
dared to make the decision without my permission.

90
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,500
If it wasn't for the tomb, I would have already killed him.

91
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,500
I think that Your Highness shouldn't worry about this.

92
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,300
That Song Yi Meng has done this.

93
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,300
It means that he has no doubt about Your Highness's identity.

94
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,500
I think that

95
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,900
I can write him a letter as Li Shiliu

96
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,100
and let him come to you with Zhou Mi's plan.

97
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,300
That's good.

98
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,900
Isn't Su Yi Meng trying to kill me?

99
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,300
I want to see if he has the ability.

100
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Miss, Miss.

101
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,300
At least you have breakfast.

102
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,700
I can't afford it.

103
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,500
Today is the day that your sister and I will defeat fate.

104
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,900
If we succeed, it will be completely peaceful. If we fail, it will be completely peaceful.

105
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,500
Meng Er.

106
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,100
General Chu.

107
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,300
Where are you going, Meng Er? Why are you so hurry?

108
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,300
I'm going to look for Hero Li.

109
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,100
Go look for Li Shiliu?

110
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,500
I'm going to look for him.

111
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,300
I'm going to look for him.

112
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,500
I'm going to look for him.

113
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,700
I'm going to look for him.

114
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,900
I'm going to look for him.

115
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,900
I'm going to look for him.

116
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,900
I'm going to look for him.

117
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,900
I'm going to look for him.

118
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,900
I'm going to look for him.

119
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,900
I'm going to look for him.

120
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,900
I'm going to look for him.

121
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,900
I'm going to look for him.

122
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,900
I'm going to look for him.

123
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,900
I'm going to look for him.

124
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,260
I'm going to look for him.

125
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,500
Why are you expecting me first?

126
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,720
If you decide to make me disappear,

127
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,200
I won't be able to defeat you.

128
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,280
You really knew about that tonight?

129
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,140
Did anyone explain it to me?

130
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,320
What's wrong with you guys?

131
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,320
You saw how I was dressed yesterday?

132
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,400
You're not dressing in a smooth manner,

133
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,400
except when you made up and wore something on your chest.

134
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,900
What's so strange about that dress?

135
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,900
Alright, alright.

136
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,900
Don't be so serious when you meet each other.

137
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,900
You're both men.

138
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,900
Be more generous.

139
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,900
Okay?

140
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,900
Okay?

141
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,900
Meng'er likes someone who is weak and weak.

142
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,900
There's nothing wrong with that.

143
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,900
Of course she doesn't like someone who doesn't invite herself.

144
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,900
Master Li, you're saying that...

145
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,900
I'm the one who met the unknown person in my fiancée.

146
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,900
How can I not come?

147
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,900
How can I be at ease?

148
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,900
If there's no basic trust between the two of you,

149
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,900
then even if you get married,

150
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,900
it's still a marriage.

151
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,900
You're too generous.

152
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
You're still so bold to say that you're defeated.

153
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,900
Stop!

154
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,900
Did you two forget what you're doing today?

155
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,900
Suicide.

156
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,900
If anything happens,

157
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,900
let alone the three of us,

158
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
the Song family, the Tianyu Army,

159
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,900
and the Night God,

160
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,900
they'll all die.

161
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
You two

162
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,900
just wear such fancy clothes every day.

163
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,900
Can you do something serious?

164
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,900
Can you?

165
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,900
Okay.

166
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,900
Let's get down to business.

167
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,900
Next,

168
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,900
let's have a good chat.

169
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,900
Yo!

170
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,900
Sha Heng Plan.

171
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,900
Nan Heng.

172
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,900
I know this person too well.

173
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,900
He's a delicate person,

174
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,900
but he's suspicious.

175
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,900
So if you want to kill him,

176
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,900
you can't reveal anything.

177
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,900
The first step is to lure him away

178
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,900
from the Black Armor Army's protection

179
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,900
and take him to the place we arranged.

180
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,900
What about the location?

181
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,900
I suggest we choose the Jade River.

182
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,900
There are many people in the Jade River

183
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,900
in Hengchuan City.

184
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,900
Even if we fail to assassinate him,

185
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,900
we can still get into the crowd

186
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,900
and escape smoothly.

187
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,900
Killing people

188
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,900
is a great skill.

189
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,900
I'll be in charge of

190
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,900
the matter of Yin Nan Heng leaving.

191
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,900
I can tell him

192
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,900
that there's news of the cutting of the knife

193
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,900
and ask him to talk to him.

194
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,900
I'm sure he'll agree.

195
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,900
As for Chu Gui Hu,

196
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,900
you...

197
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,900
I can ask the Qianyu Army

198
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,900
to hold the Black Armor Army back

199
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,900
and make sure no one comes to welcome me.

200
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,900
Very good.

201
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,900
Now, we're going to

202
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,900
the most important part.

203
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,900
How to assassinate him?

204
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
Good.

205
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,900
Good.

206
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,900
Good.

207
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
Good.

208
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,900
Good.

209
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
Good.

210
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,900
Good.

211
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,900
Where is this?

212
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,900
It's so beautiful.

213
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
This is the daughter of Song's Mansion.

214
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,900
How beautiful!

215
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,900
Good.

216
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,900
Good.

217
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,900
Good.

218
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,900
Good.

219
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,900
Good.

220
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,900
Good.

221
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,900
Good.

222
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,900
Good.

223
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,900
Good.

224
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,900
Good.

225
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:11,380
with the

226
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:21,420
Cold

227
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,020
You're here, Your Highness.

228
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,220
Woman, are you playing with fire?

229
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,660
Didn't you say there's a way to cut the knife?

230
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,980
What's the point of playing such a show?

231
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,660
It's boring to say it.

232
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,540
But before we get down to business,

233
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:02,660
I want to do something interesting with you.

234
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,060
You little girl,

235
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,180
you're going to kill me.

236
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,700
Your Highness, don't worry.

237
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,340
There are many people here.

238
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,060
It's not convenient.

239
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,580
I object.

240
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,700
Brother, I just got into the show.

241
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,660
Mo, I don't think this is a good idea.

242
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,300
You...

243
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:47,980
She...

244
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,300
I...

245
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,780
Anyway, this is definitely not good.

246
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,380
You...

247
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,340
What's wrong with this?

248
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,660
Do you think my performance was too exaggerated?

249
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,820
I'll give you another one.

250
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,140
I'll do a cute one.

251
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,860
No need.

252
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,340
Mo, you don't know men.

253
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,940
Men are not as simple as you think.

254
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,500
Especially a despicable man like Nan Heng.

255
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,300
If he's not pure,

256
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,100
he'll do something evil to you before you do it.

257
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,540
If he...

258
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,140
Chu Gui Hong, don't be ridiculous.

259
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,900
What kind of man is Nan Heng?

260
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,060
A prince?

261
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,260
What kind of woman has he never seen?

262
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:20,860
In your heart,

263
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,900
he's a romantic man who's willing to marry and build a wedding.

264
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,340
He can't move when he sees a little girl dancing.

265
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,940
Isn't men all like this?

266
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,140
All like this?

267
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,300
Mo, I'm not like this.

268
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,860
Anyway,

269
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,780
no matter if Nan Heng is a romantic man,

270
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,620
he can't let Mo take the risk.

271
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,540
The assassination is very dangerous.

272
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,900
I think we should wait for now

273
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,820
and find other ways.

274
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,580
Let's make a long-term plan.

275
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,020
What long-term plan?

276
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,540
You've been counting your fingers for half a year.

277
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,260
There are still a few days left before the wedding.

278
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,660
What were you looking at just now?

279
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,500
It's already this time.

280
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,260
Why don't you trust Hero Li?

281
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,300
Mo, you're mistaken.

282
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,020
I don't believe him.

283
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,740
Do you think I'm deaf?

284
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,660
plexed

285
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,100
inferno

286
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,900
behind

287
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,080
the holding

288
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,260
So we'll just let the general Chu tell us

289
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,860
how you want to kill them

290
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,700
I

291
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,180
What do you want to say?

292
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,100
He's experienced und reputation,

293
00:16:43,100 --> 00:17:05,860
evil and cunning while

294
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,260
It could be done by the Nav door of requires

295
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:15,180
Chu Gui, when did so many people in the capital become like this?

296
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,380
I understand.

297
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,380
The Seventh Prince is on his way.

298
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,980
The Xian Daren people are leaving now.

299
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,180
Get lost!

300
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,380
Go, go, go.

301
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,780
Hurry and go.

302
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,980
Your Highness, are you satisfied?

303
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,780
Let's go!

304
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,980
I'm sorry.

305
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,980
I'm sorry.

306
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,980
It's you.

307
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,980
I'll avenge you tonight.

308
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,980
Protect me!

309
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,980
You're the one who killed me.

310
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,980
I'll avenge you tonight.

311
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,980
I'll avenge you tonight.

312
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,980
I'll avenge you tonight.

313
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,980
I'll avenge you tonight.

314
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,980
I'll avenge you tonight.

315
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,980
Don't kill me.

316
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,980
I can give you any kind of balance.

317
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,980
Don't kill me.

318
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,260
I'm not afraid of you.

319
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,420
Enough!

320
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,340
So in your heart,

321
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,580
Nangeng is such a person.

322
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,860
Is there any problem?

323
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,100
What's the problem?

324
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,220
Only know yourself, know your enemy,

325
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,420
can you fight well.

326
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,220
If he really is as you said,

327
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,620
a coward who is afraid of death,

328
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,740
how can he live in the court

329
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,500
until today?

330
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,780
You don't understand even I said it.

331
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,420
He is a man.

332
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,660
He can escape death,

333
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,940
can be a man of good words,

334
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,220
and have golden fingers.

335
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,660
What's the problem?

336
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,580
How to say?

337
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,300
I'll tell you like this.

338
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,020
Enough!

339
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,660
Can't you kill him?

340
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,900
If you want to kill him, listen to me.

341
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,300
What's your opinion?

342
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,380
Don't you always think

343
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,700
I have a relationship with Nangeng?

344
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,660
Can you hear my opinion?

345
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,780
What?

346
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,420
You've never had a relationship with Nangeng?

347
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,900
You're doing it again.

348
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:22,860
So,

349
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,740
the died is

350
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,380
still in the Confine diagnosis.

351
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,260
When that time comes, your Torch Legion

352
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,200
Then instituted with his name,

353
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,140
and then transferred

354
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,760
to Nauhe and Changyang room.

355
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:42,380
His horse name Next Formality

356
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,380
is titled Catch Me, Daydream.

357
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,360
On this day,

358
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,460
Salt and Pepper

359
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,060
was ordered to destroy

360
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,560
that fantasy

361
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,520
from the Sword Th켓n,

362
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,160
so I broke

363
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,660
the promise.

364
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,020
My followers

365
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,800
had believed it for so long.

366
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,320
Cheers.

367
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,240
I have a style called time mallet

368
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,280
for sky king

369
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,920
Who are you?

370
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,960
I'm the one who send you on the way

371
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
I don't know why I'm like this.

372
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
I'm such a good person.

373
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
When will I be able to live with you?

374
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
I'm sorry.

375
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
I'm sorry.

376
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
I'm sorry.

377
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
I'm sorry.

378
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
I'm sorry.

379
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
I'm sorry.

380
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
I'm sorry.

381
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
I'm sorry.

382
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
I'm sorry.

383
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
I'm sorry.

384
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,800
When will I be able to get rid of this grudge?

385
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
I'm so sad.

386
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Miss Su,

387
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
please don't cry.

388
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,800
You don't want this to happen.

389
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
I'm so sad.

390
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
You're so good.

391
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
You're really good.

392
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
This plan is good.

393
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
From the beginning to the end,

394
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
it's all been thought out for us.

395
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
It's really a relief

396
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
to be with everyone.

397
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
You know very well about Nan Heng,

398
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Cheng Zhong, and the defense of the palace.

399
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
You really make me admire you.

400
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Those who don't know

401
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
will think that you are also in Cheng Zhong's place.

402
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
I'm sorry.

403
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
Those who don't know

404
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
will think that you are also in Cheng Zhong's place.

405
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
If you don't know much,

406
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
how can you manage the Moon?

407
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
In short,

408
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
if there's a hero helping,

409
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
the odds will increase.

410
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
As long as Nan Heng is alive,

411
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,800
all troubles will be solved.

412
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Come on.

413
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Kill Heng Plan.

414
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Start.

415
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Bye, everyone.

416
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Bye.

417
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
The one who can make our boss

418
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,800
work hard and play the whole day

419
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
is Miss Song.

420
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
What's wrong?

421
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
Why don't you say something?

422
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
If you don't say anything, it's a default.

423
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
A default?

424
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
It's a default.

425
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Let's get down to business.

426
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
The eye clinic is ready.

427
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
I'll wait for you to check.

428
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
I'm sorry.

429
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
I'm sorry.

430
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,800
I'm sorry.

431
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
I'm sorry.

432
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Sorry.

433
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,800
In the future,

434
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
don't be too close to me.

435
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Then you don't have to be so serious in the future.

436
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,800
Can you melt the Cosmic Fish Shaping Blade?

437
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
You'll know soon.

438
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,720
You are too sound!

439
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,320
You know how to cause troubles,

440
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,180
but you don't.

441
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,320
Do you know who I am?

442
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,540
What is that?

443
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,380
It's my aim,

444
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,640
and I'm going towards it.

445
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,960
The idea behind I-minglingяж (?)

446
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,380
is to protect the Mo Bai Wuls of Antonioa's and Cui horus

447
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,340
guys all told me

448
00:26:54,340 --> 00:27:19,180
when the

449
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,740
nd

450
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,780
Everything is going according to the original plan.

451
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,580
But it's not completely according to the original plan.

452
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,980
You're saying it like you didn't say it. What do you mean?

453
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,180
When you were just talking, don't stand so close.

454
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,980
Stop talking nonsense.

455
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,780
I'm not joking.

456
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,980
How can this work?

457
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,180
Don't worry.

458
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,180
I won't leave for a long time.

459
00:27:59,180 --> 00:27:59,980
But I...

460
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,980
Chu Gui Hong is very wary of me.

461
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,180
If I don't use a lot of medicine,

462
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,780
I'm afraid it's hard to completely eliminate his suspicion of Li Shiliu.

463
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,380
I...

464
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,180
I'm sorry.

465
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,580
I'm sorry.

466
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,980
What's wrong? Why are you so upset?

467
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,180
Mo Er.

468
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,780
Actually, what I said in the restaurant today wasn't true.

469
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,380
When I fought Li Shiliu for the first time, I was suspicious of him.

470
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,580
Today, we discussed the plan of killing Heng.

471
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,980
He is very familiar with Nan Heng's situation.

472
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,580
Don't you think these are very strange?

473
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,580
You've been acting all day today.

474
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,380
Please.

475
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,180
A great man doesn't lie to a great man.

476
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,780
Okay, brother?

477
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,780
Okay. Even if these are all coincidences,

478
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,380
what about the assassinator?

479
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,780
He was a prince, but he was killed by a wolf.

480
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,580
Why did he agree to join the assassination mission?

481
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,580
That's right.

482
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,380
He didn't agree to it immediately.

483
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,580
Instead, he rejected my proposal many times.

484
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,780
So what?

485
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,180
Maybe he was just trying to get a hold of you.

486
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,580
Or maybe he was playing a bigger game with Nan Heng.

487
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,780
These are all your guesses, right, General Chu?

488
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,180
But the hero Li saved my life.

489
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:45,580
It feels like you're walking in a long tunnel.

490
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,980
Suddenly, someone lights up a lamp for you.

491
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,580
He even told you that everything has been changed.

492
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,380
He told you to be at ease and not be angry.

493
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,580
So why can't we believe him?

494
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,180
I know. You're afraid that I'll be deceived.

495
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,180
But now, even if there's a chance of one in a million,

496
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,780
I must try it.

497
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,980
Because all the plots are revolving around Nan Heng.

498
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,980
If we don't break through, both of us will die.

499
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,380
Do you understand?

500
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,580
Both of us will die?

501
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,980
Are you talking about the day of the lamp festival?

502
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,180
Meng Er, don't worry.

503
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,380
No matter what happens next, I'll protect you.

504
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,380
No, no, no. You can just be like Wang Chang that day.

505
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,980
Just be normal.

506
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,780
If you succeed in the assassination,

507
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,780
you and 18th Prince will be able to gain the power of the fish.

508
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,180
If you fail, it's fine.

509
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,380
You can just find a place to rest and have a drink.

510
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,380
Meng Er, I'm not worried about myself at all.

511
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,180
It's you.

512
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,980
It's you.

513
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,380
I see.

514
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,180
You're Nan Er.

515
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,380
You'll always be by my side.

516
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,780
But I also need you to believe me.

517
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:12,180
I have a killer trump card. Nan Heng won't be able to hurt me.

518
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,580
Warm and fragrant.

519
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,300
Okay, I'm going home.

520
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:16,820
Meng.

521
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,300
Bye.

522
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,460
I feel so bad.

523
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,620
Miss.

524
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,500
Mother.

525
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,020
Mother, what's wrong?

526
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,820
Mother.

527
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,860
Maybe it's not a long time.

528
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,540
Listen.

529
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,500
When I see you get married

530
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,060
before I graduate,

531
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,700
I only have one wish left.

532
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,420
Mother.

533
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,980
Father has been deceived by you

534
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,420
for more than 20 years.

535
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,660
That's all.

536
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,460
I'm flattered.

537
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,740
You dare to try it?

538
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,020
Why is my life so miserable?

539
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,220
My daughter was born with a wrong wish.

540
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,860
She's colder than ice.

541
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,900
Let me die.

542
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,260
Die.

543
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,460
Madam, let me die.

544
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,700
Madam, don't.

545
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,100
Madam, don't.

546
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,460
Don't come.

547
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,500
Madam, don't.

548
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,460
If you do this,

549
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,900
she'll die.

550
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,460
Madam, it's the other way around.

551
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,860
It's the other way around.

552
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,260
It's the other way around.

553
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,460
I know you care about your mother.

554
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,940
I've asked around.

555
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,460
The 18th Prince will go to the brothel

556
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,660
to light the lantern for His Majesty.

557
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:53,340
This is a rare opportunity.

558
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,140
The lantern is a blessing for Great Jin.

559
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,260
It's not a wedding.

560
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,460
Your mother

561
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,860
doesn't worry about Great Jin.

562
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,460
As long as you can get married,

563
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,460
it's my blessing.

564
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,460
Mother, don't waste your time.

565
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,460
In the high-class palaces in the world,

566
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,460
there are many women who are married.

567
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,460
Women are helpless to do things

568
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:32,160
and fight for the

569
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,460
sake of men.

570
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,460
The lantern show is about to begin.

571
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,460
Are you all right?

572
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,460
I'm fine. Thank you, brother.

573
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,460
Be careful.

574
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,460
Don't be careless.

575
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,460
The 18th Prince will come to light the lantern for His Majesty.

576
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,460
I hope nothing goes wrong.

577
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,460
Yes.

578
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,460
My lords,

579
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,460
long time no see.

580
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,460
I'll propose a toast to you.

581
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,460
I'm sorry.

582
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,460
I'm sorry.

583
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,460
I'm sorry.

584
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,460
I'm sorry.

585
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,460
I'm sorry.

586
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,460
I'm sorry.

587
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,460
I'm sorry.

588
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,460
I'm sorry.

589
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,460
What time is it?

590
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,460
It's already the time of the dead.

591
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,460
It's said that the dead started it.

592
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,460
There are still no people.

593
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,460
Just because these two people are so strange,

594
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,460
they want to kill themselves.

595
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,460
It's a joke.

596
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,460
You've asked several times this night.

597
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,460
How can you be so anxious when you're being killed?

598
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,020
This isn't like that谢谢

599
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,780
My Highness.

600
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,920
She has come.

601
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,660
The obstructed parenthesis has here.

602
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,600
Hind-the-scenes Fehlet

603
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,460
I've pass out.

604
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,720
The demeanor of the Louis Vuitton attacker

605
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
is pretty good.

606
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,720
Can you move please.

607
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,860
Let's go over there.

608
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,060
Sorry.

609
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,220
I'm sorry.

610
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,180
It's you.

611
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,660
Did you do it on purpose?

612
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,620
You're dressed like a ball.

613
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,820
You're going to get married?

614
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,220
Do you know how expensive my fabric is?

615
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,620
You even stepped on my clothes.

616
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,820
I'm sorry.

617
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,700
I didn't stand still.

618
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,500
I've made you fall.

619
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,220
I won't talk to you anymore.

620
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,860
I'll go find someone.

621
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,460
Stop.

622
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,020
You're sorry and you want to hit me?

623
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,060
You're going to pay for my dress?

624
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:03,860
You...

625
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,500
Ruoruo.

626
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,500
There are many people here.

627
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,380
Don't make trouble.

628
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,340
I'm helping you.

629
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,820
She's dressed like a ball.

630
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,100
Who knows what she's up to?

631
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,580
What do you want?

632
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,660
Use this to fight.

633
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,500
This won't do.

634
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,660
I'll change another one for you, okay?

635
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,340
This one.

636
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,620
This won't do, Sister.

637
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,380
Give it to me first.

638
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,060
This won't do.

639
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,860
This one.

640
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,580
This won't do.

641
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,380
I...

642
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,340
With일colon.

643
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:43,980
Jin,

644
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:44,860
stop.

645
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,260
I can't live.

646
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:49,820
This is bad.

647
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:52,860
Thank you, Sister.

648
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,500
Do your best.

649
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,100
Thank you.

650
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,620
ort.

651
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,940
Bro Erhao wants to near army army

652
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,620
but Da Dan is afraid the master is here.

653
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,980
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

654
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,420
Your Highness, it's an assassin.

655
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,540
Your Highness, listen to me.

656
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,660
I'm not an assassin.

657
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:23,220
This is just a normal

658
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,340
There are so many eyes in the royal court.

659
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,340
Look at you.

660
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,660
A little thing like this.

661
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,660
How embarrassing.

662
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,260
It's not embarrassing.

663
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,060
I'm sorry. Don't take your hat off.

664
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,860
What did you say?

665
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,260
I just want to ask Miss Song.

666
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,460
What are you asking?

667
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,580
It's all in vain.

668
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,340
The royal teacher only knows to ask.

669
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,620
I'm not talking about you.

670
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,740
This is like I have skin on my forehead.

671
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,420
Do things more stably in the future.

672
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,740
You.

673
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,700
Come out with me.

674
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,620
I'm a god.

675
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,380
I'm the son of Xiangrui.

676
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,060
I, I, I ask what's wrong.

677
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,460
I can't even ask.

678
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,780
What does he mean by that?

679
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,180
What kind of subordinate?

680
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,980
Is it a curse?

681
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,980
I'm the victim.

682
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,780
Victim, victim, victim.

683
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,780
Hurry up, hurry up.

684
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,780
Good, good, good.

685
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,780
Good, good, good.

686
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,780
Good, good, good.

687
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,780
Good, good, good.

688
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,780
Good, good, good.

689
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,220
How should I make people go to the river?

690
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,820
Just say it.

691
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,540
Is it too sudden?

692
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,300
There was a change just now.

693
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,780
He is cunning and bad-tempered.

694
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,020
What if he is seen?

695
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,060
I just helped him protect her.

696
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,100
This is too obvious.

697
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,260
Next,

698
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,300
it is impossible to reveal the meaning of the love at first sight.

699
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,540
Must try to

700
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,260
let her lead Gu Jian to the river.

701
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,260
Good, good, good.

702
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,260
Good, good, good.

703
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,260
Good, good, good.

704
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,260
Good, good, good.

705
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,260
How should I say it?

706
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,260
Good, good, good.

707
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,260
Good, good, good.

708
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,740
If you keep going,

709
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,740
you'll leave the city.

710
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,660
You haven't spoken all the time.

711
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,660
What are you thinking about?

712
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,460
I, I was thinking

713
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,460
that you just saved me.

714
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,460
It's like the god's order.

715
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,460
I'm in danger.

716
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,460
Save me from the danger.

717
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,460
Song Yi Meng,

718
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,460
when did you talk so much?

719
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,460
Just say it.

720
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,460
If you really want to know,

721
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,860
I have something to tell you.

722
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,860
Then you...

723
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,860
Then tell me.

724
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,860
Your Highness, you...

725
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,860
Your Highness...

726
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,860
Your Highness, your hair line...

727
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,860
It seems that...

728
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,860
You moved a little bit after you went to the sword with me last time.

729
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,860
Hair line?

730
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,860
Hair line.

731
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,860
Young man,

732
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,860
go with your wife to the river to light a lantern.

733
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,860
I want to go to the Palace of Classic.

734
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,860
Two lanterns, two taels of silver,

735
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,860
no need to pay.

736
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,860
Why are lanterns so expensive?

737
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,860
I need two taels.

738
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,860
Jiawu, Tiancheng, lanterns for the wronged.

739
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,860
Aladdin lanterns are not that expensive.

740
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,860
What's wrong? Are you in pain?

741
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,860
Miss,

742
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,860
I've been married for 40 years.

743
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,860
If you're young and willing to spend money,

744
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,860
you'll be blessed.

745
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,860
You're the daughter of the minister.

746
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,860
You're so stingy.

747
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,860
Take it.

748
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,860
I'll see you out.

749
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,860
I...

750
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,860
No money.

751
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,860
A man can't even get two taels of silver.

752
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,860
I've been selling lanterns for 60 years.

753
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,860
I've never seen anyone so stingy as you.

754
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,860
No, I...

755
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,860
Give it to me.

756
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,860
Lanterns!

757
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,860
Here,

758
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,860
for you.

759
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,860
Thank you, Uncle.

760
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,860
Miss,

761
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,860
when you look for a man,

762
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,860
you need to open your eyes widely.

763
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:20,860
Don't worry.

764
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,860
Look at this knife.

765
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,060
This knife,

766
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:28,060
does it look like the one you used to knock on the door?

767
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:28,660
No, no.

768
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,380
I'll give you a ride.

769
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,380
I hope you can keep knocking on the door.

770
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,060
Let's go.

771
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,060
Who are you talking about?

772
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,460
Who are you talking about?

773
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,180
Your Highness,

774
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:41,660
I'm not talking about you.

775
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,460
You're not blind.

776
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,260
Let's go, Your Highness.

777
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,660
It's too late if we don't light the lanterns.

778
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,060
Let's go.

779
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,260
Let's light the lanterns.

780
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,260
Come here.

781
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:49,660
You're blind.

782
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,460
I'll give you a ride.

783
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,660
Thank you, brother.

784
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,060
It's so beautiful.

785
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:27,460
The city is surrounded by so many cold and mysterious things.

786
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:36,260
You and I are destined to be entangled and mature.

787
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:43,260
The wind blows gently in the ear.

788
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:50,260
The black night's attempts are in vain.

789
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:54,860
The hands of the dream are tangled.

790
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,660
When will I return?

791
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:03,260
Although the wind blows gently in the ear,

792
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:08,260
it's not as good as fate.

793
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,460
The words are in a flash.

794
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,660
If this dream is true,

795
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:16,460
how can the love and hate be hidden?

796
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:20,860
Although the wind blows gently in the ear,

797
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:25,860
it's not as good as fate.

798
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,260
If this dream is true,

799
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,460
how can the love and hate be hidden?

800
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:38,260
The love and hate are still here.

801
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:51,460
The wind blows gently in the ear.

802
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:56,460
The hands of the dream are tangled.

803
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,460
When will I return?

804
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,460
Although the wind blows gently in the ear,

805
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:09,460
it's not as good as fate.

806
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,460
The words are in a flash.

807
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,460
If this dream is true,

808
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,460
the years are short and the wind is strong.

809
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:23,460
The life is not as good as fate.

810
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,460
If this dream is true,

811
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,460
how can the love and hate be hidden?

812
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:35,460
The love and hate are still here.

813
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:47,460
