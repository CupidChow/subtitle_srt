1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
Ugh..

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,620
5th E loads

3
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:41,560
Your

4
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,200
going f sea

5
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,460
I love yng

6
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,840
Does the ThanhLa02 files

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,600
Children do not like to eat, do not grow each, use dragon mother to break bones

8
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,080
Dragon mother to break bones, let you watch the book

9
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,240
The crime of crime is really clever

10
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,840
Just

11
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,640
It's just that it's been dealt with for too long with the seventh prince

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,320
Ears like a wooden person, the way of writing

13
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,400
Just return the poem to the body

14
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,000
Since Lord Chu knows this truth

15
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,600
Does this imposter know what is misstabilization

16
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,120
Over the powerful night, swiftly withdraw from the Yama family

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I will find out the evidence of your collusion with the Night Deity.

18
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
General Chu, you're joking again.

19
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,000
I was invited by you to come to the prison today.

20
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Why would I have to do with the Cangjiang Yue City?

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Or do you call me to the prison on purpose

22
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
just to give me a hat that should be worn when I'm in danger?

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
After His Highness entered the prison,

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
a terrible incident happened.

25
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Is it just a coincidence?

26
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm also curious about this.

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Why would a coward know that I would come to the prison?

28
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Moreover, I was injured by you.

29
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Could it be that there is a mole among the Lord of the Thousand Jade Army and the Jingzhao Manor?

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Nan Heng, you're lying!

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You're talking nonsense and lying to the prince.

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're not to be forgiven for this crime.

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You even wanted to set up a soul-collusion

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
to get me and the Prince to be together.

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Your crime is really hard to forgive.

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But you still don't know enough.

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You said that I was a killer.

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
How could a killer be connected to the lives of people?

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If Shangguan He really is my subordinate,

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
how could I let him live?

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Why didn't I kill him when the chaos was just beginning?

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Why did I have to do this again?

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm not going to let you live.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I killed him when the chaos was just beginning.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Why did I have to do this again?

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm not going to let you live.

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Shangguan He has been sentenced to a few days.

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't believe that his accomplice would be able to hold his anger and watch.

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If there is a move,

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
he will definitely show his feet.

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I think the most unbearable thing

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
is probably General Chu.

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Meng.

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Father.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
How is he?

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The doctor said that he is fine.

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He will be fine after a few days of rest.

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Don't worry.

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Father, where is Nan Heng?

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Is he still in the Aiting Valley?

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He has already left.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll go and see.

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't go for now.

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Aiting said that she doesn't want to see anyone now.

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why?

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
She wants to see Nan Heng, but she doesn't want to see us.

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This Seventh Prince is my good trick.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He made your sister fall into the water.

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't worry, father.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I will never let Nan Heng go to Shanghai to see Song Yun Ting again.

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
His Majesty has arrived.

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Greetings, Lord Song.

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Eunuch Liu, I don't know why His Majesty has arrived.

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I have a reason.

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Lord Song, you don't have to be so formal.

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
His Majesty is visiting Song's mansion in private.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He doesn't want to talk about state affairs.

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't know what has disturbed His Majesty again.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Lord Song, you don't have to say that.

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Your Highness, the Seventh Prince has already gone to His Majesty's place

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
to report the situation of the Seventh Prince.

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll go and see him now.

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Lord Song, don't worry.

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The person His Majesty wants to see is not you.

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Not me?

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Who is that?

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Me?

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Your Majesty, Song Yi Meng has arrived.

89
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I, Song Yi Meng, greet Your Majesty.

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I, Song Yi Meng, greet Your Majesty.

91
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I, Song Yi Meng, greet Your Majesty.

92
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Stop!

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Your Highness, the people of Cang Jiang Yue have already left.

94
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Tian Yu Jun went there and made a hole.

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's good.

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I was worried about this on the way.

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Thank you.

98
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What happened to you?

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Your Highness, a big trouble has happened.

100
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The Seventh Prince has already entered the palace to meet His Majesty

101
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and has already talked about you.

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What did His Majesty say?

103
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
His Majesty is very angry.

104
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He keeps scolding Song Yi Meng.

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why did His Majesty scold Song Yi Meng?

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He said that Song Yi Meng shouldn't have touched you like this.

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He couldn't touch your brain, but he was very wise

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
to have you go into Song's mansion, which led to such a trouble.

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He also said that his actions were not right and he didn't do any good to you.

110
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's why Song Yi Ting has become a very good woman.

111
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
His Majesty is scolding Song Yi Meng.

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He hates the old man.

113
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Your Highness, His Majesty is really angry this time.

114
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He couldn't wait to have Song Yi Meng go into the palace.

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He went to Song's mansion this time to fight with him.

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
After seeing the six holes,

117
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
His Majesty summoned me today.

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What's the matter?

119
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
His Majesty doesn't need to disobey the order to go into Song's mansion.

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What do you think is the matter?

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
His Majesty has always hated Nan Heng.

122
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Is he trying to use the Purple Golden Pavilion to blame him?

123
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
If I drag out the matter of Nan Heng's private investigation of the Duan Tao Zhi Fa,

124
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
then the rest of the story will not happen, right?

125
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The Song family will not be disowned.

126
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Ting will not be deceived.

127
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I will not be made a hostage.

128
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Do I have to punish him?

129
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If I explain to you, will you believe it?

130
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The world says I am a killer.

131
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Don't you think so?

132
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The world curses me.

133
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Don't you do the same?

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I don't believe anyone.

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's because no one has ever believed me, even you.

136
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You have to know that the world is not what you look like.

137
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
If I don't fight for life, then I will be forced to be a prisoner.

138
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Your Majesty.

139
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I have heard about what happened last night.

140
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Song Yi Meng, if you can come forward,

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
you can point out that Old Seven seduced your sister and did not do anything wrong.

142
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Your Majesty, I don't want to point out the Seventh Prince today.

143
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I just want to ask for a decree.

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't you want me to make the decision for you to keep your position as Consort Zheng?

145
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Fine.

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Next month, you and Old Seven will get married.

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Song Yi will be a side-disposal.

148
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Your Majesty.

149
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I haven't finished yet.

150
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Your Song sisters and Old Seven's scandal has been so big that they cannot be kept in the dark.

151
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Song Yu De's reputation has been greatly affected.

152
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm afraid it's hard to establish a family in the capital.

153
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I will persuade him to resign from his position.

154
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Go to Old Seven's mansion and be a guest.

155
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Go to the fief with him.

156
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Your Majesty, I'm not asking for this decree.

157
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You don't want to marry and you don't want to keep your position.

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
How can you still be so stubborn?

159
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Do you really think I wouldn't dare to kill you?

160
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Your Majesty, I'm asking for the decree to cancel the marriage with the Seventh Prince.

161
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't want to have anything to do with the Seventh Prince

162
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and my sister and the whole Song family.

163
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Song Yi Meng, the marriage of a prince is a family matter and a national matter.

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
If you don't have a relationship today,

165
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
he will have a child tomorrow.

166
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If you can't find a reason to be on the stage...

167
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Your Majesty, if the marriage is cancelled,

168
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
the Seventh Prince will never have the opportunity to bring the forces of the Ministry of War into the gray.

169
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
By then, you will have enough time to plan your future path for the future Crown Prince.

170
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Will you marry the two daughters of the Song family to the Seventh Prince

171
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
or cancel the marriage?

172
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Please think twice before making any decisions.

173
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I really underestimated you.

174
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But I must remind you that the Seventh Prince is working hard to get married to the Song family.

175
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If you betray him, he will never let you go.

176
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
He will let the entire Song family go.

177
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Go!

178
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Go!

179
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Go!

180
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Gu Sheng is looking for you.

181
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I know you will come.

182
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What?

183
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
This is the imperial decree that the emperor asked you to cancel the marriage.

184
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Cancel the marriage?

185
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Song Yi Meng, I told you that I would give you an explanation about the Purple Pavilion.

186
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Why don't you believe me?

187
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Can't you believe me even once?

188
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What do you want me to believe in?

189
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Do you want me to believe that you approached me from the beginning

190
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
not for the sake of the Song family's power?

191
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Or do you want me to believe that you are never a person who uses all his energy

192
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
to manipulate the power and power?

193
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
A person who can't die to change?

194
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So...

195
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
In your heart,

196
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
the reason I'm seeing your sister

197
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
is to trick the Song family.

198
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Every time you are in danger, when I help you,

199
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
it's all fake.

200
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Every thing I do for you,

201
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I take it as...

202
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I take it as useless.

203
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's like a jade.

204
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Is it?

205
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Why?

206
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Why do you think you know me very well?

207
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Because I've known you since I met you.

208
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I know.

209
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:23,000
One day,

210
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Not only this time, from now on, I will never believe you again.

211
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm telling you, Ban Nan He, I came to you from the beginning just to kill you.

212
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I came to you to find a way to cut the sword, to kill you, to kill you to get married, and to kill you.

213
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
If it wasn't because Ting liked you,

214
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I would have killed you right now.

215
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling

216
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:53,000
you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

217
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,540
it always sucks

218
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,040
Katmipas

219
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,820
Rokkandlisk

220
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,140
Rokkandlisk

221
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:22,700
rubbing

222
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,100
Yang Yimeng, why are you so muddled?

223
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,580
Seventh Prince has promised to solve everything.

224
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,300
Why do you have to cancel the engagement?

225
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,740
I have no intention to marry him.

226
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,500
Why can't I cancel the engagement?

227
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,980
I know you're in a dilemma right now.

228
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,740
No matter how I try to persuade you not to be with him,

229
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,020
you won't listen.

230
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,220
But, Ting, I still want to tell you.

231
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,100
I know him.

232
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,540
He...

233
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,500
You won't have a good ending.

234
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,420
You're the one who doesn't understand him.

235
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,620
Let me tell you the truth.

236
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,460
The person I really like is Shangguan He.

237
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,420
Everything that happened in the Forbidden City

238
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,540
was a complete misunderstanding.

239
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,620
You like Shangguan He?

240
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Then why did you...

241
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,380
Song Yimeng, why are you so muddled?

242
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,980
You always talk to Seventh Prince about everything.

243
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,580
But you never think about

244
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,620
who you really like.

245
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
This...

246
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,460
What does this have to do with Li Shiliu?

247
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,740
I'll keep this in mind.

248
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,340
I never told anyone about Li Shiliu.

249
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,980
Ting and Seventh Prince's situation

250
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,860
has been a big problem.

251
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,180
This matter can't involve anyone else.

252
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,460
Yes.

253
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,180
Ting...

254
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,780
likes Li Shiliu?

255
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,540
Song Yimeng, why are you so muddled?

256
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,060
You always talk to Seventh Prince about Li Shiliu.

257
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,740
But you never think about

258
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,020
who you really like.

259
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,860
Does Li Shiliu have anything to do with Nanhe?

260
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,460
Then making a

261
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,340
pact with him is giving him a Japon to marry.

262
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:27,900
Is this your eye?

263
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,340
If you still pigment me,

264
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,660
it won't show up ahead of time.

265
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,100
Do you really want to lie to me?

266
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,820
If you don't believe me,

267
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,660
I dare not do it.

268
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,100
unfortunate

269
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,100
I haven't changed.

270
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,140
And in my opinion,

271
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,220
Nan Heng is so loyal to you.

272
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,900
How could he kill you?

273
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,620
Why did you protect Nan Heng so much?

274
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,820
Did I

275
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,860
do something wrong from the beginning?

276
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,940
The rain water in the garden was so deep.

277
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,900
The family of flowers and vegetables were broken.

278
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,460
I asked my brother-in-law for a favor.

279
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,220
Everything happened.

280
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,340
Nan Heng is also one of them.

281
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,860
The only thing that has changed

282
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,060
is the day of the Lantern Festival in Shangyuan.

283
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,340
The person who saved me is not Nan Heng.

284
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,460
It's Li Shiliu.

285
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,340
If it was me,

286
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,580
Li Shiliu

287
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,220
didn't want to save me.

288
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,260
But because

289
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,060
the heroine was in danger,

290
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,900
so she taught Qiandong to back him up.

291
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,740
Stop his gun banana.

292
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,740
Light an olfactory Success.

293
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,860
Just wait for me to finish my task.

294
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,220
In the fairytale,

295
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,860
Song Yi Dragon program, Nan Heng,

296
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,460
freshly hatched,

297
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,460
I can't see the mountain.

298
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,180
But when I came here,

299
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,340
the person Song Yimeng likes is...

300
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,980
It's not mentioned in the script

301
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,980
that the fireworks in this world

302
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,980
will be so beautiful.

303
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,620
And

304
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,580
it's not mentioned that

305
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,420
the pair that doesn't show their faces

306
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,140
is also pretty handsome.

307
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,460
So,

308
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,460
what do you think

309
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,460
we are now?

310
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,460
So,

311
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,460
the script hasn't changed from the beginning to the end.

312
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,460
The person I like

313
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,460
is Li Shiliang.

314
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,460
It's also Nanhe.

315
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,460
The End

316
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,460
The End

317
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,460
The thief in Tanjiang, Li Shiliang

318
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,460
hid this ball

319
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,460
and now the whole city is searching for him and his accomplice.

320
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,460
The one who took the initiative to expose the man

321
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,460
will be punished according to the law.

322
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,460
If there is a cover,

323
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,460
the one who hides

324
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,460
will be punished in the same way.

325
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,460
This place is quite hidden.

326
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,460
It can be hidden for a few days.

327
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,460
Come on, let's shake hands.

328
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,460
Who?

329
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,460
Me.

330
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,460
Boss, boss.

331
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,460
Boss, boss.

332
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,460
How is it? Are the brothers all right?

333
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,460
None of them are hurt.

334
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,460
The other brothers are hiding next door.

335
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,460
That's good.

336
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,460
Boss,

337
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,460
luckily you sent someone to report it in time.

338
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,460
Otherwise, our brothers

339
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,460
might really go to jail.

340
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,460
I didn't expect

341
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,460
it was Chu Guihong's trick.

342
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,460
He is really a vicious man.

343
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,460
The second master must be saved.

344
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,460
You don't have to worry about Shangguan He.

345
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,460
But today I want to announce one thing.

346
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,460
From today,

347
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,460
the Canjiang Yue

348
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,460
will be officially dissolved.

349
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,460
Disolved?

350
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,460
Disolved?

351
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,460
Why?

352
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,460
Why?

353
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,460
Why?

354
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,460
Disolved?

355
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,460
Boss,

356
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,460
what are you joking about?

357
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,460
Take these.

358
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,460
Take it.

359
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,460
Share it with everyone.

360
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,460
Don't ask about the other things.

361
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,460
Boss,

362
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,460
do you want to

363
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,460
separate us from the others

364
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,460
and save the second master by yourself?

365
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,460
You don't have to worry about it.

366
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,460
Wait.

367
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,460
The bank note is not enough.

368
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,460
You are right.

369
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,460
We brothers have been working for you for so many years.

370
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,460
Just this bank note

371
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,460
wants to get rid of us.

372
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,460
There is no door.

373
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,460
Right, brothers?

374
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,460
Yes.

375
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,460
You promised to find me a wife.

376
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,460
If you can't find one, we won't go.

377
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,460
Yes.

378
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,460
And my mother's house.

379
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,460
You haven't bought it for me yet.

380
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,460
Shut up.

381
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,460
Now the Qianyu Army

382
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,460
is searching for the people of the Cangjiang Yue.

383
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,460
You are in the capital.

384
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,460
It's dangerous everywhere.

385
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,460
Listen to me.

386
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,460
Go.

387
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,460
Boss,

388
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,460
I know.

389
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,460
You want to risk your life

390
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,460
and push us away, right?

391
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,460
You are dreaming.

392
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,460
None of the brothers of the God of Night

393
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,460
are afraid of death.

394
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,460
You want to live together.

395
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,460
You want to live together.

396
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,460
You want to live together.

397
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,460
You want to live together.

398
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,460
You want to die together.

399
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,460
Boss,

400
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,460
didn't we say

401
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,460
when we were with you?

402
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,460
The God of Night lives and dies together.

403
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,460
Yes, lives and dies together.

404
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,460
Lives and dies together.

405
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,460
The God of Night

406
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,460
is not a family without the boss.

407
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,460
Living and dying together

408
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,460
is the brotherhood.

409
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,460
Living and dying together?

410
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,840
You are all

411
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,460
a bunch of cowards.

412
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,460
How can you call yourselves a bunch of cowards?

413
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,460
You deserve to live and die together with me.

414
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,460
You deserve to live and die together with me.

415
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,460
Your Highness.

416
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,460
To tell you the truth,

417
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,460
Cang Jiang Yue

418
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,460
is just a chess game

419
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,460
I played in the capital.

420
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,460
You are

421
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,460
chess pieces of the Wu clan.

422
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,460
Now Shang Guan He has exposed his identity.

423
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,460
You are all my spies.

424
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,460
Don't you understand?

425
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,460
100 taels.

426
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,460
You are enough to make a living.

427
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,460
Do you hear me?

428
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,460
Get out of here.

429
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,460
Boss.

430
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,460
Shut up!

431
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,460
What right do you have to make a living with me?

432
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,460
And you.

433
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,460
A useless person who can't even speak.

434
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,460
What's the use of keeping you?

435
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,460
And you, the people of the Wu clan.

436
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,460
I'm telling you.

437
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,460
If one day

438
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,460
you ruin my big plan,

439
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,460
none of you can live.

440
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,460
Do you hear me?

441
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,460
I'm sorry.

442
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,460
I'm sorry.

443
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,460
I'm sorry.

444
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,460
I'm sorry.

445
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,460
I'm sorry.

446
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,460
I'm sorry.

447
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,460
I'm sorry.

448
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,460
I'm sorry.

449
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,460
I'm sorry.

450
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,460
I'm sorry.

451
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,460
I'm sorry.

452
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,460
I'm sorry.

453
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,460
I'm sorry.

454
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,460
I'm sorry.

455
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,460
I'm sorry.

456
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,460
I'm sorry.

457
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,460
I'm sorry.

458
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,460
Boss.

459
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,460
Come on, drink.

460
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,060
Come on, cheers.

461
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,620
You must drink.

462
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,100
Cheers.

463
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,540
Come on.

464
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,100
Come on.

465
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,860
Brother, let's drink.

466
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,500
To you.

467
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,100
Come on.

468
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,900
Come on, cheers.

469
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,580
Drink.

470
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,180
Come on, brother.

471
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:43,660
Drink.

472
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,340
Brother.

473
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,620
Brother.

474
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,300
Brother.

475
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,460
You two.

476
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,780
Come on, cheers.

477
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:55,940
Drink.

478
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,300
Drink.

479
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,060
Boss.

480
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,700
Do you remember a year ago,

481
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,260
you told me

482
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,060
to take care of the Cangjiang Yue for you.

483
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,060
We even made a deal.

484
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,300
You are the boss of the Black Star.

485
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,620
I am the second boss of the Black Star.

486
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,460
I will do the dirty things for you.

487
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,980
But why do I have to

488
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,460
do so many disaster relief,

489
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,660
and treat the water problem?

490
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,980
I am a snake, old, weak, rich,

491
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,900
and I have to find a cat for people.

492
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,900
This kind of crap.

493
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,540
Doing good deeds,

494
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,500
I am trying to make you

495
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
a sinful and heavy person.

496
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,620
Give me more service.

497
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,780
Do you understand?

498
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,420
Is that good deeds?

499
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,540
That is good deeds, boss.

500
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,420
You open your eyes and see clearly.

501
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,740
You are the snake, the snake, the snake.

502
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,940
Not the Bodhisattva.

503
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,220
And I am the great thief of Jiangyang.

504
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,460
Not the upper-ranking good person.

505
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,100
Look at me.

506
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,180
I look like

507
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,740
a good-for-nothing person who does good deeds.

508
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,580
Do I look like that?

509
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,820
If you don't do it, why do you want me to do it?

510
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,660
If you want me to do it,

511
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,500
I will do it.

512
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,340
I will add more price.

513
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,820
I am a famous person.

514
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,740
I am the thief of Jiangyang

515
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,860
who committed the robbery of Shiyuqi in half a month.

516
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,260
And I am here to find

517
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,780
the lost cat and dog.

518
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,380
What do you think?

519
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,620
Okay.

520
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,500
Two years.

521
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,740
Two years later,

522
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,940
I will set you free.

523
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,820
You can set me free?

524
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,860
You are a ghost.

525
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,540
I am hungry.

526
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,100
I mean, the government of Jinzhao

527
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,300
has also taken a lot of taxes from the capital.

528
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,580
Where did the money go?

529
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,780
The food is so bad.

530
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,500
If you tell the truth about Nan Heng,

531
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,420
I will tell you everything.

532
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,820
Not to mention the pig,

533
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,740
the pig is worth it.

534
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,020
You and I both know

535
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,260
Nan Heng is with Ye Youshen.

536
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,540
He must have a good intention.

537
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,660
He left you in this prison

538
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,460
to get rid of your son.

539
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,860
But you killed him.

540
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,100
Why?

541
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,980
General Chu,

542
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,500
I want to make a deal with you.

543
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,420
What deal?

544
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,380
If you tell me

545
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,380
all the bad things that Chan Jiangyue did,

546
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,220
I will tell you

547
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,860
the crimes of Nan Heng and Ye Youshen.

548
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,180
What do you think?

549
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,260
I can't tell you.

550
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,420
What?

551
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,220
For you,

552
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,540
Chan Jiangyue and Ye Youshen

553
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,900
are both the biggest evils.

554
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,380
You should be able to

555
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,980
make up for all the bad things.

556
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,460
I need time to investigate

557
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,060
the case of Chan Jiangyue and Ye Youshen.

558
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,020
It's okay. I'll give you time to investigate.

559
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,580
If you can find out one thing,

560
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,820
I will take it.

561
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,380
Nan Heng caused you to die.

562
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,460
You still don't know the good or bad.

563
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,220
Did Nan Heng harm me?

564
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,860
Nan Heng didn't take me to prison.

565
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,100
General Chu,

566
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,660
you are the reason

567
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,380
why I can only be here to make a proposal.

568
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,420
You and I both know

569
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,180
that Nan Heng didn't end well.

570
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,940
I believed twice

571
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,780
that my aunt and father died.

572
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,380
This time,

573
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,580
it's your turn.

574
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,700
Have you checked

575
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,740
the truth of the case of the empress

576
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,420
and the battle of Pingrong?

577
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,140
The late empress died in autumn.

578
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,500
That day,

579
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,900
Nan Heng led the palace

580
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,780
to the place where the assassins were ambushed.

581
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,980
I sent a letter to the Black Armor Army

582
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,860
who was guarding Youcheng

583
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,140
at the battle of Pingrong.

584
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,620
But until the gate was broken,

585
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,700
20,000 guards of Qianyu Army were all killed.

586
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,500
Nan Heng didn't come either.

587
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,820
Have you asked him

588
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,780
about the truth of the case?

589
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,540
Who in the world would admit that

590
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,020
they killed people?

591
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,620
But there are many truths

592
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,060
hidden in the water.

593
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,620
What you think

594
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,380
may not be true.

595
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,420
There is no good or bad

596
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,540
in the first place.

597
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,060
Okay.

598
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,860
Then in your opinion,

599
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,340
why did Nan Heng run the Cangjiang Yue?

600
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,460
Why did he take in

601
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,380
King Slaughter's Men hoped them

602
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:58,900
with wayward weapons in called the Slaver'sーン Men

603
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,820
besides offering etc as a reward for climbed on his head?

604
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,380
dreaming of the Arashiyalu

605
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,740
took the sword and shot Identus

606
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,380
and caught theique

607
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,820
for the foreign technology.

608
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,340
discutin in 가로의 종목

609
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,580
Unlike Nan Heng,

610
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,580
Tell me, is this something that a person should do?

611
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,580
Don't deliberately force others to save the stars.

612
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,580
Nan Heng's actions are also in the wrong place.

613
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,580
From what I know, after the battle of Ping Rong,

614
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:29,580
you and your cousin are no longer Nan Heng's opponent.

615
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:35,580
Nan Heng is just a person who has never been trusted by anyone.

616
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:40,580
Maybe what he wants is just a group of friends,

617
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,580
a family,

618
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,580
a kind of feeling that makes him feel that he is really being trusted.

619
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,580
If I knew Nan Heng,

620
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,580
I mean if,

621
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,580
then he would definitely not be the kind of person you say

622
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,580
who can plan to kill the Empress at the age of nine.

623
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,580
He would definitely not be the kind of person who wants to take over the military,

624
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,580
let the army die,

625
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,580
and make the land fall into the enemy's hands.

626
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,580
So, you don't need to interrogate me anymore.

627
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,580
I am willing to die to atone for my sins.

628
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,580
To die to atone for your sins?

629
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,580
You admit that you are guilty?

630
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,580
My sin is that this Black Star Second Master

631
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,580
is not being happy.

632
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,580
I can't count the lives,

633
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,580
I can't even count the old memories.

634
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,580
The wind and snow are all over my body.

635
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:45,580
You have saved me from death so desperately.

636
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:49,580
May I ask what value do I have?

637
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,580
I have investigated you.

638
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,580
You are not only a thief,

639
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,580
but also a lazy person.

640
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,580
You often do things that are easy to do.

641
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,580
Are you trying to humiliate me by saving me?

642
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,580
But you are very good at managing things.

643
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:08,580
So, I plan to build a meeting hall here.

644
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,580
You will be the one to manage it.

645
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,580
The management hall is just a cover.

646
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,580
I want you to collect information in the capital,

647
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,580
listen to the secret documents of the officials,

648
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,580
and train a person named Ye You Shen

649
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,580
to use his power as his own.

650
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,580
Do you understand?

651
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,580
It's really dirty.

652
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,580
Fine.

653
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,580
But you made me do so many dangerous things.

654
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,580
You have to pay more.

655
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,580
You want to start a war?

656
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,580
I tell you,

657
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,580
doing things for me

658
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,580
is your only job now.

659
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,580
What if I don't agree?

660
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,580
Then I believe

661
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,580
someone will come to collect your body tomorrow.

662
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,580
If I expose my identity,

663
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,580
I will be pardoned.

664
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,580
It makes sense.

665
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,580
Why didn't I think of it?

666
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,580
You are so smart, Master.

667
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,580
You thought of it at once.

668
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,580
You can still get along with people

669
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,580
when you are in a state of self-restraint.

670
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,580
You are so smart.

671
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,580
You can still get along with people when you are in a state of self-restraint.

672
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,580
You are so smart.

673
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,580
You can still get along with people when you are in a state of self-restraint.

674
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,580
Let go of Song Yi Meng.

675
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,580
Let go of me.

676
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,580
I am a unlucky beauty.

677
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,580
Look at him.

678
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,580
I am a lucky beauty.

679
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,580
I am a lucky beauty.

680
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,580
I am a lucky beauty.

681
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,580
I am a lucky beauty.

682
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,580
I am a lucky beauty.

683
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,580
I am a lucky beauty.

684
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,580
I am a lucky beauty.

685
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,580
I am a lucky beauty.

686
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,580
I am a lucky beauty.

687
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,580
I am a lucky beauty.

688
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,580
I am a lucky beauty.

689
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,580
I am a lucky beauty.

690
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,580
I am a lucky beauty.

691
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,580
I am a lucky beauty.

692
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,580
I am a lucky beauty.

693
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,580
I am a lucky beauty.

694
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,580
I am a lucky beauty.

695
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,580
I am a lucky beauty.

696
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,580
I am a lucky beauty.

697
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,580
In a time of danger,

698
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,580
a man would be used to save another man.

699
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,580
In a time of danger,

700
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,580
I'm sorry.

701
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,580
I'm sorry.

702
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,580
I'm sorry.

703
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,580
I'm sorry.

704
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,580
I'm sorry.

705
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,580
I'm sorry.

706
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,580
I'm sorry.

707
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,580
I'm sorry.

708
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,580
I'm sorry.

709
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,580
I'm sorry.

710
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,580
I'm sorry.

711
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,580
I'm sorry.

712
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,580
I'm sorry.

713
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,580
I'm sorry.

714
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,580
I'm sorry.

715
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,580
I'm sorry.

716
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,580
I'm sorry.

717
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,580
I'm sorry.

718
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,580
I'm sorry.

719
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,580
I'm sorry.

720
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,580
I'm sorry.

721
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,580
I'm sorry.

722
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,580
I'm sorry.

723
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,580
I'm sorry.

724
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,580
I'm sorry.

725
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,580
I'm sorry.

726
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,580
I'm sorry.

727
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,580
I'm sorry.

728
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,580
