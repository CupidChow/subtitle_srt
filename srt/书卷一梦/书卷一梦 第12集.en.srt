[Episode 12]

3
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,430
Hold it straight.

4
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,350
Understood.

5
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,800
You, a wanderer with a mysterious past,

6
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,590
have meddled in court affairs
time and again.

7
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,120
What exactly are you after?

8
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,780
What do you think

9
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,760
my intentions are, General Chu?

10
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,190
I don't know.

11
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,800
But if

12
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,850
Yimeng is also your target...

13
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,370
I advise you

14
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,390
to give up that idea right now.

15
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,750
You, the mighty Lieutenant General
of the Qianyu Army,

16
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,079
think about things like that all day long.

17
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,810
No wonder Miss Song
keeps her distance from you.

18
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,540
My relationship with Yimeng

19
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,079
is none of your concern.

20
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,430
I have no interest

21
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,910
in your personal affairs.

22
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,840
But let me remind you.

23
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,560
What Miss Song cares about most right now

24
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,310
is the South City renovation

25
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,160
and addressing
the people's pressing needs.

26
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,960
That's why you're putting on

27
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,390
a hero's act

28
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,020
to help with the renovation?

29
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,050
Dealing with Nan Heng

30
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,870
and getting involved in the assassination

31
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,070
are just your tricks to win Yimeng over.

32
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,780
So that's what you think.

33
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
Then why don't we

34
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,710
make a bet?

35
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,210
Let's see

36
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,900
who can restore the South City

37
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,130
better and faster.

38
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,310
But if you lose,

39
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,350
you call off the engagement.

40
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,910
This is ridiculous.

41
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,730
Marriage is a union between two families.

42
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,130
Why should I bet with you?

43
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,720
Because

44
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,400
there are 61 damaged houses

45
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,590
and 347 displaced people in South City.

46
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,560
Though the court has allocated funds

47
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,190
to finish repairs
before the Beginning of Spring,

48
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,910
both the money and manpower

49
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,880
fall far short.

50
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,100
You'll need help
from the Waning River Crescent.

51
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,840
Otherwise,

52
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,690
when Nan Heng uses this against you,

53
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,630
what will you do then?

54
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,770
As for the renovation,

55
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,120
I'm willing to
let the Waning River Crescent take part.

56
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,560
But I hope you understand

57
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,950
that this renovation affects
the lives of people in the capital.

58
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,950
It's not something
you can bluff your way through

59
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,240
with cheap tricks
from the martial arts world.

60
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,070
If I find out you have ulterior motives,

61
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,159
you won't

62
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,190
get off so easily this time.

63
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,360
Also,

64
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,240
no matter what happens,

65
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,330
I will never use my marriage with Yimeng

66
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,870
as a bargaining chip.

67
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,430
Miss Song,

68
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,870
please calm down.

69
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,050
Look at you,

70
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,800
waving around some worthless thing
like it's supposed to scare me.

71
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,330
Your master

72
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,630
already tried threatening me with a knife
to force some half-baked romance,

73
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,430
and now you're pulling the same trick.

74
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,720
Since when did we even have
a romance storyline?

75
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,190
Who gave you the right
to just make stuff up?

76
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,510
No, Miss Song,

77
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,870
I'm just...

78
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,510
I'm begging you, alright?

79
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,190
I finally landed the job.

80
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:29,870
Can you please explain

81
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,160
what all those strange terms

82
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,430
actually mean?

83
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,760
Please, I'm begging you.

84
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,870
Please.

85
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,930
We're all just trying to make a living.

86
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,750
You've got it tough too.

87
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,470
Go back and tell your master.

88
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,600
If he has questions,
he can come ask me himself.

89
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,430
Stop giving
the supporting cast a hard time.

90
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,680
No, Miss Song,

91
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,360
I was so foolish.

92
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,870
I didn't realize
how kind and beautiful you truly are.

93
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,750
Can you just tell me

94
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,720
who's really behind all this?

95
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,630
Are you trying to sweet-talk me?

96
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,430
No.

97
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,570
Sweet talk won't work on me.

98
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,450
I've already told your master

99
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,270
that the assassination was my doing alone.

100
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,670
No one else was involved.

101
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,680
This isn't about the assassination.

102
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,810
It's about the fire.

103
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,600
What's the real story behind it?

104
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,750
Tell me, please.

105
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,950
Well...

106
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,500
If you really want to know,

107
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
I'll tell you.

108
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,530
It was honestly a coincidence,

109
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,510
part of the plot.

110
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,510
I'm not lying to you.

111
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,270
Really.

112
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,070
I get it.

113
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,760
We're not that close yet,

114
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,960
so you can't open up.

115
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,560
Alright then,

116
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,160
if I badmouth the Seventh Prince,

117
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,870
does that earn me a spot on your side?

118
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,930
Listen carefully.

119
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,750
The Seventh Prince

120
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,270
brings ruin upon
men of loyalty and virtue.

121
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:36,950
He's

122
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,150
cold and ruthless.

123
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,070
Honestly, he's a complete idiot.

124
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,330
The Seventh Prince isâ€”

125
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,090
Isn't that Fugui,
the one who works for Nan Heng?

126
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,680
Let's beat him up first.

127
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,450
Mr. Li.

128
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,280
Mr. Li.

129
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,000
Everyone around Nan Heng is scheming.

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You should leave now.

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,659
Don't get involved with them.

132
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Go back and keep your mouth shut.

133
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,120
Don't tell Nan Heng you saw him here.

134
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,560
Otherwise, I'll spread every word

135
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,000
you just said

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,210
about the Seventh Prince.

137
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,330
If we die, we die together.

138
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,660
No one gets to walk away.

139
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,270
Come on.

Mr. Li.

156
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,360
I've sent Shangguan back.

157
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,560
I noticed he washes his hands
after every task.

158
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,390
His skin's practically rubbed raw.

159
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,720
So I let him go.

Alright.

161
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,520
Thank you for your help.

162
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,740
What's wrong with you?

163
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,320
Are you in a bad mood?

164
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,290
Did Chu Guihong bully you?

165
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,510
He bullied me?

166
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,150
Do you really see me as that weak?

167
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,440
When it was Nan Heng,
you tried to protect me.

168
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,480
When it was Chu Guihong,

169
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,840
you did the same.

170
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,120
Even with Fugui just now,

171
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,440
you still stepped in for me.

172
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,200
I...

173
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,440
You...

174
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,930
You might be a hero,

175
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,530
but you're still a supporting character.

176
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,630
I've got plot armor,

177
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,690
so I should be the one protecting you.

178
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,150
Plot armor?

179
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,240
What's that?

180
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,550
It's...

181
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,080
This thing.

182
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,870
This.

183
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,080
There you go.

184
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,700
Now you've got one too.

185
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,030
Thank you all for your hard work.

186
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,720
Come on, food's ready.

187
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,030
Thank you so much.

188
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,080

189
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,150
Thank you so much.

190
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,150
Come and get it.

191
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,320
Take more, please.

192
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,390
Sure thing!

193
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,090
Look at these people from South City.

194
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,890
They probably don't even

195
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,550
get to live a full life in this world.

196
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,200
That day, the fire

197
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,870
was burning for real.

198
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,280
If it weren't for you, Mr. Li,

199
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,570
they might have died just like that.

200
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,140
However, a protagonist like Nan Heng

201
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,720
only cares about power and schemes.

202
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,920
The people's lives mean nothing to him.

203
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,410
All he wants is to outmatch Nan Rui,

204
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,780
even if it means sacrificing
everything the people have,

205
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,480
including their lives.

206
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,380

207
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,230

208
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,710
Nan Heng?

209
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Just because he's the protagonist?

210
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,940
You keep talking about protagonists

211

212
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,900
but I still don't get what that means.

213
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,910
I want to help you change everything

214
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,910
and stand with you against Nan Heng.

215
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,120
But I can't do that

216
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,120
if I don't even understand
what you're saying.

217
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,000
So, Miss Song,

218
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,820
could you explain it to me?

219
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,690
I...

220
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,030
I...

221
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,200
I...

222
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,120
I understand.

223
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,170
When we're not that close,

224
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,970
some secrets are hard to share.

225
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,440
Miss Song, it seems

226
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,400
you still don't trust me.

227
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,920
That's not true, Mr. Li.

228
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,120
I do trust you.

229
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,880
It's just that

230
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,090
if I really told you everything,

231
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,400
you would be afraid of me.

232
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,320
Mr. Li.

233
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,200
You're the most important friend

234
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,900
I have in this world.

235
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,000
You're also the only one
who understands me

236
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,230
and trusts me.

237
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,790
Perhaps...

238
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,010
Perhaps you could even

239
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,720
change my fate.

240
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:52,750
So,

241
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,480
I really can't lose you.

242
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,030
I'm afraid to lose you.

243
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,110
Please let me keep this secret.

I don't have a name.

That's impossible.

Grandma says

263
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,650
those of us who live in South City

264
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,240
are all lower-class people.

265
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,630
Lower-class people don't need names.

what's your father's name?

What's wrong?

00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:38,960
Nothing.

287
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,130
So all these common people

288
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,000
don't have their own names.

289

I didn't know "Passerby"

290

00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,870
and inflicts suffering upon women.

344
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,240
He's a bad guy, you know?

345
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,630
He kills without even blinking.

346
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,150
Nan Heng has committed plenty of

347
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,900
wicked deeds over the years, hasn't he?

348
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,940
Nan Heng is a sinister villain.

349
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,020
However, a protagonist like Nan Heng

350
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,400
only cares about power and schemes.

351
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,600
The people's lives mean nothing to him.

352
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,680
Anyway,

353
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,220
he's not a good person.

354
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,630
Fugui!

355
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,870
Come in!

356
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,410
Your Highness.

357
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,360
Let me ask you.

358
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,390
Do you also think

359
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,510
I am a person who only cares about power

360
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,360
and ignores the lives of the people?

361
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,820
What do you mean by "also"?

362
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,520
No, it's impossible.

363
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,710
Your Highness

364
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,370
is known for your kindness

365
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,080
and warmthâ€”

366
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,270
truly a gentleman

367
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,090
and a great hero of the realm.

368
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,780
Do you really believe your own words?

369
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,270
Since you don't believe it yourself,

370
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,470
she certainly won't believe it either.

371
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,440
She?

372
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,750
Accompany me
to the Song Residence tomorrow.

373
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,150
I have questions for her.

374
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,640
Yes, Your Highness.

375
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,510
[Song Residence]

376
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,030
Twenty-five.

377
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,310
Sixteen,

378
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,270
seventeen.

379
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,910
We're short on timber lately.

380
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,470
To keep the project on schedule,

381
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,070
we need to use materials sparingly.

382
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,960
Remember, you twoâ€”

383
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,270
everything here must be properly sorted

384
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,590
and counted once a day,

385
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,110
and any shortages reported right away.

386
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,720
That's how we avoid mistakes.

387
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,590
My Lady, you're impressive!

388
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,330
I'm just helping Mr. Li.

389
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,920
He's done so much for the people,

390
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,440
so I should do my part too,

391
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,160
right?

392
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,010
What are you doing here?

393
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,480
Is this how you treat

394
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,920
the person who saved you

395
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,180
from being charged with assassination?

396
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,790
Your Highness,

397
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,590
mind your gentlemanly conduct.

398
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,080
I need to speak with Miss Song alone.

399
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,640
Both of you, leave now.

400
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,250
Your Highness,

401
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,480
th-they don't know anything.

402
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,800
Please don't frighten them.

403
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,680
Besides,

404
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,270
what is it

405
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,200
that cannot be said in their presence?

406
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,800
Why must we speak in private?

407
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,960
Miss Song,

408
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,430
His Highness suggests

409
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,720
it might be a bit stuffy in here

410
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,880
and perhaps the ladies
would appreciate some fresh air.

411
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,680
Ladies,

412
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,590
please.

413
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,070
It's quite stuffy in here.

414
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,800
I need to get some fresh air too.

415
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,770
What are you doing?

416
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,760
First question:

417
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,610
To you,

418
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,600
what kind of person am I?

419
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,160
A truly admirable person.

420
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,920
I want you to tell the truth.

421
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,290
How is that not the truth?

422
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,160
Even though Your Highness
has tried to kill me

423
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,030
so many times,

424
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,630
you always let me walk away.

425
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,310
Such magnanimity,
rare even among top celebrities,

426
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,250
combined with your remarkable foresightâ€”

427
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,180
you're truly an admirable person.

428
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,750
Fine.

429
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,420
Then the second question:

430
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,860
What is a "top celebrity"?

431
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,080
What does "protagonist" mean?

432
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,410
And what is this

433
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,810
"script" you speak of?

434
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,710
Everyone keeps asking me these questions.

435
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,160
I-I really feel suffocated.

436
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,680
I really need to go out and breathe

437
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,070
some fresh air.

438
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,200
I've searched through
all the books in the Wenyuan Library

439
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,680
and questioned
all the scholars in the Hanlin Academy,

440
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,740
yet no one knows anything about this.

441
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,080
I was just saying it casually.

442
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,790
Your Highness, seriously,

443
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,440
why do you bother
remembering such trivial things?

444
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,840
Just saying it casually?

445
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,310
Once is fine,

446
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,510
but what about twice?

447
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,350
Three times?

448
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,790
Four times? Five times?

449
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
You once said I was the protagonist.

450
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,310
Now you're calling me a top celebrity.

451
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,110
You also mentioned that everything

452
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,510
between us is part of some script rule.

453
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,110
What does all that mean?

454
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,070
Did I...

455
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,870
Did I say that?

456
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,310
Song Yimeng.

457
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,600
I'm begging you to tell me

458
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,510
what you're hiding from me.

459
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,510
Your Highness,

460
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,240
do you have any manners at all?

461
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,400
How can you be so rude to a girl?

462
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,510
Fine,

463
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,990
I'll tell you today.

464
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,880
A top celebrity
is someone with top traffic,

465
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,240
and a script
is the foundation of a show.

466
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,590
You, who only knows how to
use force when facing problems,

467
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,070
who hasn't even learned basic

468
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,790
English vocabulary,

469
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,510
do you understand?

470
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,440
Do you understand?

471
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,500
Do you understand?

472
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,050
You don't understand.

473
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,310
Not only do you not understand,

474
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,400
you kill without remorse,

475
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,270
you slaughter the innocent.

476
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,110
You don't really want to know

477
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,440
what the real script is about.

478
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,920
You just think I know more than you,

479
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,480
you think I'm hiding everything from you.

480
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,480
You want to control everyone,

481
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,790
but you don't trust anyone.

482
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,640
Am I right,

483
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,500
Your Highness?

484
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,200
Have I successfully mind-controlled him?

485
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,310
Fine,

486
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,830
you're right about everything.

487
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,890
I did use force against you before,

488
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,060
but let me tell you.

489
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,940
Apart from this matter,

490
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,300
I have never killed innocent people.

491
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,270
I don't trust anyone,

492
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,510
because no one has ever trusted me,

493
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,750
not even you.

494
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,160
I...

495
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,500
You should know that

496
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,590
things in this world

497
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,210
are not what
they appear to be on the surface.

498
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,760
What people say
isn't necessarily the truth.

499
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,830
On the battlefield,

500
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,270
it's kill or be killed.

501
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,240
In the imperial court,

502
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,450
it's even more
dangerous than the frontier.

503
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,710
If I don't fight desperately to survive,

504
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,910
then I'll be the one driven to a dead end.

505
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,500
Song Yimeng.

506
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,720
If

507
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,800
you truly want to understand me,

508
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,440
don't use your eyes.

509
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,870
Who wants to understand you?

510
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,050
Everyone present here

511
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,550
is an expert in weapon forging.

512
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,720
Our Chief Master has gone to great lengths

513
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,850
to invite you all from the Huai region,

514
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,360
spending several days,

515
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,100
yet there's been no progress.

516
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,630
You're making it
very difficult for me to explain.

517
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,970
Mr. Shangguan,

518
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,360
it's not that we're incompetent.

519
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,880
The blades you want
must be forged from fine steel,

520
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,920
but nowadays all the quality iron mines

521
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,550
are under imperial control.

522
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,550
To forge steel blades from ordinary iron,

523
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,880
that's... that's simply impossible!

524
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,310
Indeed.

525
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,960
So if I provide you with fine iron,

526
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,290
you could forge it then?

527
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,160
Sir, what you don't know is

528
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,110
the fine iron needs to be tempered

529
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,640
before it can become steel.

530
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,110
And this tempering method

531
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,920
is known only to Lord Qianyu.

532
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,350
In my youth,

533
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,070
I was fortunate enough
to apprentice in the Qianyu Army

534
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,800
under a blade-forging master.

535
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,350
Even though he served
in the army for decades,

536
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,680
he never obtained Lord Qianyu's formula.

537
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,590
So...

538
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,960
In the end, you still can't forge it.

539
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,110
Guards! Take them away.

540
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,110
Move along.

541
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
What should we do?

542
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,460
We'll have to target the Qianyu Army.

543
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,510
Go to the South City
and tell the Chief Master

544
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,310
that our mission remains unaccomplished,

545
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,480
and we need to find
another way through Chu Guihong.

546
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,270
Yes.

547
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,380
Bravo! Bravo!

548
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,200
Bravo! Bravo!

549
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,270
General,

550
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,480
what are they doing over there?

551
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,400
Are they here to help
or just cause trouble?

552
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,030
Chattering all day long,

553
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,270
they're clearly
disrupting military discipline.

554
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,510
Let them do their thing,

555
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,720
we'll do ours.

556
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,880
Only by completing this before next month

557
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,110
can we help His Majesty

558
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,000
and His Highness

559
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,330
put their minds at ease.

560
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,350
General,

561
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,590
the Waning River Crescent

562
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,390
is full of riffraff.

563
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,400
When it comes to speed,

564
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,050
we really can't compete with them.

565
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,180
When the time comes,

566
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,680
you won't really break off
your engagement with Miss Song, will you?

567
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,210
That's none of your business.

568
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,670
Focus on your own duties.

569
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:15,640
Let's go.

570
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,560
Give it to me,

571
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,910
give it back!

572
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,220
Over there.

573
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,520
I have no strength at all now.

574
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,610
It's a five-strand hemp rope.

575
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,090
Remove one strand from inside,

576
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,890
and the rope loses its strength.

577
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,510
From the outside,

578
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,880
it's hard to notice.

579
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,440
Come on,

580
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,100
let's do it.

581
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,070
Ronghua.

582
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,610
If the General finds out about this...

583
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,070
Then let him beat me.

584
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,440
It's better than
letting his beloved Miss Song

585
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,700
be snatched away by that street ruffian.

586
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,350
Haven't you noticed lately

587
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,160
that Miss Song

588
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,890
keeps coming to the South City?

589
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,550
When has she ever come to see our General?

590
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,270
Every time,

591
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,570
she's only here to see that ruffian.

592
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,590
Let me tell you,

593
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,520
if you're my brother,

594
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,900
then help me with this.

595
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,840
The Second Master says so...

596
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,510
Understood.

597
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,630
Go back and tell Shangguan He

598
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,720
not to act rashly.

599
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,590
Yes, sir.

600
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,000
There's something wrong with the rope.

601
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,550
Someone has tampered with the rope.

602
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,310
If you keep fighting me,
the building will collapse.

603
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,830
Don't tell me your men did this.

604
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,160
I had no idea about this.

605
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,000
You were sneaking around just now.

606
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,160
What are you scheming this time?

607
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,310
The guilty party accuses first.

608
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,920
You came to
South City with ulterior motives.

609
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,880
If you don't explain yourself,

610
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,720
I won't let you stay any longer.

611
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
You talk about morality and righteousness,

612
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,200
but your actions are despicable.

613
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,130
You're the one who shouldn't stay.

614
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,720
The Qianyu Army's bruise medicine

615
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,820
works wonders.

616
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,960
Thanks.

617
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,510
Most people think this pill

618
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,590
is taken orally,

619
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,790
yet you know
the Qianyu Army's method of application.

620
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,870
What's so special about that?

621
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,170
This medicine

622
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,510
is sold everywhere in the black market.

623
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,550
Military supplies

624
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,600
have somehow leaked into the black market,

625
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,000
and my subordinates
have disregarded my orders.

626
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,680
My family's legacy has come to this,

627
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,000
how ridiculous.

628
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,480
Wait,

629
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,400
aren't you afraid it might be poisoned?

630
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,270
You wouldn't dare.

631
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,310
If I were poisoned to death,

632
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,070
your entire Waning River Crescent

633
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,270
would go down with me.

634
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,260
It's wine?

635
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,030
What,

636
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,830
is carrying wine

637
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,200
a crime too?

638
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,480
Why are you speaking with such sarcasm?

639
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,720
Look who's talking,

640
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,530
you're no better yourself.

641
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,750
If you weren't genuinely concerned
for the people of South City,

642
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,280
you wouldn't have
gone to such lengths today.

643
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,640
I've had many
misunderstandings about you before,

644
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,440
but today

645
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,540
I'll tentatively
believe you're a good person.

646
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,680
Then I must thank you

647
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,660
for your tentative trust.

648
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,550
There you go again.

649
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,200
About the rope incident,

650
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,150
the Qianyu Army wronged you,

651
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,200
I owe you a favor.

652
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,910
What can I do to repay you?

653
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,900
The method of weapon forging,

654
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,040
can you share it?

655
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,690
Coveting the method of weapon forging

656
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:07,750
is a serious crime.

657
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,850
Qianyu Army's sharp weapons

658
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,110
are meant to protect Great Jing,

659
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,160
but is Great Jing

660
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,240
only protected by your Qianyu Army?

661
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,670
I wonder if this method

662
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,240
were shared among all military forces,

663
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,000
how many soldiers
at the border would be saved?

664
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,450
Perhaps

665
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,600
in the Pingrong Battle,

666
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,610
many lives could have been spared.

667
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,650
I understand what you're saying,

668
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,370
but if this method

669
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,350
falls into the wrong hands,

670
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,750
then

671
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,590
how many people

672
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,750
would die needlessly because of it?

673
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,160
The person with
ulterior motives you're referring to

674
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,220
is Nan Heng, right?

675
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,270
In any case,

676
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,140
he's not a good person.

677
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,850
You needn't investigate
the method of weapon forging anymore.

678
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,040
My father is dead,

679
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,110
and there will never be

680
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,040
any truth about this secret again.

681
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,449
Since we're talking about Nan Heng,

682
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:25,120
I have a few questions

683
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,510
I'd like to ask you.

684
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,909
What questions?

685
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,080
That first time we met,

686
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,500
when I brought people
to investigate the Waning River Crescent,

687
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,030
why were you so prepared?

688
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,800
Did you perhaps get information

689
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,230
from Nan Heng in advance?

690
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:42,820
Why would I need
help from others for this?

691
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:45,000
Everyone at Waning River Crescent
is a person of the martial arts world,

692
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,320
from all walks of life.

693
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,590
Every day we're living with our heads

694
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,150
on the chopping block.

695
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,170
Don't you think I'd
at least get this bit of information?

696
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,400
You came marching in broad daylight

697
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,460
with the Qianyu Army to investigate.

698
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,620
If I couldn't
get this information in advance,

699
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,900
how would we
Nightwalkers at Waning River Crescent

700
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,460
have survived until today?

701
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:04,960
Fine.

702
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,560
Even if what you say makes sense,

703
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,460
the three of us clearly agreed

704
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,460
to assassinate Nan Heng together.

705
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,480
So why weren't you there

706
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,700
that night?

707
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:19,670
Fine.

708
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,190
I admit it.

709
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,340
I was scared, okay?

710
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,590
You and Miss Song are both

711
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,480
children of high officials.

712
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,230
Me? I'm just a nobody
from the martial arts world.

713
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,230
Assassinating a prince is something

714
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,210
that could easily cost me my head.

715
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,910
Couldn't I have a backup plan?

716
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,490
Besides, don't forget that

717
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:39,130
if I hadn't been cautious,

718
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,770
you, General Chu, would have

719
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,970
arrested me that day.

720
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,010
I finally understand now.

721
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,280
You still

722
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,110
don't trust me.

723
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,800
But think about it.

724
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:02,020
I'm just a nobody
from the martial arts world.

725
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,750
Why would a prince
conspire with someone like me?

726
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,880
Besides,

727
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,710
if you don't trust me, General Chu,

728
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,400
how could Nan Heng trust me?

729
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:11,810
Tell me,

730
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,670
could he?

731
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,510
I see that you

732
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,800
were born into a noble family,

733
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,030
sheltered from reality.

734
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,920
You think everything

735
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,150
is much simpler than it actually is.

736
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,150
Once,

737
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,410
I had a friend who

738
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,450
told me the same thing.

739
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,220
He said I was naive

740
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,090
and thought everything was too simple

741
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:55,960
I didn't realize

742
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,150
haste makes waste

743
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,020
and true strength comes through trials.

744
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,570
[19 years ago]

745
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,280
Oh dear!

746
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,040
Are you hurt?

747
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,700
What should we do now?

748
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,540
This...

749
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,270
Bruise medicine.

750
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,630
Gao family's secret recipe.

751
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,440
Want some?

752
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:27,350
â™ª I leave the book aside,
though I haven't finished reading it â™ª

753
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,970
This is for external use only,
not to be taken orally.

754
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:36,350
â™ª I know one day I can have
a glimpse of the ending â™ª

755
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,840
Give me your hand.

756
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,540
You're that prince from the Gao family, aren't you?

757
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,870
My name is Chu Guihong.

758
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,740
â™ª Life is unpredictable â™ª

759
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,130
I know they don't
let you ride horses in the palace.

760
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,010
From now on, my horse is your horse.

761
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,480
â™ª Who can get rid of perplexity â™ª

762
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,550
I won't ride your horse for nothing.

763
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:53,060
â™ª And find the answer he yearns for? â™ª

764
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,070
I'll tell you the secret medicine formula.

765
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,590
That's great!

766
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,150
I want to give it to my father,

767
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,590
so the soldiers of the Qianyu Army

768
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,240
can all use this miracle medicine.

769
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,230
If the wind changes my past

770

Your riding skills are really impressive.

771
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,650
Teach me, please.

772
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,920
If you write about me

773
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,480
No.

774
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,020
I'll call you big brother.

775
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:05,920
Still no.

776
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,450
I'll call you master.

No.

779
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,110
I'll give you the Qianyu Military Manual.

780
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:11,920
Do you want it?

781
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:18,240
Let the moonlight see how many lines I love you

782
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,030
Let me run against the south wall

[This attack is invincible]

784
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:30,360
Even if it's destiny, it doesn't matter to me

785
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,590
Here.

786
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,840
Don't ever tell anyone

787
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,440
that I taught you how to ride.

788
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:52,880
â™ª People's demeanor varies
in this world of hustle and bustle â™ª

789
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,230
Will I never learn to ride properly?

790
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,510
One fall from a horse

791
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,800
is nothing to be afraid of.

792
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,590
Even those battle-hardened generals

793
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,100
know that even good riders fall sometimes.

794
00:38:55,990 --> 00:39:02,340
â™ª Are they all bound by
destiny at the same time? â™ª

795
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,530
But I'm learning so slowly,

796
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,140
you've been teaching me
for almost half a month now.

797
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:08,950
â™ª A simple move can lead to
multiple major changes â™ª

798
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,040
You're inexperienced,

799
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
thinking many things
are simpler than they are,

800

â™ª Who can find out the truth? â™ª

Steel is forged
through a hundred refinements.

803

â™ª Is it a bluff or a real match? â™ª

804
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,530

00:42:59,350 --> 00:42:59,980
Father.

849
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,540
[Empress Chu Yurong]

850
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,110
Let me carry you.

851
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,370
Let's go.

852
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:26,800
Heng, when we return to the palace today,

853
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,880
ride in my carriage.

854
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,590
Come.

855
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:42,950
Come.

856
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:48,840
What are you doing?

857
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,480
That's the right expression.

858
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,560
When I was your age,

859
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,630
I would constantly
pester my father and brother

860
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,050
to go horse racing and hunting,

861
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:00,510
having the time of my life.

862
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,950
If you carry too many worries,

863
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,410
you'll age quickly,

864
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:05,900
and once you're old,

865
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,780
you can never return to your youth.

866
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,010
His Majesty is

867
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,050
still so childish despite his age.

868
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,330
He's not ignoring you

869
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,260
because he's just
competing with Chancellor Gao.

870
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:25,910
Eat up.

871
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,170
When you're done,

872
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,280
I'll take you hunting for

873
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,540
an even bigger rabbit.

874
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,210
We can make

875
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,700
a warm scarf
for your mother, how about that?

876
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,590
This path doesn't lead to the palace.

877
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,220
Mother brought me here

878
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,070
to catch rabbits.

879
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:21,030
You're lying!

880
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,400
Are you going to eat or not?

881
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:28,370
[Cold Palace]

882
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,670
If not, you'll starve.

883
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:28,480
Come out.

884
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:29,480
Leave us.

885
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,280
Yes.

886
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:32,510
Open the door.

887
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,410
Where are the things I gave you?

888
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,200
Give them back to me.

889
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,180
Give them back!

890
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,640
I burned them.

891
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,280
Wait.

892
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,520
I didn't kill your aunt,

893
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:09,730
do you believe me?

894
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,890
So you and Chu Guihong

895
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,710
have such a history together,

896
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,280
how fascinating.

897
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:32,740
Those who abandon me and disturb my heart

898
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,250
are all obstacles,

899
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,070
not to be longed for.

900
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,680
Didn't you two

901
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,000
just reconcile?

902
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,070
What reconciliation?

903
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,310
Even if we patch things up temporarily,

904
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,110
we'll end up as strangers again.

905
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:56,690
Besides, the one on the throne

906
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,230
constantly reminds me:

907
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,360
when two tigers fight, one must perish.

908
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:04,590
If I don't win,

909
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:07,920
then I can only die.
