00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But who told Song Yi Meng to refuse to cooperate with me to finish the plot?

10
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I said Nan Hao, just listen to me

11
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If you want to save your life, you should follow the rules of the script world

12
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If I am a person who follows the rules, why are you here?

13
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The world is still so hard

14
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Xue Ying, I will tell you the truth

15
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If you still want to turn the plot around, you will die in less than a month

16
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Then think about how I will hurt Song Yi Meng

17
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Or just wait until you die

18
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Chu Ke Huo, do you know who you are protecting?

19
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The person who can help me return to the capital is my father

20
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If he is your father, how can he be such a star?

21
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You are so happy

22
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Everyone will only believe in what is good for them, I am no exception

23
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You taught me that the bad guys in the eyes of the world will be praised for every good thing

24
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Now Song Yi Meng and Shang Guan He's marriage is over

25
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The person who will make this marriage beautiful is my father

26
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And you will only be a dying loser

27
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Father, the wind is blowing

28
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let's go back

29
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Go

30
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You

31
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I have told Rong Hua to investigate it clearly

32
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That day, my father died under the sword of He Yuan people, there is no possibility of him being alive

33
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Tell me, who are you?

34
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Who is the producer? Who is the writer?

35
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Who am I?

36
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Xiang, did you see that?

37
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Ting and her husband have been married for so long, even her uncle has no other choice

38
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But when I went out, he just knocked on the door

39
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It seems that I am really a god of painting

40
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If you feel sad, you can not talk

41
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why are you like this?

42
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You, you, you, you, see, see, see, see, see, see

43
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I see you are not talking

44
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
18th prince

45
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Ting Ting, how did you know?

46
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How did you come out?

47
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Just now in the river, why did you help me?

48
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Ting Ting, although this time it was my uncle looking for help, I was also thinking about myself

49
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Actually, these days, I have thought a lot

50
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
If I keep bothering you, I really don't want to eat sweet meat

51
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What do you mean by this?

52
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Ting Ting, you are the best woman in our capital

53
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No, you are the best woman in our capital

54
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You are the best woman in our capital

55
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You have your own opinion

56
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You dare to do things that are against the common sense

57
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But me, I am a person who only knows to hide behind my father

58
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
There is no stupid person

59
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Whether it's knowledge or business, I don't jump

60
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
How can I match you?

61
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Actually, I figured it out

62
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Finally, I sincerely wish you and Brother He can have a good result

63
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I accept your blessing

64
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's just that you shouldn't be so arrogant

65
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The achievement of knowledge and business is not the only standard of measuring men

66
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Just like we shouldn't use gentle and virtuous marriage to measure women

67
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You are born in the royal family, but you are pure and kind

68
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Not everyone can do this

69
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You are bright and honest

70
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
These are the same as the achievement of knowledge

71
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The same precious and valuable

72
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So in the future, you will definitely find a woman who is in love with you

73
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Ok

74
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Ok

75
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Tiantian

76
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
No, you say this is not because I am stupid

77
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Your Highness is not stupid at all

78
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Your Highness is ambitious

79
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You can take the initiative to reflect on yourself

80
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You have the chest of Hanna Baichuan

81
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You can give up hatred for more than ten years

82
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Calmly accept your brother to be the crown prince

83
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You can also use the heart of good will to fulfill your woman

84
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Not everyone can do these things

85
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yes, I know that I am still the chosen one

86
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The son of Xiangrui

87
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Tiantian

88
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Then you

89
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Would you like to be friends with me, the one who is very virtuous

90
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's my honor to be friends with you

91
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Ok

92
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The situation is like this

93
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
In the script world, Nan Heng is the male lead

94
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
In the end, he will kill the emperor and ascend the throne

95
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And you, the cannon man

96
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Nan Er

97
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
After he ascends the throne

98
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Will die under his sword

99
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
No bones

100
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
He did bad things

101
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Killed my father

102
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Seized my fiancee

103
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Finally stepped on me

104
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Why

105
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Who calls him the male lead

106
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Then me

107
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Why am I not Chu Ren Gong

108
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
How am I inferior to him

109
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You are not inferior to him

110
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Then

111
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Or this way

112
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Cooperate with me

113
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Finish the plot of Cheng Lou Er Xuan Yi

114
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
When I come back now

115
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I will change the Dian Jun

116
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Write you as the male lead

117
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So the father wanted to make a deal with his son

118
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Then you know what I want now

119
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Of course I know

120
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You just want to kill Nan Hang

121
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Help your cousin Nan Rui to ascend the throne

122
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Son wants Nan Heng to die, right

123
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But son wants to hold his fate in his own hands

124
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The world is big

125
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
No one can convince me

126
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You want to get the throne yourself

127
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What are you doing

128
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You don't come here

129
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What are you doing

130
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What are you doing

131
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
If father wants to make this deal with his son

132
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
After an hour

133
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Sign up for Wang Fu Jian

134
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
How can I go back if you leave

135
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Pervert

136
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Dead pervert

137
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I didn't write it in the script

138
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Heng Er Da Xiao suffered in the Cold Palace for many years

139
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And died on the battlefield for many years

140
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Now it's finally destined to come back from the border

141
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But the days of peace have not passed for a few days

142
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Why would this happen

143
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I have sent people to investigate

144
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Song Yu De said

145
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
When Song Fu's servants found him

146
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
He didn't believe it

147
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
There is no one else around

148
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Your Majesty

149
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Your Majesty

150
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The imperial physicians have rushed to the Eastern Palace to meet

151
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
They said that the crown prince had an emergency

152
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Qin Yuan Shou is giving the crown prince an injection

153
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
There will be results soon

154
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yes

155
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Don't worry

156
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Heng Er is used to the disease

157
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't worry

158
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Heng Er is always blessed

159
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It will definitely be better

160
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's useless for me to be a mother

161
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Let him die like this

162
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
In my life

163
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The most valuable thing is Heng Er

164
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I owe him

165
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's me

166
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's me

167
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Not you

168
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
How long do you want to hide from me

169
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You used to lie to me with two identities

170
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Now you are so badly hurt

171
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You still want to keep it from me

172
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You see me like a fool

173
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm worried about you

174
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Are you happy?

175
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Is it fun?

176
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I didn't

177
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Didn't I have two blows last time

178
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I didn't mean well

179
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You still want to hide from me

180
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Qin Yuan Shou said

181
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Your injury this time is different from last time

182
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Then I will tell you the truth

183
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's King Qianyu

184
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
King Qianyu

185
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
He asked you for help

186
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
He couldn't convince you, so he came to me

187
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
He saw that I was too stubborn to cooperate with him to complete the plot

188
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So he took the bait

189
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Want to threaten

190
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So you are poisoned

191
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What about the antidote?

192
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Is it in his hand?

193
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The antidote has been obtained

194
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It will be cured in a few days

195
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You

196
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Did you really get the antidote?

197
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You didn't lie to me

198
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
No

199
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I didn't lie to you

200
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I didn't lie to you

201
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
No, I have to find Qin Yuan Shou to confirm

202
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Come back

203
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The scriptwriter came here is a secret

204
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's not good to let too many people know

205
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Not to mention you think about it

206
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I am the male lead he wrote

207
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
How can he let me die easily

208
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
He just saw that I was not willing to cooperate with him to complete the plot

209
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So he just wants me to suffer

210
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So you just let him die

211
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
No

212
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Then you say

213
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
In the moon

214
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Why did he try to coordinate with A-Tian and Shang Guan He?

215
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Song Yi Ting married Shang Guan He

216
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Why did he try to coordinate with A-Tian and Shang Guan He?

217
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Why did he try to coordinate with A-Tian and Shang Guan He?

218
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Then you will suffer more from the counterattack of the hero

219
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Until your life is at stake

220
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Understand?

221
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I think he wants to pull Shang Guan He and Ye You Shen

222
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Then he will deal with me together

223
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Is he stupid?

224
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
He thinks Shang Guan He will betray you

225
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
He just thinks the people here are too simple

226
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You and I will not be obedient

227
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Shang Guan He will not betray us

228
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Shang Guan He will not betray us

229
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Nan Hong

230
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You have to promise me

231
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
From now on

232
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You will not hide anything from me

233
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
If I find out that you lied to me again

234
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Then you will kneel down and kneel down for the rest of your life

235
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Ok

236
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I will listen to you

237
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What are you doing?

238
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm going to take your medicine

239
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Why are you laughing?

240
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You suddenly gave me medicine in such a small bowl

241
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm still a little bit not used to it

242
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This

243
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Come, open your mouth

244
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Come on, big man, take your medicine

245
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Slow down, slow down

246
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I just found out recently

247
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You are really an outsider

248
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You not only didn't kill me

249
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
But also fulfilled the good relationship between me and Yi Zhongren

250
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So fierce

251
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I am very grateful

252
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Why do I think you are looking for me for another purpose?

253
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You really can't hide anything from our father

254
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You say

255
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
This little book world

256
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
How can you compete with the magic?

257
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I came today

258
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I also want to express my heart

259
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
If you are willing to take me on a trip in the future

260
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I am willing to laugh at the whole horse

261
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
This idiom is not used like this

262
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
If the idiom is used wrongly, the whole horse will be killed

263
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
This idiom is not used like this

264
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
If the idiom is used wrongly, the heart is right

265
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What my father wants to do is to prove the plot

266
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What can I do?

267
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You can say it

268
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Want to test me

269
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
To be honest

270
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:59,380
When Nan Heng was

271
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
If you want to die

272
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Just remember one question

273
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
What question

274
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Just

275
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Don't ask questions

276
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Don't be polite with your father

277
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Look, it's so late

278
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You are not familiar with the road in the house, right?

279
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'll send you

280
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
No need no need no need

281
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Such a small thing

282
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I have to bother my father

283
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Doesn't that make me look so bad?

284
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Go to bed early

285
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Ok, then I'll go back

286
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I drank too much

287
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Go go

288
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Old man is the most sincere

289
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Go go go

290
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Qian Yunjun outside the border

291
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Qian Yunjun

292
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
That's right

293
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Fu Gui checked the city defense deployment

294
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
There was no record of Qian Yunjun's transfer last night

295
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
A friend of Huo You Tuo asked for information

296
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I found that group of people

297
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It was Chu Gui Hong who secretly pulled the gold back from the border

298
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I remember

299
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
According to the plot

300
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
After Nan Heng ascended the throne

301
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Chu Gui Hong who was dismissed from the border

302
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Returned to the capital privately

303
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Secretly transferred the troops

304
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
This is the famous scene of Cheng Luang's second choice

305
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Did the plot not be changed?

306
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Don't worry

307
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Since we won the fate once

308
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Can win the second time

309
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Now as long as we have the evidence that Chu Hui Hong was transferred to the border privately

310
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Can be released to the people

311
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Are you okay?

312
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Nothing

313
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
The next famous scene you say

314
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Does my house have Tingting?

315
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Yes

316
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
How about this

317
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You will write to the chief of the council later

318
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Let him bring Song Yiting to the palace

319
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
There are many guards in the palace

320
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The monks and monks dare not act rashly

321
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
As long as you and him

322
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Don't appear at the same time in the city

323
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Their plan cannot be implemented

324
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
it is good

325
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Just

326
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
The reinforcements of the Chu Gui Hong of Su State have arrived

327
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Only rely on the military armament and guards in the capital

328
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm afraid it's hard to watch

329
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Don't worry

330
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'll go to the emperor later

331
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Let him quickly withdraw the military armament and return to the capital

332
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Even if the military armament is in a hurry

333
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Our Ye You Shen brothers can also hold out for a few days

334
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But sister-in-law

335
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You will tell me in detail later

336
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
What will happen on the next famous scene?

337
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Only by following the plan and the situation

338
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I can return to modernity

339
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Arrange the best ending for you

340
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
ah

341
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Where is the brain?

342
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
On the cultivated wind again

343
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Everything

344
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Has just started

345
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Good sound

346
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Sure

347
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Let's go,vellies

348
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
去

349
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
General, everything you told me is done.

350
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
If you don't ask me, why would I do this?

351
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
If you don't ask me, why would I do this?

352
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You must have your reasons for saying that to His Majesty and 18th Prince.

353
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
General, you saved my life from the battlefield.

354
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Since the moment you saved me, I've decided to do it secretly.

355
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
From now on, I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

356
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Even if you want me to die, I won't ask you anything.

357
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Okay.

358
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Rong Hua, now, I can't trust anyone but you.

359
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Remember, if His Majesty orders you to do anything,

360
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
you don't have to listen to him.

361
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,620
You shouldn't report this to His Remove the

362
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:25,920
Jackson when he's an imperialズ

363
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
That's great!

364
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,000
ブラックワールι

365
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,600
Don't tell the noble consort about this.

366
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,160
Your Majesty.

367
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,360
Your Majesty, 18th Prince is here.

368
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,280
Let him in.

369
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,240
Yes.

370
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,040
Father.

371
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,680
Father.

372
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,400
I heard that Qi is ill.

373
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,600
You must be very sad.

374
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,800
I don't know what to do.

375
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,520
So I bought some red tangerines to visit you.

376
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,640
Isn't this your mother's favorite?

377
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,640
Yes.

378
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,440
It's Mother's death anniversary in a few days.

379
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,480
Now that father is worried about Qi's illness,

380
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,840
I want to buy some red tangerines.

381
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,520
I hope to comfort father with them.

382
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,280
You're so sensible.

383
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,280
I know you care about father.

384
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,200
Come on, sit down.

385
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,040
Father, let me peel an orange for you.

386
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,600
Okay.

387
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,440
Father.

388
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,480
You're so old now.

389
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,080
You can't even peel an orange.

390
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,080
When mother was alive,

391
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,080
she used to peel the orange for me.

392
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,280
I never peel an orange for others.

393
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,600
You're so clumsy.

394
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,400
Let me do it.

395
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,160
Oh, father you can go first.

396
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,520
It's really delicious.

397
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,800
Who would buy it if father didn't ask?

398
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,720
You look even better with your going.

399
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,360
Yet the beard is so long.

400
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,360
You look so much better now.

401
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,600
I do look better.

402
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,080
I've done a lot of bad things before.

403
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,880
I've let my father down and my mother's expectations down.

404
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,160
There's no reason for a tree to grow on its own.

405
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,960
If you don't look good,

406
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,560
it means you've denied my ability to make a portrait.

407
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,560
I can't be a great emperor,

408
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,560
but at least I have to be a good father.

409
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,560
As long as you're healthy and safe,

410
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,560
I'll go to Xiamen to see your mother the next day.

411
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
I'll have an explanation with her.

412
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,560
Father, why are you talking like this?

413
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,560
Father, you must be too old

414
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,560
because of my wife's illness.

415
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,560
That's why you're so depressed and depressed.

416
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,560
Father, I've secretly asked Qingtianjian.

417
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,560
My wife's illness is probably because of this evil mother.

418
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
To defeat the evil,

419
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,560
you have to use your soul to suppress it.

420
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,560
And you have to use your inner joy to suppress it.

421
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,560
I wanted to make a decree

422
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,560
so that people outside the palace don't say anything bad.

423
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,560
I'll pray for my wife and her family.

424
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,560
I'll pray for my wife and her family.

425
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,560
I'll pray for my wife and her family.

426
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
Liu Mingxi,

427
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,560
I think there are still a dozen of memorials to be read.

428
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
Search them.

429
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Yes.

430
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,560
Father, why don't you talk to me?

431
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,560
Did I say anything wrong?

432
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,560
No, I'm eating this orange.

433
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,560
It's so delicious.

434
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,560
It tastes so good.

435
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,560
Father, do you think we should make a decree

436
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,560
to remove the evil for my wife?

437
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,560
Father, are you okay?

438
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,560
You're still stuck eating an orange.

439
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,560
Father, what's wrong with you?

440
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,560
Father, father, father.

441
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,560
Father, father, don't scare me.

442
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,560
Father.

443
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,560
Father, doctor, doctor.

444
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Don't scare me.

445
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,560
Help, Prince 18 is trying to kill His Majesty.

446
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,560
Help, Prince 18 is trying to kill His Majesty.

447
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,560
Help.

448
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,560
No, I don't have it.

449
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
Father.

450
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Get out.

451
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,560
I'm getting old.

452
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,560
Father, I'm sorry.

453
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,560
Your Highness.

454
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Jinxia, Jinxia.

455
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
There are a lot of people after me.

456
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,560
They said I was hiding from father.

457
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,560
But I didn't.

458
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,560
I really didn't.

459
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
I know.

460
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,560
Let's go find the Crown Prince.

461
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,560
Master Jin, I don't have an AD.

462
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
I don't know if you really have one.

463
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,560
Are you guilty or nothing?

464
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,560
Yes, I am.

465
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,560
Go POW.

466
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,560
I don't know either.

467
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,560
Don't even know how to understand them.

468
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,560
Good for you.

469
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
Your Highness,

470
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
It's not wrong.

471
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,560
I'm not a sinner.

472
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
Why do you punish me?

473
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,560
You're not a sinner.

474
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,560
If so,

475
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,560
I'll follow your order.

476
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,560
Under the knife,

477
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,560
life and death

478
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,560
will be decided by heaven and earth.

479
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,560
Kill them.

480
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,560
Jinxiu

481
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
Ji Yang

482
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,560
Ji Yang

483
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,560
Ji Yang

484
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,560
Ji Yang

485
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,560
You can't leave the room.

486
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Your Highness,

487
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
go to find the Crown Prince.

488
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
I know.

489
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
I know.

490
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Don't lie.

491
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,560
Where's the doctor?

492
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,560
Doctor

493
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Where's the doctor?

494
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,560
Go to find the doctor.

495
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
Ji Yang

496
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
Ji Yang

497
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
Let me go.

498
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
Ji Yang

499
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,560
Ji Yang

500
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Ji Yang

501
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
I have nothing.

502
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,560
You're the only one left.

503
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,560
Ji Yang

504
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,560
Ji Yang

505
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Let me go.

506
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,560
Ji Yang

507
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
Cousin

508
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,560
Why?

509
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,560
Why?

510
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,560
Why?

511
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,560
Why do you do this to me?

512
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,560
Father was poisoned.

513
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Is it related to you?

514
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,560
Answer me.

515
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,560
Answer me.

516
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,560
Answer me.

517
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,560
The Black Armor Army is on the order of the Crown Prince.

518
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,560
We're here to interrogate the Eighth Prince.

519
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,560
General Chu

520
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,560
Let him go.

521
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,560
Let him go.

522
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,560
Your Highness

523
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,560
What should we do now?

524
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,560
You should give us a good example.

525
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,560
The Ministry of Justice has already interrogated the owner of the red orange.

526
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,560
The eunuch who is guarding outside the palace and the doctor of the Liuming Department have a testimony.

527
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,560
It proves that the Eighth Prince personally fed the emperor orange.

528
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,560
This is really a good evidence.

529
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,560
Your Highness

530
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,560
How is it?

531
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Your Highness

532
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,560
The doctor has examined the poison that the Lord of the Thousand Rain Army collected in the Eighteenth Prince's mansion.

533
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,560
It's indeed the same as the poison in the red orange.

534
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,560
I'm asking how is your body?

535
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
His Majesty is already in a bad state.

536
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,560
He is weak and has a death.

537
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,560
The Qin Yan Shou said that the poison was very strong.

538
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,560
He is afraid that he is in danger of his life.

539
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
Go tell the Qin Yan Shou

540
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,560
No matter what method you use, no matter what kind of strong medicine you use, you must save His Majesty.

541
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,560
I will bear all the consequences.

542
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,560
Yes

543
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
Your Highness

544
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,560
The evidence and evidence are all here.

545
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,560
The Eighteenth Prince Nanrui committed treason and is unforgivable.

546
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,560
Please punish him severely.

547
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,560
Yes

548
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,560
The court is in a state of chaos and the four departments are in danger.

549
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,560
If the Crown Prince cannot be cut off immediately, the court will be in chaos.

550
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,560
The state is in a state of chaos.

551
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,560
Shut up

552
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
Nanrui is my brother.

553
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,560
No one knows what kind of person he is better than me.

554
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,560
It's good to have five officials.

555
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,560
The people of the world are fine.

556
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,560
No matter who asks, I still say that.

557
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Nanrui cannot be the murderer.

558
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
Did you hear?

559
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,560
Your Highness

560
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,560
Isn't this case a check?

561
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,560
Or not a check?

562
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,560
Continue to investigate

563
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,560
Investigate and maintain

564
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,560
Yes

565
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,560
Why is it so coincidental?

566
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,560
Nan Heng just got sick

567
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,560
His Majesty is in trouble again

568
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,560
And how could Nanrui do it?

569
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
Crown Princess

570
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,560
The Imperial Kitchen has sent food three times.

571
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,560
You should eat at least one bite.

572
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
No, I can't eat.

573
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
There must be something wrong with this.

574
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,560
No matter how strange it is, you have to eat enough to have the strength to investigate.

575
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,560
The Imperial Hospital has sent a message.

576
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,560
His Majesty is afraid that he can't stand tonight.

577
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,560
If His Highness is in a critical situation,

578
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,560
If His Highness is in a critical situation,

579
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,560
There are still a lot of troublesome things waiting for you to deal with.

580
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,560
Critical situation?

581
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,560
How could I ignore this?

582
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,560
When Cheng Lu was in the second selection,

583
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,560
Nan Heng has already ascended to the throne.

584
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,560
Nan Heng

585
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,560
You killed the loyal and loyal, killed the father and the king, and you are not worthy of being the emperor.

586
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
Today, if you want them to live,

587
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,560
You will die here.

588
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,560
You dare to threaten me?

589
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,560
Your Highness

590
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,560
Where is Shang Guan He?

591
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,560
He went back to his home to pick up the second girl.

592
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,560
Hurry up and find someone to tell him.

593
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,560
You must protect Ting.

594
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,560
You can't leave at all.

595
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,560
Did you hear me?

596
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,560
Go quickly.

597
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
Okay.

598
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,560
Ding Qiu

599
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,560
Help me get a team of the Black Armor Army.

600
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,560
I'm going out of the palace.

601
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
Yes.

602
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,560
Please.

603
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,560
130

604
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,560
I can't stop.

605
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,160
As for Shengsheng,

606
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,400
I've tried my best.

607
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,120
But I'm afraid

608
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,200
I can't last more than a few nights.

609
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,200
I believe you're innocent.

610
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,920
I'll try my best to find out the truth for you.

611
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,760
But before that,

612
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,120
you should stay here

613
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,640
in case someone tries to take advantage of it.

614
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,640
Do you hear me?

615
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,280
You're the one who caused the disaster.

616
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,600
Who else can you show this self-pity look to?

617
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,120
Brother Qi,

618
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,080
don't go.

619
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,840
You reminded me before.

620
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,520
Ji Xiang also reminded me.

621
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,520
I was wrong.

622
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,120
But I still chose to believe him.

623
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,960
But in the end,

624
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,360
father was killed by me.

625
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,840
Ji Xiang was killed by me too.

626
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,240
They're all the people in this world

627
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,800
who care about me the most.

628
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,600
Do you think

629
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,600
I deserve to die?

630
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,840
It's not the end.

631
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,840
What's the point of saying this now?

632
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,760
Just say a few words.

633
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,200
Can everything be better?

634
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,920
What can I do?

635
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,680
I...

636
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,680
I'm a loser.

637
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,800
I'm a loser.

638
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,440
Since I was a kid,

639
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,480
I've done nothing wrong.

640
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,200
I've never done anything right.

641
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,560
I'm stupid and stupid.

642
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,200
Now,

643
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,120
I've caused Ji Xiang and father to die.

644
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,360
Why did they die?

645
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,640
Shouldn't I be the one who died?

646
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,400
Why?

647
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,160
Why?

648
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,000
Why?

649
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,760
Why?

650
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,440
Why?

651
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,320
Why?

652
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,120
Why did they die?

653
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,080
Why?

654
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,120
Why?

655
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,200
Get me out of here.

656
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,360
What's the point of dying?

657
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,400
Will Ji Xiang come back once you're dead?

658
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,640
Won't things get better if you die?

659
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,720
Listen up.

660
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,000
If you're a little bit bloody,

661
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,960
give it your best.

662
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,480
Face it together with me and solve it together.

663
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,280
But

664
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,600
I'm a sinner now.

665
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,240
What else can I do?

666
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,840
What you have to do now is to think about it.

667
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,120
From the red-and-red game,

668
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,360
if they have any flaws,

669
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,360
you can clear your own name.

670
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,360
And now I need you.

671
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,840
I need you to solve it with me.

672
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,360
Let His Majesty get better together.

673
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,120
Do you understand?

674
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,680
That is enough.

675
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,120
I don't want to leave you.

676
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,720
I'd like to hear yours.

677
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,040
Brother.

678
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,480
Can I wake up?

679
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,240
Go, sound suppressor

680
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,280
for information

681
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,040
See you

682
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,600
I'm sorry.

683
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,600
I'm sorry.

684
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,600
I'm sorry.

685
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,600
I'm sorry.

686
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,600
I'm sorry.

687
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,600
I'm sorry.

688
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,600
I'm sorry.

689
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,600
I'm sorry.

690
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,600
I'm sorry.

691
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,600
I'm sorry.

692
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,600
I'm sorry.

693
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,600
I'm sorry.

694
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,600
I'm sorry.

695
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,600
I'm sorry.

696
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,600
I'm sorry.

697
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,600
I'm sorry.

698
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,600
I'm sorry.

699
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,600
I'm sorry.

700
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,600
I'm sorry.

701
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,600
I'm sorry.

702
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,600
I'm sorry.

703
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,600
I'm sorry.

704
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,600
I'm sorry.

705
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,600
I'm sorry.

706
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,600
I'm sorry.

707
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,600
I'm sorry.

708
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,600
I'm sorry.

709
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,600
I'm sorry.

710
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,600
I'm sorry.

711
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,600
I'm sorry.

712
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,600
I'm sorry.

713
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,600
I'm sorry.

714
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,600
I'm sorry.

715
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,600
I'm sorry.

716
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,600
I'm sorry.

717
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,600
I'm sorry.

718
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,600
I'm sorry.

719
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,600
I'm sorry.

720
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,600
I'm sorry.

721
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,600
I'm sorry.

722
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,600
I'm sorry.

723
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,600
I'm sorry.

724
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,600
I'm sorry.

725
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,600
I'm sorry.

726
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,600
I'm sorry.

727
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,600
I'm sorry.

728
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,600
I'm sorry.

729
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,600
I'm sorry.

730
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,600
I'm sorry.

731
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,600
I'm sorry.

732
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,600
I'm sorry.

733
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,600
I'm sorry.

734
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,600
I'm sorry.

735
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,600
I'm sorry.

736
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,600
I'm sorry.

737
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,600
I'm sorry.

738
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,600
I'm sorry.

739
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,600
I'm sorry.

740
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,600
I'm sorry.

741
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,600
I'm sorry.

742
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,600
I'm sorry.

743
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,600
I'm sorry.

744
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,600
I'm sorry.

745
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,600
I'm sorry.

746
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,600
