the capital prefecture's office is handling a case.

00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,590
How dare you obstruct us?

6
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,320
So what if it's the capital prefecture's office?

7
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,320
Without my approval today,

8
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,639
you won't take anyone away.

9
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,970
What if I insist on taking him away today?

Li Shiliu,

13
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,710
I'm taking him back

14
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,590
to investigate an old case.

15
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,860
If he isn't Shangguan Baihe,

16
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,660
I will release him.

17
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,570

what you really

81
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,930

97
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
It's where my father

98
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,690
and Yimeng's mother pledged their love.

99
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,430
That day,

100
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,520
it was also snowing heavily.

101
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,770
I didn't listen to my father

102
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,230
and wait in the corridor;

103
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,800
I sneaked into the hall.

104
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,800
Unexpectedly,

105
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,460
I saw my father crying.

106
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,000
Since I was old enough to remember things,

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,480
my mother told me

108
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,700
Yimeng's mother came from a humble background.

109
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,950
But that day,

110
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,110
I was curious for the first time—

111
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,570
what kind of love

112
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,760
could make a proud Minister of War

113
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,159
hold his late wife's memorial tablet

114
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,630
in this broken house

115
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,520
and cry uncontrollably?

116
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,020
I understand what you're saying.

117
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,950
You want to find someone

118
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,430
like your father.

119
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,680
But Miss Song,

120
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,170
can we talk about this another day?

121
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,040
Without a soulmate,

122
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,240
wandering the world alone is fine.

123
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,120
But after meeting you,

124
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,340
I feel that

125
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,250
spending time with you

126
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,000
would be a good thing.

127
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,120
Mr. Li,

128
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,830
I don't know

129
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,830
what I like about you.

130
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,049
Maybe I just don't want to enter a blind marriage

131
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,720
with someone I don't love.

132
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,400
That man

133
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,549
matches my status,

134
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,030
but it's only a match of status.

135
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,080
Having witnessed true love,

136
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,930
how could one settle for less?

137
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:54,700
Mr. Li,

138
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,600
are you the one I should wait for?

139
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,550
Miss Song,

140
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,960
I can't

141
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,360
give you an answer today.

142
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,410
How about this?

143
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,440
Wait a few more days,

144
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,570
and I believe you'll find your answer.

145
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,400
What if I don't want to wait?

146
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,550
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240

The snow is too heavy.

159
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,390
Yimeng,

160
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,360
you should go back.

161
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,120
I know the place;

162
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
I can go by myself.

163
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,320
No.

164
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,600
Since I'm already in this world,

165
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,630
I have to stop her from making a mistake.

166
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,440
Otherwise,

167
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,060
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

168

Miss Song!

170
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,150
If you don't want to marry Nan Rui, there are plenty of ways.

171
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,240
You don't have to go down this path

172
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,600
and ruin your reputation.

173
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,240
Without Nan Rui,

174
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,030

and find the executioners from that day for questioning,

454

What exactly are you looking for?

518

The method of weapon forging.

How is she?

520
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,740

I...

527
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,190
Are you even human?

528
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,920
I don't have time for you.

529
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,170
Nan Heng,

530
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:02,960
how could you...

531
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,090
Eighteenth Prince,

532
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,940
we are on the street.

533
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,990
Please stay calm

534
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,240
for Miss Yiting.

535
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,590
I...

536
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,480
Stay calm?

537
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,310
I...

538
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,010
Nan Heng,

539
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,110
both you and that Li Shiliu

540
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,400
are no good!

541
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,920
I will definitely avenge Yiting!

542
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,520
Just wait for your downfall!

543
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,370
If you want to know who Li Shiliu is

544
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,070
and keep him safe and sound,

545

[One day ago]

549
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,110
Is His Highness inside?

550
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,370
What happened?

551
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,000
Come.

552
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,750
Yiting.

553
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,000
Yiting?

554
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,140
Why did she pass out?

555
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,110
What did you do to her?

556
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,660
Your sister encountered mountain bandits

557
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,920
and fainted from fear.

558
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,540
Jerk.

559
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,440
Let's go!

560
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,130
Your Highness!

561
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,240
What exactly happened?

562
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:18,790
You...

563
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,050
What's wrong with you?

564
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,960
I'm fine.

565
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,590
I was drugged.

566
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,830
Go inside and clean up the mess.

567
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,960
Take the blade away.

568
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,440
Seal off all news

569
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,260
and deploy troops to surround the Song Residence.

570
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,110
You sealed off the news, surrounded Song Residence,

571
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,350
and even slipped a note into my clothes.

572
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,550
Your Highness, what exactly

573
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,350
are you scheming?

574
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,830
And also,

575
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,070
who exactly is Li Shiliu?

576
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,440
Actually,

577
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,270
since you were provoked by the Axe Gang

578
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,030
at Waning River Crescent,

579
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,630
the Li Shiliu you've been seeing

580
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,060
has always been Shangguan He.

581
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,230
Shangguan He?

582
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,090
That's impossible.

583
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,790
He's just a pervert.

584
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,540
How could he possibly be Mr. Li?

585
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:11,770
Miss Song,

586
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,750
this Li Shiliu

587
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,480
is another identity of mine.

588
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,630
Shangguan He happened

589
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,790
to meet you under this identity.

590
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,270
I didn't want to interfere

591
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,000
in this matter between you two.

592
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,000
Yesterday I went to Zijin Pavilion

593
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,600
because he asked me

594
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,960
to return these paintings to you.

595
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,930
But I didn't expect

596
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,830
what happened afterward.

597
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,670
Your identity must remain secret,

598
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,740
so you sent the Xuanjia Army to the Song Residence,

599
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,410
hoping to explain everything to me first.

600
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,920
Yes.

601
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,450
Seventh Prince, well played.

602
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
But today,

603
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,240
the one who should be talking to me

604
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,270
is not you.

605
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,450
Where is Shangguan He?

606
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,820
Doesn't he even have the courage to explain to me?

607
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,590
He is currently

608
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,350
in the prison of capital prefecture's office.

Please calm down, Mrs. Song.

Let me in.

615
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,920
His Highness did this for a reason.

616
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,440
He will certainly give you an explanation.

617
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,290
What explanation?

618
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,110
That he wants to marry our Yiting?

619
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,240
Should I just let his wolfish ambitions

620
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,960
drag Yiting into the fire?

621
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,890
How can you say that about His Highness?

622
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,030
If it weren't for Miss Yiting poisoning the incense burner,

623
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,830
would His Highness be like this?

624
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,380
What nonsense are you talking about?

625
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,030
How could our Yiting do such a thing?

626
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,240
It's clearly that Nan Heng...

627
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,750
It was your Miss Yiting who wanted to frame His Highness.

628
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,000
If you don't believe me,

629
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,830
Xuanjia Army has already brought back the incense burner

630
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,510
from Zijin Pavilion.

631
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,680
I'll take you to see it right now.

632

Shut up!

633
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,640
His Highness just wants to calm things down.

634
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,640
Why do you

635
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,880
keep causing trouble here?

636
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,030
You shameless scoundrel!

637
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,310
Trying to blame the victim, are you?

638
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,000
Fine.

I...

644
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,640
I didn't act recklessly.

645
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,880
His Highness ordered us

646
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,590
not to fight back or talk back.

647
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,400
I wouldn't dare disobey.

The women in Song Residence

652
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,080
are all quite something,

653
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,160
and His Highness still gets entangled with them.

654
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,020
Isn't he just asking for trouble?

655
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,590
You two, master and servant,

656
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,190
have played me like a fiddle,

657
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,610
and now you want me to help hide the truth.

658
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,500
Your Highness,

659
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,360
why do you think I'd agree to that?

660
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,110
Shangguan He told me once

661
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,160
that your knowledge and talent

662
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,590
surpass most women.

663
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,950
Since you've read history,

664
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,810
you should know the lessons of the past.

665
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,310
Since you're good at chess,

666
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,570
you should understand gains and losses.

667
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,840
You said all this

668
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,550
just to warn me

669
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,260
that revealing your identity

670
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,880
will only make things worse,

671
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:09,510
that I'd get the reputation of seducing my brother-in-law,

672
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,110
and that Yimeng would become a laughingstock.

673
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:12,930
This benefits

674
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:13,960
neither me

675
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,160
nor the Song family.

676
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,880
As long as you understand this,

677
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,690
I will immediately withdraw my men from Song Residence.

678
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,270
And you can rest assured.

679
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,070
I've already sealed off

680

the news about last night.

681
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,620
Absolutely no one will know about it.

682
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,610
I'll also do my best to help

683

What makes you think

686
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,410
this is enough?

687
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,790
What else do you want?

688
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,270
I want Shangguan He

to be safe and sound.

00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,750
Yimeng once said

691
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,000
you're ruthless

692
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,590
and far from a decent person.

693
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,650
Now that Shangguan He's been exposed,

694
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,240
if you don't step forward and take responsibility,

695
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,790
this won't end well.

696
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,270
But you

697
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,830
will never expose Waning River Crescent

698
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,160
or give up your power.

699
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,240
Are you planning to sacrifice the pawn to save the king,

700
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
keeping yourself clean of all this?

701
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,200
Miss Song, you're indeed smart.

702
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,030
But you don't need

703
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,300
to worry about these matters.

704
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,160
Whether smart

705
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,470
or foolish,

706
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,530
we're all just mortals.

707
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,050
A person must have some backbone.

708
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,000
I admit

709
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,990
every word you said before was right.

710
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,790
The pros and cons,

711
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,010
the risks and gains—

712
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,530
I understand them all.

713
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,750
But

714
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,790
I just don't want to comply with you.

715
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,850
Rescue Shangguan He,

716
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,190
apologize to Yimeng,

717
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,440
and never marry another woman

718
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,590
besides her in your life.

719
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,370
If you fail at either,

720
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,720
don't blame me

721
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,320
for exposing your identity.

722
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,690
You dare threaten me?

723
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,760
Aren't you afraid I'll...

724
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,850
If I die,

725
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,760
Yimeng will never forgive you.

726
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,960
On that alone,

727
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,130
I bet you don't dare.

728
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,030
Fine.

729
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,000
It's a deal.

730
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:35,830
[Song Residence]

731
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:51,730
[Token]

732
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,510
The capital prefecture's office is handling a case,

733
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,960
and there is important information.

734
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,590
Seventh Prince, please come to the office with me for a discussion.

735
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,250
What important information?

736
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,510
The capital prefecture's office has the authority to interrogate.

737
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,550
Any defiance

738
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,040
will be treated as a serious offense.

739
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,830
Who dares disrespect His Highness!

740
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,710
It's fine.

741
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,400
I haven't been to the capital prefecture's office since returning to the capital.

742
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,190
Today,

743
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,120
I'll go there with you.

744
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,500
Who is this person?

745
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,510
Your Highness, have you forgotten?

746
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,150
His name is Shangguan He.

747
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:37,230
You saw him at Waning River Crescent.

748
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,429
Logically speaking,

749
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,949
matters of outlaws shouldn't concern you.

750
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,239
But three years ago,

751
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,880
he was known as Shangguan Baihe—

752
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,909
the ringleader you arrested in the theft case

753
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:51,969
involving three prefectures in Jiangnan.

754
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,320
I've handled countless cases over the years.

755
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,890
How could I possibly remember

756
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,970
a insignificant prisoner?

757
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,790
According to the Ministry of Justice's records,

758
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,410
Shangguan Baihe was already executed.

759
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,610
Your Highness, as the official in charge of that case,

760
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,010
aren't you curious how someone

761
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:21,480
who supposedly died three years ago

762
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,890
is now alive?

763
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,940
So you are saying

764
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,880
that I should

765
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,150
watch over every prisoner

766
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,620
I arrest

767
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,160
all the way until their execution?

768
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,100
You can come up with 1000 reasons to deny it.

769
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,280
However,

770
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,920
yesterday, I went to the Secretariat

771
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,450
to check the old case files.

772
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,230
Guess what happened?

773
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,480
The archives caught fire.

774
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,090
All records from those years

775
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,340
were destroyed.

776
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,530
Your Highness,

777
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,180
if you were in my position,

778
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:12,050
wouldn't you suspect that someone powerful

779
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,210
was pulling the strings behind this case?

780
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,790
Every time you fail,

781
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,890
you blame me.

782
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,700
It was like this during the Pingrong Battle,

783
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,290
and it's still the same now.

784
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,280
It doesn't matter if you don't admit it.

785
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,060
Aren't you skilled at forcing confessions?

786
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,070
Then why don't you ask

787
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,970
Shangguan Baihe

788
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:49,320
how he came back from the dead?

789
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,970
Oh, and I forgot to tell you—

790
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,030
this case has already been reported to His Majesty.

791
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,400
What I'm doing today

792
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,180
is giving you a chance

793
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,470
to prove you didn't collude with court officials

794
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,050
to falsify the case files.

795
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,500
Catch them!

796
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,190
Your Highness,

797
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,120
are you alright?

798
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,620
Qianyu Army is truly useless.

799
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,800
You can't even keep watch over a prisoner.

800
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,400
Is there any place still safe

801
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,800
in the capital?

802
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,030
Fugui,

803
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,630
go back and lead the troops

804
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,050
to capture the men in black.

805
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:41,880
Yes.

806
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,670
Seventh Prince, you're known as the God of Death,

807
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,730
yet you were injured by a man in black.

808
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,370
Or were you just faking the injury

809
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,530
to cover up

810
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,670
a prison break?

811
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,590
Even the God of Death

812
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,030
has his limits.

813
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:06,600
Is that so?

814
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,190
It's a pity.

815
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,340
Looks like

816
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,120
you saved the wrong man.

817
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:18,880
Put him down!

818
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,590
Oh no!

819
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,990
That's not Shangguan He.

820
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,130
Stop right there!

821
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,380
Arrest them all!

822
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,440
This

823
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,440
is the real Shangguan He.

824
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,840
The ones who just broke into the prison

825
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,360
were Nightwalkers from Waning River Crescent, right?

826
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,230
Too bad.

827
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,490
They're probably surrounded by Rong Hua's men now.

828
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,440
Once Rong Hua captures them,

829
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,890
Seventh Prince,

830
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,550
what do you think about

831
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:06,030
sentencing them to exile a thousand miles

832
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,890
for the crime of prison breaking?

833
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,440
Sounds good.

834
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,550
But General Chu,

835
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,010
why are you so sure

836
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,150
the prison breakers are Nightwalkers?

837
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,990
I'm really not from Waning River Crescent.

838
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,800
Someone paid me five hundred taels

839
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,590
to lead people to break the prison

840
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,910
and promised

841
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,110
another five hundred after success.

842
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,150
That person

843
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,050
was a Nightwalker, right?

844
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,380
That person never showed up.

845
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,490
A little beggar

846
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,590
handed me the letter

847
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,190
and silver.

848
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,250
You hired people to break the prison?

849
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,880
General Chu, you must be joking.

850
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,130
I'm not Shangguan He's accomplice.

851
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,070
Why would I do that?

852
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,200
I'm just telling you this

853
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,760
to remind you

854
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,190
not to be...

855
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,550
overconfident.

856
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,840
It doesn't matter.

857
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,150
No matter who they are,

858
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,440
they'll only be Nightwalkers

859
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,840
from Waning River Crescent.

860
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,000
Officers, you must be joking.

861
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,120
How could that little beggar be a Nightwalker?

862
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,030
Enough.

863
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,190
I say it is so.

864
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,030
If there's no evidence,

865
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,440
then we'll fabricate it.

866
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,490
Today, Waning River Crescent must be shut down.

867
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,420
Brothers!

868
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,440
Follow me to Waning River Crescent.

869
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,110
Yes!

870
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,590
Framing?

871
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,360
Impressive.

872
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:40,890
You flatter me.

873
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,610
I've just been dealing with you for so long

874
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,050
that I picked up these tricks.

875
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,210
Now I'm just using

876
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,550
your own methods against you.

877
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,110
Mr. Chu, since you understand this,

878
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,800
do you also know

879
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,030
what the art

880
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,360
of escape means?
