1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sword is heavy.

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the deep roots of the enemy.

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,200
It's better to be a man than to be a man.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am a hero.

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
I am a hero.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
I am a hero.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
I am a hero.

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
I am a hero.

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
I am a hero.

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
I am a hero.

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,000
I will be a hero forever.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The wind blows in the direction of the sun.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I don't regret my youth for being so uncivilized.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I will be a hero forever.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For this life and for all lives,

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I will give my all for the world.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Episode 4

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Episode 4

20
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,200
Why are you staring at me?

21
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,200
What are you thinking about?

22
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,400
I've thought about it.

23
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,400
Song Yi Meng.

24
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
I like you.

25
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
What did you say?

26
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,000
I said I like you.

27
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,000
So I want your forgiveness.

28
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,800
Then I will marry you.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You...

30
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,400
Are you crazy?

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,400
You are thinking too much.

32
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,800
Why can't you understand?

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,200
Listen to me first.

34
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,600
At first, I was afraid of you.

35
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
I even...

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,600
I even wanted to kill you.

37
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,400
But after I got along with you,

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,400
everything has changed.

39
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,400
What do you mean?

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,400
Let me remind you.

41
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,400
You didn't kill me because you can't kill me.

42
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes.

43
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,000
I can't kill you.

44
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,200
But...

45
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,000
But because of Shang Yuan's lantern festival,

46
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,800
I fell in love with you.

47
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
After that,

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,600
I never wanted to kill you again.

49
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,400
I was afraid and uneasy

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,200
when I lied to you.

51
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,800
But I was also confused about some things.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,600
Why did you avoid me

53
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,600
when I was Nan Heng's hand?

54
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
You are so anxious,

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,600
vigilant, and

56
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,800
you treat me with sincerity.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,200
I'm always sincere to you.

58
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,800
But why did Song Yi Meng

59
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,400
point out to Li Shiliu?

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So?

61
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,200
Is this the reason you lied to me?

62
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,800
I lied to you.

63
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,600
I lied to you.

64
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,000
I lied to you.

65
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,600
But that's because I was afraid.

66
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,200
I was afraid that once the lie was exposed,

67
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,800
I would never see you again.

68
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,400
And...

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,600
And I was very selfish.

70
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,400
Because I was so jealous of the feeling of being trusted by you.

71
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,600
I couldn't bear to wake up from this dream.

72
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
But...

73
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,000
Dreams will come true one day.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Lies will be exposed one day.

75
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,200
That's right.

76
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,400
So now I want to tell you honestly.

77
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,400
The real Nan Heng

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
is not the evil spirit that others talk about.

79
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,000
He is not a carefree hero.

80
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,800
He is just a cowardly and selfish man.

81
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,000
Can I

82
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,200
marry you?

83
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,000
We have to get married.

84
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't want to marry you.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,400
We have to get married.

86
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,800
I don't want to marry you.

87
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,400
Your Highness, where are you?

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,600
Is it dangerous?

89
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
You must run safely, Your Highness.

90
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,000
Lord Feng Gui, there's a body in there.

91
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,000
Lord Feng Gui, it's in there.

92
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,700
Miss Song's cloak?

93
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,200
Lord Fugui!

94
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,600
Lord Fugui!

95
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:30,580
I found traces of a

96
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,580
Let's go!

97
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,580
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,580
I can't promise you.

99
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,580
I can't promise you.

100
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,580
I can't promise you.

101
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,580
I can't promise you.

102
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,580
What are you worrying about?

103
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,580
Nan Heng,

104
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,580
let me ask you.

105
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,580
When you left the Cold Palace

106
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,580
and went to the border,

107
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,580
what were you thinking about?

108
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,580
I just didn't want to die in the Cold Palace.

109
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,580
I wanted to kill a living person for myself.

110
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,580
That's right.

111
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,580
You did it.

112
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,580
You made military achievements.

113
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,580
Gradually, you also have your own strength.

114
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,580
But when you returned to the capital,

115
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,580
you suddenly found that

116
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,580
the border was fighting for more than ten years.

117
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,580
It turned out to be worthless.

118
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,580
No matter how much you made,

119
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,580
the crown prince

120
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,580
will only be Nan Rui.

121
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,580
And your ending?

122
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,580
You have to go back to the deep palace.

123
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,580
You can't be free for life.

124
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,580
What were you thinking about at that time?

125
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,580
If you've been through a lot of trouble

126
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,580
and want to climb to the top,

127
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,580
but you can't climb up,

128
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,580
you should have understood by then.

129
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,580
Actually, it's pretty good to see the scenery under the mountain.

130
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,580
You mean

131
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,580
no matter how hard you try,

132
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,580
you can't change it?

133
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,580
But I don't believe it.

134
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,580
Why should I be held in someone else's hands?

135
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,580
I will definitely get what I want

136
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,580
by my own efforts.

137
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,580
But when you got what you wanted,

138
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,580
it was the time when our Song family

139
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,580
was in a tragic situation.

140
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,580
When I was young,

141
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,580
there was a very serious fire.

142
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,580
And my parents

143
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,580
left that place

144
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,580
to save me.

145
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,580
They left that world forever.

146
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,580
So,

147
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,580
I will never let such a tragedy

148
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,580
happen again.

149
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,580
What do you mean by parents leaving?

150
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,580
Isn't Song Daren fine?

151
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,580
I don't understand what you're talking about.

152
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,580
Nothing.

153
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,580
You won't understand.

154
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,580
Nan Hong,

155
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,580
there will be no good ending

156
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,580
between us.

157
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,580
Since there won't be a good ending,

158
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,580
why don't we

159
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,580
never start again?

160
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,580
So,

161
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,580
this is the reason why you rejected me.

162
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,580
I don't understand.

163
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,580
I don't understand.

164
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,580
You're a very kind person.

165
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,580
I can understand your feelings.

166
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,580
But, Song Yingmu,

167
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,580
have you ever tried hard?

168
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,580
Everything didn't start.

169
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,580
Why do you say there won't be a good ending?

170
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,580
If it's my fault, I can change it.

171
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,580
I can also promise you

172
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,580
that I will take care of the Song family

173
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,580
when I face you in person.

174
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,580
This world

175
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,580
is a huge picture book.

176
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,580
And I

177
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,580
am just an ordinary person.

178
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,580
I just want to protect my family

179
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,580
so that they can live well.

180
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,580
The only place I can live

181
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,580
is my heart.

182
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,580
So, Your Highness,

183
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,580
the Song Yingmu in front of you

184
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,580
will never

185
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,580
fall in love with you.

186
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,580
Let me ask you.

187
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,580
You're so afraid of death,

188
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,580
so afraid of pain.

189
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,580
Why didn't you save me on purpose?

190
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,580
Song Yingmu,

191
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,580
can you really

192
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,580
control your heart?

193
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,580
General!

194
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,580
General!

195
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,580
General!

196
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,580
General!

197
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,580
General!

198
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,580
You sneaked away

199
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,580
after you hid from me last night?

200
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,580
I was killed to the cliff.

201
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,580
So many things happened

202
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,580
overnight.

203
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,500
and escaped.

204
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,780
Look.

205
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,540
I got a cut here.

206
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,180
Someone is so rampant

207
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,100
under the feet of the emperor.

208
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,780
Shut up.

209
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,540
Even the Seventh Prince was hurt.

210
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,260
Fortunately, Seventh Prince arrived in time.

211
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,500
Otherwise, he would have been

212
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,660
in a state of shock.

213
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,340
It's not that serious.

214
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,740
Tian Yan, it's not that serious.

215
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,060
It's already like this.

216
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,220
It's not that serious?

217
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,180
Mr. Song is right.

218
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,780
Those people are all good at martial arts.

219
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,740
They are very good at it.

220
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,900
Not to mention him.

221
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,980
Even I, who have been fighting for years,

222
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,420
almost died.

223
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,540
Are you done?

224
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,500
Stop being so insolent.

225
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,820
What do you mean?

226
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,100
Dad, don't listen to him.

227
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,860
He's not that serious.

228
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,820
If he is,

229
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,380
I will not be able to come back alive.

230
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,100
Think about it.

231
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,980
Even so, it must be a very dangerous situation.

232
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,020
Otherwise, the Seventh Prince has such high martial arts.

233
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,380
How could he get hurt?

234
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,180
Tian'er is right.

235
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,620
He...

236
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,460
You are not allowed to go to the south.

237
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,380
Stay in the capital.

238
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,340
Dad, don't listen to him.

239
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,540
Mr. Song is right.

240
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,700
But the evil man didn't get the chance.

241
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,060
He will definitely find another chance to kill the killer.

242
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,620
I don't know

243
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,100
what he is planning.

244
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,140
Kill him.

245
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,420
Shoot him.

246
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,780
Or poison him.

247
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,180
Go, go, go.

248
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:38,780
Meng,

249
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,900
I have a bad feeling.

250
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,380
From today on,

251
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,380
you stay in Song's mansion.

252
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,780
Don't go out.

253
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,340
Dad, this is not necessary.

254
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,340
Dad is right.

255
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,820
This is not a good idea.

256
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,860
It's not enough if he doesn't go out.

257
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,420
Mr. Song, think about it.

258
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
He can even buy the horse-dress of Song's mansion.

259
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,700
Then he can't protect the eyes of the people

260
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,060
who live in Song's mansion.

261
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,020
Hurry up.

262
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,780
Guards.

263
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,380
Add guards to the mansion.

264
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,900
Keep an eye on them all day.

265
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,580
Yes.

266
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,100
Meng,

267
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,460
from today on,

268
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,940
you stay in the room.

269
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,700
Don't step out of the room.

270
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,700
Dad,

271
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,380
how could I not go out?

272
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,580
It's not that serious.

273
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,620
Don't listen to him.

274
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,140
This is the Seventh Prince.

275
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,340
Find the real murderer as soon as possible.

276
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,380
Let Song's mansion rest in peace.

277
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,140
Of course.

278
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,260
I will do my best.

279
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,380
But Miss Song, Mr. Song,

280
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,980
from now on,

281
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,740
you two should be careful.

282
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,420
Yes.

283
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,380
Is this his house or mine?

284
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,940
Why do you all believe him?

285
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,780
Be good.

286
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,300
Okay.

287
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,620
You are so arrogant.

288
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,780
You are so petty.

289
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,220
I think you are not kind.

290
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,260
Song Yi Meng.

291
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,140
Don't follow me anymore.

292
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,940
You are going in the wrong direction.

293
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,700
I...

294
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,340
Don't think I don't know

295
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,100
why you said that

296
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,380
in front of my family.

297
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,580
You can get me stuck for a while.

298
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,500
But you can't get me stuck forever.

299
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,500
I'm doing this for your own good.

300
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,500
The enemy hasn't come out yet.

301
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,060
You can't be careful.

302
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,780
Enemy?

303
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,500
Where did the enemy come from?

304
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,860
That's the scene

305
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,700
that must happen in the script.

306
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,180
Besides,

307
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,220
I have no enemies

308
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,860
except you.

309
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,380
Get out of the way.

310
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:19,820
Your Highness.

311
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,380
Song Yi Meng.

312
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:20,980
Your Highness.

313
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,980
Something bad happened.

314
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,900
Something bad happened.

315
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,740
What happened?

316
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,780
Where did the general go?

317
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,820
Yes.

318
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,540
The general is not here

319
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,100
after such a big thing happened to him.

320
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,860
You mean...

321
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,980
General.

322
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,700
General.

323
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,140
You are finally back.

324
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,460
General.

325
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,580
You should take a decision

326
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,940
about the general's life.

327
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,180
Yan Yi.

328
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,180
How will the Ministry of Justice

329
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,180
decide about this?

330
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,100
General.

331
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,220
Last night, Gao Xiang's body

332
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,460
was sent back to the Jinzhao Mansion

333
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,660
by Lord Chu at once.

334
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,660
This morning,

335
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,380
Lord Chu came to the palace to meet His Majesty.

336
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,660
During this period,

337
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,500
the Ministry of Justice has no chance

338
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,900
to intervene in this matter.

339
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,420
Liao Qian.

340
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,900
Didn't I tell you to

341
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,420
keep an eye on Qian Yu's action?

342
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,300
Why did you let Chu Guihong take the county?

343
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,860
Your Highness.

344
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,140
No.

345
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,580
General.

346
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,100
I will follow your order

347
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,580
and obey your orders every night.

348
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,580
Be serious.

349
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,420
However,

350
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,780
what is surprising is

351
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,820
that last night, General Chu took Ronghua

352
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,900
to see off Gao Xiang.

353
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,420
When they were separated,

354
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,540
something happened.

355
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,500
They were killed and killed.

356
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,140
Are you deaf?

357
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,740
I heard that

358
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,300
the sound of the wind was too loud.

359
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,340
They were killed as well.

360
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,780
Come back quickly.

361
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,480
Have porcelain

362
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,980
bags.

363
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,780
Listen.

364
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,700
I won't regain the lower rank

365
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,500
until General Chu

366
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,260
dies in the 우르

367
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,040
and does η

368
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,500
Let's return.

369
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,980
I failed to

370
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,620
trust you since that day

371
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,060
when you were一

372
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,260
the leader of theols

373
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,300
General, Chu Guihong's actions are quite strange.

374
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,300
He sent the Prime Minister and the Emperor to attack the Emperor.

375
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,300
I fear that he might have some evil intentions

376
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,800
and harm you.

377
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,300
General, why don't we send someone

378
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,300
to use the death of the Prime Minister

379
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,300
to attack Chu Guihong?

380
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,300
That's right, General.

381
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,300
Since General Chu saw the Prime Minister last night,

382
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,800
why don't we use this matter

383
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,300
to accuse him of being dead

384
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,300
and deliberately release those little people

385
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,300
who are under the feet of the Emperor?

386
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,900
If we can use this to stop the Emperor's

387
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,300
defense of the Emperor,

388
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,300
then the death of the Prime Minister

389
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,300
will be our help.

390
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,300
You're right.

391
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,300
That's right.

392
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,300
General,

393
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,300
the death of the Prime Minister has been decided.

394
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,300
Please don't worry.

395
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,300
But now,

396
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,300
how to stabilize the state of the Prime Minister

397
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,300
who is deliberately attacking him

398
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,300
is the most important thing.

399
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,300
No matter what,

400
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,300
you still have us.

401
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,300
Yes.

402
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,300
Enough.

403
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,300
I have my own conclusion.

404
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,300
You can all leave.

405
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,300
Yes.

406
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,300
People are really different.

407
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,300
When Gao Qiang was here,

408
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,300
these people were all behind the bars

409
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,300
and were only following orders.

410
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,300
Now?

411
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,300
They've been gone for less than 12 hours

412
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,300
and they've changed their faces.

413
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,300
How can we use the death of the Prime Minister

414
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,300
to make a fuss about everything?

415
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
It's too normal.

416
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,300
How sincere can there be in a fist fight?

417
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,300
By the way,

418
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,300
how's the investigation going on with the man in black?

419
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,300
And who put the trap in the cave?

420
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,300
Do you have any clues?

421
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,300
We're still investigating

422
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,300
the man in black.

423
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,300
But the weapons and rope

424
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,300
in the cave

425
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,300
were put there by you before.

426
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
I put it there?

427
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,300
What do you mean I put it there?

428
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,300
I just found out.

429
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,300
Two years ago,

430
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
the more the river was almost exposed,

431
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,300
you ordered Long and Hu

432
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,300
to turn these weapons

433
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,300
in the cave over.

434
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,300
At the time, both of them

435
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,300
didn't know who you were.

436
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,300
Long came to the cave

437
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,300
in Hu Yang Lin.

438
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,300
He put the things there.

439
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,300
Hu followed the trick of the Black Armor Army

440
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,300
and made some traps

441
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,300
with the rope.

442
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,300
To hide it from others,

443
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,300
in case it was exposed in the future,

444
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,300
he pushed it to you.

445
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,300
Why did he push it to me?

446
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,300
Who taught you the nickname of Sha Shen?

447
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,300
I…

448
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,300
I'm the one who killed the God of Death.

449
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,300
So I'm the one who killed the God of Death.

450
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,300
I deserve it, right?

451
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,300
Enough.

452
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
Don't investigate the man in black.

453
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,300
Go to the Jinzhao Prefecture right now.

454
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
Give Chu Gui Hong the pressure.

455
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,300
Let him release Shang Guan and the others.

456
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,300
Yes.

457
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,300
I won't let you investigate.

458
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
You're the only one who's making trouble.

459
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,300
You're a liar.

460
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,300
You mean

461
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,300
Old Seven killed Gao Changying?

462
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,300
Yes.

463
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,300
I suspect

464
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,300
that the case of the case of the Seventh Prince

465
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,300
is new to Prime Minister Gao.

466
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,300
I'm worried that

467
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,300
he might do something to him

468
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
in the battle of Pingrong.

469
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,300
I'll tell the world that he's the one who killed the God of Death.

470
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,300
I beg Your Majesty

471
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
to investigate the truth of the battle of Pingrong.

472
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,300
This is a big matter.

473
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,300
We can't trust only one word from Gao Changying.

474
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,300
If you want to re-examine the whole Pingrong world

475
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,300
and find the truth,

476
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,300
you'd better find out

477
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,300
who killed Gao Changying first.

478
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,300
If it's really what Old Seven did,

479
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
I'll make a decision.

480
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,300
I'll investigate both cases.

481
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
Once I find the evidence of the battle of Pingrong,

482
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,300
I'll prove it to my father and the Imperial Army.

483
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,300
Then,

484
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,300
Your Majesty can take this opportunity

485
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,300
to completely remove

486
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,300
the power of Nan Heng in the court.

487
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:43,300
Ten, ten, ten, fifteen, twenty.

488
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,300
Not bad, not bad.

489
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Come on, come on.

490
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
Ten, twenty, twenty.

491
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,300
Come on, come on.

492
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,300
We won again.

493
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,300
General.

494
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,300
You guys play.

495
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,300
I'm tired.

496
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,300
The situation of the first meeting

497
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,300
has been arranged properly.

498
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
Shangguan, Baihe and others

499
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,300
can be released at any time.

500
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,300
You take them back to Cangjiang Yue.

501
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,300
I want you to take this opportunity

502
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,300
to find out the life of each Night God

503
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,300
by matching Cangjiang Yue.

504
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,300
What do you mean by this?

505
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,300
Nan Heng made a plan

506
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,300
to destroy the battle of Pingrong.

507
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,300
But the records of me asking for help

508
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,300
to him in the Imperial Army

509
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,300
were all taken back by Ren Jin Shu.

510
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,300
This matter must have caused

511
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,300
his people to get involved in Qianyu Army

512
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,300
and get involved.

513
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,300
Then, they disguised as real kings

514
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,300
and escaped.

515
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,300
What you mean is

516
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
that the people who escaped

517
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,300
might be hiding in Cangjiang Yue.

518
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,300
If it weren't for the mysterious

519
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,300
Night God power of these people,

520
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,300
where else would they be?

521
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,300
Here they are, brothers.

522
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,300
Isn't this Lord Chu?

523
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,300
Why did you come to see us in person?

524
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,300
Nan Heng used the 60-pointed border

525
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,300
to exchange for Cangjiang Yue to cross the Minglu River.

526
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
You can go now.

527
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
Please.

528
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,300
My advice

529
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,300
is not to put it in your heart.

530
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,300
Trust him.

531
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,300
It won't end well.

532
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,300
The last time, the head-cutter

533
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,300
didn't let you eat the meal.

534
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,300
When you're willing to give up your life,

535
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,300
I will prepare a good wine and good dishes.

536
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,300
Then, I will ask you

537
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,300
to give me more suggestions.

538
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,300
The head-cutter has no food to eat.

539
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,300
I'm tired of the suggestions.

540
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,300
But if Lord Chu

541
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,300
is willing to give up his grudge

542
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,300
and kneel down,

543
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,300
the gate of Cangjiang Yue will always be open to you.

544
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,300
By then, I will definitely

545
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,300
put a good table on it

546
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,300
and treat you well.

547
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,300
Come on.

548
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
Let's go.

549
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Come here.

550
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,300
If you still suspect that I'm guilty,

551
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,300
you can take me back to the prison and interrogate me.

552
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,300
You interrogate me again.

553
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,300
Are you crazy?

554
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,300
You scared me.

555
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,300
Don't give up.

556
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,300
Don't let me say it for the third time.

557
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,300
Come here.

558
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,300
Stand still.

559
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,300
Let's start with you.

560
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,300
Name.

561
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,300
Luan Erhu.

562
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,300
Age.

563
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,300
Twenty.

564
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,300
Where are you from?

565
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,300
Pianzhou.

566
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,300
You'd better cooperate.

567
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,300
The lips are square and the lips are straight.

568
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,300
The lips are round and the ears are fat.

569
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,300
The left side of the eyebrow is slightly higher than the right side of the eyebrow.

570
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,300
Half inch.

571
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,300
Are you done?

572
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,300
We are a club and we only have a few people.

573
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,300
You are a registered writer and a scholar.

574
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
You sent us back to be a regular, right?

575
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,300
You should be more cautious when releasing criminals.

576
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,300
Moreover, you are all from the South.

577
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,300
You can't protect the people you can't see in the future.

578
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,300
You...

579
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,300
Move.

580
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,300
What is it?

581
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,300
Your method is too practical.

582
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,300
This is an Excel table.

583
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,300
My wife taught me.

584
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,300
What is it?

585
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,300
Ten taels.

586
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,300
Jin.

587
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,300
What did you say?

588
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,300
My wife said this is called intellectual property.

589
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,300
You don't want to buy it?

590
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,300
Forget it.

591
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,300
Remember.

592
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,300
You blew up my ten taels.

593
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,300
It hurts.

594
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,300
It hurts.

595
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,300
It hurts.

596
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,300
You are moving around.

597
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,300
How can you apply the medicine?

598
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,300
What kind of medicine is this?

599
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,300
Are you hurting people or saving people?

600
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,300
You are lying.

601
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,300
This is a high-grade medicine.

602
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,300
And a high-grade liquor.

603
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,300
And a high-grade salt.

604
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,300
It's just right for you.

605
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,300
How can I be a low-grade person?

606
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,300
You are a low-grade person.

607
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,300
I know.

608
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,300
But,

609
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,300
Miss Song Er.

610
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,300
I'm happy that you came to pick me up.

611
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,300
But we are not a couple.

612
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,300
We don't have to be so friendly.

613
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,300
For a man like Master Bai He,

614
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,300
who is irresponsible and ungrateful,

615
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,300
you need to be more careful.

616
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,300
Wait a minute.

617
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,300
Come with me to see my parents.

618
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,300
See your parents?

619
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,300
The reason why I was ruined in the Forbidden City was because of you.

620
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,300
It's time for you and Nan Heng to give me an explanation.

621
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,300
Master Song Er.

622
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,300
I want to hear you explain it to me.

623
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,300
The several problems.

624
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,300
Are you really

625
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,300
playing tricks on me?

626
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,300
Or do you mean to marry me?

627
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,300
Marry?

628
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,300
Marry?

629
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,300
So you suspect that it was Gao Xiang who killed Song Yi Meng.

630
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,300
But isn't Gao Xiang dead last night?

631
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,300
Didn't he die?

632
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,300
You just had to react.

633
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,300
Right.

634
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,580
In the whole capital,

635
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,380
the only person who would spend so much energy

636
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,540
to kill Song Yi Meng

637
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,780
is Gao Xiang.

638
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,900
Now, in the case of Jiangnan,

639
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,620
he has determined that

640
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,020
Song Yi Meng made you fall into the outer river

641
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,180
and didn't intend to fight for it.

642
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,660
He wanted to get rid of the person who was behind it.

643
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,580
So,

644
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,340
if he had killed Song Yi Meng

645
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,660
and made a false move last night,

646
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,540
then all of these things would have been clear.

647
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,060
So, Gao Xiang's power

648
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,380
is much stronger than we thought.

649
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,900
Not only did he raise a dead body,

650
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,780
but he also had his men

651
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,740
in the military.

652
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,140
He helped him escape death.

653
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,580
We need to investigate this.

654
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,900
At least, we need to find out

655
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,940
how many unknowing forces

656
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,100
Gao Chang has.

657
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,220
If we let the situation develop,

658
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,700
I'm afraid that one day,

659
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,820
he will take over the imperial power.

660
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,740
It's very likely.

661
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,860
I've arranged for the military

662
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,700
to investigate the Black Armor Army.

663
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,220
But if we want to find Gao Xiang,

664
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,340
we need to use the Night God.

665
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,540
But it's easy to alert the people

666
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,740
in the Black Armor Army.

667
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,540
How about this?

668
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,220
I'll arrange for Long A Hu to investigate.

669
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,300
Okay.

670
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:05,860
What about you?

671
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,020
Me?

672
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,460
This job is not suitable for me.

673
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,420
Look at me.

674
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,460
I'm not in good health.

675
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,780
I fell down when the wind blew.

676
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,260
It's hard to investigate

677
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,580
and not leave you behind.

678
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,140
If I'm delayed,

679
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,940
it will ruin the plan of Chief.

680
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,380
You're right.

681
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,140
Yes.

682
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,340
So,

683
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,940
I'll arrange for you to do something else.

684
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,380
I've only met His Highness.

685
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,540
He wants to discuss marriage with me.

686
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,020
What?

687
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,340
Is His Highness your father?

688
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,420
We're both cultured people.

689
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,020
It's not elegant to say that.

690
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,380
Marriage is a big thing.

691
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,380
We can't rush it.

692
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,500
We won't talk about it for now.

693
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,500
But the thing in the Purple Pavilion

694
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,100
is indeed my fault.

695
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,300
I have to go there in person

696
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,740
and explain it to the second brother.

697
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,660
I think it's getting late.

698
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,460
How about we leave now?

699
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,060
Is His Highness

700
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,020
asking you to come to my house

701
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,020
because he has a task?

702
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,460
Is he asking you

703
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,300
to keep an eye on my elder sister?

704
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,500
You're indeed the most talented girl in the capital.

705
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,900
People say that Miss Song'er is very smart.

706
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,940
She can't hide anything

707
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,620
from your beautiful eyes.

708
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,500
So,

709
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,100
are you willing to

710
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,140
do me a small favor?

711
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,900
Tell me.

712
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,540
What did His Highness threaten you with?

713
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,740
You should just

714
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,580
do your job

715
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,820
in the middle of the month.

716
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,300
You don't have many choices.

717
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,740
Ai Qi?

718
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,740
You're so arrogant.

719
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,700
You're so lazy.

720
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,660
I didn't expect you to be like this.

721
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,980
You misunderstood me.

722
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,060
Fine.

723
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,460
I can take you to the Song family.

724
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,140
I'll add a room

725
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,940
with a good view of the south and north.

726
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,700
How can you do that?

727
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,780
I'll add two maids.

728
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,660
I'll serve you with the food

729
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,660
that you like.

730
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,420
Really?

731
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,700
The monthly salary is doubled.

732
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,900
You can also have three days off every month.

733
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:01,780
Wait.

734
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,740
What should I pay

735
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,220
for such a generous revenge?

736
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,820
If I call you,

737
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,140
you can call me as you like.

738
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,780
Call me as you like?

739
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,420
My hero,

740
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,940
can you take over my job?

741
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,100
I...

742
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,580
Forget it.

743
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,740
What's on your mind?

744
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,620
Seventh Prince is a thief.

745
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,820
If he finds out that I'm taking over his job,

746
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,220
I'll...

747
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,380
As long as you don't tell him,

748
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,580
he won't know.

749
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,500
That's true.

750
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,620
What else do I need to do?

751
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,100
You just need to sell your wings.

752
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,500
You don't need to sell your body.

753
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,900
Deal.

754
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,660
Miss.

755
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,500
I've heard about it.

756
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,420
What did you say?

757
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,020
Last night,

758
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,500
besides the matter between you and Seventh Prince,

759
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,980
there was also a big thing in the capital.

760
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,980
Gao Xiang died?

761
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,180
Seventh Prince went out in a hurry.

762
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,540
He must have said it for this matter.

763
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,500
Gao Xiang died?

764
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,860
Why would Gao Changying die?

765
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,660
In the whole script,

766
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,540
he lived to the end

767
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,140
and shared the world with Nan Heng.

768
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,260
The big villain

769
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,580
died so easily?

770
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,260
Who did you hear from?

771
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,380
Is the news reliable?

772
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,500
Absolutely.

773
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,340
Hu Da, the master, told me.

774
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,380
He said that the master went to the Ministry of Justice in a hurry.

775
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,980
After he came out, he looked very upset.

776
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,460
Sister.

777
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,380
Is Gao Xiang really dead?

778
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,100
Meng Er.

779
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,580
If Seventh Prince comes to see you recently,

780
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,220
you must not see him.

781
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,380
Why?

782
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,820
Although the Jingzhao Mansion and the Black Armor Army

783
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,180
are suppressing the news,

784
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,820
there are many rumors in the capital

785
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,540
that Seventh Prince killed Gao Xiang.

786
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,820
This is ridiculous.

787
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,100
Last night, Nan Heng

788
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,660
was with me all the time.

789
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,620
He didn't have time to kill anyone.

790
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,100
Gao Xiang died

791
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,300
because of the firepower and the grenade.

792
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,340
The ball car that escorted Gao Xiang

793
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,740
was filled with firepower.

794
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,620
The grenade exploded on the way.

795
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,060
More than ten people were killed

796
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,140
and the body was blown up instantly.

797
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,580
Firepower?

798
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,180
Why does it sound so familiar?

799
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,020
This is...

800
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,020
A report.

801
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,420
In the battle at the border last year,

802
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,700
He Yuan and His Highness

803
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,460
had an appointment to fight outside the city of You.

804
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,860
His Highness defeated him in that battle.

805
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,700
And the thing that Seventh Prince burned

806
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,220
the food and food storage of the other party

807
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,380
was the firepower.

808
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,340
That's impossible.

809
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,940
Nan Heng is not that kind of person.

810
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,020
He would never kill Gao Tangyin.

811
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,020
I'm not that kind of person.

812
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,980
I'm just a person who can't kill anyone.

813
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,940
Meng.

814
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,180
Now that Gao Xiang is dead,

815
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,260
all the forces in the court

816
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,340
will use this opportunity to make a big mistake.

817
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,220
If in the end,

818
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,020
Seventh Prince really killed Gao Xiang,

819
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,660
I'm afraid that the Qing Dynasty will change.

820
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,340
Sister-in-law's skill is very accurate.

821
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,340
It's a one-off.

822
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,700
What did you see?

823
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,060
The bone is broken continuously.

824
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:28,180
The blood vessels and muscles are strong.

825
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,340
This person

826
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,300
should be a dead body

827
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,900
that was killed by someone else.

828
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,340
What's wrong?

829
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,340
I know this note.

830
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,340
General.

831
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,780
This is the information of all the Ye Youshens.

832
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,020
We didn't find anyone

833
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,020
who is related to our Qianyu Army.

834
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,020
The background of the Imperial Concubine

835
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,220
may also be faked.

836
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,500
Take a few people

837
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,780
to the hometown of these people

838
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,780
and check it again.

839
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,580
Yes.

840
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,580
Brother.

841
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,260
Look what I brought you.

842
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,580
This is the money from my mother.

843
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,580
Don't do this.

844
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,980
How did it become like this?

845
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,980
Brother,

846
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,980
I'm sorry.

847
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,980
I'm sorry.

848
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,980
I'm sorry.

849
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,460
How did it become like this?

850
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,460
Come on.

851
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,820
What a pity.

852
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,980
What are you looking at?

853
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,980
The same.

854
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,580
The same cloth.

855
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,460
The same.

856
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,180
Brother,

857
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,860
this is just an ordinary cloth.

858
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,060
Why is it so big?

859
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,380
This is Qianyu Army's

860
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,980
Eastern clothes cloth at the border.

861
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,460
Its owner

862
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,980
may be an old friend of Qianyu Army.

863
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,980
Are you thinking too much?

864
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,580
In recent years,

865
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,980
there have been many trade relations between the capital and the border.

866
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,980
This same cloth

867
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,980
is very expensive.

868
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,980
It's not worth it.

869
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,580
There are many trade relations between the border and the capital.

870
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,380
This same cloth

871
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,380
can be bought in the capital.

872
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,380
This is a cloth for military service.

873
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,380
It's cold at the border.

874
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,980
When you're in the war,

875
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,380
your clothes are often worn out.

876
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,580
My father specially chose

877
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,780
a rough cloth

878
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,380
to make the Eastern clothes of Qianyu Army.

879
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,780
You mean

880
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,180
you can't buy this cloth for money?

881
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,580
Your Highness,

882
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,780
where did you buy the red cloth?

883
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,780
I bought it for you.

884
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,780
I'm sorry.

885
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,780
I'm sorry.

886
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,780
I'm sorry.

887
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,780
I'm sorry.

888
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,780
I'm sorry.

889
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,780
I'm sorry.

890
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,780
I'm sorry.

891
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,780
I'm sorry.

892
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,780
I'm sorry.

893
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,780
I'm sorry.

894
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,780
I'm sorry.

895
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,780
I'm sorry.

896
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,780
I'm sorry.

897
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,780
I'm sorry.

898
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,780
I'm sorry.

899
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,780
I'm sorry.

900
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,780
I'm sorry.

901
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,780
I'm sorry.

902
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,780
I'm sorry.

903
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,780
I'm sorry.

904
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,780
I'm sorry.

905
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,780
I'm sorry.

906
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,780
I'm sorry.

907
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,780
I'm sorry.

908
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,780
I'm sorry.

909
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,780
I'm sorry.

910
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,780
I'm sorry.

911
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,780
I'm sorry.

912
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,580
You broke into my trap.

913
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,580
You think you're too lucky.

914
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,580
Who are you?

915
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,780
We're businessmen.

916
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,980
We have a big business.

917
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,580
Do you want to meet?

918
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,580
Oh.

919
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,580
I'm not a person who can't get along with money.

920
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,180
I don't know what kind of business you two are doing.

921
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,780
Kill people.

922
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,180
We want to talk to your boss.

923
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,780
Want to see our boss.

924
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,580
This sincerity.

925
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,980
Almost interesting.

926
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,980
What about these clothes?

927
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,780
I believe you can see it.

928
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,180
This is a common thing among the powerful.

929
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,780
If you're going to eat, don't talk nonsense.

930
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,980
Hurry up and introduce.

931
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,980
Tonight at midnight.

932
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,780
Jiang Song Lin in the suburbs.

933
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,980
I brought the owner to see you.

934
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,380
Here's the vegetables.

935
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,380
Come on.

936
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,180
Why would the world come to this kind of place to buy red tangerines?

937
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,780
Isn't this the winter's favorite?

938
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,780
Mother's favorite is the red tangerine.

939
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,180
I think this thing is not common in the capital.

940
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,780
Just let people learn from it.

941
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,580
Why don't you have any people who sell red tangerines?

942
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,780
Ji Xiang said it was bought in Nancheng.

943
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,780
I don't know.

944
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,780
Come on.

945
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,180
Cousin, look.

946
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,780
