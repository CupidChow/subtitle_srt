00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
When the lamp appears at noon

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,220
Episode 8

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,640
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,700
You can go back.

63
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,220
Come on.

64
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:09,920
Let's go.

65
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,220
This way, take this.

66
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,540
Look.

67
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,420
Look.

68
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,540
One right, two left.

69
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,700
This is not the room we used.

70
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:26,900
It's here.

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If it's not the crown prince's birthday,

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,640
then it's the emperor's idea.

73
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,400
He...

74
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,800
Tingting, don't worry.

75
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,920
As long as you don't agree,

76
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,400
I will not force you.

77
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,200
How about this?

78
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,800
Tomorrow...

79
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,440
No, I'll go to father later.

80
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,360
I'll make it clear.

81
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,960
Let him get rid of this idea, okay?

82
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,320
Okay.

83
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,240
Then please take care of the crown prince.

84
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,000
It's my duty.

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,760
Tingting!

86
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,760
If...

87
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,360
I mean if...

88
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,560
If Shangguan He is not here,

89
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,760
or if he is not good to you,

90
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,320
will you...

91
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,440
Will you consider me?

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,920
Father, I'm back.

93
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,440
Your Excellency,

94
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,040
Your Highness.

95
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,400
Your Highness, please.

96
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,960
Your Excellency, please.

97
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
How can I do this?

98
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,360
Your Highness, please.

99
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,160
No, no, no.

100
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,760
Your Excellency, please.

101
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,560
Your Highness, please.

102
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,880
Enough.

103
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,480
The door is so wide.

104
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,920
We can't walk together.

105
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,400
So many people...

106
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
ï¿½

107
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,400
I am so screwed up now.

108
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,480
Then we should stay together.

109
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,600
You leave?

110
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,200
Father.

111
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,520
It's my family's day today

112
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,480
and I didn't see Tingting and his wife.

113
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,740
You should have more courage.

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If she really wants to piss me off,

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
then just continue to be with that Jianghu guy.

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Go tell my mother,

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and force me to marry 18th prince.

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I will give her a child with Shangguan He.

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What did you say?

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I said you, this damn girl,

121
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
do you know shame?

122
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm talking to you.

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You really want to piss me off.

124
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm the one who has shame.

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Mother, go marry 18th prince.

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You piss me off.

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Go.

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's a family dinner today.

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Everyone doesn't have to be so far away.

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Right.

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You don't eat meat,

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
you can't have a child.

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I didn't want to have a child.

134
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Ting,

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
you've lost a lot of weight recently.

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Come on, come on.

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll give you a shrimp.

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What shrimp does he eat?

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He's not a kid.

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Drink soup.

141
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I think he should drink Meng Po soup.

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let him see more of those

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
good and excellent men in the next life.

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The good men you're talking about

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
are just a bunch of vulgar things.

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's okay not to see.

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes, yes, yes.

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I think he's not a good man.

149
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He should be in your eyes.

150
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Your highness,

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
this braised pork feet

152
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
is a specialty of our Song family.

153
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You must try it.

154
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Thank you, Song Dan.

155
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's quite salty today.

156
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Eat a quail egg.

157
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Come on.

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Eat shrimp.

159
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yes, yes.

160
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Shrimp is delicious.

161
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes, yes.

162
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Thank you.

163
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Well,

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Mrs. Song,

165
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Mr. Song,

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
today is the first time

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I eat with you.

168
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
From now on, we're a family.

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I propose a toast to you.

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay, okay.

171
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You're being polite.

172
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Didn't you just say

173
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
that today is a family dinner.

174
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No need to be polite.

175
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Why are you being so polite?

176
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't go too far.

177
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
No, Song Yu De,

178
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
can you not

179
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
pretend to be confused?

180
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Don't you know that the guy A Ting likes

181
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
is your man?

182
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Mother,

183
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
today is the first day of the wedding dinner.

184
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Do you want to embarrass everyone?

185
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Do I have to embarrass everyone?

186
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Have you forgotten

187
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
how they hurt you

188
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
in the broken room of the Forbidden City?

189
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Have you forgotten all that?

190
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Mrs. Song,

191
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I was wrong

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
about the Forbidden City.

193
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm sorry

194
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Mrs. Song, I'm sorry.

195
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll make up for it

196
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
if you need anything in the future.

197
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's serious. It's serious. It's okay.

198
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's not enough.

199
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Your man Shang Guan He

200
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
is still in our family.

201
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If he hadn't been after Ting,

202
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
would Ting's marriage be like this?

203
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Do we have to offend the emperor

204
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and Prince 18?

205
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Mother, don't talk nonsense.

206
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's my idea to not marry Prince 18.

207
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It has nothing to do with the Crown Prince, Shang Guan He.

208
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Even so,

209
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
the Crown Prince still owes us an explanation.

210
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If you really feel sorry,

211
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
you should send your man Shang Guan He

212
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
directly to Jiangnan

213
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
so that we can never see him again.

214
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Your Highness, let's drink.

215
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
No.

216
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No.

217
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Are you okay?

218
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'll take care of Shang Guan He.

219
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Mother, you don't have to make things difficult for others.

220
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm done eating. Enjoy your meal.

221
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Sir Song, Mrs. Song,

222
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I still have to do some work.

223
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,800
Enjoy your meal.

224
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay.

225
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,360
Father, Madam, enjoy your meal.

226
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,480
Eat, eat, eat.

227
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,400
You eat, you eat.

228
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,920
An Qi.

229
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,440
I'm sorry.

230
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,000
Do you think Shangguan He

231
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,880
likes Ting or not?

232
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,840
He wants to pay you back.

233
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,960
If he doesn't like her,

234
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,440
you should tell him in advance.

235
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,480
So he won't miss her.

236
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,640
He has already completed the task I gave him.

237
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,320
He won't go back until it's too late.

238
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,040
Do you think he's not moved?

239
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,640
Look.

240
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,320
He's moved,

241
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,440
but he doesn't take the initiative, refuse or take responsibility.

242
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,640
He's just a fish.

243
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,440
He's wasting Ting's youth for nothing.

244
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,000
What do you mean?

245
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Listen.

246
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,840
Men are different from women.

247
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,320
Shangguan He is different from other men.

248
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,280
He likes Song Yiting,

249
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,240
but he's also afraid.

250
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,560
What?

251
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,320
Tell me.

252
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,600
What is he afraid of?

253
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,440
Your sister,

254
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,200
whether it's appearance, talent,

255
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,720
virtue or cultivation,

256
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,360
she's all different.

257
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,320
Besides, there are still men who are pursuing her.

258
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,960
But what is Shangguan He?

259
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,000
He's just a wild horse.

260
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,640
What can he give your sister?

261
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,800
These are the reasons for the mutual respect.

262
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,280
Old and old.

263
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,760
After all,

264
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,720
it's the self-esteem of men like you that's wrong.

265
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,400
You're right.

266
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,520
But it's also wrong.

267
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,960
Shangguan He doesn't want to be a drunkard.

268
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,960
But he wants to protect your sister.

269
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,080
He thinks that

270
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,280
since he can't give the future he wants,

271
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,680
the life he wants,

272
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,720
he'd better not start.

273
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,600
Why aren't you afraid that you can't give me my future,

274
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,600
but you insist on starting with me?

275
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,960
I'm the man.

276
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,960
I can give you whatever you want.

277
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:52,840
He likes you

278
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,560
but he lost its peace.

279
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,580
Please open your eyes and face the reality

280
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,480
this way

281
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,280
It is slightly difficult

282
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,800
to battle against the BTS

283
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,080
who is currently on the stage

284
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,760
However

285
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,860
the epitome of happiness

286
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,320
forever

287
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,500
is finally dead

288
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,860
It is surely time for you to

289
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,800
continue the tasks elves have sent you

290
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,580
Now that you have made your entrance

291
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,460
Now that the remaining Business decentralized

292
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,980
IX has made its first move

293
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,980
Do you like the master's zither?

294
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,980
I'll buy you these, okay?

295
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,980
Actually, I'm quite free recently.

296
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,980
The big boss is not available to talk to me.

297
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,980
Long and Hu are back.

298
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,980
Only they are here.

299
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,980
Shangguan He, what do you mean?

300
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,980
Even if my mother is forced to marry me,

301
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,980
marriage is just a family thing for me.

302
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,980
And you, seeing the pressure I'm under,

303
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,980
you don't have the courage to break the marriage,

304
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,980
or to elope.

305
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,980
You just don't understand the meaning of this.

306
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,980
What do you mean?

307
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,980
I...

308
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,980
If you have no other answer, please go back.

309

Other than Wave

312
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,980
It is Shandong

313
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,700
You can go away if you want

314
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,060
But you can never leave, I promise

315
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,240
Just one more day

316
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,220
Don't hate him

317
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,340
I want to live a happy life

318
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,680

321
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,480
The road to its throne is long

322
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,200
Green oneself

323
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,840
The north is in danger

324
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,840
I'm afraid that you will be in danger.

325
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840
I'm afraid that you will be in danger.

326
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,840
I'm afraid that you will be in danger.

327
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,840
I will save your life.

328
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,840
Uncle!

329
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,840
Uncle!

330
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840
It's me, uncle!

331
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
Nanrui!

332
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,840
You've grown up so much.

333
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,840
You're taller than me.

334
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,840
Uncle, I can't believe that you're alive.

335
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,840
That's great!

336
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840
Cousin, you...

337
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,840
His Majesty ordered that the King of Qianyu returned to the capital

338
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,840
to hold a banquet.

339
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Please come inside and discuss it.

340
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,840
Nanrui, come inside.

341
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Let's go.

342
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
Come.

343
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,840
Come.

344
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
Come.

345
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,840
Come.

346
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,840
Come.

347
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Come.

348
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,840
Come.

349
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,840
Come.

350
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,840
Come.

351
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,840
Come.

352
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,840
Come.

353
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
Come.

354
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,840
So you changed the plot?

355
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,840
It's okay.

356
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
In this situation,

357
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:57,340
the ice will fall and the water will be

358
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
cold.

359
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,840
So, changing your fate

360
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,840
is not a golden hand.

361
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
It's you and me.

362
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,840
But...

363
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,840
In the future, no matter what happens,

364
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,840
I will face it with you.

365
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,840
excellent,

366
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,840
beautiful,

367
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,840
outstanding,

368
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,260
andï¿½

369
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,260
I didn't miss the moment when we made it right.

370
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,260
I really do believe that

371
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,260
we will be there soon

372
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,260
no matter what happens.

373
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,260
Usually the Cuz carried you back with it.

374
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,260
Why did you make the seventh prince the crown prince?

375
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,820
Uncle

376
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,860
Actually, this old Qi is not bad

377
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,140
Thanks to him

378
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,860
The great cause was exposed

379
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,420
Revealed the innocence of the Qianyun Army

380
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,220
Besides, I have no heart

381
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,900
Can't be the crown prince

382
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,660
Father conferred him as a reasonable person

383
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:58,820
Uncle

384
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,100
Now the court is finally peaceful

385
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,740
This cousin assassinated the old Qi

386
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,460
The old Qi also promised not to pursue

387
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,980
Or we will be even, okay?

388
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,980
Walk in front of the ghost gate

389
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,620
I have thought about a lot of things

390
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,660
Honger

391
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,100
Today in front of your aunt

392
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,300
Should you

393
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,540
Apologize to the emperor seriously

394
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,940
I should have stopped guarding the border

395
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,140
But left the position without permission

396
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,940
In the impulsive attack of the crown prince

397
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,140
The crime is unforgivable

398
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,700
I beg your majesty

399
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,860
For the sake of the past

400
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,860
For the sake of the border guard of the Great Jin

401
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,660
Give me another chance

402
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,260
I will make up for the mistake

403
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,340
For the Great Jin

404
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,340
I will do everything for the Great Jin

405
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,460
Chu Guihong

406
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,700
You were once the most beloved child of Yu Rong

407
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,780
Between the old Qi

408
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,900
In the end

409
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,140
It's all because of these old wishes

410
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,420
Caused a mess

411
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,820
Now that the King of Qianyu has returned to the capital

412
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,220
I have no intention to let you two separate

413
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,060
These days

414
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,900
Just stay in the capital for the time being

415
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,980
Thank you, your Majesty

416
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,780
But

417
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,940
If you dare to be rude to my crown prince again

418
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,980
Next time

419
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,780
There will be no such good luck this time

420
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,380
Did dad say something wrong?

421
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,500
The emperor is a lover

422
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
He Nanrui doesn't even have a brain

423
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,900
As long as you show your attitude

424
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,260
The past things will definitely work

425
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,620
It's easy to deal with others

426
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,420
But Nan Heng

427
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,020
I and her have reached this point

428
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,860
Want to really get rid of the boundary

429
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,860
Get her trust

430
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,460
I'm afraid it's not that easy

431
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,100
Son

432
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,060
What are you afraid of?

433
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,580
Isn't it because of dad?

434
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,300
Tonight at the banquet

435
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,820
Dad will help you get rid of the boundary

436
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,220
I will help you get rid of Nan Heng

437
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,660
Uncle

438
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,020
You have suffered outside for these days

439
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,540
Eat more meat to make up

440
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,900
Crown prince

441
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,620
I apologize to you

442
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,580
But I was in trouble on the day of the crown prince's wedding

443
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,540
Although the crown prince is rich and rich

444
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,540
I didn't pursue it

445
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,860
But I am really ashamed

446
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,220
I will punish myself for this cup

447
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,300
Thank you for being generous and generous

448
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,380
I will not save you

449
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,020
You see, I said it a long time ago

450
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,260
Old seven is generous and generous

451
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,980
Not a person who cares, right?

452
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,780
Prince

453
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,300
I have a matter

454
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,540
I can't solve it

455
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,380
Your Highness, please tell me

456
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,940
When this vase broke

457
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,740
Even a little bird can't fly out

458
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,140
How did you escape from heaven?

459
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,780
I remember when the city was broken

460
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,380
I was going to protect the flag and fight until the last moment

461
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,020
But some generals knocked me out

462
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,420
Put on my armor and disguise me

463
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,660
And helped me change into the armor of the He Yuan people

464
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,540
Hiding in the dead people of the other party

465
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,140
I just escaped

466
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,780
After you escaped from the vase

467
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,620
Why don't you come to meet me?

468
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,780
Instead, you went to the mountain to shoot water

469
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,540
I am afraid that I will not be able to help you

470
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,140
I went to shoot water

471
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,660
I had a deep misunderstanding about you

472
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,780
I even thought that the battle of Pingrong had your hand

473
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,860
Naturally, I don't want to go to the Black Armor Army

474
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,420
After the Black Armor Army returned to the court

475
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,620
Why don't you go back to the capital to meet the emperor?

476
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,100
Don't you trust the emperor?

477
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,260
Those days

478
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,300
I was lost in the wild

479
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,500
I didn't expect that the war was dying

480
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,180
I just want to make a confession

481
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,500
But I still have a son

482
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500
He lost his mother and no brothers and sisters since childhood

483
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,580
How can I think at ease?

484
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,020
For him, I have to give up my power

485
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,580
Escaped to the capital to find a chance to meet with my brother

486
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,540
We parents are just thinking about this

487
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,980
Chu Li, come, I understand you

488
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,220
Thank you, your Majesty

489
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,420
Your Highness, I know

490
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,900
The Chu family and you have been separated for many years

491
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,100
There is a deep misunderstanding

492
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,860
I came back this time

493
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,780
I didn't threaten your Highness

494
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,220
Please don't mind the previous

495
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,500
In the future, I will definitely get close to the capital

496
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,220
With your Highness, we work together to defend the Black Mountain

497
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,020
Your Highness is joking

498
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,460
I am a friend of the young general

499
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,900
I will definitely remember the previous and defend the Great Jin

500
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,900
Dear friends, just wait for this dish

501
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,340
This dish is the famous Da Ze deer meat

502
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,460
It's not easy to get it, everyone will taste it quickly

503
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,460
Fresh and tender, the taste is very good

504
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,980
This Da Ze deer meat is indeed famous

505
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,860
Elderly Please

506
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,820
It's so late now, why hasn't Nanê² returned yet?

507
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,140
Is something going on?

508
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,140
Don't shout, don't shout

509
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,140
It's me

510
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,140
Song Xiaoyu

511
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,140
It's me

512
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,140
You are

513
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,140
I have called you Song Xiaoyu, who else can it be?

514
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,140
What Song Xiaoyu, Song Daiyu

515
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,140
Sorry, you have the wrong person

516
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,140
I'm not Song Xiaoyu

517
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,140
Gongting Yuyue wine

518
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,140
I

519
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,140
One hundred and eight hundred and one cup

520
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,140
Digging machine technology, which wall

521
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,140
Chinese Shandong Zhang Lan wall

522
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,140
Meng Hangrui Tianhe

523
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,140
Yi Rong Xu De Yi

524
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,140
I want to see you perform

525
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,140
You are also dressed up

526
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,140
You have seen the script

527
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,140
But you are

528
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,140
What is this

529
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,140
You

530
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,140
Editor teacher

531
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,140
You are an editor teacher

532
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,140
I didn't talk to you formally that day

533
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,140
Today I introduce myself

534
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,140
My name is Li Bixiong, the pen name is Bixiong

535
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,140
You can call me Bixiong

536
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,140
No, you are embarrassed to find me

537
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,140
Just because of you

538
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,140
Every time it's that keyboard player

539
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,140
I and Nanhe are in danger

540
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,140
Are you enemies with me?

541
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,140
You still say

542
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,140
You always change the script for no reason

543
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,140
I can't teach the script

544
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,140
The director of the producer is a big hit to me

545
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,140
Who am I going to cry with

546
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,140
The same is the world's great worker, right?

547
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,140
Understand understand

548
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,140
Understand understand

549
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,140
But how did you wear it?

550
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,140
It's also a rainy day

551
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,140
Also came

552
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,140
And

553
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,140
How do you know I'm in the flower shop now?

554
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,140
This is a long story

555
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,140
Long story short

556
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,140
I have something to ask for these years

557
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,140
What is it

558
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,140
I am now in the flower shop

559
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,140
I am in the flower shop

560
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,140
I am in the flower shop

561
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,140
Isn't my identity now the King of the Thousand Jade?

562
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,140
But in a few days

563
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,140
He Chu Guihong has begun to suspect me

564
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,140
I have to quickly remove his concerns

565
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,140
If he finds out my identity

566
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,140
Then the world will collapse

567
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,140
Collapse

568
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,140
Then how do you hope I can help you?

569
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,140
Live in your house

570
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,140
Don't contact Chu Guihong

571
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,140
Don't do it

572
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,140
Live there

573
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,140
I'm afraid this is not suitable

574
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,140
I am now married

575
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,140
Not to mention the Crown Prince's Mansion

576
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,140
You may have more trouble when you go there

577
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,140
I almost forgot

578
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,140
You have married Nanhang

579
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,140
Old prince

580
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,140
You said you were going out of the palace

581
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,140
How did you come out of the harem

582
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,140
Brother Liu

583
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,140
This old prince is drunk

584
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,140
I'll help him

585
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,140
Drunk drunk

586
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,140
Your Highness, go back quickly

587
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,140
His Majesty is waiting to drink with you

588
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,140
Coming coming

589
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,140
Consider my first round

590
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,140
I'll go to the Crown Prince's Mansion to find you

591
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,140
Drunk drunk

592
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,140
Actually not drunk

593
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,140
You slow down

594
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:14,140
It's okay, I can still continue

595
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,140
The palace is the palace

596
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,140
This wine is delicious

597
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,140
The meat is delicious

598
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,140
Stinky feet

599
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,140
Say

600
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,140
Who are you?

601
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,140
Chu Guihong

602
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,140
How dare you be so disrespectful

603
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,140
How did I teach you in the past?

604
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,140
The evil yuan people like to eat deer meat

605
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,140
Often slaughter deer in the camp

606
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,140
Cruel means

607
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,140
Father has no sympathy for this

608
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,140
I ordered my soldiers and soldiers not to eat deer meat

609
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,140
The violators are punished by military law

610
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,140
But today you are at the banquet

611
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,140
Without care to use deer meat

612
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,140
Completely forgot the rules of the sword army

613
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,140
You are definitely not my father

614
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,140
Say

615
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,140
Who are you?

616
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,140
Come on, come out here

617
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,140
What did I say when I taught you how to practice swords?

618
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,140
You

619
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,140
Stinky boy, remember

620
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,140
This is the skill of killing enemies

621
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,140
Never face your family or friends

622
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,140
Remember me

623
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,140
What's wrong with eating deer meat?

624
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:48,140
If I follow the rules and pick three, I can see you alive

625
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,140
I think you just raised the trap

626
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,140
Dare to fight with me

627
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,140
Go to the ancestral hall to get 30 plus laws

628
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,140
See me when you understand

629
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,140
Father, I

630
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,140
How can they be smarter than each other?

631
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,140
This is difficult to do

632
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:19,140
Song Xiaoyu, I really poked you to death

633
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,140
I am sorry

634
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,140
Where are my eyes?

635
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,140
Didn't do it for me

636
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,140
Do you understand or not?

637
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,140
You said the scriptwriter is the one who writes the script

638
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,140
The person in King Qianyu's body is him

639
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,140
You understand

640
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,140
I understand why you don't have any reaction

641
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,140
He knows all the people who are the characters

642
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,140
That's a hang up

643
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,140
In my opinion

644
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,140
You should prepare something valuable

645
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,140
Go to the King's Mansion to walk around

646
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:06,140
You should know that the actor who offended the scriptwriter has no good food

647
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,140
Then I ask you

648
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,140
Do you know why he came here?

649
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,140
What's the meaning of your recent work?

650
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,140
Have you ever heard the so-called keyboard sound again?

651
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,140
No

652
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,140
That's not the same

653
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,140
And the rules of this world have been broken by us

654
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,140
There is no need to be afraid of him

655
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,140
Even if he created everything outside

656
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,140
But the plot has changed here

657
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:53,140
Now he is the one who can't sit still and should be anxious

658
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,140
According to what you said

659
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,140
The scriptwriter has to come to please you

660
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,140
I can't say it clearly

661
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,140
You

662
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,140
You remember

663
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,140
You are just a producer

664
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,140
Not a producer

665
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,140
Don't be so crazy, okay?

666
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,140
Your Royal Highness

667
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,140
King Qianyu is here

668
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,140
What did I say?

669
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:27,140
Then go meet this scriptwriter

670
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,140
You come out to welcome me in person

671
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,140
Hurry up

672
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,140
I'll give you the gift

673
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,140
So you really got it right

674
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,140
I really came to please you

675
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,140
Your Royal Highness

676
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,140
I came out to fight

677
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,140
Many rules don't understand

678
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,140
You have to help me

679
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,140
So here

680
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,140
For you

681
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,140
If it's not enough

682
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,140
King Qianyu's mansion is full

683
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,140
What are you looking at?

684
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,140
No more work?

685
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,140
No more work?

686
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,140
So many people are in

687
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,140
Can't stop him

688
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,140
I said Xiaoyu

689
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,140
He looks exactly like Nanfeng

690
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,140
Even that smelly appearance

691
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,140
It's like a house carved out

692
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:35,140
You are different from King Qianyu

693
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,140
The old prince is not aware of the deer

694
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,140
And the situation is stable

695
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,140
Not like you are so rude

696
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,140
He knows

697
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,140
You

698
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,140
We are a couple

699
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,140
What's the secret between a couple?

700
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,140
None of this matters

701
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,140
Let's open the window and talk

702
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,140
Scriptwriter teacher

703
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,140
How did you get in?

704
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,140
It's all thanks to you two

705
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,140
I shave my hair every day

706
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,140
I can only squeeze out a little bit of hair

707
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,140
A little bit of hair

708
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,140
You guys

709
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,140
This is the second day

710
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,140
It's strange

711
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,140
I didn't know at first

712
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,140
Don't believe

713
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,140
I will continue to write

714
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,140
You guys continue to change

715
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,140
I write

716
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,140
Change

717
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,140
Write change

718
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,140
This is almost on

719
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,140
How do I explain to the fake house?

720
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,140
Tell them

721
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,140
The male and female actors don't cooperate

722
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,140
Teacher changes the script

723
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,140
Or say

724
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,140
This female actor

725
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,140
Come in here

726
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,140
I really have no choice

727
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,140
I just wrote a story about the script

728
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,140
Want to see what will happen

729
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,140
I didn't expect to have a fight at night

730
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,140
Get up the next day

731
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,140
Really come here

732
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,140
You said

733
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,140
You wrote yourself in

734
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,140
But your method

735
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,140
It's a little more advanced than mine

736
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,140
So you came here

737
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,140
Is to restore the plot

738
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,140
I

739
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,140
I

740
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,140
I believe the crown prince

741
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,140
Will not let this kind of thing happen

742
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,140
Right

743
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,140
That one

744
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,140
By the way, Xiaorui, don't talk about me

745
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,140
Are you used to coming here?

746
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,140
I'm fine

747
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,140
There are cars and houses in this place

748
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,140
I have a boyfriend

749
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,140
Really?

750
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,140
This has Starbucks afternoon tea

751
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,140
There are both

752
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,140
That has modern hot places

753
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,140
Anyway, I can't move

754
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,140
Pretty good

755
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,140
There is no hot water heater in the shower

756
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,140
There is no automatic toilet in the bathroom

757
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,140
You can't use your phone before you sleep

758
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,140
What kind of life is this?

759
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,140
It's like a monk

760
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,140
Qingning is about to open at the end of the month

761
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,140
This is a good S plus configuration

762
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,140
You say

763
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,140
If you are in modern times

764
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,140
That must be the next female actor

765
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,140
The old prince has something to say

766
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,140
No

767
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,140
How to survive

768
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,140
Where to live

769
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,140
That is Song Yi Meng's own choice

770
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,140
If you have a ulterior motive

771
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,140
I won't agree

772
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,140
Which eye can you see

773
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,140
I have a ulterior motive

774
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,140
Then I ask you

775
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,140
What are you doing here today?

776
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,140
Visiting the old town

777
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,140
Visiting the old town

778
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,140
Such a life around the old town

779
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,140
Can't I just say a few words?

780
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,140
I think you are a strange man

781
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,140
Intent to solve the poison

782
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,140
Too much detoxification

783
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,140
There is no way to survive

784
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,140
I say

785
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,140
Okay, okay, don't say it anymore

786
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:02,140
Nan Heng, I know your concerns

787
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,140
Editor teacher

788
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,140
I can't make out what you mean

789
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,140
Come out for me

790
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,140
Pan Nan, give me another drink

791
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,140
Last night, the old prince

792
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,140
In his heart

793
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,140
I woke up for two hours

794
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,140
And I have to go to the battle

795
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,140
I got up early

796
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,140
My umbrella is fogging up

797
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,140
What are you doing?

798
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,140
Yesterday, the prince asked me to stick the horse cloth

799
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,140
Stuck for a whole afternoon

800
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,140
Say something to build up the strength of the Qianyu army

801
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,140
I get up early

802
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,140
My legs are as big as a board

803
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,140
What are you doing?

804
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,140
What are you doing?

805
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,140
I don't have anything to do

806
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,140
Now don't fight

807
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,140
I don't even know how to fight

808
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,140
Go to the car to run

809
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,140
General, I am sorry

810
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,140
Brothers in the county

811
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,140
Always joking around

812
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,140
Don't take it to heart

813
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,140
At that time, Pingrong City

814
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,140
The compatriots who witnessed the father's death

815
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,140
You can only be those

816
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,140
Why did the general ask this question?

817
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,140
There are some things

818
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,140
I always have doubts in my heart

819
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,140
Ronghua

820
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,140
I want you to help me investigate something

821
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,140
I ask you

822
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,140
You came to the Crown Prince's Mansion

823
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,140
I want to take me back with you

824
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,140
Yes, I wanted to talk to you alone

825
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,140
I didn't expect Nan Heng to be there

826
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,140
There are many things that cannot be said clearly

827
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,140
What do you mean?

828
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,140
You mean you know how to go back?

829
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,140
Of course

830
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,140
Who am i?

831
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,140
I am the screenwriter

832
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,140
I set the mechanism here

833
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,140
I tell you

834
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,140
The script world has death

835
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,140
There are three mechanisms

836
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,140
In addition to the heroine's danger, the heroine must be saved

837
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,140
There is also

838
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,140
As long as the script is finished

839
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,140
Until the end

840
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,140
We can go back

841
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,140
I understand

842
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,140
You want me to cooperate with you to complete the second choice of the tower

843
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,140
And to complete the scenes that I became a hostage later

844
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,140
Right?

845
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,140
Smart

846
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,140
But if you are afraid of pain

847
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,140
I asked Lao Zhao to prepare a anesthetic for you

848
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,140
It's just to save Nan Heng

849
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,140
Just saved the doctor who ordered Nan Heng to die

850
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,140
But if you follow the original plot

851
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,140
The Song family will be destroyed, do you know?

852
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,140
What Song family and Li family

853
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,140
It's all just a lie

854
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,140
you

855
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,140
what happened

856
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,140
Nothing

857
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,140
What if you don't follow the original plot?

858
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,140
What will happen

859
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,140
Then we two will always be trapped here

860
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,140
I can't be the first line of the script

861
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,140
And your actor dream

862
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,140
It will also be broken like glass

863
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,140
Ok, that's good

864
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,140
As long as this world doesn't collapse

865
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,140
What's good

866
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,140
Do you really want to stay

867
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,140
Be a intercessor for that killer

868
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,140
You listen well

869
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,140
Nan Heng is not a killer

870
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,140
I'm not like you

871
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,140
What is the love brain Song Yimeng

872
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,140
I am very satisfied with this world

873
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,140
I won't go back with you

874
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,140
You are crazy

875
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,140
He gave you a gun

876
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,140
Don't forget that he will kill you in the end

877
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,140
I know

878
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,140
He did want to kill me at first

879
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,140
But now everything is different

880
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,140
The keyboard player has disappeared

881
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,140
His original setting has long been detached

882
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,140
How can it hurt me and hurt the Song family

883
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,140
This is a world of paper

884
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,140
This sky is fake, this earth is fake

885
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,140
Everything is fake

886
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,140
Even you and me are fake

887
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,140
Wake up

888
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,140
it is good

889
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,140
What are you doing

890
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,140
Does it hurt, editor teacher

891
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,140
You don't talk nonsense

892
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,140
It hurts

893
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,140
I tell you

894
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,140
Since you came to this world

895
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,140
The whole world is real

896
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,140
The sky is real, the earth is real

897
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,140
Everything is real

898
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,140
Even you and me are fake

899
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,140
Understand

900
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,140
Why are you talking nonsense

901
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,140
Don't talk nonsense

902
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,140
I haven't finished

903
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,140
You are right

904
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,140
In addition to the script

905
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,140
You are indeed a designer

906
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,140
The creator of the wind and clouds

907
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,140
But you are in this world

908
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,140
You are a new person

909
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,140
Instead of persuading me

910
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,140
Why don't you let me take you

911
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,140
Let's see this real world

912
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,140
Editor teacher

913
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,140
Real world

914
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,140
Exit

915
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,140
Your Royal Highness

916
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,140
There is a big problem

917
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,140
The Crown Princess and the old prince are over there

918
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,140
I said it for a long time

919
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,140
I said I would take her to the moon

920
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,140
To the moon

921
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,140
Crown Princess said

922
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,140
Yes

923
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,140
I also asked you to tell the crown prince

924
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,140
Tell you to rest assured

925
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,140
How can I trust it

926
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:33,140
I think the engagement between the Crown Princess and Chu Gui Hong

927
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,140
Just the old prince's one-handed operation

928
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,140
What if he wants to protect the Crown Princess now

929
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,140
And Chu Gui Hong went to the front yard again

930
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,140
What should I do

931
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,820
Your Highness, are you okay?

932
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,820
Are you okay?

933
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,820
Sit down.

934
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,940
Your Highness, since you got married,

935
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,020
you've been weak.

936
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,020
Be careful of your body.

937
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,700
Your Highness, why are you bleeding?

938
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,540
I'll call the doctor.

939
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,540
Wait.

940
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,580
Don't be afraid.

941
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,940
Don't shout.

942
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,500
Yes.

943
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,140
Your Highness,

944
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,140
I'm fine.

945
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,140
I'm fine.

946
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,140
I'm fine.

947
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,140
I'm fine.

948
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,140
I'm fine.

949
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,140
I'm fine.

950
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,140
I'm fine.

951
