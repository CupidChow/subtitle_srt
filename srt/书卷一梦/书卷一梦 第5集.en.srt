[Gentle Breeze]

4
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,100
Your Highness,

5
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,310
y-you've been sitting here
this whole time?

6
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,590
She's already gone.

7
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,360
I've put a tail on her.

8
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,560
Nothing will happen.

9
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,840
Your Highness,

10
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,240
would you like to go inside
and get changed?

11
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,140
Don't tell anyone

12
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,710
what happened today.

13
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,240
Yes.

14
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,270
But I really don't get it.

15
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,430
Why did you

16
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,430
do all that today?

17
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,800
I wanted to figure out the reason too.

18
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,340
To see what kind of connection

19
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,990
Song Yimeng has with me.

20
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,079
You couldn't
bring yourself to kill her today

21
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,600
and kept saving her
at the last moment.

22
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,540
That wasn't your true intention?

23
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,020
Was she using some kind of sorcery?

24
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,350
What I just did to her…

25
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,710
No, no.

26
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,630
I have to make a trip to Longhu Mountain

27
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,310
and hire a few exorcists.

28
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,000
Look at me now.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,130
Don't upset me more.

30
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,550
Yes.

31
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,330
Back in the royal garden that day,

32
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,770
I already thought something was off.

33
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,650
Today in the woods,

34
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,590
I planned to kill her in the chaos

35
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,030
and pin it on Chu Guihong.

36
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,440
But things turned out like this instead.

37
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,230
Judging from what happened,

38
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,690
it seems that no matter

39
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,710
what danger Song Yimeng is in

40
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,590
or where I am,

41
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,310
my body moves

42
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,190
on its own to save her.

43
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,150
If that's the case,

44
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,120
not only can we not hurt her,

45
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,680
but we also have to watch out

46
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,480
for others using her against us.

47
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,800
If the Eighteenth Prince

48
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,240
and Chu Guihong find out about this,

49
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,590
we'll…

50
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,590
That's why this matter

51
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,030
must be kept secret at all costs.

52
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,750
Yes.

53
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,910
Also,

54
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,050
we need to find a solution
as soon as possible.

55
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,310
But Song Yimeng

56
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,190
is still Chu Guihong's fiancée.

57
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,470
If the two of them talk about this,

58
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,280
then we...

59
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,840
Exactly.

60
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,960
As long as Chu Guihong
stays in the capital,

61
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,190
he's a threat.

62
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,950
Here's what we'll do:

63
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,630
go bring Censor Yao Qian

64
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,000
to me.

65
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,070
Yes.

66
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,120
Stop.

67
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:43,110
[Yan Gate]

68
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,270
Go on in.

69
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,880
Other people travel into novels

70
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,230
and live the dream.

71
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,550
When I do,

72
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,560
I suffer every possible hardship.

73
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,390
Why am I so unlucky?

74
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,190
We should carefully check every passerby.

75
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,360
Why did you stop me just now?

76
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,950
How many times have I told you?

77
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,110
Keep your eyes sharp

78
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,760
when guarding the city gate.

79
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,630
Didn't you see the person

80
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,110
behind that girl just now?

81
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,860
That was the captain of the Xuanjia Army,

82
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,660
one of the Seventh Prince's men.

83
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,680
Are you saying that was Song Yimeng

84
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,780
who just walked by?

85
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,070
It seems that
she came out of the prince's manor.

86
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,830
They were together

87
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,190
this late at night.

88
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,340
They must be pretty close.

89
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,680
Guihong,

90
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,600
when you get back tonight,

91
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,070
take a nice hot bath

92
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:42,940
and relax.

93
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,390
If you feel unwell,

94
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,000
just let me know, okay?

95
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:46,920
Well,

96
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,510
after I get home, I'll…

97
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,390
Yimeng!

98
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,870
Chu Guihong?

99
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,510
Yimeng.

100
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,390
What happened to you?

101
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,310
I'm fine.

102
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,190
I'm fine.

103
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,830
You...

104
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,920
You're out of prison?

105
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,490
I was officially released
by imperial decree.

106
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,580
All aboveboard.

107
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,170
Good.

108
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,940
As long as that scoundrel Nan Heng

109
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,470
didn't give you a hard time.

110
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,310
Don't worry.

111
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,510
But you—

112
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,430
he took you away

113
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,580
right after we met earlier.

114
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,880
I was so worried.

115
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,000
Let me take a look at you.

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,460
He didn't hurt you, did he?

117
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,880
I'm fine.

118
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,720
I'm fine.

119
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,560
General.

120
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,190
-You must…
-Yimeng.

121
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,090
When did we become so distant?

122
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,360
Well...

123
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,270
Well...

124
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:39,830
Hong.

125
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,510
Hong.

126
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,580
Nan Heng is ruthless and dangerous.

127
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,840
He's hard to deal with.

128
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,390
You've finally been released.

129
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,560
So don't go against him

130
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,650
in court anymore,

131
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,320
okay?

132
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,020
Yimeng,

133
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,600
be honest with me.

134
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,840
He bullied you today, didn't he?

135
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,190
Sure enough.

136
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,000
Second male leads are always
the ones the audience falls for.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,390
They're just better.

138
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:11,950
Isn't this…

139
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,330
This piece of jade was gifted to me

140
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,600
by my aunt,

141
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,310
the late empress, when I was born.

142
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,600
It's protected me on the battlefield,

143
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,730
bringing me home safe again and again.

144
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,720
Now that we're getting married,

145
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,850
I want you to have it.

146
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,330
May it protect the one

147
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,010
I love from today on.

148
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,360
Even Nan Heng

149
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,560
wouldn't dare act recklessly

150
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,490
in front of something from my aunt.

151
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,310
But

152
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,600
if you give it to me,

153
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:35,960
what about you?

154
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,040
I have the scented pouch you gave me.

155
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,940
During those dark days
in the imperial prison,

156
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,470
it was the only thing that kept me going.

157
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,790
But this jade is so valuable.

158
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,190
My scented pouch

159
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,190
isn't worth much.

160
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,600
Then just make me a few more.

161
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,800
I'll hang them here

162
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,680
and here.

163
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,680
Wherever I go,

164
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,510
the air will be filled with fragrance.

165
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,870
So everyone will know,

166
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,020
your man has arrived.

167
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,200
How does that sound?

168
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,960
You're finally smiling.

169
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,780
So beautiful.

170
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,000
Every time our general sees Miss Song,

171
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,020
he acts like

172
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,480
a peacock spreading his feathers.

173
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,669
Miss Song.

174
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,450
Greetings, Your Highness.

175
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,150
You and Guihong

00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,400
I'm terribly sorry.

348
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,270
Please, Your Highness,
give me one more chance.

349
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,440
I'll dedicate myself fully,

350
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,360
just like Your Highness—

351
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,120
working day and night

352
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,150
without stopping to rest.

353
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,670
I swear I'll collect

354
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,670
every last piece of proof

355
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,670
of Chu's crimes.

356
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,840
Good.

357
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,520
I'll give you a chance.

358
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,670
Then you know what to do

359
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,370
at tomorrow's morning court, don't you?

360
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,500
Yes, Your Highness.

361
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,740
His Majesty has arrived!

362
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,040
Long live Your Majesty!

363
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,790
Rise.

364
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,130
Thank you, Your Majesty.

365
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,720
Father.

366
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,960
Rui,

367
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,310
do you have something to report?

368
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,270
Father,

369
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,589
I believe that

370
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,880
although the Qianyu Army
suffered a setback this time,

371
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,110
Chu Guihong
has earned great merit over the years.

372
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,480
He's a rare military talent.

373
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,070
How can we brush him off
with an empty title?

374
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:33,790
Therefore,

375
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
I respectfully request that

376
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,830
you appoint Chu Guihong
to an important post

377
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,550
and return command
of the Qianyu Army to him

378
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,410
so he may defeat Heyuan once more.

379
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,810
Regaining command of the Qianyu Army?

380
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,350
Who else but General Chu

381
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,590
is qualified to take on
such responsibility?

382
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,840
But didn't he just lose a battle?

383
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,260
Exactly.

384
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,940
How can we promote a defeated general?

385
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,110
Miss.

386
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,920
How did it go?

387
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,510
I handed the pouch you gave me

388
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,790
to that attendant next to General Chu,

389
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,880
Rong Hua,

390
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,030
the big guy

391
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,880
who's quite strong,

392
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,670
but his face kinda resembles…

393
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,110
No one asked about Rong Hua.

394
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,160
He's not the point.

395
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,240
I'm asking about Chu Guihong.

396
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,130
Did he read it?

397
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,920
He did.

398
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,920
And as it happens,

399
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,830
right after

400
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,310
he read your message,

401
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,790
someone from the palace showed up

402
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,790
and summoned him to see His Majesty.

403
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,400
Miss, what did you write

404
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,790
in your message?

405
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,070
General Chu's expression

406
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,070
was really strange after he read it.

407
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,190
He read it. That's all that matters.

408
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,830
Good thing I remembered
that part of the plot.

409
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,720
Otherwise...

410
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,810
Heng,

411
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,270
what do you mean?

412
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,400
Every position I proposed,

413
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,960
you shot it down with some excuse.

414
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,240
You couldn't kill my cousin,

415
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,700
and now you can't even
hide your intentions?

416
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,480
Heng,

417
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,680
since you think the posts Rui suggested

418
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,130
aren't suitable,

419
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,350
then tell me—

420
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,030
what post do you think

421
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,480
Chu Guihong deserves?

422
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,790
Your Majesty,

423
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,310
in my opinion,

424
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,110
when discussing matters of court,

425
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,910
the public good must come first.

426
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,470
If we give Chu Guihong a high position,

427
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,770
we'll be putting personal interests first.

428
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,940
If appointing the right person for the job

429
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,070
is putting personal interests first,

430
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,920
are you saying

431
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,030
only when the court
is full of the Gao family's people

432
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,630
[Calm, Respectful, and Sincere]

433
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,640
can we say we've put
the public good first?

434
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,360
You must be joking, Your Majesty.

435
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,400
The Duke of Zhou welcomed talent

436
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,830
and won hearts across the land.

437
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,160
Helping you unite the nation

438
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,070
and recruit men of virtue and talent

439
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,070
is what we've

440
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,610
always striven to do.

441
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,240
Your Majesty.

442
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,240
Chu Guihong may

443
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,400
have had a good reputation in the past,

444
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
but after the Pingrong Battle,

445
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,700
his command led to
the loss of tens of thousands of soldiers

446
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,790
and the slaughter of civilians

447
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,160
in three border cities.

448
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,070
As a result,

449
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,530
his reputation is already tarnished.

450
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,350
I worry that reinstating him

451
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,480
will only dishearten the people.

452
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,280
Your Majesty.

453
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,850
[Calm, Respectful, and Sincere]

454
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

455
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,310
Rise.

456
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,810
Thank you, Your Majesty.

457
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,350
Seventh Prince,

458
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,900
you said my reputation is tarnished now.

459
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,680
What evidence are you basing that on?

460
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,140
Naturally, it's backed by

461
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,760
a Censorate investigation.

462
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:25,880
Your Majesty,

463
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,000
I request that

464
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,540
the investigating censor

465
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,590
present the Censorate's impeachment
memorial against Chu Guihong

466
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,990
and explain the details.

467
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,240
Seriously?

468
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,970
You came prepared, didn't you?

469
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,270
Summon him.

470
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,120
[Memorial]

471
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,170
Seventh Prince,

472
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,840
may I ask how much longer

473
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,050
until the impeachment memorial arrives?

474
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,190
Yeah, Heng,

475
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,800
it's almost noon now.

476
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,720
Don't tell me you sent someone

477
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,300
to write it on the spot.

478
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,410
Your Highness,

479
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,300
there's something fishy about all this.

480
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,260
Maybe…

481
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,560
Wait a little longer.

482
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,020
Guess

483
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,550
I'm really hungry.

484
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,110
Well,

485
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,080
putting the right people
in charge matters,

486
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,280
but not more than

487
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,400
Father's health.

488
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,160
If we wait any longer,

489
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,590
we could skip lunch

490
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,440
and have dinner directly.

491
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,220
Enough.

492
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,610
Since no one has any objections

493
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,600
to reinstating Chu Guihong,

494
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,530
he shall be appointed
as the Prefect of the Capital

495
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,800
and Commander of the Army,

496
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,100
resuming leadership of the Qianyu Army

497
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,210
to guard the capital.

498
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,100
In an emergency,

499
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,430
he can act with full discretion.

500
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,700
He can also enter the palace armed

501
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,100
to report directly to me.

502
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,830
Congratulations, General Chu.

503
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,660
No,

504
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,730
now we should be calling you

505
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,160
Commander Chu

506
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,350
or Prefect of the Capital.

507
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,480
It's a great responsibility.

508
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,340
I'll do my best.

509
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,260
I hope all of you

510
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,000
can guide and support me…

511
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,270
Your Highness.

512
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,110
In the days to come.

513
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,310
Just now, Mr. Yao was blindfolded,

514
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,030
beaten,

515
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,240
and left in an abandoned mine
on the western outskirts.

516
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,350
By the time we got there,

517
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,550
the place had already been cleaned out.

518
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,790
No need to investigate.

519
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,180
It must've been Chu Guihong's doing.

520
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,870
But what I can't figure out is

521
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,840
how he knew where Yao Qian was.

522
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,050
Your Highness.

523
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,920
Last night,

524
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,160
we sent someone to tail Miss Song.

525
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,950
She ran into Chu Guihong on the road.

526
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:15,870
And this morning,

527
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,680
a maid from her house

528
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,550
secretly paid a visit to the Chu family.

529
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,090
Do you think they might…

530
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,060
Mr. Song.

531
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,480
Come, come.

532
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,590
Have a seat.

533
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,930
I remember when you visited us as a child,

534
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,270
your favorite treat

535
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,090
was always the crystal cake.

536
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,310
Go on, have a bite.

537
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,680
Yes.

538
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,610
Yimeng loves crystal cakes too.

539
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,040
When we were little,

540
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,570
she used to steal mine all the time.

541
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,260
That's a rude thing to say.

542
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,860
Please forgive me, Mr. Song.

543
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,160
It's fine.

544
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,230
Your father and I
have been close for years.

545
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,510
You and Yimeng have been engaged
since you were young.

546
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,790
In my eyes,

547
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,610
you're already family.

548
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,480
No need to stand on ceremony.

549
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
That blade of yours…

550
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,790
My Lord.

551
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,310
It hasn't been sharpened.

552
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,240
Yeah, I'll take care of that today.

553

[Song Residence]

554
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,970
Your Highness,

555
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,840
Chu Guihong's here too.

[Room of Elegance]

557
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,030
Miss,

558
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,720
aren't you the most afraid
of the Seventh Prince?

559
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,030
He's literally barging in right now,

560
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,090
and you're not the least bit nervous?

561
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,880
When I sent word
to Chu Guihong this morning,

562
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,790
I already knew Nan Heng would come.

563
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,030
Relax.

564
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,590
He can't kill me now.

565
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,970
I'm not afraid of him.

566
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,770
Your Highness.

567
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,980
How could they serve such cheap tea

568
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,670
to the distinguished Seventh Prince?

569
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:32,680

00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,600
go bring my premium ginseng tea.

571
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,070
Yes.

00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,790
where are the pastries?

574
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,480
Four sweet ones, four savory ones—
don't miss a single one.

575
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,070
Go, go.

576
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,510

please wait a little longer.

The premium tea

00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,800
will be served in no time.

583
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,880
My goodness!

584
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,830
Look at your ears—

585
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,160
they're bright red!

586
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,920
Fugui!

587
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,200
I'm not trying to scold you,

588
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,240
but you really need

589
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,590
to learn how to serve properly.

590
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,590
It's freezing today,

591
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,480
yet you didn't even prepare
a fur coat for your master.

592
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,810
Totally unacceptable!

593
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,330
Here, Your Highness.

594
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:12,830
Warm your hands.

Warm your hands.

Now tell me—

601
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,400
did you meet with Chu Guihong?

602
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,670
Sure did.

603
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,310
He and I are

604
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,840
engaged, after all.

605
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,070
Do I need your permission to see him?

606
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,880
What?

607
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,660
Working under you

608
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,760
means I'm not allowed to marry?

609
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,610
You've got a lot of nerve
talking to me like that.

610
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,410
You're not afraid of me anymore?

611
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,030
I am afraid.

612
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,780
Even terrified.

613
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,330
I'm shaking in my boots.

614
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,340
Your Highness.

00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,330
There's a dagger right here.

Go ahead, kill me.

617
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,030
Oh wait, I forgot.

618
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,990
You can't kill me.

619
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,000
No matter how hard you try,

620
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,430
the only one who ends up hurt

621
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,790
is you.

622
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,710
By the way, Your Highness,

623
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,780
do those three dart wounds in your back

624
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,510
still hurt?

625
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,880
Nightwalkers?

626
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,620
Sounds like
they're from the martial world.

627
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:07,830
That's right.

628
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,030
From what I've heard,

629
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,010
they were originally
skilled fighters from the martial world.

630
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,110
Three years ago,

631
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,980
a mysterious person gathered them up,

632
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,170
trained them,

633
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,640
and made them an elite force.

634
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,550
Their leader

635
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,570
seems to be quite capable.

636
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,750
This person secretly formed
the Nightwalkers within the country,

637
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,590
and outside the country,

638
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,350
he used a guild
called Waning River Crescent

639
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,130
to build connections
in the lodging, gambling,

640
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,650
restaurants, and other fields.

641
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,550
Anything you can't do openly—

642
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,880
you can do it

643
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,350
at Waning River Crescent.

644
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,290
I heard a bit about it
while I was in prison.

645
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,270
Waning River Crescent
is located in a shady, chaotic area.

646
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,270
After dark, it's total mayhem.

647
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,500
There's always

648
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,310
something shady going on.

649
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,050
The so-called guild

650
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,240
sounds more like a cover
for the Nightwalkers' operations.

651
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,630
That's why

652
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,290
the court's troubled.

653
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,980
You mean...

654
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,590
Hong,

655
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,170
I need to know that

656
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,140
at court,

657
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,180
sometimes when the wind blows,

658
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,360
it really is wind,

659
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,720
and sometimes,

660
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,280
it's not.

661
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,850
Thank you for the guidance.

662
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,100
Well,

663
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,250
I didn't say anything.

664
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,000
Of course.

665
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,840
You said nothing at all.

666
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,160
It's just that I suddenly

667
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,590
came to a realization.

668
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,070
If I can

669
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,750
uncover the identity of this leader

670
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,490
and find out
what the Nightwalkers are really after,

671
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,240
that would be a major achievement.

672
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,310
It'd definitely help
the Eighteenth Prince's path

673
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,680
to the Eastern Palace

674
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,030
and my own career too.

675
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,990
So that's why
you're not afraid of me anymore.

676
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,710
You figured that part out.

677
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,560
But

678
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,520
the two maids just now

679
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,030
are Yingqiu

680
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,310
and Zhixia, right?

681
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,960
I heard the three of you grew up together

682
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,020
like real sisters.

683
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,720
I might not be able to kill you,

684
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,590
but killing them?

685
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,550
That'd be easy.

686
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,300
Bad guys really do stay bad, huh?

687
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,440
You love

688
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,640
using someone else's weakness as leverage.

689
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,520
Zhixia and Yingqiu

Don't be ridiculous!

Fine.

I'll make it simple for you.

With this many arrows aimed at me,

even the noble Seventh Prince

wouldn't make it out alive, right?

719

Wait.

720
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,680
I'll do it.

721
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,970
Why is it taking you forever
just to undress?

722

Your belt.

723

of clothing every day.

One layer after another.

I'm not taking advantage of you.

I'm teaching you how to be a decent man.

I'm kindly teaching you
how to respect others.

733

Don't think just because
you're the male lead

734
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,950
you can do whatever you want.

735

What did you just call me?

736

You wanna take my last name
and become a Song?

What happened to
all that arrogance just now?

742
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,680
Didn't you tell me to undress

743

and kneel to you?

744
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,880
Fine.

745
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,560
Then I'll undress too.

746
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,990
Now you're scared, huh?

747
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,980
Even if you take off your clothes now,

Say it.

To deal with a big villain like you,

of course I had to be well-prepared.

00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,920

00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,760
Two days.

863
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,480
You're just being unreasonable.

864
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,150
One day.

865
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,490
Two days.

866
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,510
Just two days.

867
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,840
But, Your Highness,

868
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,480
I have a small favor to ask.

869
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,190
When you leave later,

870
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,850
can you go out that way?

871
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,560
That way.

872
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,710
Your Highness,

873
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,150
aren't we here to deal with Song Yimeng?

874
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,260
[Song Residence]

875
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,930
If we leave like this,
won't it just boost her ego?

876
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,060
She even made you
climb out the window.

877
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,480
Your Highness.

878
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,070
You...

879
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:29,900
You...

880
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,740
Chu Guihong was invited here by Song Yude?

881
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,750
Yes.

882
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,750
They had a long talk in the study.

883
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,920
Looks like the Song family

884
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,950
is getting involved
in the fight for the throne.

885
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,500
If we don't kill Song Yimeng,

886
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,590
she'll become a threat down the line.

887
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,560
Your Highness,

888
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,020
Song Yimeng is cunning,

889
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,550
and now she's got the upper hand on you.

890
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,190
That's...

891
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,390
I may not be able to kill her,

892
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,940
but that doesn't mean

893
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,570
I'm at the end of my rope.

894
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,030
Send word to Waning River Crescent.

895
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,450
It's time they proved their worth.
