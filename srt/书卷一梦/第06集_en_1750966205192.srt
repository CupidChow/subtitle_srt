20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Even now you take off your clothes,

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I will only be your bodyguard.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So...

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So...

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So what?

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Tell me.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Episode 2

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Did Chu Guihong send Song Yuede here?

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We talked a lot in the study.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It seems that the Song family

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
is going to fight Chu Wei.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If Song Yi Meng doesn't get rid of this mutiny,

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
it will be a big trouble in the future.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Your Highness, Song Yi Meng has many tricks.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Now you are being controlled by him.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I can't kill him.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But it doesn't mean

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I have no other way.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Tell the Cang Jiang Academy

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
that I should see their value.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Editor Duan.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Where is your cutting-edge technique?

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Give me some clues.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't play with people anymore.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm so tired.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Miss!

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Wake up!

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What's wrong?

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't scare me.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Stop shaking.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm so scared.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Why are you so agitated?

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
His Highness has left.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What's wrong with you?

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What if you hurt yourself?

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
General Chu just told you to take care of yourself.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He will be so sad if you do this.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You are right.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I can't be defeated by Nan Heng

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
just because I'm lying here.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Ying Qiu,

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
help me to sort out my problems.

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Wait and see.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm so lonely.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I need to find a book.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There's no time to find a book.

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Master, please help me.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I need more money.

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I have no money.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's not about money.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
In the capital,

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
people are so greedy.

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Besides, we can't do it.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Please let us go.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Master, please try.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I need more money.

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I really can't do it.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is so important.

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Please help us.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Guard Ngan.

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No comment of your sort.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Where're you going?

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Summer 먼저.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You'll feel felt like walking.

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But I don't need you to take me for a walk.

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I wish Yue expanding to succeed.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Bueno.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,280
It's so good.

102
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,040
Go away.

103
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,880
How dare you sell your business at my place?

104
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,280
I'll arrest you if you do.

105
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,480
Listen.

106
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,480
If I get the Cangjiang Moon,

107
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,360
I'll sell it at a good price.

108
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,320
I'll pay you back.

109
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,280
Go away.

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,080
Cangjiang Moon?

111
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,040
Sir.

112
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,040
Excuse me.

113
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,160
Is Cangjiang Moon a black market?

114
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,720
So what?

115
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,920
What does it have to do with you?

116
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:38,960
Yes.

117
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,640
So you want to play the fool?

118
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,640
It's no use talking to you.

119
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,840
This is called Martial c happily ever after.

120
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,400
Tell Mr. Shang Guan

121
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,920
everything is alright.

122
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,600
Yu is involved to the tortanden.

123
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,400
Miss, you're so pretty.

124
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Don't touch me.

125
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,880
Miss, don't eat my wound.

126
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,040
Miss, don't be afraid.

127
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,600
Miss, we shouldn't stop you.

128
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,640
Let's go back.

129
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,720
I'll send someone to stop you tomorrow.

130
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,840
No.

131
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,040
Nan Heng gave me two days.

132
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,360
I must find a way tonight.

133
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,840
Follow me.

134
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,360
General, I've got the news.

135
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,920
There are many people here.

136
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,640
The leader is called Commander Yi.

137
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,200
He's said to be a master of the hand.

138
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,280
Can we just leave him here?

139
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,280
Don't worry.

140
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,160
A hundred elite soldiers will come tonight.

141
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,360
Be alert.

142
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,600
Don't reveal your identity.

Brother.

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,840

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,680
Three taels of gold.

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
Three taels of gold.

151
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
Three taels of gold.

152
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
Three taels of gold.

153
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,080
Three taels of gold.

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,880
It looks open.

161
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,480
Let's go.

162
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
Aren't you trying to kill a lady?

163
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480

No need

169
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
Today, there are many powerful people in the restaurant

170
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,080
I can't make any trouble

171
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,080
I can do it alone

172
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
You have arranged everything?

173
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
A woman with no wealth

174
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080
It's hard to do anything

175
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
But

176
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,080
We always come to the moon to kill the old and weak

177
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Why this time

178
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
This woman

179
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,080
Can't be underestimated

180
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,080
It's an accident

181
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,080
Accident?

182
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,080
Don't forget

183
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,080
I know that the daughter of the powerful

184
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Is a noble person

185
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,080
She doesn't leave evidence

186
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,080
It's a pity

187
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,080
Like a beautiful flower

188
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,080
Tonight, I will explain it here

189
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,080

Come

195
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,080
Let's go inside and see

196
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,080
I knew this opera house

197
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,080
There is such a wonderful place

198
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,080
I was taken away by the Song family every day

199
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,080
I went to the South Pole

200
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
Yinqiao, let's go inside and see

201
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
Good good

202
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,080
Good good

203
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Yinqiao, give me the money

204
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,080
Don't worry

205
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,080
Give me

206
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,080
Last one

207
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,080
What's wrong with you

208
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
You

209
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
The girl actually gave the newspaper

210
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
What kind of force is this

211
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,080
Can't be seen as a noble

212
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
Wait a minute

213
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,080
I ask you

214
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,080
The newspaper means

215
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,080
Is it three fans

216
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
Have to make the same move

217
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Yes

218
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,080
I can't see the newspaper now

219
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,080
Is it smart

220
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,080
That's not good

221
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,080
I just threw the money up because of you

222
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,080
I have to start over

223
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,080
Girl, gambling rules

224
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,080
Buy a gift

225
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,080
Big brother, this rule is dead

226
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,080
Is the person alive

227
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,080
If this rule is alive, people will die

228
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
But

229
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
Why is it so heavy

230
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,080
These money are all

231
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
I passed through the newspaper

232
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,080
I lost because I didn't play

233
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
No way

234
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
I don't accept

235
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,080
I don't accept

236
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,080
Don't wait for her

237
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,080
No time

238
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,080
Told you

239
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,080
Hey

240
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,080
Forget it

241
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,080
I am not as good as Qiu Shuzhen

242
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,080
Feel free

243
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
What?

244
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
It's a bun.

245
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,080
It was a bun just now.

246
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,080
How could it be?

247
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,080
How could it be?

248
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
Why is it a bun?

249
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,080
What's going on?

250
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
Three sixes.

251
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
I didn't see it wrong, right?

252
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
Is it the one-man fairy?

253
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,080
So I'm not the nine-leafed fairy.

254
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,080
I'm the eight-leafed fairy.

255
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,080
Thank you, thank you.

256
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
I admit it.

257
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Please, please.

258
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
Hurry up.

259
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Hurry up.

260
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,080
Who's the old fairy?

261
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
Interesting.

262
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
Pass it down.

263
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
I'll do it myself.

264
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,080
The sword is so dark.

265
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,080
The one who knows me is as weak as A'Long.

266
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Kill him.

267
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
I'll do it.

268
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,080
Killing a beauty is an art.

269
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,080
Killing a beauty who is concerned about the buyer is even more so.

270
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:30,080
I'd like to see how this woman is not laughable.

271
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
Remember.

272
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
Don't make any noise tonight.

273
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,080
Check the steps in the vault.

274
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,080
Find out what's behind them.

275
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
Don't make any noise.

276
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,080
General, don't worry.

277
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,080
We've been waiting for a long time.

278
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,080
We're waiting for tonight.

279
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,080
The ghost is like the dragon walking.

280
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,080
The lantern is like the night.

281
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,080
The ghost is like the dragon walking.

282
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,080
The lantern is like the night.

283
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,080
The ghost is like the dragon walking.

284
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,080
The lantern is like the night.

285
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,080
You're Li Shiliu if you're not weak.

286
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,080
The dead don't need to know this.

287
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Where are we going now?

288
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
We've made enough money.

289
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,080
It's time to do something serious.

290
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
Let's go.

291
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,080
Let's find out how to cut the sword.

292
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,080
What can he do?

293
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
Let's go.

294
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Great.

295
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,080
Everyone.

296
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,080
Today, we're going to perform a small show in Cangjiang.

297
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
Is this the show?

298
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,080
I brought a new item from the border.

299
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,080
Please have a look.

300
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,080
Sign the fake number.

301
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,080
You must have seen it.

302
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,080
100 golds.

303
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,080
Do you like it?

304
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,080
Stop bragging.

305
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,080
I've been here for so many years.

306
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,080
I've never seen anything good.

307
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,080
This time, it's different.

308
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,080
Little beauty.

309
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,080
What is this for?

310
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
Don't you know?

311
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,080
This is the weapon that the border caught.

312
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,080
It was the most practical weapon in Jin.

313
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,080
But after the war,

314
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,080
the border guards stopped it.

315
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,080
It's rare to see such a thing.

316
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,080
A thing?

317
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,080
How can it be a thing?

318
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,080
150 golds.

319
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,080
200 golds.

320
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,080
500 golds.

321
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,080
I'm a thousand golds.

322
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,080
I'm Yu Chi Yan.

323
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,080
I'm rich.

324
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,080
This girl is not worth much.

325
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,080
But what's the situation now?

326
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,080
Now the emperor has thousands of soldiers in Jin.

327
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,080
The price is different.

328
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,080
This is the value of the item.

329
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,080
1000 golds.

330
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,080
1000 golds is too high.

331
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,080
It's not worth 100 golds.

332
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,080
Have you seen it?

333
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,080
This is the power of money.

334
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,080
Look at your face.

335
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,080
Look at your body.

336
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,080
This beast.

337
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,080
Come on.

338
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,080
Drink.

339
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
Drink.

340
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,080
Open it.

341
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,080
What?

342
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
You bastard.

343
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,080
What's this?

344
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,080
Hurry up.

345
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,080
If someone forces you to drink,

346
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
you'll be punished.

347
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,080
Do you understand?

348
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,080
It's okay.

349
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
Don't worry.

350
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
I'm the heroine.

351
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,080
I'm not the heroine.

352
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
I'm the boss in the drama.

353
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,080
Hit me.

354
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,080
Wang Zhen.

355
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
Jingqiu, run.

356
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,080
Come with me.

357
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,080
I'm the boss.

358
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,080
Stop.

359
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,080
Don't run.

360
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
Hurry up.

361
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,080
Don't stop.

362
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,080
Hurry up.

363
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
Hurry up.

364
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
Jinggui.

365
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
Jinggui.

366
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
Jinggui.

367
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,080
Jinggui.

368
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,080
Don't run.

369
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,080
General.

370
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
General.

371
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,080
ious?

372
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,080
Dr affected by hyp MXI.

373
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,080
部分

374
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,080
You haven't had a good time yesterday, right?

375
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
Why are you still here?

376
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,080
You have to stay here to discover something more dramatic.

377
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,260
Wait for a while, they're gonna be raided.

378
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,100
Enough.

379
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,400
Hey!

380
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,400
Are you OK?

381
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,800
I'm so angry.

382
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
I'm so angry.

383
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,520
He's so angry that he's here to hurt people.

384
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,840
Do it.

385
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,200
Song Jia Nü?

386
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,400
Kill Fu Shao.

387
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,640
What about Song Jia Nü?

388
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,640
You do it.

389
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,120
Okay, you're in my debt.

390
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
Why don't you go?

391
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,200
You can kill everyone.

392
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,920
So they won't cause us trouble.

393
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
Okay.

394
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,640
Boss said

395
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,640
we can't kill people who are irrelevant.

396
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,080
You...

397
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,840
Why is Boss here?

398
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,160
The plan has changed.

399
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,680
Who do you want to kill?

400
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
Oh.

401
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Sorry, I'm passing by.

402
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Go on.

403
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
Look at her.

404
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,080
Help!

405
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,200
Boss, what does Boss mean?

406
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,200
There's something wrong. We'll talk later.

407
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,600
You'll pay for this mistake first.

408
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Okay.

409
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,840
Boss.

410
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,920
You

411
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,480
Boss, there's something wrong.

412
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,200
Boss.

413
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
I'll kill him.

414
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Keep killing him.

415
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Didn't you hear me?

416
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Next time, find a place to kill.

417
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
Let's go.

418
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Didn't I tell you not to make any noise?

419
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
I didn't.

420
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,200
You just hit me from the sky and made me fly.

421
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
What about the auction?

422
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,200
You even killed someone.

423
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
I didn't kill anyone.

424
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Didn't Wu Ji save him?

425
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,200
The auction is a mess done by foreign guests.

426
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Our people don't know about this.

427
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,200
If we dare to auction in the Canjiang, we must pay them.

428
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
Boss.

429
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,200
Boss.

430
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,200
How do we deal with those rich people?

431
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
Hero.

432
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
Hero.

433
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Hero, where are you?

434
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Hero.

435
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Hero.

436
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
Stop running.

437
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
I finally caught up with you.

438
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,200
If it weren't for you, Wu Ji and I would be dead.

439
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Hero, what's your name?

440
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Where do you live?

441
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
Tell me everything.

442
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
I must report to the rescue team.

443
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Don't worry.

444
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
Don't worry.

445
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
Goodbye.

446
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,200
How can this work?

447
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,200
I have to know who my benefactor is.

448
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
What a beautiful woman.

449
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
How dare she pull Boss's car.

450
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
She's so rude.

451
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Do it.

452
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
She always breaks the needle.

453
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
She broke his soul with a needle.

454
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
Get out of here.

455
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,200
Da Zang.

456
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
What do you mean?

457
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
I understand.

458
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,200
Boss means that he thinks our secret base is too small.

459
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,200
We can't kill them all at once.

460
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,200
We can't kill them all at once.

461
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Take this.

462
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
It's a tear-stained watch.

463
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
It's painful.

464
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Come on.

465
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
Take it.

466
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
Hero.

467
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
You're hurt.

468
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
No.

469
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
What do you mean?

470
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
You're bleeding.

471
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
You must have done it to save us.

472
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
I said no.

473
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
It's okay.

474
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Hero, you're a good man.

475
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
But your mouth is a little hard.

476
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
You didn't see it.

477
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
How can I leave you alone?

478
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Let me see your wound.

479
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,200
Let me see if you're okay.

480
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,200
You're a man and a woman.

481
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Let's keep a distance.

482
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,200
What distance?

483
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
It's urgent.

484
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
I have to take you to the hospital.

485
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Let's see if you're okay.

486
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
No.

487
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Let's go.

488
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
Let's go.

489
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
What's wrong?

490
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,200
I'm tired.

491
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
Now?

492
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
Here?

493
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
Men are strong.

494
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
They don't mind the night.

495
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,200
And they're good at martial arts.

496
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,200
It's usually practiced by the night.

497
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Boss.

498
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
What secret are you hiding?

499
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
What are you doing?

500
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
Keep moving.

501
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
It's over.

502
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,200
You can't kill him.

503
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
Hero.

504
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
We are...

505
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Don't misunderstand.

506
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
I didn't mean that.

507
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
I didn't say anything.

508
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Why are you two here?

509
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
Did I disturb you?

510
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
Boss.

511
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
The man who saved me just now

512
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
is your boss?

513
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
No.

514
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
I'm the boss.

515
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
You're the boss?

516
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
I'm the boss.

517
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
It's your boss?

518
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
Yes.

519
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
So it means

520
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
he's the only one

521
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
in such a big moon.

522
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Of course.

523
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Who else can do this except for the boss?

524
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
I've found a big person.

525
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Guys.

526
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Come here.

527
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
I have some questions

528
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
about your boss.

529
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Let's talk.

530
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Don't be impulsive.

531
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Boss told me not to act rashly.

532
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,200
I just want to ask you some questions.

533
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
We have to start the meeting first.

534
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
Wait a minute.

535
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
Are you crazy?

536
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
How dare you hit the boss's woman?

537
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
A knife on the head.

538
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
A knife on the head?

539
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Miss.

540
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,200
He said it's the soul of the soul.

541
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
Soul of the soul?

542
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,200
He's from the south.

543
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
He has a accent.

544
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
From the south?

545
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
Yes.

546
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,200
Where's the accent?

547
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
Do it.

548
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Do it.

549
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Do it.

550
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,200
Do it.

551
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
Who are you going to hit?

552
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,200
Not hit.

553
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
He said

554
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
sister-in-law.

555
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
Right, guys?

556
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
Yes.

557
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Sister-in-law.

558
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
Sister-in-law.

559
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
You call me sister-in-law?

560
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
I'm not your sister-in-law.

561
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
No.

562
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Do it.

563
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Why didn't he escape?

564
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,200
He's gone.

565
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
You're a brother.

566
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Is there something wrong with your family?

567
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,200
Yes.

568
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Ignore him first.

569
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,200
Let's get down to business.

570
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,200
Business?

571
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
What's that?

572
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,200
What's this?

573
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,200
Liket registration.

574
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Liket registration?

575
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
The name is Hu Ziyi.

576
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
He is tall and has a special interest in the company.

577
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
I want to know if you can accept a man wearing a mask

578
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
and a man being lonely.

579
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
I'm not sure.

580
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,200
I've already done what you said.

581
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
I won't tell anyone.

582
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,200
I'm sure those rich men will know nothing tomorrow.

583
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Why did you hit in the woods?

584
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Because I want to confirm something.

585
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
What?

586
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
You can't kill Song Yi Meng, right?

587
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
Your Highness.

588
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
What do you want to say?

589
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,200
I want to say that I'm the only one in the Night Travel God

590
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,200
who knows your true identity.

591
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
You even bought me such a deep friendship.

592
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,200
You're so ungrateful.

593
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
Do whatever I ask you to do.

594
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Don't worry about other things.

595
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
But I'm curious.

596
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Actually, I thought it was strange at first.

597
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
You're the seventh prince.

598
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
You want to kill a weak woman.

599
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,200
Why do you have to use the card in your hand?

600
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Or why do you have to do it yourself?

601
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
There's only one answer.

602
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,200
You must have a connection with her.

603
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,200
You'll help her when she's in trouble.

604
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,200
I and A'Long A'Hu did the same thing when we were injured.

605
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,200
I guess it's not bad.

606
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,200
I thought you were thinking about love.

607
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
I thought so.

608
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
But I know you.

609
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Even if you're in the same world,

610
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,200
you won't be nice to any woman.

611
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
And you'll give up your principles.

612
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
I like smart people.

613
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
But I don't like smart people.

614
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,200
I could get you out of prison three years ago.

615
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,200
I could send you back three years later.

616
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,200
Okay, I got it.

617
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,200
I'll leave my life to you.

618
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
Is that okay?

619
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
What about Song Yi Meng?

620
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
How will you deal with him after tonight?

621
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
Look.

622
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
You've been looking for the knife for years.

623
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,200
You didn't find anything.

624
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,200
Now you have the chance.

625
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,200
Why don't you use Song Yi Meng to get the money from Chu Gui Hong?

626
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,200
I can't imagine what you can imagine.

627
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
Song Yi Meng is afraid of me.

628
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,200
But he's a cunning man.

629
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
He doesn't care about me.

630
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
He can't help me.

631
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,200
He knows I have many secrets.

632
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
He must be a bad guy.

633
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
Wrong.

634
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,200
Song Yi Meng is afraid of the cruel prince Nan Heng.

635
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,200
But you're the one who saved him from danger.

636
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
The famous knight Li Shiliu.

637
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
He has many secrets.

638
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
And he's friends with Chu Gui Hong.

639
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,200
He may know Chu Gui Hong's plan to take Chu away from the prince.

640
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,200
So he should be the one who saved him.

641
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,200
He should investigate everything carefully.

642
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,200
Isn't that good?

643
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
Look.

644
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,200
The traditional information collection doesn't have the summary.

645
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,200
It's not efficient at first.

646
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
It's troublesome to find the data.

647
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
Now it's different.

648
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
We can put the data in the summary.

649
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
It's not only one thing.

650
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,200
We can also do a high-efficiency summary.

651
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
It's a clear way.

652
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,200
It's not a good idea to change the way of the return.

653
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
It's just a general idea.

654
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
It's just a standard.

655
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,200
It's just a must for the workers.

656
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,200
You can evaluate the total value of every Likers in the future.

657
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
There are no other Likers.

658
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Only you can make boss give up principles.

659
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
Me?

660
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,200
But I just met your boss.

661
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,200
I don't even know his name.

662
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
That's right.

663
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,200
This is one of the biggest problems of boss.

664
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
He never leaves a good thing.

665
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Of course, he has many other problems.

666
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,200
For example?

667
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
Boss doesn't like women.

668
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,200
Don't listen to him.

669
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,200
Boss doesn't like women.

670
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
If he didn't manage the things in the gang every day,

671
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,200
how could he find his sister-in-law every day?

672
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
I beg you.

673
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
Don't be a mess.

674
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
It's because of his experience

675
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
that our brothers are full and short.

676
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,200
They don't have to eat and sleep anymore.

677
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
He is the boss in everyone's heart.

678
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,200
He is also the only boss, Li Shiliu.

679
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,200
Li Shiliu?

680
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,200
There is such a talented person in this script.

681
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
Why didn't I notice it before?

682
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,200
The buyer's life boss killed you.

683
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
The buyer's life boss killed me?

684
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Me?

685
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,200
So you brought me here on purpose.

686
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,200
It's the South Heng department's decision.

687
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
Miss Song,

688
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,200
the boss did kill your sister-in-law.

689
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
But he really loves you.

690
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Otherwise, our boss wouldn't stop us from killing you.

691
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
So...

692
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,200
You all want to kill me?

693
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
No.

694
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
Help!

695
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,200
Stop!

696
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,200
Help!

697
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Listen to me.

698
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,200
This is a misunderstanding.

699
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,200
This is not what you think.

700
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
You'd better not explain.

701
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
What are you doing?

702
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,200
Boss!

703
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,200
Did they bully you?

704
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,200
No, no, no.

705
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Boss, no.

706
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Miss Song and I get along well.

707
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,200
Right, Miss Song?

708
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Miss Song,

709
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,200
these people are all busy.

710
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,200
I hope you don't mind.

711
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,200
But we don't want to interfere in the court's affairs.

712
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,200
Please don't tell anyone about what happened tonight.

713
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,200
You mean you can let me go?

714
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,200
Don't worry, hero.

715
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
You saved my life.

716
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
I won't cause you any trouble.

717
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Don't worry.

718
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,200
Thank you.

719
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Thank you.

720
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,200
A'Long, A'Hu.

721
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,200
Yes.

722
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Take Miss Song back.

723
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,200
No.

724
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Tonight, the people in the army will be in charge.

725
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
A'Long, A'Hu must go with me.

726
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,200
I can't go.

727
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,200
What about Lao Huang and Lao Li?

728
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
They owe me money.

729
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
I'll do the job for them.

730
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,200
What about Lao Luo?

731
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,200
She has a baby and is in a hurry to go home.

732
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
I have a big moon.

733
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
I don't even have a capable person.

734
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,200
Isn't that the boss, Jianing?

735
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,200
It's dangerous to see your family off.

736
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,200
You must not do that.

737
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,200
How about I go home alone?

738
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,200
No way.

739
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,200
We are the most popular group in Ye You Shen.

740
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,200
How can we let a weak girl like Miss Song go alone?

741
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,200
You're right.

742
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,200
Boss.

743
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,200
Please.

744
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Please.

745
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,200
Let's get close to her as a savior.

746
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,200
Let's investigate everything carefully.

747
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
Isn't that good?

748
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,200
The boss did take the reward of the assassination of the Seventh Prince.

749
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
But the boss is really kind to you.

750
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,200
Otherwise, our boss wouldn't have come to kill you.

751
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,200
Miss Song.

752
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,200
You go first.

753
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
You go first.

754
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,200
Okay, I'll go first.

755
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
A'Long, A'Huo, they told me everything.

756
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,200
What did they say?

757
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,200
They said you took the business of killing me.

758
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
But you must have been forced to do that.

759
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
Right, boss?

760
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,200
Of course.

761
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,200
Of course, I had to do that.

762
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,200
You're a bunch of rascals.

763
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,200
Look, you saved me in the end.

764
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Boss, although we haven't been together for a long time,

765
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,200
I can see that you and A'Long, A'Huo, they are not bad people.

766
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
They are good people.

767
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,200
They can be the assassins in the Jianghu.

768
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,200
There must be some reasons for not being a good person.

769
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,200
Right?

770
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
What do you want to say?

771
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:33,200
I want to say that, boss, although you let me go today,

772
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
but from what I know about Nan Heng,

773
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
he will definitely not let you go.

774
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
Not only will he not let you go,

775
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,200
he will not let you go to the Hanjiang Courtyard,

776
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,200
and your brothers.

777
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,200
So, I want to make a suggestion.

778
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
I hope that we, the good villagers,

779
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
can think together,

780
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,200
and work together,

781
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,200
to fight against that cruel wolf man.

782
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,200
Okay?

783
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,200
What wolf man? What villagers?

784
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:05,200
You mean, you want me to fight against that high-ranking prince with you?

785
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,200
That's what I mean.

786
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,200
That's also for the sake of your safety.

787
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,200
Then why do you think that Nan Heng will not let me go?

788
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,200
Because he is a bad person.

789
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Do you understand?

790
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
He is a bad person.

791
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,200
You have been in the Jianghu for many years,

792
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
you must have heard of him.

793
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
He is a wolf man, he is very ambitious,

794
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,200
he is very cruel, he is very cruel.

795
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
I don't do it.

796
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
I frame the good and harm the women.

797
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,200
If it wasn't for the script,

798
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,200
I would have been a good man.

799
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
That's ridiculous.

800
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,200
Look, you also think it's ridiculous, right?

801
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,200
I'm so angry.

802
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
Why can a person like him,

803
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,200
who is so high-ranking,

804
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,200
do nothing but do nothing?

805
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
You are so stubborn.

806
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,200
Okay.

807
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,200
If Nan Heng is really as you said,

808
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
so vicious and vicious,

809
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
then let me ask you,

810
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,200
four years ago, in Jingyang,

811
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Qian Yi Jun did nothing,

812
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,200
he led the Black Armor Army to fight for seven days,

813
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,200
and then he was able to stop the war,

814
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
and then he was able to do new things.

815
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,200
Of course.

816
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,200
You don't even think about it.

817
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,200
Why is that?

818
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,200
Why?

819
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,200
It's because he was greedy for the mine of Jingyang,

820
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,200
and the name of the fake judge,

821
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
he also stole the money of the government.

822
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
Okay.

823
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Then,

824
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
five years ago, in the battle of Tancheng,

825
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
the Black Armor Army was trapped in the Yanku Pass,

826
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,200
Chu Gui Hong said he was here to rescue,

827
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
but he kept guarding the pass.

828
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
Nan Heng led the 2,000 Black Armor Army

829
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,200
to fight for 49 days to keep the pass.

830
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,200
What does that mean?

831
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,200
Hero,

832
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
it's because Nan Heng was too reckless,

833
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
and fell into the trap of the enemy.

834
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,200
Otherwise, how could this situation happen?

835
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
This pot can't be watered.

836
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,200
Okay.

837
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
Then we won't fight with them.

838
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,200
Ten years ago,

839
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,200
in the battle of Dongshuo,

840
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,200
the Black Armor Army had 5,000 soldiers,

841
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,200
and they fought against Dongshuo's 40,000 elite soldiers.

842
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
If Nan Heng hadn't taken the lead

843
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,200
in taking down the enemy's general,

844
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
how could he turn the situation around

845
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,200
and change the peace of the border for ten years?

846
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,200
What's wrong?

847
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,200
Hero, listen to me.

848
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,200
What?

849
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,200
Nan Heng is so reckless.

850
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
He fought against 40,000 elite soldiers.

851
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,200
What's wrong with him?

852
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,200
He's not good at the rear-end formation.

853
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,200
He's a general,

854
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,200
and he's the best in the front.

855
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,200
He's a bad guy.

856
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
Listen to me, Hero Li.

857
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,200
Nan Heng is...

858
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,200
He...

859
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,200
He may have a problem in his brain.

860
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,200
I'm sorry.

861
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,200
I'm sorry.

862
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,200
I'm sorry.

863
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,200
I'm sorry.

864
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,200
I'm sorry.

865
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,200
I'm sorry.

866
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,200
I'm sorry.

867
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,200
I'm sorry.

868
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,200
I'm sorry.

869
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,200
I'm sorry.

870
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,200
I'm sorry.

871
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,200
I'm sorry.

872
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,200
I'm sorry.

873
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,200
I'm sorry.

874
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,200
I'm sorry.

875
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,200
I'm sorry.

876
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,200
I'm sorry.

877
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,200
I'm sorry.

878
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,200
I'm sorry.

879
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,200
I'm sorry.

880
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,200
I'm sorry.

881
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,200
I'm sorry.

882
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,200
I'm sorry.

883
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,200
I'm sorry.

884
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,200
I'm sorry.

885
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,200
I'm sorry.

886
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,200
I'm sorry.

887
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,200
I'm sorry.

888
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,200
I'm sorry.

889
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,200
I'm sorry.

890
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,200
I'm sorry.

891
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,200
I'm sorry.

892
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,200
I'm sorry.

893
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,200
I'm sorry.

894
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,200
I'm sorry.

895
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,200
I'm sorry.

896
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,200
I'm sorry.

897
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,200
I'm sorry.

898
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,200
I'm sorry.

899
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,200
I'm sorry.

900
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,200
I'm sorry.

901
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,200
I'm sorry.

902
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,200
I'm sorry.

903
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,200
I'm sorry.

904
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,200
I'm sorry.

905
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,200
I'm sorry.

906
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,200
I'm sorry.

907
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,200
I'm sorry.

908
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,200
I'm sorry.

909
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,200
I'm sorry.

910
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,200
I'm sorry.

911
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,200
I'm sorry.

912
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,200
I'm sorry.

913
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,200
I'm sorry.

914
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,200
I'm sorry.

915
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,200
I'm sorry.

916
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,200
I'm sorry.

917
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,200
I'm sorry.

918
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,200
I'm sorry.

919
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,200
I'm sorry.

920
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,200
I'm sorry.

921
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
I'm sorry.

922
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,200
I'm sorry.

923
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,200
I'm sorry.

924
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,200
I'm sorry.

925
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,200
I'm sorry.

926
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,200
I'm sorry.

927
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,200
I'm sorry.

928
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,200
I'm sorry.

929
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,200
I'm sorry.

930
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,200
I'm sorry.

931
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,200
I'm sorry.

932
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,200
I'm sorry.

933
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,200
I'm sorry.

934
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,200
I'm sorry.

935
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,200
I'm sorry.

936
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,200
I'm sorry.

937
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,200
I'm sorry.

938
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,200
I'm sorry.

939
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,200
I'm sorry.

940
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,200
I'm sorry.

941
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,200
I'm sorry.

942
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,200
I'm sorry.

943
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,200
I'm sorry.

944
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,200
I'm sorry.

945
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,200
I'm sorry.

946
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,200
