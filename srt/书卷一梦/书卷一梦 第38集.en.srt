175
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,290
and had a strange dream.

176
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,390
I trust her.

177
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,180
Think about it.

178
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,320
Even this whole world is painted,

179
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,720
what else is impossible?

180
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,510
Is there any other clues

181
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,310
in this round of reincarnation?

182
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,550
Actually, I've been through
a reincarnation

183
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,840
when I first came here.

184
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,630
At that time,

185
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,790
I wanted to marry Chu Guihong

186
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,270
and the script says

187
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,800
I would definitely run away
from the wedding.

188
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,870
So later,

189
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,270
no matter how hard I tried
to change the plot,

190
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,800
my life ends in a tragic way.

191
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,870
Why can't I untie it?

192
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,600
Time to roll!

193
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,180
My Lady.

194
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,630
My Lady!

195
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,610
I don't want to be in this world anymore.

196
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,000
It seems that the reincarnation

197
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,210
was triggered again this time

198
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,550
because I died.

199
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,860
You mean

200
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,240
as long as you die,

201
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,790
we can come back to this moment?

202
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,600
That's right.

203
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,720
Then,

204
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,910
how can the Chu family fight against us?

205
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,870
If the situation is going south,

206
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,520
you can just kill yourself.

207
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,640
You have a point.

208
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,670
If anything happens,

209
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,550
I'll die again.

210
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,200
What do you mean have a point?

211

Nothing will go wrong.

That won't do.

216
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,080
What if the reincarnation fails?

217
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,270
Or if there’s a twist
in the cycle of reincarnation?

218

It's really different this time.

give everyone a chance to start over.

Who else can take the risk if I don't?

You are the key to
the either-or selection at the city tower.

Let me ask you.

348
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,480
Where did this come from?

349
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,120
I...

350
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,080
I bought it at the South City market.

351
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,820
Did you meet anyone on the way?

352
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,080
Yesterday,

353
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,080
I...

354
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,600
I met Rong Hua.

355
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,680
Rong Hua?

356
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,670
That's it.

357
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,510
Her Majesty's death anniversary
is around the corner.

358
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,370
Red tangerines from Dongting

359
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,120
were Her Majesty's favourite food
when she was still alive.

360
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,320
Every year at this time,

361
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,840
Rui will have red tangerines
with Your Majesty

362
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,750
as memorial.

363
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,510
Not many people in the palace
know about this.

364
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,580
But Chu Guihong is one of them.

365
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So,

366
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,210
I guess he must have bribed the vendors

367
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,840
and poisoned the tangerines

368
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,170
to poison Your Majesty.

369
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,600
Impossible.

370
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,240
No matter how bold Guihong is,

371
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,750
he wouldn't dare to kill His Majesty.

372
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,480
If he really wanted to kill someone,

373
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,910
he will kill you first.

374
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,670
You're right.

375
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,090
He's trying to kill

376
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,750
all three of us.

377
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,870
Heng.

378
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,590
I'm afraid

379
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,550
this is just your guess.

380
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,790
Let me ask you.

381
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
Do you have proof?

382
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,670
Your Majesty,

383
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,030
you can ask someone
from the royal medical office to test

384
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,960
and you'll know if it's true.

385
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,270
No.

386
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,270
What's the need of doing that?

387
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,000
Heng.

388
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,480
If you don't believe me,

389
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
I'll have it myself now

390
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,340
and let you see if it's poisonous.

391
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,750
I trust you.

392
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,560
Liu Mingxi.

393
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,270
Send someone from the royal medical office
to test for poison.

394
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,080
Yes.

395
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,120
Heng.

396
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,420
Send your men to South City

397
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,080
and send the vendor involved

398
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,630
to the prison of the Ministry of Justice

399
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,830
and hand him to Yan Yi.

400
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,580
Yes.

401
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,440
Your Majesty.

402
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,640
I have one more thing.

403
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,630
Go ahead.

404
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,340
I beg Your Majesty

405
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,870
to deploy the troops in the outskirts
back to the city

406
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,620
and send the Xuanjia Army
back to the capital as soon as possible

407
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,050
in case of emergency.

408
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,170
What...

409
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,349
What's happening today?

410
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:16,190
[Capital]

411
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,960
Junior General,

412
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,440
it's just as you expected,

413
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,030
After Nan Heng entered
His Majesty's bed chamber,

414
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,070
His Majesty and the 18th Prince

415
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,310
didn't eat the poisoned food.

416
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,110
Not only that,

417
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,070
His Majesty also deployed the Xuanjia Army
to the capital.

418
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,360
[Capital]

419
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,510
Deploy troops to the capital?

420
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,730
Is the news true?

421
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,680
Yes.

422
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,430
The eunuch we planted in the bed chamber
said so.

423
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,350
What about the vendor selling red tangerines?

424
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,280
Did you send him out of the capital?

425
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,220
We were too late.

426
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:53,300
[Capital]

427
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,680
By the time you asked me to rush there,

428
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,010
he was just taken away
by the Xuanjia Army.

429
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,280
Junior General,

430
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,480
now,

431
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,740
what should we do next?

432
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,550
That vendor

433
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,880
won't be able to stand severe torture

434
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,980
and will give us away.

435
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,270
[Capital]

436
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
At that time,

437
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,030
if we were to be sentenced to death
for treason,

438
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,440
then...

439
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,370
So what about it?

440
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,260
Since he's pushing me to the dead end,

441
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,030
I won't go easy on him.

442
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,640
Tell Rong Hua

443
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,920
to act in advance.

444
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,680
Yes.

445
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,070
The wound is two inches deep,

446
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,290
caused by a Qianyu Sword.

447
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,890
I'm afraid Mrs. Shangguan
has been taken away by the Qianyu Army.

448
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,070
The footprints went that way.

449
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,200
Seems like they just left not long ago.

450
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,480
Go after them!

451
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,340
Second Master.

452
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,240
The situation have changed.

453
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,040
Should we report to Chief first?

454
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,160
Chief is still in the palace.

455
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,720
We definitely don't have enough time
to go back and forth.

456
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,920
Now that we are all here,

457
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,550
save the people first.

458
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,000
Let's go.

459
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,510
Go.

460
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,160
Go.

461
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,740
Second Master.

462
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,940
Yiting's hairpin.

463
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,110
Second Master.

464
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,310
There's one here too.

465
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,310
Second Master.

466
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,340
Second Master.

467
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,440
Do you think

468
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,110
Mrs. Shangguan left this here on purpose

469
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,370
so that we can find her?

470
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,420
It could also be a trap.

471
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,070
Shall we chase after them?

472
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,830
Let's go.

473
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,180
Let's go inside.

474
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,230
Mrs. Shangguan.

475
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,710
Mrs. Shangguan.

476
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,730
Yiting.

477
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,370
Mrs. Shangguan.

478
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,000
Yiting.

479
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,100
Mrs. Shangguan.

480
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,210
Mrs. Shangguan.

481
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,780
Mrs. Shangguan.

482
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,720
Run!

483
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,550
Run! Quick! Run!

484
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,590
Run! Hurry!

485
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,690
Shangguan He!

486
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,650
Chu Guihong, are you crazy?

487
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,810
What grudge does you have against him?

488
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,200
Why?

489
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,750
Is it painful

490
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,370
watching the person you love die

491
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,420
in front of you

492
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,670
while you can't do anything?

493
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,130
Yiting.

494
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,090
You bastard!

495
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,640
Yiting.

496
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,810
I've already tasted this

497
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,030
in the Pingrong Battle.

498
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,070
My father was killed by Nan Heng.

499
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,330
Why can't I kill one of his subordinates?

500
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,430
Let go of me!

501
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,340
Guihong, listen to me.

502
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,830
The person you hate

503
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,220
should be Nan Heng, right?

504
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,050
It shouldn't be us.

505
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,350
Yiting and I

506
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,070
have never wronged you.

507
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,270
I beg you.

508
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,070
Let Yiting go.

509
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,750
No matter what's your plan
against Nan Heng,

510
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,920
I can help you.

511
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,550
Can't I help you?

512
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,280
You don't have to do this.

513
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,250
We insignificant people

514
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,140
should be helping each other.

515
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,880
Mother!

516
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,200
Let go of me!

517
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,320
Let go of me!

518
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,030
Mother!

519
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,510

00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,220
[7. Turned into a human swine
in the Cold Palace]

695
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,070
It was right near this spot

696
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,240
that he struck me down,

697
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,000
wasn't it?

698
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,030
Yes.

699
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,110
But

700
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,880
that was the old script.

701
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,000
And soon,

702
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,450
you will die by his hands still.

703
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,790
In that case,

704
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,600
Song Yimeng,

705
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,120
why do you still help him?

706
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
Because he's no longer

707
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,030
the Nan Heng he used to be.

708
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,070
Chu Guihong.

709
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,700
I came to see you today,

710
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,410
other than because my family
is still in your hands,

711
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,570
I also want to advise you one last time.

712
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,440
Like you, Nan Heng and I

713
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,310
hate the script

714
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,750
that has control over everyone's fate.

715
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,680
What we're doing now

716
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,960
is exactly trying our best

717
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,550
to change our fates,

718
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,590
including that of the Song family,

719
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,540
all the people

720
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,200
of the Waning River Crescent

721
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,030
and you.

722
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,680
If you can let go of your obsession,

723
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,740
in this vast world,

724
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,220
you can

725
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,880
establish achievements

726
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,070
and conquer the battlefield anywhere.

727
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,880
You can even be a hero

728
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,750
like your father.

729
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,450
Enough.

730
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,230
Why should I believe you?

731
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,070
Why should I condescend myself

732
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:29,000
and be Nan Heng's subordinate
for the rest of my life?

733
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,310
I learned swordsmanship at six,

734
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,590
and was stationed at the border at 17.

735
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,160
My injuries are no less than Nan Heng

736
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,110
and the amount of people I protected
are also no less than him.

737
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,380
But in the end,

738
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,270
just because he is the destined male lead,

739
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,790
just because of
a few strokes from the puppeteer,

740
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,200
I deserve to be trampled

741
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,480
and die by his hands?

742
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,070
Song Yimeng.

743
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,510
Tell me.

744
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,480
If you were me,

745
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,210
wouldn't you

746
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,790
fight back?

747
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,010
Of course I will.

748
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,290
But I won't be like you,

749
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,920
hurting innocent lives

750
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,920
to achieve your goal.

751
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,470
Have you ever thought about it?

752
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,180
For your own selfish desire,

753
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,680
you made innocent people

754
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,200
your sacrifice.

755
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,060
Have you thought about all these?

756
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,540
I'm also telling you,

757
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,550
the one who caused your tragic fate

758
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,800
wasn't Nan Heng,

759
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,940
but the old script.

760
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,050
You're right.

761
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:31,880
The one at fault

762
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,830
is that parasite inside my father.

763
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,940
So I killed him.

764
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,030
Why?

765
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,330
Is it strange?

766
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,070
Because Chu Guihong should be a patriot

767
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,350
who never let others down,

768
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,110
that's why

769
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,400
I can't kill anyone?

770
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,390
I should have known

771
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,500
that you are no longer the Chu Guihong
you used to be.

772
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,990
Then are you still the Song Yimeng I know?

773
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,970
My Yimeng

774
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,890
is the person who trusts me the most
in this world.

775
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,010
She never stands against me

776
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,230
and will never side my enemy.

777
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,100
Song Xiaoyu.

778
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,940
You don't have to say anything.

779
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,380
I won't let you go

780
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,120
before my plan succeeds.

781
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,900
So you want to take me hostage

782
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,740
and lure Nan Heng here?

783
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,160
Let me tell you.

784
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,350
Dream on.

785
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,030
He won't come.

786
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,400
You're right.

787
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,310
But this

788
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,830
is not enough.

789
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,430
Come.

790
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,420
Wake up.

791
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,080
Wake up.

792
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,410
Your Highness.

793
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,480
I found them.

794
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:38,770
Hurry.

795
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,270
Give me a hand.

796
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:41,920
Here.

Get someone to save him.

801

Yes.

802

Here.

Shanhu.

813

His breath is weak.

814
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,430
I'm afraid he can't survive.

815
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,790
Don't forget.

This time,

818

I will die behind you.

My condolences.

820
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,220
What condolences?

821
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,550
Get the imperial physician here!

Okay.

Stop talking.

I'm sorry.

Your target is me and Nan Heng.

What grudge do you have
against the Song family?

[Shining Stars and Moon]

852

There was no grudge in the past.

At that time,

854
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,540
Mr. Song even treated me as a son-in-law.

You changed first,
