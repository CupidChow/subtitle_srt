00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry.

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Jia Ru Ru, are you really not considering

89
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
locking me up in a small dark room?

90
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Then we can have a meal together.

91
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What's going on?

92
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Why is it not moving?

93
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Help me!

94
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
There's a murderer again!

95
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We can't let water get inside!

96
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Don't let water get inside!

97
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
No way.

98
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It wants me to die again?

99
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I've died many times.

100
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No way.

101
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm really not going to die.

102
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm not going to die.

103
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Nan Heng?

104
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He looks exactly like Nan Feng.

105
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He has the same ugly face.

106
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The same...

107
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'd better just die.

108
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm going to suffocate to death today.

109
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm not going to be heartless to you.

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're going down alone?

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Are you sure?

112
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's still our famous god,

113
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
the Seventh Prince.

114
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He's so arrogant.

115
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Ting Ting!

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Ting Ting!

117
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I heard someone fell into the water.

118
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Are you okay?

119
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm standing here and it's fine.

120
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I fell into the water first.

121
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And the Seventh Prince.

122
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The Seventh Prince?

123
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No way.

124
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He's got a golden day.

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What's going on?

126
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh no.

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The Ming Dynasty's coming.

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Thank you for saving me.

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I have to go.

130
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm leaving.

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm leaving.

132
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I know.

133
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I designed the water to seduce the Seventh Prince.

134
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why are you still here?

136
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You want to leave?

137
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Now you know?

138
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What did you say to me?

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Chu Gui Heng is going to marry me.

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The Seventh Prince is going to...

141
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Sister Zhang, what's going on?

142
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You ask me?

143
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm asking you?

144
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You're still pretending to me.

145
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm dead.

146
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm going to die today.

147
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm going to break this relationship.

148
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What are you doing?

149
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I saved you just now.

150
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You saved me?

151
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The Seventh Prince is going to marry me.

152
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He has other reasons, right?

153
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay.

154
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What?

155
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I saw through it, right?

156
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're so close to me.

157
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Isn't it just for the sake of the Song family's power?

158
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Do you really think I don't know anything?

159
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Well said.

160
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I didn't expect the two girls of the Song family

161
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
to be so good at acting.

162
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So you mean

163
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I should let you die, right?

164
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yes.

165
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Once there was a famous person who said

166
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
give up helping others to be close

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and respect others' fate.

168
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Do you understand?

169
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay.

170
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If there's a next time,

171
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll let you die.

172
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
There's no next time.

173
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I and the Seventh Prince

174
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
will be good friends forever.

175
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
See you.

176
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Again?

177
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Your Highness, what should we do now?

178
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You...

179
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What's wrong?

180
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What's wrong?

181
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Your Highness,

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
did you save my daughter just now?

183
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What are you doing?

184
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Your Highness,

185
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm so sorry

186
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
that I couldn't repay you.

187
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Now I just want to pick the flowers

188
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and make a wish.

189
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Stop it.

190
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,080
Hua Duong

191
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
I won't let you suffer.

192
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,000
Please retort to Duyen.

193
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I want to use your blood.

194
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,200
Why did you choose to take the paper and the phoenix

195
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,000
for this?

196
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What is this?

197
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What's going on?

198
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't know what happened.

199
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What?

200
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He Baltimore me.

201
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What's wrong with me?

202
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Why my body is not listening to me?

203
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It seems that the emperor is enjoying himself.

204
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Is this also his plan?

205
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm afraid that I can't be with you forever.

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The 7th Prince's worship is gone.

207
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We...

208
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm controlled by him.

209
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Fugui, take this girl away.

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I...

211
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Don't be so arrogant.

212
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's the first time that the 7th Prince is so suspicious.

213
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I...

214
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's the first time that my wife is so suspicious.

215
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Really?

216
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
How can she be so suspicious?

217
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You're old.

218
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Go away.

219
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Shut up.

220
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Our prince is getting married tonight.

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Did you hear that?

222
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The 7th Prince's worship is gone.

223
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Who is so bold?

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The eldest daughter of the Song family.

225
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Really?

226
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll tell you this alone.

227
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't tell anyone.

228
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You must keep your mouth shut.

229
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Whoever tells anyone will be a dog.

230
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's true.

231
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Thunder and lightning strike together.

232
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The wind and the wine are separated.

233
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's hard to separate.

234
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's true.

235
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The 7th Prince has sent the wife of the Song family to the prison.

236
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh my god.

237
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You dare not write like this in the book.

238
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The same hairpin of the Song family.

239
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The god of death can be confused.

240
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Look.

241
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The new Mengmeng incense.

242
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's a light and pure incense.

243
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The color of the rouge that the royal family's children prefer.

244
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I bought it.

245
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Our girl just used this.

246
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's why she lost the 7th Prince's incense.

247
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Which one do you think it is?

248
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Could it be that one?

249
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Which one can it be?

250
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's that one.

251
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Which one is that?

252
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The girl is talking about the snake.

253
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You two are not doing your job, right?

254
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You...

255
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You're quite old.

256
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You're teaching the snake to follow you.

257
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Go to work.

258
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You are an actress.

259
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
An actress who is in her prime.

260
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You just had a kiss with your partner.

261
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That's all.

262
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Kiss?

263
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's a big deal.

264
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Which actor has never kissed?

265
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Right?

266
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's just that you're an actress.

267
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You're a little perverted.

268
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're a little perverted.

269
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You're not afraid of strangers.

270
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You're afraid of people.

271
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You're a little perverted.

272
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You're a little perverted.

273
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You're a little perverted.

274
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You're a little perverted.

275
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm not.

276
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh my god.

277
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
When have I ever acted in such a ridiculous play?

278
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's just a disgrace.

279
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Can you be a person?

280
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Even if it's to promote the plot,

281
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
you can't treat me as a tool.

282
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Miss.

283
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You really ruined the one who killed the god.

284
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh my god.

285
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Miss is dying.

286
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
How could she be infected with the Seventh Prince?

287
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Don't you think you're very separated recently?

288
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Now you're afraid.

289
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Who's the one who has to send me to the palace?

290
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm the only one who has ever read the script.

291
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That means only I know what the plot is about.

292
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
No matter if these producers are willing or not,

293
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
their existence is just to promote the relationship between Nan Heng and me.

294
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Where are the tool people?

295
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So,

296
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
force into the palace,

297
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
fall into the water,

298
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
and then die.

299
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm not a tool.

300
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm a tool.

301
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm a tool.

302
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And that part,

303
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm not controlled.

304
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
All of these are the strong points of the script.

305
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But I'm a heroine,

306
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I have to fight with the script.

307
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Your Highness.

308
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I've already sent someone to deal with the garden.

309
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
No one will talk about your sister.

310
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
If anyone...

311
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Your Highness,

312
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
if anyone talks about it,

313
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I...

314
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Your Highness,

315
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
you're getting cold.

316
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hurry.

317
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Drink some soup.

318
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Your Highness,

319
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
your trick is so wonderful.

320
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
In order to seduce Song's daughter,

321
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
you first jumped into the lake to save her.

322
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Then you were in the water,

323
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
and then you were willing to take the bait.

324
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I almost got fooled by you.

325
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I didn't.

326
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What I did today,

327
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
wasn't my intention.

328
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Then why did you...

329
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It must be that Song Yi Meng,

330
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
used some magic to control me.

331
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Your Highness Qi,

332
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
was that you who saved my sister?

333
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You...

334
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I was just saying.

335
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Your Highness is usually the most serious.

336
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
When we see that Song's daughter,

337
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
it's like she's changed.

338
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What should we do?

339
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Your Highness,

340
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
how about I go to the Zi Yin Temple,

341
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and ask some masters to come and see?

342
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
To get some air.

343
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
No wonder Chu Gui Hong hasn't married yet.

344
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It seems that she's a demon.

345
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Chu Gui Hong hasn't married yet?

346
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Just like us,

347
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
we're all beggars.

348
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Your Highness,

349
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I mean,

350
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
when Song's daughter was six years old,

351
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
she was taken over by King Qian Yu,

352
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and the Chu family's daughter.

353
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
This incident was also reported to His Majesty.

354
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But at that time,

355
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
His Highness was in the cold.

356
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
He didn't know about this.

357
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So many years have passed,

358
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
the Chu family has been fighting the border.

359
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I thought this marriage was over.

360
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I didn't expect Chu Gui Hong

361
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
to be like a demon.

362
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
She didn't marry or marry.

363
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
She's just like a Song's daughter.

364
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There's such a thing?

365
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Since Chu Gui Hong is so loyal to her,

366
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
don't blame me for being too honest.

367
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm sorry.

368
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What do you mean?

369
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Don't tell anyone about the incident at the Imperial Garden.

370
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I want everyone to know about it.

371
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Understood.

372
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Your Highness,

373
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Prime Minister Gao is back.

374
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Uncle.

375
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Your Highness.

376
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Don't stand on ceremony.

377
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Isn't Uncle in Lianghuai?

378
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Why did he come back suddenly?

379
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I just got the news.

380
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
His Majesty secretly arranged for two officials

381
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
to assist 18th Prince's party to set up a tent on the way.

382
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
His Majesty's favor

383
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
has long been weak.

384
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
No matter how much I earn

385
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
and get many achievements

386
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
with this life,

387
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm still a man of the past.

388
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What's the matter with these people?

389
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't know how Your Highness will deal with them.

390
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I have troops from all over the country.

391
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
My 20,000 Black Armor Army

392
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
will never defeat Chu Gui Hong's army of Qianyu.

393
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But Chu Gui Hong has the way to cut the road

394
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
from the Taizu Dynasty.

395
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
If my Black Armor Army learns this method,

396
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
in the future,

397
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
whether it's self-protection or...

398
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Or...

399
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Or...

400
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'll have many more victories.

401
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Then I'll sneak into the tent

402
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
and help Your Highness get things done soon.

403
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Uncle, do you have any news?

404
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
During the battle of Chu Gui Hong,

405
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
he often sent letters to the women who were close to him in the capital.

406
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Before the battle of Pingrong,

407
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
he sent a letter to the women who were close to him in the capital.

408
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I think

409
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
the way to cut the road

410
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
is in the hands of this woman.

411
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's Song Yimeng?

412
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Do you know him?

413
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Not only do I know him,

414
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
he was the daughter of Minister Song of the Ministry of War.

415
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I want to take him to have a good relationship with Song Yide.

416
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I didn't expect that he had an accident.

417
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Move it in!

418
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yes!

419
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Follow me!

420
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Hurry up!

421
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Yes!

422
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Move it in!

423
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Three boxes of painting, three boxes of jewelry,

424
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
500 taels of gold,

425
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and a pair of gold-plated clothes.

426
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So much money!

427
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
A jade-like cake,

428
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and two pieces of silver-plated shoes.

429
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
A piece of blue jade-like pearl,

430
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
and a jade-like plum.

431
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So much money!

432
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Miss Song,

433
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
you were frightened in the palace yesterday.

434
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Today, you are a little bit tired.

435
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Please be filial to her and give her a good life.

436
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
These are all Nan Heng's things?

437
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm sorry.

438
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm not suitable.

439
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Get out!

440
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Your Highness,

441
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Miss Song didn't come to see us last night.

442
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What should we do?

443
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You should be diligent and considerate.

444
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I have to do something

445
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
that he can't agree to.

446
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
This one is good.

447
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
This one is good.

448
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
This one is good.

449
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Brother,

450
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
what are you doing this time?

451
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Nan Heng,

452
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
stop crying!

453
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Thank you, boss.

454
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Okay.

455
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
This...

456
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Why is this guy always not here?

457
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I won't eat sweet and sour pork anymore.

458
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I won't eat spicy food anymore!

459
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Today, the Seventh Prince is doing something new.

460
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Did you memorize it?

461
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The Seventh Prince is doing something new?

462
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Of course.

463
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I heard that the Black Armor Army that the Seventh Prince is following

464
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
is going to be the new leader of the army.

465
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I heard that the Black Armor Army is going to be the new leader of the army.

466
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I heard that the Black Armor Army that the Seventh Prince is following

467
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
is going to be the new leader of the army.

468
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I won't listen to you!

469
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I won't listen to you!

470
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I won't listen to you!

471
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I won't listen to you!

472
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I won't listen to you!

473
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I won't listen to you!

474
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Seventh Prince!

475
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Seventh Prince!

476
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Seventh Prince!

477
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Seventh Prince!

478
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Why is there so many people in the whole room?

479
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Seventh Prince!

480
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Oh my god!

481
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't want to date a guy.

482
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Is it that hard?

483
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Say it.

484
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What do you want to force me to do again?

485
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You still have the nerve to ask me what I want to do?

486
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
People like Song Yimeng are so hot-tempered for marriage.

487
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Before the banquet,

488
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
what did I tell you?

489
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I told you to take down the Eighteenth Prince.

490
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
He is the most powerful man in the Great Qing Dynasty.

491
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Even the Emperor likes the future Chu army.

492
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Where can you find another man like this?

493
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Hey, I'm talking to you.

494
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Your mother has already investigated the whereabouts of the Eighteenth Prince.

495
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You just go out and give her a chance to recover.

496
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I don't have to waste my energy.

497
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I've decided that I won't get married in this life.

498
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Song Yiting, do you really think you're eighteen years old waiting for me to raise you?

499
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I can tell you that if you keep dragging on like this,

500
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
those good husbands will be chosen by others.

501
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
By then, you will regret it.

502
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What?

503
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Zhan Dai, Yin Zhu, I'm leaving.

504
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yes.

505
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Song Yiting!

506
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What is this?

507
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I can't write poems, but I can read.

508
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm leaving.

509
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What are you doing?

510
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What?

511
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What's this?

512
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Your Highness,

513
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Our lady is really sick.

514
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Not that, our Highness has been here for ten days,

515
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
but your lady is sick for seven days.

516
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,380
The

517
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,280
Go

518
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
He really said that?

519
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
No, no.

520
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Seventh Prince also said that

521
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I have to see him today anyway.

522
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Let him give up and fight.

523
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Don't resist anymore.

524
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Otherwise, he will ruin the reputation of the two princes.

525
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
He will be completely confused.

526
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
He is just a word-bender.

527
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
He has seen shameless people.

528
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
He has never seen such shameless people.

529
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
This modern song

530
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
is also a good song to make a fight.

531
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's strange.

532
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
There is no hot-picking

533
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
and a love-hate relationship.

534
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Is it the ghost of the scriptwriter again?

535
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Must the heroine

536
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
be in love?

537
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Miss!

538
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Miss!

539
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Miss!

540
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Bad news!

541
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Seventh Prince and his men broke in.

542
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You two fight.

543
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'll go to the toilet.

544
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Miss!

545
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Master, please go over there.

546
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Seventh Prince is also here.

547
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Is the wind cold of Lord Song good?

548
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Just right.

549
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Your snow water is fried with white tea

550
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
mixed with fish and orange peel.

551
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Lord Song has a good taste.

552
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
This is the same as the water

553
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
that was taken by the snow that year

554
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
in the Meilin in the city.

555
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I know that today the prince came

556
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and specially let people take it from the ground.

557
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Prince, taste this tea.

558
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Is it a three-year-old fairy?

559
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It's really a fairy.

560
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Everyone says that Seventh Prince

561
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
is good at military skills and has a lot of experience.

562
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I didn't expect that he was so good

563
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
at this kind of winter and summer.

564
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Unlike my daughter

565
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
who only knows to play around

566
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and doesn't have a good sense of humor,

567
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I put the water and the water

568
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
in front of her at the same time.

569
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
She can't tell the difference.

570
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It seems that the prince and my daughter

571
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
are really like a cloud and mud.

572
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Lord Song, you're wrong.

573
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I've seen a lot of these things.

574
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
But I just like

575
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
a girl like Miss Song who doesn't care about the world

576
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
and goes to the world of carving.

577
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The heaven knows the child

578
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
can't compare with a common girl.

579
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The prince is going to do something big in the future.

580
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
But my Song family

581
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
is already old.

582
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm afraid that after this half-life

583
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I will not have the opportunity to help the prince.

584
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
There are some things

585
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
that the prince should do better.

586
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Okay.

587
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Miss Song and I have a mutual love.

588
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
We can't talk about helping each other.

589
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But I deeply appreciate your love for your daughter.

590
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So don't worry.

591
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
As long as you're willing to let me take care of your daughter,

592
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
after a hundred years,

593
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I will definitely take care of the Song family.

594
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Isn't it a beautiful thing?

595
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You...

596
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Father.

597
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Your Highness.

598
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Xiaomeng.

599
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Come on, come on, come on, sit down.

600
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Sit down.

601
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Miss Song's cold has also been cured?

602
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Your Highness.

603
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Her cold is getting better.

604
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
The cough is also a sign of a cold.

605
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
So she doesn't dare to go out today.

606
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
What's going on?

607
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Didn't the script say that they were always in disagreement?

608
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Why did Nan Heng have to be on the table?

609
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Xiaomeng.

610
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Didn't you say that day you and the prince were in the green garden?

611
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Is there a misunderstanding?

612
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I asked the prince to come today

613
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
just to let you make it clear to the prince.

614
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Master Song is wrong.

615
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That day, among the officials on the case,

616
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Miss Song and I were trying to protect each other.

617
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Why did you misunderstand?

618
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Your Highness, you don't have to say that.

619
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
My daughter has been engaged to the Chu family since childhood.

620
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
She has always followed the rules.

621
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
The rules are dead.

622
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
People are alive.

623
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Then the living can't let the outside people die.

624
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So my daughter

625
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
will never dare to have any feelings for you.

626
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Your Highness, don't think too much.

627
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Come on, come on.

628
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Drink tea.

629
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Drink tea.

630
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So Master Song means

631
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I have over-reacted.

632
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Meng.

633
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Who is right about me and the prince?

634
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Miss Song,

635
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
you say.

636
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
This is a business of love.

637
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Business of love?

638
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Miss Song,

639
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
that day,

640
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I saved you from the lake.

641
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But if you don't remember what happened on the shore,

642
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I don't suggest

643
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
you mention it to Master Song again.

644
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Your Highness, you are so wise.

645
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
That day, in the garden,

646
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I saved you.

647
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's my good fortune.

648
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Recently, you have done so many things for me.

649
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I am so grateful.

650
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I can't forget it.

651
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But

652
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I can't force you to do something about love.

653
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You can just take it as

654
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I was too impulsive

655
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
and had a crush on someone.

656
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I made a mistake

657
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
that most women would make.

658
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
But I also have one thing

659
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
to ask you.

660
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You are a master of martial arts.

661
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
No one can beat you.

662
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But why did you have to do that?

663
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I am not the one who can do that.

664
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
But why did you have to

665
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
do that in public?

666
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You didn't take the initiative,

667
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
you didn't refuse, you didn't take responsibility.

668
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Do you want to make the same mistake

669
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
that all men would do?

670
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Why did Meng Ruofen lie to her?

671
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So,

672
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
she can't do it.

673
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I did make a mistake.

674
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
But you

675
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
are also a bad person.

676
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But don't worry.

677
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I am not the kind of person

678
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
who will force you to take responsibility.

679
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
The impulsive feeling of the moment is over.

680
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Let it go.

681
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
From today,

682
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
let's walk side by side

683
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
in the world.

684
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
What do you think, Your Highness?

685
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I think I should cut off her love line.

686
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Yes.

687
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Don't drink or eat in the future.

688
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Understand?

689
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Your Highness.

690
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
The misunderstanding is solved.

691
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Come, let's drink tea.

692
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Drink tea.

693
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Sir Song,

694
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
since it has been solved,

695
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
it's better for us to not be mistaken.

696
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I don't bother you anymore.

697
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,240
Miss Song, can you send me out?

698
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,760
No, it's not appropriate, Your Highness.

699
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,600
The concubines just got married.

700
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,400
They will gossip.

701
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,120
Meng,

702
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,280
all visitors are guests.

703
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,360
And Your Highness is so wise.

704
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,520
Moreover,

705
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,640
our family

706
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,280
can't be rude.

707
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,440
Please, Your Highness.

708
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:28,920
Your Highness,

709
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,120
Miss Song is not from the same family.

710
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,120
She doesn't like you.

711
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,880
Shut up.

712
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,520
Honey,

713
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,840
we wereWhy my husband goes missing so muchoccupied?

714
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,800
He goes togebaut into a cave,

715
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,880
Where can he sleep?

716
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,520
He wants to eat something sweet.

717
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,360
You will have a good night rest.

718
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,960
It's such a pity that I can't read it.

719
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,160
I have something to tell Miss Song

720
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,840
I think you don't need to

721
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,840
I have said everything I should say

722
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
What are you doing?

723
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,880
I want to see what will happen

724
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,880
That day, you controlled me

725
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,880
Is it right?

726
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,880
I have to go

727
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,880
I have to go

728
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,880
You were controlled too?

729
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,880
Yes

730
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,880
Stop pretending

731
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,880
Say it

732
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,880
What do you want to do?

733
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,880
I don't understand what you are talking about

734
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,880
I saved you that day

735
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,880
You didn't appreciate it

736
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,880
You sent me a message in the dark

737
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,880
Now you want to use a misunderstanding to talk to me

738
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,880
What? Do I look like a fool?

739
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,880
No, it's a misunderstanding

740
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,880
It's true

741
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,880
Sorry

742
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,880
It's not right here

743
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,880
Say it

744
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,880
How can I explain it?

745
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,880
The script is set, the heroine is emotional, the scene is not in time

746
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,880
She has to tell me now

747
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,880
Say it

748
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,880
I said, don't be impulsive

749
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,880
I said

750
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Actually

751
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,880
Actually

752
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,880
The scriptwriter hit me

753
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,880
The scriptwriter hit you?

754
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
Yes

755
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,880
The scriptwriter hit me

756
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,880
It's a mysterious power

757
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,880
She knows everything

758
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,880
And she can control everyone's life and death

759
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,880
If you really can't understand

760
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,880
You can take her as a Bodhisattva

761
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,880
A Bodhisattva, Buddha, etc.

762
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,880
She told me a lot of dreams about you

763
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,880
So I came to this world to help you

764
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,880
We are a team

765
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
Goddess

766
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
Dream-telling

767
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,880
Continue

768
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,880
I didn't make it up

769
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,880
When you were nine years old, the emperor threw you into the Cold Palace

770
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,880
You were so clumsy, but he didn't ask

771
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,880
When you were ten years old, you were practicing martial arts

772
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,880
You were scheming and you were so stubborn

773
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,880
You almost got a disability

774
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
Am I right?

775
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,880
The End

776
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,880
I'm sorry

777
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,880
I'm sorry

778
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,880
I'm sorry

779
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,880
I'm sorry

780
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,880
I'm sorry

781
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,880
I'm sorry

782
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,880
I'm sorry

783
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,880
I'm sorry

784
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,880
I'm sorry

785
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,880
I'm sorry

786
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,880
I'm sorry

787
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,880
I'm sorry

788
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,880
I'm sorry

789
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,880
I'm sorry

790
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,880
I'm sorry

791
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,880
I'm sorry

792
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,880
I'm sorry

793
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,880
I'm sorry

794
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,880
I'm sorry

795
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,880
no

796
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,880
Be careful

797
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,880
No

798
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,880
You

799
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,880
Umm

800
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,880
I'll waterside

801
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,180
Talking about a miracle,

802
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,600
that's a far cry to hurt.

803
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,400
Thank you for all your efforts,

804
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,380
but don't dare to depending on zuleft.

805
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,600
Everyone, like and subscribe Gallaudet to my channel.

806
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,420
Otherwise, I'll miss you too much.

807
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,600
In fact,

808
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,260
you're not a really strong girl at all.

809
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,260
What do you want?

810
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,260
What do you want?

811
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,260
What do you want?

812
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,260
What do you want?

813
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,260
In three days,

814
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,260
I want you to give me all the letters

815
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:36,260
that Song Yi Mo and Chu Gui Hong have.

816
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,260
Otherwise...

817
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,260
Letter?

818
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,260
What are you looking for?

819
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,260
The Cutting Blade.

820
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,260
The Cutting Blade?

821
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,260
The Cutting Blade?

822
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,260
Am I right, Your Highness?

823
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,260
You should believe me now.

824
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,260
Do you know what you're talking about?

825
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,260
Of course I know.

826
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:13,260
It's the Cutting Blade.

827
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,260
Your Highness,

828
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,260
if you want to find it,

829
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,260
I can help you.

830
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,260
Really.

831
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,260
Nan Heng,

832
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,260
it's better to have more enemies than more allies.

833
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,260
I can really help you.

834
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,260
You...

835
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,260
You... Can you let me go first?

836
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,260
I'm begging you.

837
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,260
Okay.

838
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,260
Today's matter

839
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,260
is a secret between me and Miss Song.

840
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,260
From now on,

841
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,260
you and I are allies.

842
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,260
I'll have to trouble Miss Song

843
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,260
to help me.

844
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,260
Don't worry, Your Highness.

845
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,260
I will.

846
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,260
I will.

847
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,260
The Cutting Blade.

848
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,260
The Cutting Blade.

849
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,260
The Cutting Blade.

850
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,260
The Cutting Blade.

851
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,260
The Cutting Blade.

852
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,260
The Cutting Blade.

853
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,260
The Cutting Blade.

854
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,260
The Cutting Blade.

855
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,260
Where is it?

856
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,260
Didn't you write it down?

857
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,260
It's in the letter I wrote to my wife.

858
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,260
I'm so rich now.

859
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,260
I have to find it.

860
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,260
Chu Gui Hong is not a general.

861
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,260
He's a sit-down.

862
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,260
That's too dangerous.

863
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,260
I found it.

864
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,260
Miss Song.

865
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,260
Where is it?

866
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,260
Where is it?

867
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,260
Isn't it?

868
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,260
Where is it?

869
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,260
Is it there?

870
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,260
No.

871
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,260
I don't know.

872
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,260
I don't know.

873
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,260
It's in the letter.

874
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,260
I'll look for it later.

875
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,260
No.

876
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,260
I don't know.

877
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,000
The

878
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,320
Senior Princess

879
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,240
Long just died

880
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:25,140
TangMüzik

881
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,920
Yourise

882
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,400
The information is back

883
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,180
Ten years ago

884
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,320
Chu Gui Hong is on a campaign border

885
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,520
It is Miss Song who came to see him off

886
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,240
Since that moment

887
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,820
the two intruded buses

888
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,220
He has been paying attention to the news about the crown prince

889
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,900
What he said today is probably true

890
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,420
I don't believe in this

891
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,260
about the monster

892
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,300
But a woman who is so close to the crown prince

893
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,020
actually knows me so well

894
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,540
He even knows my big and small affairs

895
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,260
Who will he be?

896
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,500
Nanrui

897
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,420
or the emperor?

898
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,380
He is different

899
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,340
Who knows what he saw

900
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:07,880
Now my mouth

901
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,420
is already ferocious

902
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,420
I'm sorry.

903
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,420
I'm sorry.

904
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,420
I'm sorry.

905
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,420
I'm sorry.

906
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,420
I'm sorry.

907
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,420
I'm sorry.

908
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,420
I'm sorry.

909
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,420
I'm sorry.

910
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,420
I'm sorry.

911
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,420
I'm sorry.

912
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,420
I'm sorry.

913
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,420
I'm sorry.

914
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,420
I'm sorry.

915
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,420
I'm sorry.

916
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,420
I'm sorry.

917
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,420
I'm sorry.

918
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,420
I'm sorry.

919
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,420
I'm sorry.

920
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,420
I'm sorry.

921
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,420
I'm sorry.

922
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,420
I'm sorry.

923
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,420
I'm sorry.

924
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,420
I'm sorry.

925
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,420
I'm sorry.

926
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,420
I'm sorry.

927
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,420
I'm sorry.

928
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,420
I'm sorry.

929
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,420
I'm sorry.

930
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,420
I'm sorry.

931
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,420
I'm sorry.

932
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,420
I'm sorry.

933
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,420
I'm sorry.

934
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,420
I'm sorry.

935
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,420
I'm sorry.

936
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,420
I'm sorry.

937
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,420
I'm sorry.

938
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,420
I'm sorry.

939
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,420
I'm sorry.

940
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,420
I'm sorry.

941
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,420
I'm sorry.

942
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,420
I'm sorry.

943
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,420
I'm sorry.

944
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,420
I'm sorry.

945
