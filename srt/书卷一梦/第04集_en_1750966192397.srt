1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,940
Big

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,940
Sweep

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,880
Secretary

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,580
Minky

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,400
Dass

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,000
Raising a little

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I will be your hero forever

8
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The wind of Yangxi

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I run away from the mist

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I regret my youth

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I will be your star

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For this life and for all lives

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I will sacrifice my life

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You fell into the water that day and I saved you

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You don't appreciate

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You actively sent a message in the dark

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Now you want to use a misunderstanding to gather with me

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What?

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Do you think I'm stupid?

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's useful

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Miss Song rarely enters the palace

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And I didn't find that

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
She has noticed and inquired about the news about the prince

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What she said today is probably true

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't believe in this thing

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't believe in this thing

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But a woman of high rank

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
How can she know me so well?

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
She even knows my big deal

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But she knows who she belongs to

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Nanrui or the emperor?

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No matter who she belongs to

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This mouth still has to close

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The crown prince wants to kill her

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
She is Song Yu De's daughter

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If not, I will do it in Song's mansion today

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What about the alliance with Miss Song today?

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's just a delay

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Tomorrow Song Yu De will leave the capital for business

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I have to give her a perfect death sentence

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Open the door

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Cousin

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Cousin

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Cousin

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Cousin

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Cousin

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Come

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Cousin

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's so cold in the prison

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You're afraid you can't get used to it

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
In addition

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Father has issued an order yesterday

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let the Ministry of Justice accept your case

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I believe it won't take long

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You can go out

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
At this time

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Although father's words

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Can't be wholeheartedly

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
At that time

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There is a chance to stop the old wife

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's right

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But don't worry

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I will definitely stand up for the public

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Let you return to the court

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
At that time, we will join hands

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
One battle

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Cousin

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Why don't you talk?

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Don't drink

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Is this wine not to your taste?

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Let me see

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let me see

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Come

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's very fragrant

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Cousin

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You know nothing

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This wine is from a great man

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This is what I saw from my father's side

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
One person

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Your Highness

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You see, call your Highness again

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We drink so much

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You can go far away

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
it is good

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Cousin

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Now you have drunk

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Also said

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Can you listen to me?

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I always feel that the defeat of Pingrong City

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Not so simple

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Qianyun Army has been fighting against He Yuan for decades

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Never lost

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Why is it this time

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He Yuan took over the military base

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What do you mean?

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Before the war

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Some things are still strange

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
General, look

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
General

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's the people of Lingxin

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Your Highness

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
They are coming in the direction of the city gate

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Should we open the city gate?

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
No

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He Yuan's army is cunning

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
If the people are trapped in He Yuan

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We will be in a bad situation

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Ruohua

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You take people to find out

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Your Highness, look

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
King Qianyu, listen

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If the gate is not opened today

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I, He Yuan, will definitely enter the city

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Two cities

116
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
People

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Go to the city

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Father

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Why does He Yuan people

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Why can you only enter the border

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Two cities to serve the people

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Why did I move into the enemy camp that night

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The opponent is already prepared

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Everything seems to have been planned in advance

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I have to go

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Everything seems to have been planned in advance

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There must be someone in here

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You are the old seven

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But aren't those all the people who want to be killed?

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Pingrong battle

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Qianyu army lost half

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I also lost my father

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The biggest profit is Nanheng

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
After returning to the court

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The one who immediately ordered me to be guilty is also him

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No wonder father also suspects that the old seven is the same enemy of the traitor

137
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But there is no evidence

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
If I can get out of prison

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I must find the crime of his traitor

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Punish him

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Cousin

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You wait first

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Wait for father to let you go

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Then we will continue

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Have you heard

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Recently, the seventh prince fell in love with a woman

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Everyday to pick up the summer

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Give people a gift

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
A big success

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Whose girl

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I heard that the killer has never been in the female temple

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Who else can it be?

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's Cheng Xi

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The military officer of the left side of the city bridge gate

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Song Yimeng, the daughter of Song Yutong

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Is this fake?

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Of course it's true

158
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The story

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It started with that person

160
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He is a traitor

161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
A traitor

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This person is cruel

163
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
In order to achieve the purpose

164
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He can do everything

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Even his own father can kill

166
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He is a good person

167
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Handsome doll

168
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
This person

169
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Is a young general

170
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
For love

171
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Can give everything

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Even his own life

173
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This is the heroine of the story

174
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Handsome doll

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Originally a young lady

176
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But her own birth

177
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Entangled in a political conspiracy

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
In order to get her baby

179
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The traitor seduced her step by step

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Various conspiracy schemes

181
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Even killed everyone around her

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Finally

183
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Even her power

184
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
All have no end

185
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
She is so beautiful

186
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
She is so beautiful

187
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
She is so beautiful

188
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
She is so beautiful

189
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
All have no end

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So pitiful

191
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You say

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If she started

193
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Give the baby to this traitor

194
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Then the traitor

195
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Will not kill everyone around her

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Will not get close

197
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And hurt this poor doll

198
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's a pity

199
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's cloudy

200
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The baby is gone

201
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The apple is gone

202
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What should you do now?

203
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Go tell the traitor

204
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The baby is gone

205
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
How can that work?

206
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You say the traitor

207
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Why is it called a traitor?

208
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You have to kill someone if you disagree

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Then tell the good person

210
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Since it's a good person

211
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You can definitely save him

212
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
No way

213
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The good person is locked up by the bad person

214
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Can't see me

215
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Then with the traitor

216
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
With the dead woman

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Die together

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
This

219
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
She can't beat me

220
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Can't you

221
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Can't you secretly change the baby?

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
No way

223
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You don't understand

224
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No one has ever seen this baby

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What can I change?

226
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What can I change?

227
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No one has ever seen

228
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Oh my god

229
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes

230
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
No one has ever seen this baby

231
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Then I can just write it like this

232
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What the scriptwriter can't write

233
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Can only be tested by the actor

234
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
No

235
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Cut the knife first

236
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Cut the knife first

237
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
This is a bit cruel, right?

238
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What is a knife?

239
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
A knife is a knife

240
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
A knife is a knife

241
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Nonsense literature

242
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Why didn't anyone tell me before

243
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's so hard to write a script

244
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I've been writing this all night

245
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What the hell is this?

246
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What the hell is this?

247
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No way

248
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Rather than waiting for death

249
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's better to leave

250
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Before the baby is discovered

251
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I have to go first

252
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Your Highness

253
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
There is news from Zhao Yu

254
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Chu Gui Hong stole the jade sword

255
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And he was killed

256
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Our people had a fight with him

257
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And he ran away

258
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Good

259
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Light the sword

260
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Kill

261
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Who are you?

262
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You dragged me into this mountain

263
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You

264
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Mo Hai

265
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Chu Gui Hong

266
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You

267
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You let it out of the prison

268
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What a coincidence

269
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You appear just right

270
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I have something to ask you

271
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That

272
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That

273
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Where is the way to cut the knife?

274
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
No way

275
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
After being cut by the male pig

276
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
He was disturbed by the male

277
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What kind of life is this?

278
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
General Chu

279
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
At least we are

280
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Ding Wu Qing's relationship

281
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
If you have something to say

282
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Can you talk to me?

283
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You are not Song Yi Meng

284
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Is the male monkey's IQ so high?

285
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I know Song Yi Meng

286
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I will never ask about the secret of Qian Yu Jun

287
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And I will not have anything to do with

288
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Such a despicable villain like Nan Heng

289
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You are the one who sent him

290
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
To investigate the secret of cutting the knife

291
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Oh no

292
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You must be calm

293
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Think about it

294
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Is there any other name in the script?

295
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Think about it

296
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Chu Gui Hong

297
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Are you crazy?

298
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You don't believe that I am the real Song Yi Meng

299
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Fine

300
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Let me ask you

301
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Before you went on the expedition

302
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Did I give you a name?

303
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's a cotton bag with wood

304
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
All the leaves on it are red

305
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Only one piece

306
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Because the thread was not enough

307
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I embroidered it into purple

308
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Am I right?

309
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Wait a minute

310
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You don't believe me

311
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Let me tell you

312
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Chu Gui Hong I know

313
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
He will not suspect me

314
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Since I have proved that I am the real Song Yi Meng

315
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What about you?

316
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
How can you prove to me

317
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You are the real Chu Gui Hong?

318
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Mu Er

319
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
This is the sachet you mentioned earlier

320
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Ten years ago

321
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,580
There were no

322
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,000
You drove nine miles

323
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You gave me this sachet

324
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You said

325
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The cotton flower was only in spring

326
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But when you see it

327
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Wherever I am fighting

328
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Every year

329
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I can think of you

330
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What can a sachet prove

331
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You are the real Song Yi Meng

332
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You are the real Song Yi Meng

333
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,760
What can a sachet prove?

334
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,040
What if you stole it from him?

335
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,520
Unless...

336
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,880
Unless...

337
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,440
You can tell me

338
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,520
what's in the cut-off knife.

339
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,680
As long as you can tell me,

340
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,880
I'll believe you.

341
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,880
Mu Er.

342
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,200
I know nothing about you.

343
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,640
But only this one thing.

344
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,400
I can't tell you.

345
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,800
Come on.

346
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,320
I'll come when you need me.

347
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Don't involve Mu Er.

348
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,800
Chu Gui Hong.

349
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,000
You escaped from prison.

350
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's a death sentence.

351
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,520
You can't even protect yourself.

352
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,000
And you're still protecting others.

353
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,600
You came to me from the Moon Moon.

354
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,800
Why?

355
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,200
It's Zhao Yue's jade scroll.

356
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,200
It's you.

357
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
You're so stupid.

358
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,800
You're so stupid.

359
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,800
You can be provoked by others

360
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,600
with just a few words.

361
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,800
I thought you wouldn't understand

362
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,000
until you die.

363
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,800
Chu Gui Hong.

364
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
He lied to you.

365
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,600
He wanted to punish you.

366
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,800
Don't get him wrong.

367
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,600
Miss Song is smart.

368
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,600
But escaping from prison

369
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,200
is a death sentence.

370
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,000
Chu Gui Hong.

371
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Escape from prison

372
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,800
and kidnap the daughter of the Minister of War.

373
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,400
You're not going back.

374
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,200
Kill them.

375
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,800
Run.

376
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Did you see that?

377
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,000
The Princess was scared and flew over.

378
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
What's going on?

379
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
He wanted to kill me.

380
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
But he killed half of me.

381
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,200
And he changed his mind.

382
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,000
Song Yi Mao.

383
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,600
What did you do to me?

384
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,200
It's not me.

385
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
I didn't do anything.

386
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,600
I didn't even move.

387
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Give you a chance.

388
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,000
If you don't come out,

389
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
you'll be in trouble.

390
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,800
I'm dying.

391
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
I'm dying.

392
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
I'm dying.

393
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
I'm dying.

394
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
I'm dying.

395
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
I'm dying.

396
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
I'm dying.

397
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,800
I'm dying.

398
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
I'm dying.

399
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
I'm dying.

400
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
I'm dying.

401
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Help me.

402
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Help me.

403
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Hong.

404
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Hong.

405
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Mu.

406
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Are you alright?

407
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Song Yi Mao.

408
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Come here.

409
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
As the Seventh Prince of the court,

410
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
you killed a woman.

411
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Now.

412
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Do you want to fight with death?

413
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Yes.

414
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
What's wrong with that?

415
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Stop them all!

416
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Your Highness, it's not possible to get rid of Song Mingmeng today.

417
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Besides, you're still injured.

418
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Don't be impulsive.

419
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Cousin! Cousin!

420
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Your Highness.

421
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Cousin, are you alright?

422
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
I immediately rushed over here when I received the message.

423
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
No problem.

424
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
It's just that I was tricked by him.

425
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
I'm still in the mood to escape.

426
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
You're not injured, right? If he dares to hurt you, I'll...

427
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Old Seven!

428
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Even if I escape,

429
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
it's also a matter of the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Justice's own business.

430
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
You brought so many military officers.

431
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,800
You're doing this on your own. What do you mean?

432
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,800
Aren't you afraid that Father will know?

433
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,800
18th Brother, you've misunderstood.

434
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
I came today

435
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,800
because of what Miss Song asked.

436
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Miss Song,

437
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
am I right?

438
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,800
I...

439
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,800
You're lying!

440
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
You clearly ordered to kill me just now.

441
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
You even wanted to kill Meng'er.

442
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Chu Gui Hong,

443
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
you escaped from prison

444
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
and you're here with your uncle's daughter to celebrate your birthday.

445
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
If this matter is exposed, it will be bad for everyone.

446
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,800
I think it's better to just sit here and do nothing today.

447
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Pretend that nothing has happened.

448
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Miss Song,

449
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,800
I still keep my promise to you.

450
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
It's better to have more enemies than more allies.

451
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
I can really help you.

452
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
I'll have to trouble you in the future.

453
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Please help me.

454
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
In the script,

455
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,800
there is no mention of Chu Gui Hong escaping from prison.

456
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
It seems that this is also the change that caused after I came.

457
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
If Chu Gui Hong and I are in danger

458
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
if we are not careful,

459
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
we will not succeed.

460
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
This matter cannot be left like this.

461
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Don't say it.

462
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Cousin, you've finally gone mad.

463
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
And the rope that released you will come down soon.

464
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
You can't come back at this moment.

465
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Hurry up and come back with me.

466
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
What the two princes said is not wrong.

467
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
This is a misunderstanding.

468
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Chu Gui Hong didn't escape from prison.

469
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
The Seventh Prince didn't want to kill me.

470
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
This is all a joke.

471
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Just kidding.

472
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,800
General Chu, you should go first.

473
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
Hurry up.

474
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Meng'er.

475
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Don't worry.

476
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
I will definitely be fine.

477
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
My father knows that I'm here.

478
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
The Seventh Prince is so smart.

479
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
He definitely won't let me be in trouble.

480
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
Meng'er, you...

481
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Qin, listen to me.

482
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
What's wrong with you?

483
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
You should go back and rest.

484
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Let's go, cousin.

485
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Meng'er.

486
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Hurry up.

487
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Meng'er.

488
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Let's go.

489
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Here.

490
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
What are you looking at?

491
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
I...

492
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
I'll see you if you don't look at me.

493
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
If it wasn't for the fact that some people are so cruel,

494
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
they want to silence the show,

495
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
and they don't want to be the last one in the North,

496
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
they wouldn't be in this situation.

497
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
I'm so scared!

498
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Your shoes!

499
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Now you know you're scared.

500
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
You were so brave when you lied to me.

501
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
What did I lie to you about, Your Highness?

502
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
I told you that you're not related to me at all.

503
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Why don't you believe me?

504
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Why don't you believe me?

505
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Don't think I don't know

506
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
what you told Chu Gui Hong.

507
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Don't mind what I told him.

508
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
As long as you can cooperate with me,

509
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
I'll do everything you ask.

510
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
But if you don't cooperate with me

511
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
as you did before,

512
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
and insist on being tough with me,

513
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
I'll...

514
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
What are you doing?

515
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
What's wrong with being tough?

516
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Your Highness,

517
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
you're really trying to trick me, aren't you?

518
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
I'm telling you,

519
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
you saw it just now.

520
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,800
I'm with you.

521
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
If I can't go back to Song family safely,

522
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
my father and Chu Gui Hong won't let you go.

523
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
I don't care about them at all.

524
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Don't forget that

525
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Chu Gui Hong is now

526
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
in my hands.

527
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
I advise you

528
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
to be more filial to me.

529
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Be obedient.

530
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Your Highness, it's time to go.

531
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
I'll take Miss Song back to her mansion first.

532
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,800
Okay, go back to your mansion.

533
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Go to my mansion.

534
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
When did I say I would go to your mansion?

535
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Shut up!

536
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
Go!

537
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Go!

538
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
You're done for today.

539
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
I'll go in myself.

540
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Thank you all.

541
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Nanzhu Mansion.

542
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Is this plaque real?

543
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
When His Majesty gave this to the Seventh Prince,

544
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,800
this plaque was there.

545
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
What's wrong with it?

546
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Go in!

547
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Chu Gui Hong, the young general of the Qianyu Army,

548
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
was defeated by the Jin army.

549
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
The whole army was in pain.

550
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
I have been serving the Jin army for many years.

551
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
I'm sorry for my sins.

552
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
I'm going back to my mansion.

553
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
General!

554
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Cousin!

555
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,800
You're finally out.

556
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
Don't move.

557
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Put this on.

558
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Your Highness,

559
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
you don't need to do this.

560
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
How dare you talk nonsense?

561
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
I'm sorry.

562
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
I'm sorry.

563
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
I came from the Qingjian Sword

564
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
to serve the enemy.

565
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
My father is very kind.

566
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
He asked the Governor of Zhong to let you go.

567
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
He wants you to return to the court.

568
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Now you're out of the prison,

569
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
you must go to the prison.

570
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
You're in a good life.

571
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Put this on.

572
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
General!

573
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
General!

574
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
What did he do?

575
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
He must have a plan

576
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
to make a few more attempts.

577
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
What does he want?

578
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
He wants to cooperate with me,

579
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
kill me, and cooperate with me again.

580
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
Could he be a split-up?

581
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Your Highness,

582
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
if I have a chance,

583
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
I'll be happy to do it.

584
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Although you can't kill anyone,

585
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
you've been watching me.

586
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
You're quite a good man.

587
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
Don't worry.

588
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
I'll be happy

589
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
to do it today.

590
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Then let's not do it today.

591
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
I'm not in a hurry.

592
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
I'm in a hurry.

593
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Your Highness,

594
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
I'm sorry.

595
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Your Highness,

596
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
everything is ready.

597
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,800
Miss Song, please.

598
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Nan Heng!

599
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Why did you do that?

600
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
How could you do that?

601
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Let me go!

602
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,800
Do you hear me?

603
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,800
I'm so tired.

604
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
Your Highness,

605
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,800
I've heard about the people in the mansion.

606
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,800
I won't tell anyone about what happened today.

607
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Okay.

608
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
I thought it was an issue with the weapons.

609
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
So I don't need to use the bow and arrow.

610
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
Okay, then this one.

611
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
The Slaughter City's Li's Weapon.

612
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Your Highness!

613
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,800
Stop!

614
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
You're really here?

615
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,800
I'll kill you with one blow.

616
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,800
One blow?

617
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
You're just a girl.

618
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
Why do you have to do that?

619
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Your Highness, you're trying to torture her.

620
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
Use this.

621
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,800
You'll bleed after seven days.

622
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
This is so scary.

623
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Seven days?

624
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
How about this?

625
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,800
Three days?

626
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
Okay, I'll choose by myself.

627
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
This is not good.

628
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,800
What is this?

629
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
Your Highness,

630
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
please tell me what you want to say.

631
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Tell me.

632
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800
You're so cruel.

633
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,800
You're a human.

634
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
You're a human.

635
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
What should we do?

636
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
Are we really going to die here?

637
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,800
Oh my God!

638
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,800
Oh my God!

639
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Oh my God!

640
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Oh my God!

641
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,800
I'm so scared!

642
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
Your Highness!

643
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
I'm begging you.

644
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
Please let me go.

645
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,800
I'm really not worth it.

646
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
Please let me stay.

647
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
I can do something for you.

648
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
Right?

649
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,800
You're here.

650
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,800
It's the most important thing to me.

651
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Are you crazy?

652
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
When did you start talking about the poison?

653
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,800
Your Highness!

654
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Your Highness!

655
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
Your Highness!

656
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Your Highness!

657
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
Your Highness!

658
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Your Highness!

659
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
Your Highness!

660
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,800
Your Highness!

661
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
Your Highness!

662
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
Your Highness!

663
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,800
Your Highness!

664
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Your Highness!

665
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Your Highness!

666
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
Your Highness!

667
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,800
I was releasing a Accuracy Adding!

669
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800

Cute

678
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,060
This Song Yi Meng...

679
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,060
Since the weapon is not a threat,

680
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,060
go to the doctor in the house

681
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,060
to prescribe some poison.

682
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,060
Yes.

683
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,060
Wait!

684
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,060
Huh?

685
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,060
To...

686
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,060
Poison...

687
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,060
is not fatal.

688
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,060
Not fatal?

689
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,060
Understood.

690
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,060
Poison!

691
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,060
What is this?

692
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,060
White vegetable.

693
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,060
Okay. The red one.

694
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,060
This one?

695
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,060
Braised chicken feet.

696
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,060
Blue one.

697
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,660
Your Highness,

698
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,060
even if you don't give me the medicine,

699
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,060
please do the whole set.

700
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:29,060
This... this... such a simple poison.

701
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,060
Even a fool can't eat it.

702
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,060
If others don't eat it, Miss Song must eat it.

703
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,060
If you don't eat it, you can't leave today.

704
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,060
Please.

705
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:01,060
Who put the red chicken feet in the blue one?

706
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,060
Your Highness, I'm afraid of death.

707
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,060
I really can't eat it.

708
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,060
I'm leaving.

709
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,060
Brother, let me go.

710
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,060
I don't want to eat the red chicken feet.

711
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,060
Since Miss Song doesn't want to eat it,

712
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,060
here, I'll feed you.

713
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:34,060
Your Highness, how about we not eat it today?

714
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,060
I really can't eat it.

715
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,060
Shut up.

716
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,060
Miss Song is beautiful.

717
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,060
If I break your teeth,

718
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:48,060
and feed you again, it won't look good.

719
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,060
Here.

720
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,060
Open your mouth.

721
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,060
Forget it.

722
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,060
Since Miss Song doesn't want to eat it,

723
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,060
I'm not a person who can't eat it.

724
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,060
Thank you, Your Highness.

725
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,060
Your Highness!

726
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,060
Doctor!

727
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,060
Come here, doctor!

728
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,060
Your Highness, drink the antidote.

729
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,060
Your Highness, let's just forget it.

730
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:05,060
If this goes on, Miss Song won't be able to eat it.

731
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,060
Your Highness, before we reach the water of the mountain,

732
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,060
we must not let go.

733
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:16,060
I'll definitely revenge for this fish.

734
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,060
Are you done yet?

735
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,060
Do you want to kill me?

736
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,060
Do you hear me?

737
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:51,060
You are really heartless.

738
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,060
You want to kill me?

739
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,060
Miss Song, I'm sorry.

740
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,060
No!

741
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,260
Alright.

742
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:12,060
I open my eyes and look at you

743
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:18,060
The morning of the previous dream

744
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:25,060
I made a mistake and there are no traces of time

745
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:31,060
In the journey of hard work, I seek for the return

746
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:37,060
I take back the memory of the past

747
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:44,060
Under the white boat, I sing the song of the heart

748
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:06,060
The morning of the previous dream

749
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,060
Your Highness

750
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,060
Your Highness

751
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,060
Your Highness

752
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,060
Your Highness

753
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,060
Your Highness

754
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,060
Where are you?

755
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,060
Your Highness

756
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,060
Why are you here?

757
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,060
Where is your Highness?

758
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,060
Get out of here

759
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,060
You want to torture me

760
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,060
I'll take it off

761
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,060
See if you dare to do it again

762
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,060
Stop

763
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,060
Please

764
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,060
Go away

765
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,060
Stop

766
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,060
You have been torturing me all day

767
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,060
You are so cruel

Miss Song

771
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,060
His Highness said

772
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,060
He won't bother you with today's matter

773
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,060
But please mind your mouth

774
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,060
If the third person knows

775
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,060
Even if you find his Highness's things

776
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,060
He won't let you go

777
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,060
You are not human

778
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,060

786
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,060
I'm a girl at home

787
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,060
