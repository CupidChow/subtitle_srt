1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's so cinema in my quick

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:58,260
time

8
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,260
The light of the world is the light of the world

9
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,260
The light of the world is the light of the world

10
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,260
The moon is the light of the moon

11
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:13,260
The moon is the light of the moon

12
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,260
I am the star of the sky

13
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,260
I am the star of the sky

14
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,260
A heart is not a sword

15
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,260
A heart is not a sword

16
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,260
No need to wait, no need to hate

17
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,260
No need to wait, no need to hate

18
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,260
For all that I have

19
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,260
I will be a hero forever

20
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,260
The wind that blows in the western direction

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,260
I will not run away from the power of the past

22
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,260
I will not regret my youth

23
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,260
I will be a star in the future

24
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,260
For this life, and for all life

25
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,260
I will sacrifice my life

26
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,260
The Legend of Chusen

27
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,260
Episode 16

28
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,260
I, Song Yi Meng, greet Your Majesty.

29
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,260
Kneel down.

30
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,260
It's late at night.

31
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,260
I'm tired too.

32
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,260
I don't want to bother you.

33
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,260
The engagement was already decided.

34
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,260
But it's not close to the prince.

35
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,260
And you're still arguing with the old wife.

36
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,260
Tell me, what is the plan of your Song family?

37
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,260
Your Majesty.

38
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,260
Please give me your opinion.

39
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,260
My father has been teaching me.

40
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,260
The Song family is not in a fight.

41
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,260
The marriage with Chu Gui Hong was decided a long time ago.

42
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,260
Now, between the prince and the wife

43
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,260
It's also empty blood to seal the engagement.

44
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,260
You are a woman.

45
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,260
A woman should be careful.

46
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,260
Since the engagement is decided

47
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,260
Shouldn't you go out and not sell?

48
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,260
At home, embroider flowers and read books, is it not good?

49
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,260
Dressed in a flower dress

50
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,260
Also attending the celebration in the capital

51
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,260
Isn't this the engagement?

52
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,260
The world's wrong

53
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,260
It's not all women.

54
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,260
You are so stubborn.

55
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,260
Today, the two princes are all the same.

56
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,260
It's all your fault.

57
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,260
You still want to argue with the family.

58
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,260
Do you have to start a fight?

59
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,260
Take off your clothes and get down.

60
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,260
Your Majesty.

61
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,260
Stop.

62
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,260
Seventh Prince, you broke into the jade hairpin.

63
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,260
What do you want to do?

64
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,260
Your Majesty, all the mistakes are my fault.

65
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,260
I knew he had an engagement in advance.

66
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,260
Still entangled

67
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,260
I ordered people to go to the book.

68
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,260
Spread everywhere

69
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,260
It's also me to ask my mother to grant the engagement.

70
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,260
Who is scheming you?

71
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,260
This marriage is the mother's will.

72
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,260
What does it have to do with me?

73
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,260
This has nothing to do with Miss Song.

74
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,260
Please punish me.

75
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,260
Very good.

76
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,260
My seventh prince.

77
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,260
For the past twenty-eight years

78
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,260
It's all right.

79
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,260
Everything is good.

80
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,260
No one can catch a horse.

81
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,260
Today, I can kneel here and bow to apologize.

82
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,260
It's just for a woman.

83
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,260
Okay.

84
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,260
Then you tell me.

85
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,260
Except for the Song family behind her.

86
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,260
What's the difference?

87
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,260
Your Majesty loves the late queen.

88
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,260
It's not for the Chu family behind her.

89
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,260
Your Majesty, how dare you?

90
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,260
I tell you.

91
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,260
The Song family has an engagement.

92
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,260
This can never be changed.

93
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,260
Whether it's the king or the minister.

94
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,260
The world is human.

95
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,260
You have to follow the rules.

96
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,260
I dare not not follow the rules.

97
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,260
You dare not.

98
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,260
You are on the moon night of Qingtan.

99
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,260
It's like a sword to Rui.

100
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,260
How can you follow the rules?

101
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,260
Jin Nanrui.

102
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,260
You are a good mother.

103
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,260
You are a mother.

104
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,260
The Jin Dynasty has laws.

105
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,260
The one who kills the other will be punished.

106
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,260
But today, I won't kill you.

107
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,260
Which hand of yours removed Rui's arm?

108
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,260
Just cut this hand off for me.

109
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,260
I will kill you.

110
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,260
Cut off this hand.

111
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,260
What?

112
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,260
You dare to disobey my order?

113
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,260
This is a crime of the Qi army.

114
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:35,260
I really don't want to see you.

115
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,260
Your Majesty.

116
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,260
Everything today is my fault.

117
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,260
It's nothing to do with the Seventh Prince.

118
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,260
And...

119
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,260
The Eighteenth Prince also cut himself to the Seventh Prince.

120
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:56,260
I'm afraid I have to marry a woman for you.

121
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,260
I

122
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,260
I

123
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,260
I

124
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,260
I

125
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,260
I

126
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,260
I

127
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,260
I

128
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,260
I

129
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,260
I

130
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,260
Your Highness Qi

131
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,260
Your Highness Qi

132
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,260
Your Highness Qi

133
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,260
Your Highness Qi

134
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,260
Are you kidding me?

135
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,260
Why are you kidding me?

136
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,260
Or do you want the people to scold me

137
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,260
as a tyrant who killed his subjects?

138
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,260
I

139
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,260
I won't

140
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,260
Your Majesty

141
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,260
Your Majesty

142
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,260
The Imperial Concubine passed out in the palace

143
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,260
and is now unconscious

144
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
She kept shouting

145
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,260
to ask you and Miss Song to go there

146
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,260
Your Majesty

147
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,260
I'll take the responsibility for what happened today

148
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,260
I'm sorry

149
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,260
But now, the Imperial Concubine passed out

150
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,260
I beg Your Majesty to allow me to visit her

151
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,260
Get out

152
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,260
Thank you, Your Majesty

153
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,260
I'll take my leave

154
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,260
Your Highness, please go in and have a look

155
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,260
Imperial Concubine

156
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,260
Your Highness Qi

157
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,260
Imperial Concubine

158
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,260
This is

159
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,260
The Imperial Concubine said

160
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,260
to let Your Highness and Miss Song rest earlier

161
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,260
Open the door

162
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,260
Your Highness

163
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,260
How is it?

164
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,260
Your Highness

165
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,260
The two of them came all the way

166
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,260
and didn't even separate their hands

167
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,260
Heng

168
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,260
I can only help you here

169
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,260
You have to work hard on the rest

170
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,260
Master

171
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,260
Where is she?

172
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,260
The person in front of the imperial jade said

173
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,260
that the girl was taken away by the Imperial Concubine

174
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,260
Then hurry up and send someone

175
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,260
to go to the Imperial Concubine Gao to inquire

176
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,260
Shen Ye asked

177
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,260
The people in the palace said

178
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,260
that the girl had left the palace and went home

179
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,260
Master, it's impossible

180
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,260
If the girl goes home

181
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,260
the subordinates will definitely send someone to report

182
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,260
The girl, she

183
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,260
The girl must still be in the palace

184
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,260
She must be in trouble

185
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,260
Don't panic

186
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,260
Shen Ye has no way of entering the palace

187
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,260
Wait a little longer

188
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,260
I

189
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,260
As expected

190
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,260
Don't waste your energy

191
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,260
This is the Imperial Concubine's work

192
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,260
What do you mean?

193
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,260
I have a standard

194
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,260
The male and female masters

195
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,260
are forced to live together

196
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,260
to increase their feelings

197
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,260
The Imperial Concubine can think of this idea

198
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,260
We can't get out tonight

199
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,260
Why do you know?

200
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,260
Of course I know

201
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,260
Classic scenes

202
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,260
I've played it more than 800 times

203
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,260
You

204
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,260
Do whatever you want

205
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,260
No, you are a girl

206
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,260
Now the male and female live together

207
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,260
How can you be so unobtrusive?

208
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,260
I'm so nervous

209
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,260
What's wrong with me and Song Guan?

210
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,260
Why are you nervous?

211
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,260
I

212
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,260
Why didn't you look so nervous when you were spreading rumors?

213
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,260
Now you're afraid that I'll take advantage of you

214
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,260
What am I afraid of?

215
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,260
What advantage do I have to let you stand?

216
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,260
You'd better explain to me

217
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,260
What does the Imperial Concubine mean by getting married?

218
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,260
And just now, at the Emperor's place

219
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,260
Help me to get rid of all the sins

220
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,260
What does it mean?

221
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,260
And I really want to know

222
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,260
If the Emperor didn't stop you just now

223
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,260
You really will continue to watch

224
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,260
I'm just gambling

225
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,260
And I've been gambling since I was a kid

226
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,260
You just have to be obedient

227
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
You can let me go this time

228
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,260
Okay

229
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,260
But this time

230
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,260
The fake couple of the stars

231
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,260
It's a fight in front of the Emperor

232
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,260
I said you're pretty good

233
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,260
You dare to touch the Emperor's peasant

234
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,260
I said I didn't do this

235
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,260
You think I'll take the risk of letting the Emperor misunderstand the risk of rebellion

236
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,260
What's the fight with you?

237
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,260
What's the fight?

238
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,260
You're not smart

239
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,260
What's the fight?

240
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,260
That's right

241
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,260
So you saved me just because

242
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,260
Because

243
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,260
Don't think I don't know why you're helping me

244
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,260
You think too much

245
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,260
I'm helping you

246
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,260
It's just because of the mechanism in your mouth

247
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,260
The female master is in danger

248
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,260
The male master must save the mechanism

249
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,260
You're really good at drawing

250
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,260
Absolutely smart

251
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,260
What are you doing?

252
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,260
What do you do?

253
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,260
Sleeping is a bad thing

254
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,260
I'm not sleeping

255
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,260
You're a sleepy king, you don't need to sleep

256
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,260
Even if it's a night, you have to sleep

257
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,260
But this place is so big

258
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,260
Where are you sleeping?

259
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,260
You have to sleep on the bed

260
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,260
Then I don't sleep here, I sleep on the ground

261
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,260
But where do you sleep?

262
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,260
Where do you sleep?

263
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,260
Didn't you just say

264
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,260
Get up and settle

265
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,260
you

266
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,260
You keep the talisman

267
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,260
I'll go save the princess

268
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,260
General Chu, you wait for the talisman

269
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,260
I'll go save Meng'er

270
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,260
You go back to the mansion first

271
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,260
I'll go save Xiaomeng

272
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,260
Why is this room getting colder and colder?

273
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,260
You let go of me

274
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,260
You let go of me

275
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,260
You let go

276
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,260
Forget it

277
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,260
Yingyue is cold to death

278
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,260
Don't go to annoy her

279
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,260
In this sweet script

280
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,260
Be careful

281
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,260
One by one

282
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,260
Fall into the trap

283
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,260
This has nothing to do with Miss Song

284
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,260
Please punish me

285
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,260
Okay

286
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,260
Then you tell me

287
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,260
Except for the Song family behind her

288
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,260
What's the difference between her and her?

289
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,260
Your Majesty loves the late queen

290
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,260
Not for the Chu family behind her

291
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,260
I'm sorry

292
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,260
I'm sorry

293
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,260
I'm sorry

294
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,260
I'm sorry

295
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,260
I'm sorry

296
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,260
I'm sorry

297
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,260
I'm sorry

298
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,260
I'm sorry

299
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,260
You

300
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,260
You can't sleep either

301
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,260
The story was caused by you

302
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,260
I

303
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,260
What are you doing

304
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,260
I'm going to sleep

305
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,260
Apply medicine

306
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,260
Apply for you

307
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,260
This is not suitable on the back

308
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,260
I handled the first test

309
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,260
For you

310
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,260
You still have a conscience

311
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,260
No, Song Yimeng

312
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:49,780
Can you not be so

313
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,260
You

314
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,260
It's weird

315
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,260
Where did you get this ointment?

316
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,260
Bought on the street

317
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,260
Tangtang Seventh Highness

318
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,260
I went to buy medicine to the moon

319
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,260
So what

320
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,260
I'm sorry

321
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,260
By the way

322
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,260
I ask you

323
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,260
The past year's Qingtan Moon Banquet

324
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,260
Isn't it all in the bamboo forest outside the village?

325
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,260
How did you go to the moon in the New Year?

326
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,260
You don't

327
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,260
What do you think of the moon?

328
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,260
The girl is a prince

329
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,260
How can you put the moon in your eyes?

330
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,260
But it's you

331
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,260
You and a person in the world

332
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,260
It's so close

333
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,260
It's that Li Shiliu

334
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,260
You don't

335
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,260
Did you have any bad thoughts about people?

336
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,260
What a joke

337
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,260
A person in the world

338
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,260
How could you be in my eyes?

339
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,260
Why blush

340
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,260
How could I blush

341
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,260
Which eye can you see me blush?

342
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,260
You see, you're all nervous

343
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,260
And you say it's boring

344
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,260
I know

345
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,260
You just deliberately want to talk to me

346
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,260
You want to know who I like, right?

347
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,260
Let me tell you this

348
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,260
I can't marry you

349
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,260
Even if you let the empress get as many pings

350
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,260
How many tricks did you get?

351
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,260
I can't marry you

352
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,260
Do you understand?

353
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,260
I said it all

354
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,260
I don't know what those mothers mean

355
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,260
Don't you think we're in the same room today?

356
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,260
It's also my plan, right?

357
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,260
How can't you say that?

358
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,260
I know

359
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,260
I can't explain to a woman like you who is so nosy

360
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,260
What do you mean?

361
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,260
Who is nosy?

362
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,260
You tell me clearly

363
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,260
I said you were nosy

364
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,260
I've helped you several times

365
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,260
I didn't plan to get any returns

366
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,260
But Qingtan Yueyuan Mountain

367
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,260
I obviously helped you solve it

368
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,260
What happened

369
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,260
You became a group with Chu Guihong

370
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,260
Oppose me

371
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,260
I didn't plan to mind

372
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,260
What else do you want?

373
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,260
I

374
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,260
What are you

375
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,260
You say what else do you want

376
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,260
You're still upset

377
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,260
how

378
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,260
I can't be upset

379
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,260
Of course I'm upset

380
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,260
What the hell is Qingtan Yueyuan Mountain?

381
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,260
I said I wouldn't go

382
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,260
My father forced me to go

383
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,260
Just go

384
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,260
What are you doing there?

385
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,260
You are in front of everyone

386
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,260
I'm talking nonsense there

387
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,260
Have you considered my feelings?

388
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,260
Have you considered?

389
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,260
And your father

390
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,260
It's obviously you and the Eighteenth Prince

391
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,260
quarrel

392
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,260
Why should I kneel there all night?

393
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,260
I tell you

394
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,260
My knees are red and swollen

395
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,260
It hurts me

396
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,260
I'm not just having a knee pain

397
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,260
It hurts me all over the afternoon

398
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,260
I'm cold and hungry

399
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,260
I'm the one who's on my way

400
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,260
The more I think, the more angry I am

401
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,260
OK

402
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,260
It's all my fault

403
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,260
I'm sorry

404
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,260
You are so sorry

405
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,260
No sincerity

406
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,260
No, don't be too

407
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,260
I'm sorry

408
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,260
I'm sorry

409
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,260
I shouldn't have dragged you into it

410
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,260
I shouldn't have put you in the court

411
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,260
I shouldn't have let you be criticized by others

412
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,260
I did something wrong before

413
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,260
But from now on

414
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,260
I won't let you suffer again

415
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,260
Now

416
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,260
You go to bed

417
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,260
I sleep here

418
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,260
But if you dare to wake me up again

419
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,260
I'll kill you

420
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,260
I'm sorry

421
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,260
I'm sorry

422
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,260
I'm sorry

423
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,260
I'm sorry

424
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,260
I'm sorry

425
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,260
I'm sorry

426
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,260
I'm sorry

427
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,260
I'm sorry

428
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,260
I'm sorry

429
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,260
I'm sorry

430
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,260
I'm sorry

431
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,260
I'm sorry

432
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,260
I'm sorry

433
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,260
I'm sorry

434
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,260
I'm sorry

435
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,260
I'm sorry

436
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,260
I'm sorry

437
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,260
I'm sorry

438
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,260
I'm sorry

439
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,260
I'm sorry

440
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,260
I'm sorry

441
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,260
I'm sorry

442
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,260
I'm sorry

443
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,260
I'm sorry

444
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,260
I'm sorry

445
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,260
I'm sorry

446
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,260
I'm sorry

447
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,260
I'm sorry

448
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,260
I'm sorry

449
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,260
I'm sorry

450
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,260
I'm sorry

451
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,260
I'm sorry

452
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,260
I'm sorry

453
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,260
Charity

454
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,260
Tuesday

455
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,260
What's this

456
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,260
Your Highness, I've been worried about you all night.

457
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,260
I thought you suffered a lot.

458
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,260
Your Highness.

459
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,260
Why did you do this?

460
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,260
I'm not afraid of destroying my image just to be with you.

461
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,260
What did I do?

462
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,260
You're a girl who's so ugly.

463
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,260
I'm really...

464
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,260
You get up quickly.

465
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,260
You're a criminal if you don't know how to do it.

466
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,260
You pretend to be a maid to make up for it.

467
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,260
I...

468
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,260
Listen to me first.

469
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,260
Meng Er.

470
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,260
Meng Er.

471
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,260
Chu Gui Hong?

472
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,260
Go in.

473
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,260
Chu Gui Hong.

474
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,260
Meng Er, are you okay?

475
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,260
Why are you...

476
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,260
Nan Heng.

477
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,260
You're alone and you're alone all night.

478
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,260
Don't you think you should explain?

479
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,260
Why should I explain to you?

480
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,260
Enough.

481
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,260
Enough.

482
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,260
Stop fighting.

483
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,260
You think the noise isn't loud enough?

484
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,260
Chu Gui Hong, you leave here first.

485
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,260
If no one finds out, it'll be a trouble.

486
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,260
She...

487
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,260
Meng.

488
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,260
Meng.

489
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,260
Meng.

490
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,260
Father.

491
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,260
Meng.

492
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,260
My father will misunderstand us if he sees us like this.

493
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,260
Come on.

494
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,260
You guys hide first.

495
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,260
Don't cause me trouble.

496
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,260
I'm going to sleep.

497
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,260
You...

498
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,260
You're all useless.

499
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,260
Don't betray anyone.

500
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,260
Go.

501
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,260
Maidservant.

502
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,260
Guard.

503
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,260
If another eunuch comes, I'll be angry.

504
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,260
Xiao Meng.

505
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,260
Father.

506
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,260
Why are you here?

507
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,260
Why are you dressed like this?

508
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,260
I heard the sound of the Seventh Prince.

509
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,260
He's here too.

510
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,260
No.

511
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,260
I'm the only one in this room.

512
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:07,260
You didn't go out last night.

513
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,260
Did you meet any accident?

514
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,260
Someone set you up.

515
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,260
They framed you and locked you up here.

516
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,260
No...

517
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,260
Nan Hong?

518
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,260
She's a sinister person.

519
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,260
It must be her.

520
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,260
Stop talking.

521
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,260
Don't stay here.

522
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,260
Let's go home.

523
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,260
The emperor is here.

524
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,260
Oh no.

525
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,260
What should we do?

526
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,260
The courtyard is closed.

527
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,260
Don't go near others.

528
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,260
Yes.

529
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,260
It's over.

530
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,260
Daughter.

531
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,260
You go chat with the army first.

532
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,260
I'll hide in the field.

533
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,260
Don't turn around.

534
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,260
Don't turn around.

535
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,260
You...

536
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,260
You...

537
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,260
Lord Song.

538
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,260
Three to one.

539
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,260
Good boy.

540
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,260
Good boy.

541
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,260
Song Yi Meng.

542
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,260
Your Majesty.

543
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,260
What a coincidence.

544
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,260
You're here too.

545
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,260
How dare you!

546
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,260
How dare you not kneel when you see the emperor.

547
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,260
Come on.

548
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,260
Don't...

549
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,260
Don't call anyone.

550
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,260
I'll kneel.

551
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,260
I'll kneel.

552
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,260
Don't kneel.

553
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,260
Your Highness.

554
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,260
Your Highness.

555
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,260
She...

556
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,260
Greetings, Your Highness.

557
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,260
What did you say?

558
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,260
I said don't kneel.

559
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,260
Song Yi Meng is my daughter-in-law.

560
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,260
I won't allow anyone to bully her.

561
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,260
Daughter-in-law?

562
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,260
Ridiculous.

563
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,260
Song's daughter has been married to Chu Gui Hong since childhood.

564
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,260
This dress is the marriage I personally agreed to

565
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,260
after I married her.

566
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,260
Is this what you want?

567
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,260
Are you going to ignore my promise?

568
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,260
The marriage between me and Lord Ping Yang

569
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,260
was also the promise of the late emperor.

570
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,260
But after you ascended the throne,

571
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,260
you ignored me and brought me into the harem

572
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,260
to protect my descendants and stabilize the Gao family.

573
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,260
Since Your Majesty can ignore the promise of the late emperor,

574
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,260
then I can do it again for Heng.

575
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,260
How can you confuse these two things?

576
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,260
Why can't I?

577
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,260
Your Majesty ruined my marriage

578
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,260
and ruined my life.

579
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,260
Now you want to ruin Heng's life.

580
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,260
I don't want to.

581
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,260
Isn't the script

582
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,260
a gentle and weak palace?

583
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,260
Why did the human society suddenly collapse?

584
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,260
Are you crazy, Gao Chang Rong?

585
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,260
You dare to speak to me like this for a concubine?

586
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,260
I've been wanting to say these things for a long time.

587
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,260
I've been tolerant for decades.

588
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,260
What I've been asking for is Heng's peace and happiness.

589
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,260
But what about Your Majesty?

590
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,260
What have you done?

591
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,260
Do you want me to tell Heng about all the grievances

592
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,260
that I've suffered in front of Miss Song?

593
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,260
Okay, since you've made up your mind,

594
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,260
don't blame me.

595
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,260
What about Your Majesty?

596
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,260
This daughter-in-law,

597
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,260
Gao Chang Rong,

598
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,260
I and Gao Jia are going to get married.

599
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,260
Your Majesty.

600
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,260
Your Majesty.

601
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,260
Gao Chang Rong has been in the palace for more than 30 years.

602
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,260
He never dared to go out.

603
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,260
Now he looks like this.

604
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,260
Your Majesty, calm down.

605
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,260
Your Majesty, Minister Song is here.

606
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,260
Come in.

607
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,260
Minister Song.

608
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,260
Your Majesty.

609
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,260
What's the matter with you, old fox?

610
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,260
I'm tired today.

611
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,260
I don't have time to play with you.

612
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:33,260
The doctor said that the fatigue is a bad temper.

613
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,260
If you don't go,

614
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,260
His Majesty will be worried and depressed.

615
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,260
He will naturally feel tired.

616
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,260
I'm here today to give His Majesty a good medicine.

617
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,260
Miss, I beg you to die in the palace.

618
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,260
If you die, I will never live.

619
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,260
In this life, the life belongs to you.

620
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,260
The death belongs to you.

621
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,260
All right, all right.

622
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,260
You've been crying all day, Qiu.

623
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,260
Come on, come on.

624
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,260
I'm not living well.

625
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,260
If you keep crying like this,

626
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,260
people will think I'm a kid.

627
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,260
Miss, the Seventh Prince used to be fine.

628
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,260
He had to pull out some stories and spread them.

629
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,260
Now you two are together.

630
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,260
He doesn't have anything.

631
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,260
Anyway, I don't believe a bad person can change his mind easily.

632
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,260
You can be so sharp.

633
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,260
I won't save you anymore.

634
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,260
Oh.

635
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,260
Please forgive me.

636
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,260
I'll give it to you.

637
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,260
I'm worried about the nurse today.

638
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,260
I can only do it with a knife.

639
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,260
That thrown away?

640
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,260
Only three minutes ago,

641
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,260
The Seventh Prince was there.

642
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,260
He moved the His Majesty biases.

643
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,260
After three minutes,

644
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,260
An honest nurse came after him.

645
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,260
He threw away his sister's abortion form.

646
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:58,700
Did you know?

647
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,700
The cup is stable

648
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,700
The color of the official seal

649
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,700
The scent of the official seal

650
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,700
The name of the official seal

651
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,700
The tea smells like durian

652
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,700
Don't be a cow's eye

653
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,700
You ruined the good tea

654
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,700
What?

655
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,700
The qin qi and the calligraphy are all different

656
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,700
Even the etiquette is not good

657
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,700
How can you go out like this and be the elder sister of Song Yiting

658
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,700
Song Yiting

659
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,700
If I offended you

660
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,700
You can just tell me

661
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,700
Why is this still a etiquette

662
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,700
Just a cup of tea

663
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,700
And let you be so greedy

664
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,700
That elder sister yesterday at the moon night

665
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,700
How to have the courage

666
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,700
Say that kind of good words

667
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,700
What did i say

668
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,700
What is the capital love

669
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,700
Those are all fake

670
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,700
I tell you

671
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,700
If you dare to talk about it behind my back

672
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,700
I'm not polite to him

673
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,700
I used to think

674
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,700
You and other people in the capital

675
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,700
It's not much different

676
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,700
All I think about is getting married

677
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,700
But yesterday I found

678
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,700
You are not bad

679
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,700
So I came today

680
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,700
I specifically want to remind you

681
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,700
Father came back from the palace

682
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,700
Let my mother prepare to get married

683
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,700
Said it was the emperor's order

684
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,700
I want you to get married next month

685
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,700
What

686
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,700
Get married next month

687
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,700
I wanted to discuss the marriage plan with you

688
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,700
I didn't expect you to come first

689
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,700
Meng'er likes cotton

690
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,700
It should be placed in the spring moon

691
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,700
But there are still a few days

692
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,700
I found Qingtianjian to calculate a few days

693
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,700
Sorry

694
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,700
I just started

695
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,700
I didn't make my own heart clear

696
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,700
I understand now

697
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,700
This thing

698
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,700
The late queen left it to you

699
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,700
I can't burn

700
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,700
You don't like jade pendant

701
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,700
You can change something else

702
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,700
Just 18th prince gave me five pieces of good material

703
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,700
I'll go to a new one

704
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,700
Cotton pattern, okay?

705
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,700
Chu Guihong

706
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,700
I

707
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,700
I don't want to get married

708
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Don't worry

709
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:45,240
Three

710
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,700
Muher

711
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,700
We have been engaged for 18 years

712
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,700
How many times I can't wake up on the roller coaster

713
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,700
I was thinking that you were still waiting for me in Beijing

714
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,700
This is what happened

715
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,700
If you didn't think clearly

716
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,700
I can wait

717
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,700
Anyway, I've been waiting for so many years

718
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,700
I can wait for as many hours

719
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,700
I'm sorry

720
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,700
Chu Guihong

721
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,700
You'd better not wait

722
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,700
The Song Yimeng you like

723
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,700
I'm not the same person

724
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,700
Can you understand

725
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,700
I was thinking at first

726
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,700
Maybe

727
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,700
Can be with you

728
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,700
But I found out slowly

729
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,700
We are not people in the same world

730
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,700
I want to know

731
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,700
You are the only one in this world.

732
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,700
That night on the lantern festival,

733
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,700
you did what you thought you should do.

734
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,700
This proves that

735
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,700
the two of us are really not suitable.

736
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,700
These are the letters we have been in touch with.

737
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,700
1632

738
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,700
You said the person I like is not you.

739
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,700
Who could it be?

740
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,700
Tell me.

741
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,700
Mu'er,

742
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,700
this marriage

743
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,700
is a common thing between His Majesty and Song Da Ren.

744
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,700
If you disobey the order,

745
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,700
the King will be furious and will be furious.

746
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,700
So,

747
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,700
don't think too much, okay?

748
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,700
In the future,

749
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,700
I will treat you very well.

750
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,700
I...

751
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,700
Oh,

752
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,700
Mu'er!

753
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,700
Zu losing his mind!

754
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,700
He is a willingness to kill!

755
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,700
allow him to go to Skingyaking.

756
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,700
He is not crying a lady's dying eyes.

757
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,700
He is not pleasant.

758
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,700
Now,

759
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,700
we are at the beginning of destiny.

760
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,700
The start of one's final campaign.

761
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,700
This trip will be the start of all.

762
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,700
Get out of here.

763
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,700
Don't, boss.

764
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,700
Yesterday, Chu and the Empress in the palace tried to marry Sister-in-law.

765
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,700
We can't sit around and wait.

766
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,700
How to act, it's up to you.

767
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,700
I told you to get out. Don't you understand?

768
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,700
Get out!

769
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,700
What's wrong?

770
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,700
Who's bothering you again?

771
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,700
You go and burn all the love in the capital.

772
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,700
I don't want to see a single one in the capital again.

773
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,700
What happened?

774
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,700
Chu Guihong is right.

775
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,700
He's true to Song Yimeng.

776
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,700
Marriage means the plot of the destiny will still be on.

777
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,700
But if he quits the marriage and defends the imperial decree,

778
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,700
will something happen?

779
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,700
Whoever breaks the spell will be rewarded with a thousand gold coins.

780
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,700
Look at this.

781
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,700
A thousand gold coins.

782
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,700
Hammer, hammer.

783
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,700
Use your grief as strength.

784
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,700
If you don't hammer it down, you'll break the spell.

785
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,700
I don't know if the spell will work.

786
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,700
If you keep talking nonsense,

787
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,700
I'll hammer you to death with a hammer.

788
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,700
The wedding is on 18th of next month.

789
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,700
It's been a few days.

790
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,700
What are you going to do?

791
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,700
What does it have to do with me?

792
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,700
It's none of your business. Why are you so anxious?

793
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,700
Am I anxious?

794
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,700
Am I anxious?

795
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,700
Am I anxious?

796
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,700
Which eye are you looking at?

797
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,700
I'm anxious.

798
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,700
No, no.

799
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,700
Wipe your sweat.

800
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,700
Actually, His Majesty asked Song Chu to marry Chu.

801
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,700
It's just a thought of making Chu.

802
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,700
If the path of the Song family doesn't work,

803
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,700
it's better to break it.

804
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,700
Just change the method.

805
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,700
Why should I break it?

806
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,700
Then why don't you break it?

807
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,700
His Majesty is now clear.

808
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,700
It's to help Nanrui break your mind.

809
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,700
Are you going to resist and grab the wedding?

810
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,700
Let me tell you.

811
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,700
As long as they don't get married for a day,

812
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,700
I'll have a chance.

813
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,700
If I have a chance,

814
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,700
I'll have a chance to let the Song family come back to my home.

815
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,700
OK.

816
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,700
OK, you have the most opportunities.

817
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,700
I don't know what's going on with Song Yi Meng.

818
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,700
What does this have to do with Song Yi Meng?

819
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,700
We planned for so long before.

820
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,700
Now we're going to give up, then we're going to give up.

821
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,700
I can't bear to see Song Yi Meng.

822
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,700
It's not over, is it?

823
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,700
How can you hear me say Song Yi Meng?

824
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,700
I said it.

825
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,700
I said it.

826
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,700
No matter what,

827
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,700
we can't give up the Song family line.

828
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,700
And

829
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,700
There are a lot of people around the Imperial Household Department recently.

830
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,700
I asked Gao Xiang to meet me in the Cangjiang Yue.

831
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,700
You go and arrange it.

832
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,700
Don't let it go to waste.

833
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,700
I know.

834
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,700
What are you looking at?

835
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,700
Song Yi Meng, Song Yi Meng, what kind of Song Yi Meng is this?

836
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,700
Proposal? Stop talking nonsense.

837
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,700
Sister-in-law will never marry anyone else.

838
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,700
The woman who dares to rob the boss is so annoying.

839
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,700
I've already said it.

840
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,700
Even beautiful women can't be trusted.

841
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,700
You said the boss is so good.

842
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,700
Isn't he still a general who loves his father?

843
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,700
Look at it.

844
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,700
He used to run here and there.

845
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,700
Don't even think about seeing him in the future.

846
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,700
He's still on fire.

847
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,700
Where is Li Shiliu?

848
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,700
Li Shiliu

849
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,700
Li Shiliu

850
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:50,700
The End
