1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sword is heavy.

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the deep roots of the enemy.

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,800
It's not as good as the dust.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am willing to be a beast.

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
I am willing to be a beast.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
A heart is not a sword.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
The four seas are in harmony.

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
No need to wait. No need to hate.

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Write a poem for myself.

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
I will follow all the wishes.

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,600
I will write a poem with my love.

13
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
The wind blows.

14
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
I can't run away from it.

15
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,600
I don't regret my youth.

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,600
I will be a man of great success.

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,600
For this life, and for all lives.

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
I will do whatever my heart says.

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,800
What are you doing here with me today?

20
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
I brought you here today

21
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
to make a poem for you under the moon.

22
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Song Yun Mo.

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
In the future, I will do whatever you ask.

24
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
I will solve everything for you.

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
And don't worry.

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
I will take good care of you and the Song family.

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
I will do whatever you ask.

28
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
I will do whatever you ask.

29
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
I will take good care of you and the Song family.

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
I will never let you down.

31
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Didn't you say you never believe in the name of the gods?

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
If you believe, I will believe.

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
I believe.

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
But what about the letter?

35
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
The fate in the script

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
can't be changed.

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,800
The script can't be changed.

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Think about it.

39
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
In the script you're talking about,

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
you're a killer.

41
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Look at me now.

42
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Am I still the same?

43
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
I...

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Yes.

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
For the sake of the Night God,

46
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
for the sake of the people,

47
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
you went to the high school.

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
This proves

49
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
you have changed.

50
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
But...

51
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Not only me,

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
but everyone else has changed.

53
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Nanrui is no longer afraid of the country.

54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Even His Majesty

55
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
has passed the title of Crown Prince to me.

56
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
So, look.

57
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
The people in the script can change.

58
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Why can't the ending of the story be changed?

59
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
I brought you here today

60
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
to make the last effort.

61
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
I also want to tell you my feelings for you for the last time.

62
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
I know you still have worries in your heart.

63
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
But I'm willing to wait.

64
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
I understand.

65
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Don't worry.

66
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
I'll go to see His Majesty tomorrow to cancel the engagement.

67
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Nan Heng.

68
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Although I don't know

69
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
what the ending will be,

70
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
I'm sure you'll be able to

71
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
tell me what the ending will be.

72
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
But this time,

73
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
I'm willing to be brave again.

74
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
You...

75
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
You mean you agreed?

76
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
I...

77
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
I can't accept this.

78
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
I want you to believe me.

79
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
I don't know what the ending will be.

80
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
I'm willing to wait

81
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
until the last day.

82
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
I'll wait until you get back to your room.

83
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Come on.

84
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
I'll come again.

85
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
I'll come again.

86
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
I'll come again.

87
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
I'll come again.

88
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
I'll come again.

89
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,080
What is the direct marriage?

90
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,400
It's the process of avoiding the close-up wedding.

91
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,880
We just...

92
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,040
Just...

93
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,960
Just...

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,920
Just get married?

95
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,360
That's not what I mean.

96
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,200
No.

97
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,360
I'm just worried about the development of the plot.

98
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,360
According to the direction of the plot,

99
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,400
we will definitely see Chu Weihong

100
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,440
in the journey of marriage.

101
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,240
You two will definitely have a fight.

102
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,560
I remember it.

103
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,320
It's the three-person circle

104
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,160
on the day of the wedding.

105
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,480
You really have a good eye.

106
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,120
But I can understand the three-person circle

107
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,440
on the day of the wedding.

108
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,040
What does the circle mean?

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,760
The circle is...

110
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,000
The one who hurts him will die.

111
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,800
The one who hurts him will die too.

112
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,120
Today, I'll beat you to death.

113
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,800
I'm so scared.

114
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,520
So, in order to avoid all this,

115
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,000
let's skip it if we can.

116
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,680
Okay?

117
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,320
Okay?

118
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,160
I can understand that she is trying to hurt him.

119
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,960
You are trying to hurt him.

120
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,600
I'm trying to hurt you.

121
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,720
Why should I try to hurt you?

122
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,720
I know it sounds ridiculous.

123
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,280
But that's what it says in the script.

124
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,760
The script is really ridiculous.

125
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,400
Whenever I'm in danger,

126
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,320
you will come to save me without being controlled.

127
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,560
But what if the mechanism of the Ming Chang Noodle

128
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,680
and the mechanism of the heroine's

129
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
saving the hero at the same time

130
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
will happen?

131
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,560
What's wrong?

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,720
Nothing.

133
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,320
Don't worry.

134
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,280
Leave the rest to me.

135
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,440
You can just

136
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,520
stay at home and prepare for the wedding.

137
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,960
Yes.

138
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,040
You want Chu Guihong

139
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,920
to take Lord Qianyu to Pingrong to help?

140
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,680
Yes.

141
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,280
I've been promoted to Crown Prince.

142
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,160
According to the custom,

143
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,800
I should wear the Black Armor

144
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,800
to help in the capital.

145
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,200
If Lord Qianyu still helps me,

146
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,120
I'm afraid I'll be in a dilemma.

147
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,080
Stop pretending.

148
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,280
When did you come to me for an order?

149
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,600
Not because of Song Yimeng?

150
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,280
I dare not lie to Your Majesty.

151
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,880
It's just because

152
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,520
Chu Guihong and Song Yimeng had a engagement.

153
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,640
Chu Guihong has been

154
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,960
concerned about it.

155
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,040
I'm getting married soon.

156
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,480
It's good that he's far away.

157
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,840
I see.

158
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,640
Get up.

159
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

160
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,600
How's your relationship

161
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,200
with Rui'er recently?

162
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,080
I don't have much contact with 18th Brother.

163
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,280
Your Majesty, I have a question.

164
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,360
Are you worried that

165
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,640
if Chu Guihong is separated,

166
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,240
18th Brother will be angry?

167
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,680
Rui'er and her cousin are very close.

168
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,360
She was wrong to be the Crown Prince.

169
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,800
If she loses Chu Guihong's companion,

170
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,480
I'm afraid she can't bear it.

171
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,840
Your Majesty, you're thoughtful.

172
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,720
I should have asked 18th Brother about it.

173
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,280
I was not thoughtful enough.

174
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,680
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

175
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,720
If she'd lost Chu Guihong,

176
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,160
we wouldn't be here.

177
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,680
What are you doing?

178
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,240
How dare you break into our palace after finishing the task?

179
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,040
You should take the breriary.

180
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,600
What brings you here?

181
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
The official told me

182
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,440
to report this matter in person

183
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,080
The official?

184
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,200
and the Star Demon,

185
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,640
I think it's hard to see the past.

186
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,160
If so,

187
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,560
the Eighteen-Eleven's religion

188
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,440
has been stable for a long time.

189
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,440
I feel ashamed.

190
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,040
You're acting strange again.

191
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,760
I dare not.

192
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,360
It's rare that you brothers

193
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,720
have the same idea.

194
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,720
I'll help you

195
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,400
to let Chu Guihong

196
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,800
go to Pingrong one day.

197
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

198
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,000
Nan Heng is really too cruel.

199
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,600
He took away Meng'er and bewitched my cousin.

200
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,120
His uncle

201
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,880
killed my father and brother.

202
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,040
Why did he marry the Crown Prince?

203
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,640
He married my fiancee

204
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,880
and killed me

205
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,640
and left the capital.

206
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,440
Why?

207
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,840
General,

208
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,240
this is His Majesty's order.

209
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,440
So what?

210
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,200
Didn't Yan Chi and Nan Heng

211
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,720
secretly use some evil scheme

212
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,080
to blind His Majesty?

213
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,040
Now that the matter has been settled,

214
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,560
we'll go to Pingrong to

215
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,520
send him away.

216
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,600
He drove me out of the capital at this time.

217
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,720
It's clear that he doesn't want me

218
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,800
to appear at Meng'er's wedding ceremony.

219
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,600
But this time,

220
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,240
I won't let his scheme succeed.

221
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,040
General,

222
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,840
it's time to set out.

223
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,240
I'm afraid

224
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,120
His Highness won't come.

225
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,520
How about

226
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,960
we set out?

227
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,000
Let's set out.

228
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,080
Set out!

229
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,120
Cousin,

230
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,920
take care.

231
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,280
Listen up.

232
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,200
Keep an eye on Chu Feihong.

233
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,760
Don't let him go back to the capital.

234
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,120
Or he'll ruin

235
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,400
the wedding ceremony of the Chief.

236
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,320
Aren't you going?

237
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,640
Me?

238
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:23,000
Fine.

239
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,640
Your biggest wish

240
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,320
is to see Song Yi Meng

241
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,000
marry a good man

242
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,640
and live a happy life.

243
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,720
But

244
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,240
I'm really sorry

245
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,880
for not marrying Chu Wei Hong

246
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,680
as you wished.

247
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,920
But even so,

248
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,840
you have to bless him

249
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,600
in heaven.

250
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,280
Mother,

251
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,920
my parents

252
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,120
are out there.

253
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,440
Mother,

254
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,600
if you ever

255
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,040
see my father and mother,

256
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,520
can car them

257
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,400
the message

258
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:31,400
You said that their daughter has grown up.

259
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,400
Song Xiaoyu, are you going to marry tomorrow?

260
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Maybe in their heart, this is not the right decision.

261
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:56,400
But please believe me, this is the bravest decision I've ever made in my life.

262
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:03,400
Because here, there is a friend who takes care of me, a father who supports my daughter,

263
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,400
a sister who treats me like a family member, and a wife.

264
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Of course, there is also a man who can clear all the worries for his daughter.

265
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Meng, if Nan Heng bullies you,

266
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
the Crown Prince's Mansion is just a few kilometers away from home.

267
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
I'll go and pick you up.

268
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:30,400
On the day of the wedding, the bride is going out.

269
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,580
Look at the

270
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,400
flowers blooming in the sky,

271
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,400
looking at the years,

272
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,400
my heart beats fast.

273
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Look at the paper lanterns,

274
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,400
there is a fate that cannot be turned around.

275
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,400
Looking at the world,

276
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,400
I will never be tired of it.

277
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,400
We

278
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,400
It's dawn, why is there still no movement?

279
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
Back door.

280
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Yes.

281
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Second Master, the back door.

282
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Let's go.

283
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
What's going on?

284
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,400
So the person you like is this kind of feeling.

285
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,400
No wonder everyone is having a wedding.

286
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,400
Life still needs a sense of ritual.

287
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Even if there is something wrong, I will not let you get hurt.

288
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,400
Come on.

289
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Come on.

290
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Come on.

291
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,400
Chu Gui Hong, you are finally here.

292
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Didn't Chu Gui Hong get fired from Nan Heng and left the capital?

293
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Why are you back?

294
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,360
Can't we still avoid the famous scene

295
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,600
where the three of us are fighting?

296
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,680
The hatred of killing a father and the hatred of taking a wife.

297
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,080
Today, I'll take revenge

298
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,120
and kill you all at once.

299
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,240
I'll kill you, the devil.

300
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,200
If you want to live,

301
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,680
it depends on whether you have the ability.

302
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,560
No, no.

303
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,200
Calm down, Song Yi Meng.

304
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,800
If you go out now,

305
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,640
the famous scene where the three of us are fighting

306
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,200
will definitely happen.

307
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,240
We can't go out. We can't go out.

308
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,200
Oh, no.

309
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,600
Song Yi Meng, Meng Er.

310
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,640
General Chu, General Chu.

311
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,240
I've made up my mind.

312
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,400
I've made up my mind.

313
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,320
Why do you have to force me?

314
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,520
Why do you have to force me?

315
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,760
Song Yi Meng, go back.

316
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,400
Meng Er.

317
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,600
How can I watch you

318
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,360
marry such a blood-sucking demon?

319
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,640
It's a big mistake.

320
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
It will ruin your life.

321
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,840
What about the blood-sucking demon?

322
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,600
What about the blood-sucking demon?

323
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,320
Even if I love her, it's a mistake.

324
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,640
I'm willing to make another mistake.

325
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,320
I'm willing to make another mistake.

326
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,440
I'm willing to make another mistake.

327
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,640
Meng Er.

328
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,720
Song Yi Meng.

329
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,800
Song Yi Meng.

330
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,160
Go back.

331
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,480
Song Yi Meng.

332
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,800
Dai Heng.

333
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,960
Let her go.

334
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,480
I...

335
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,180
I must do something.

336
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,480
Do what?

337
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,140
Do what?

338
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Release him.

339
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,560
Fuhui.

340
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,000
Sw Sieg accordance.

341
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,760
Fuhue.

342
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,640
Fuhue, don't let him go.

343
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,520
Fuhue?

344
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,640
Accomplished

345
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,120
Tube

346
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,160
We...

347
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,600
We've succeeded

348
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,280
System

349
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,720
I'll go find the doctor.

350
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,520
Hurry!

351
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,720
Nau He!

352
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
Nau He!

353
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Take him!

354
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Yes!

355
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,720
Help!

356
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,720
Ghost!

357
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,720
Go find the doctor!

358
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,720
Hurry!

359
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,720
Nau He!

360
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,720
Yes!

361
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
Nau He!

362
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
Nau He!

363
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
Nau He, hang in there!

364
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,720
The doctor will be here soon.

365
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
Okay?

366
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
Hang in there!

367
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
It's okay.

368
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
It's okay.

369
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,920
Look.

370
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
The fate

371
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
can be changed.

372
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,920
I believe in you.

373
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,920
I believe in you.

374
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,920
I believe in you.

375
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Hang in there, Nau He.

376
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,920
Nau He!

377
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Nau He!

378
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
Nau He!

379
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Nau He!

380
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
Nau He!

381
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
I believe in you.

382
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
Nau He!

383
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
Hang in there!

384
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
Listen to me.

385
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Open your eyes and look at me.

386
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Okay?

387
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Okay?

388
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
Nau He!

389
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
Nau He!

390
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
Nau He!

391
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
What should I do?

392
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,920
Nau He!

393
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,920
Listen to me.

394
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
You can't die.

395
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
Do you hear me?

396
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
You can't die!

397
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,920
Didn't you promise me?

398
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,920
I'm worried about you.

399
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,920
You can solve everything for me.

400
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,920
I... I want you to live.

401
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
Do you hear me?

402
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
You can live.

403
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
You can trust me.

404
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
Help me.

405
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
Help me!

406
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
Help me!

407
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,120
Where are you?

408
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
Nau He.

409
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,120
Don't leave me alone.

410
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
Okay?

411
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
I'm begging you.

412
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,120
I'm begging you.

413
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
Nau He.

414
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
Nau He!

415
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,320
Nau He!

416
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,320
The Crown Prince was hurt by two stabs.

417
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,320
I'm afraid he can't go back to heaven.

418
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,320
Nau He.

419
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,320
They all said you can't live tonight.

420
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,320
But I don't care.

421
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,320
You were a loser and you're so shameless.

422
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
Today,

423
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,320
whether you live or die,

424
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,320
you have to finish the ceremony with me.

425
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,320
After drinking this cup of He Jin wine,

426
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,320
we'll be a real couple.

427
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,320
From now on,

428
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,320
whether you're poor or rich,

429
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,320
whether you're healthy or not,

430
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,320
I won't leave you.

431
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
Of course,

432
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,320
you can't leave me.

433
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,320
If you still have a conscience,

434
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,320
wake up quickly.

435
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
I just hope

436
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,320
that fate can help me.

437
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,520
I hope

438
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
that you can help me

439
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,520
to stay in your world for a few more hours.

440
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
Or

441
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,520
I can think of a way

442
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
to bring you into my world.

443
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,520
Okay?

444
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,520
Nau He.

445
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Wake up quickly, okay?

446
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,520
As long as you can wake up,

447
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,520
I don't want a big house.

448
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
I don't want anything

449
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,520
like a cat or dog,

450
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,520
a puppy or a wolf.

451
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,520
I just want you, a big, half-dog.

452
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
You don't have it.

453
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
Let me tell you.

454
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,520
I'll only give you this night's time.

455
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,520
Before tomorrow morning,

456
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,520
if you can't wake up,

457
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
I'll...

458
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
I'll kill you first.

459
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,520
When you're dead,

460
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
I'll inherit all your property.

461
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
I'll marry someone else when I'm alive.

462
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,520
I'll support you.

463
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
Do you hear me?

464
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,520
Wake up quickly.

465
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,520
I'm here.

466
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,520
I'm here.

467
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,520
I'm here.

468
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
I'm here.

469
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,520
I'm here.

470
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,520
I'm here.

471
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
I'm here.

472
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,520
I'm here.

473
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
I'm here.

474
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
I'm here.

475
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
I'm here.

476
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
I'm here.

477
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
I'm here.

478
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,520
I'm here.

479
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,520
I'm here.

480
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,520
I'm here.

481
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
I'm here.

482
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
I'm here.

483
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
I'm here.

484
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,520
I'm here.

485
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
What are you doing?

486
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,520
You're telling me to rescue his majesty,

487
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,520
but you're just waiting to be executed?

488
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,200
Yes, yes.

489
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,040
I heard from cousin that

490
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,960
when he was on the border,

491
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,480
his arm was broken.

492
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,360
It was someone who asked us to help him to get it back.

493
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,520
Our Highness is in danger now.

494
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,520
It's not that easy to break his arm or his leg.

495
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,640
Besides,

496
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,640
he can't even get his arm back.

497
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,480
Why should he help us?

498
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,320
Fugui, think about it.

499
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,200
Why did you run so far?

500
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,880
I really want to save my brother.

501
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,920
Why did you let him go in?

502
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,080
Even if Prince 18 wanted to save him,

503
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,560
you should know that

504
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,720
Chu Guihong did the assassination today.

505
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,520
And he is from the Qianyu Army.

506
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,240
If he comes to kill you,

507
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,520
who will take the responsibility?

508
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,840
Please rest assured, sir.

509
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,640
I'm willing to save the Crown Prince

510
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,840
because I want to atone for my young general.

511
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,840
Please promise me

512
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,920
that if I can cure the Crown Prince

513
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,200
and bring him back to life,

514
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:28,920
I will ask him to pardon my young general's crime of assassination.

515
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,720
What the hell are you Qianyu Army?

516
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,240
Our Highness is still alive.

517
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,480
You are taking advantage of the situation.

518
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,520
I'm telling you,

519
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,600
Chu Guihong did the crime of treason.

520
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,440
He deserves to be punished.

521
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,640
If you don't agree,

522
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,560
I'll leave now.

523
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,440
Fugui, you...

524
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,840
No, no, no.

525
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,800
Zhao Baochuan.

526
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,480
Fugui,

527
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,360
I'll tell you.

528
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,200
It's not the time.

529
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,520
Can't you promise me first?

530
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,120
I promise you.

531
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,640
I promise you.

532
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,120
Your Highness.

533
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,360
Today I'm married into the Crown Prince's Mansion.

534
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,160
I should decide

535
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,080
everything in the mansion.

536
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,760
I promise you.

537
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,440
As long as Nan Heng can wake up safely,

538
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,760
he and I will never pursue Chu Guihong's crime today.

539
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,480
Okay.

540
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,600
Wait.

541
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,520
But if you can't save him,

542
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,640
I will not only let His Majesty punish him,

543
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,760
you Qianyu Army

544
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,600
will be punished one by one.

545
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,920
I won't let you go.

546
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,760
Including you,

547
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,200
I'd rather dishonor you than hurt you.

548
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,280
That's not it.

549
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,200
Your Highness.

550
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,360
Greetings, Your Highness.

551
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,600
I am the movin'ór hero support.

552
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,480
Your Highness.

553
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,320
Do you get it?

554
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,600
Yeah!

555
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,760
They're

556
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,360
Muyi released from prison

557
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,760
Be careful!

558
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,760
Hurry up!

559
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
Over there!

560
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,160
Guys, chase them!

561
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,760
Hurry up!

562
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,360
Over there!

563
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,960
Catch them!

564
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,960
Don't run!

565
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,560
Catch them!

566
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
Stop!

567
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
Stop!

568
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
How is it?

569
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Come on.

570
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,760
Crown Princess Consort, it's cold in the morning.

571
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,360
Put on some clothes.

572
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,160
Fu Gui!

573
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,160
Do it!

574
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,360
Crown Princess Consort,

575
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,760
why don't you go back to your room and rest?

576
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,960
I'll be watching you.

577
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,960
Fu Gui,

578
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,560
how did you think of

579
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,760
stabbing me with a knife yesterday?

580
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,360
Tomorrow, on the way to the wedding,

581
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,960
if Chu Wei Hong is assassinated,

582
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,760
and something uncontrollable happens,

583
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,560
you just listen to me

584
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,960
and stab Song Yi Meng with a knife.

585
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,160
Your Highness, why is that?

586
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,560
As long as Miss Song is in danger,

587
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,160
Your Highness will save her.

588
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,360
You're the one who's hurt.

589
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,560
I can't do it.

590
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,760
You have to do it.

591
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,360
I only trust you on this.

592
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,560
And I can only leave it to you.

593
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,360
The owner of the prison is in danger.

594
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,560
But the one who can save her

595
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,360
will definitely be saved tomorrow.

596
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,760
So, the night before,

597
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,760
he thought of all the exceptions

598
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,360
and the right way.

599
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,160
He thought of everything.

600
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,160
Your Highness is...

601
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
Your Highness is using your life to prove

602
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,560
that he's worth your trust.

603
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,160
Miss! Miss!

604
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,160
Miss!

605
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:15,960
Ting!

606
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,760
Ting!

607
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,360
Why are you here?

608
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,760
It's all my fault.

609
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,560
I didn't see Chu Wei Hong.

610
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,960
How is she?

611
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,760
The doctor Zhao of Qianyu Army

612
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,560
is treating her wounds.

613
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,960
Doctor Zhao?

614
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,360
Ting, don't misunderstand.

615
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,960
She's not my cousin.

616
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,160
She's an ancient woman.

617
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,160
Your Highness,

618
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,160
the assassination happened yesterday.

619
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,560
Why did you

620
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,160
come here so soon?

621
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:42,960
I...

622
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,960
Yes, Your Highness.

623
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,160
How did you know

624
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,560
that the imperial doctor couldn't save you?

625
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,360
And he brought the doctor here.

626
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,960
Yesterday, Count Zhao asked me to come.

627
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,560
I heard it from him.

628
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
He said that my uncle was stabbed

629
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,960
and he couldn't be saved.

630
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,960
But why did Count Zhao

631
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,560
know it in advance?

632
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,160
Is it a coincidence?

633
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:09,800
First!

634
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
Name here.

635
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,960
How are they?

636
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,160
So spicy.

637
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,960
Could you have weapon by the fire?

638
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,960
There are other things in the house.

639
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,160
Help me on the way.

640
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,760
Could you save pass it?

641
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,360
Your Highness,

642
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,160
please take care of yourself.

643
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,960
Chun Hua,

644
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,760
please pass it to her.

645
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,760
Okay.

646
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,200
Dr. Papa, I meanıktuchu.

647
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:46,960
Zhao Mo?

648
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,620
How did you know II's Prince got 보통

649
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,720
because of ales.

650
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,700
Somebody told meoring DS,

651
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,620
Where is it?

652
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,240
18th prince brought me

653
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,040
to cure him,

654
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,340
but I can't attend

655
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,540
somebody else's problem.

656
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,580
Zhao Mo,

657
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,260
I actually wanted to know

658
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:05,940
Your Highness,

659
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,700
you'll see soon.

660
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,160
You are so brave, Chu Hui Hong!

661
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,240
How dare you assassinate the Crown Prince?

662
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,960
Now that the Crown Prince is unconscious,

663
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,760
he disappeared!

664
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
Your Majesty, please calm down.

665
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,960
Father! Father!

666
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,160
Please take care of yourself.

667
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Father!

668
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
Don't be angry!

669
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,760
Does he know that

670
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,760
assassinating the Crown Prince

671
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,160
is a serious crime against the Jiuzi clan?

672
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,160
Even if the Empress and the King of Qianyu are alive,

673
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,960
he can't protect his life.

674
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,960
Yes.

675
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,960
Father,

676
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,960
Qi's life is safe now.

677
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
Su Yu Meng also promised

678
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,560
not to pursue my cousin's crime.

679
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,960
How about you punish him again?

680
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,360
The country has its laws.

681
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,560
The Crown Prince was assassinated.

682
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,960
Actually, he just

683
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,960
said it without any reason.

684
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,960
Yes.

685
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,560
Su Yu Meng didn't mean it.

686
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,560
What about my mother?

687
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,960
When my mother was alive,

688
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,360
my cousin was the most painful.

689
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,360
Father, if you really kill her,

690
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,960
I'm afraid that my mother's soul

691
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,960
will be destroyed.

692
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,760
I'm afraid that my mother's soul

693
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,960
will be destroyed.

694
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,960
Rui,

695
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,160
send more imperial guards to find her.

696
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,360
Bring her back first.

697
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,360
Let's talk about other things later.

698
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,960
Okay, I'll do it now.

699
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,160
Is the Imperial Concubine's bedroom this way?

700
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,960
Your Highness,

701
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,960
the Crown Prince has been transferred to the security.

702
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,960
There is also the elder sister to take care of him.

703
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,960
You don't have to worry too much.

704
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,960
You should take care of yourself.

705
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,960
It's really God's blessing.

706
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,960
Good child,

707
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,960
thank you for thinking of

708
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,960
coming to tell me.

709
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,960
I'm sorry.

710
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,960
I'm sorry.

711
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,960
I'm sorry.

712
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
I'm sorry.

713
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,960
Your Majesty,

714
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,960
your name is Song Yiting, right?

715
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,960
You're really as annoying as your sister.

716
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,960
I think Song Yu De,

717
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,960
this second girl,

718
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,960
is more sensible than Song Yimeng.

719
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,960
I, Song Yiting, greet Your Majesty.

720
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,960
Slowly, slowly.

721
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,960
Your Majesty,

722
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,960
how old is the girl?

723
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,960
Your Majesty,

724
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,960
I'm 22 years old.

725
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,960
Do you have a matchmaker?

726
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,960
I already have someone I like.

727
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,960
Although I haven't changed the geese and the eight characters,

728
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,960
I've already decided it's her.

729
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,960
I can't tolerate anyone else anymore.

730
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,960
I only ask if you have a matchmaker.

731
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,960
You brought up so much.

732
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,960
Your Majesty, please calm down.

733
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,960
This second girl,

734
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,960
is like her sister.

735
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,960
She's a person who is really handsome.

736
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,960
When she thinks of something,

737
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,960
she just says it without thinking.

738
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,960
She has no disrespect for Your Majesty.

739
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,960
I didn't say anything.

740
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,960
Why did you bring the crown princess to be the matchmaker?

741
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,960
I...

742
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,960
I'm here today to see you.

743
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,960
The crown princess is currently recuperating.

744
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,960
You need to relax.

745
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,960
You need to take care of your health.

746
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,960
Don't let her wake up and miss you.

747
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,960
Yes.

748
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,960
I'm here to see you.

749
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,960
I'm here to see you.

750
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,960
I'm here to see you.

751
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,960
I'm here to see you.

752
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,960
I'm here to see you.

753
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,960
I'm here to see you.

754
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,960
I'm here to see you.

755
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,960
I'm here to see you.

756
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
I'm here to see you.

757
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
