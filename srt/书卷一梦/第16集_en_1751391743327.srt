00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm so confused, I'm so confused

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm so confused, I'm so confused

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm so confused, I'm so confused

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm so confused, I'm so confused

I'm so confused, I'm so confused

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm so confused, I'm so confused

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm so confused, I'm so confused

I'm so confused, I'm so confused

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm so confused, I'm so confused

Episode 21

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Your Highness is not at peace

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
because you have sent out the marriage of the two families.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This matter is not difficult.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Song Yu De still has a little daughter.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If you can't marry Song Yimeng,

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
then marry Song Yiting.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The east is not bright, the west is bright.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why not?

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Song Yiting is meticulous and talented.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If I marry her,

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I will be in trouble.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Meticulous and talented.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
These are all the bad qualities of a wife.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Is it possible that you have to find a woman like Song Yimeng,

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
who is stupid and crazy?

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Song Yimeng is pretending to be stupid.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
He is trying to hide his tricks.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's weird.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You know the potential of talent.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Pretending to be stupid and pretending to be a man,

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
but you are trying to hide your tricks.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is not important.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What is important is to stop the marriage.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Then marry your two daughters back to your home.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Marry your wife and get the benefits.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Meticulous and talented.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Ridiculous.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Forgive me for being straightforward.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you want to fight for the position in the future,

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
you must not waste your time on your children's private affairs.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
With your means,

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
it's not difficult to destroy this marriage.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Why bother so much?

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You will be in trouble in the future.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Your Highness.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Your family is too strong.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You have offended the big girl.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Please go and have a look.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why don't you stop her?

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You haven't learned the lesson from last time.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No, the big boss really doesn't blame me.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Your Miss Song

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
came in with the secret recipe of the knife-cutting technique.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Who dares to come?

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Who dares to come?

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What's the recipe?

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You didn't put the knife-cutting technique

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
on the big picture, did you?

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I didn't put it on. Why are you so fierce?

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Who else would it be?

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Go and find the missing person.

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
See if there's anyone who knows the recipe.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Got it.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Long, go and find clues in the dark.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If you can't find it, don't come back to see me.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Got it?

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Hu, find clues.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What kind of costume is this?

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Where can I find clues?

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What if I can't find it?

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Long has told me that if you can't find the clues,

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
he'll cut your head off.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yes.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The boss has spoken.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If you can't find the clues,

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
he'll cut off your head.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Isn't there a lot of things to do?

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I arranged for Long and Hu to do things.

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But I didn't expect that they were both dead.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes, you're not dead.

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I think you're dead.

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I saved you from the prison.

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I didn't let you eat.

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Wait.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Take the coin.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Hurry up.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't be so impatient.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hey.

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Did you do it on purpose?

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll do it.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll do it.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're so stupid.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Don't move.

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Don't do it.

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll do it.

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're pressing my hair.

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Be gentle.

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Sorry.

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Sorry.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
No, she...

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
She...

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Song Yi Meng.

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Miss Song.

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Hero Li.

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That...

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You don't have to explain.

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You...

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's not a big deal.

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Don't be nervous. I understand.

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What do you understand?

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No, I just...

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Bye.

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What are you doing?

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What are you doing?

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
List, clue.

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The second master said that it was a personal report.

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm talking to Miss Song.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll talk to you later.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Boss.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The new batch of masters have arrived.

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Each one has a big sword.

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The most important thing is the technique.

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Do you want to try it?

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'll talk to you later.

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
No.

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
She said it was a sword master.

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Sword master?

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I understand.

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I understand everything.

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What do you understand?

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You don't look like you understand.

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
She said it was a sword master.

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Shangguan, come here.

146
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You tell Miss Song what happened just now.

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I can't tell you about the change of identity.

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The master of Chengxi came to see you.

149
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He said that the second half of the three sons will be yours.

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He also hopes that you can treat them...

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Gently.

152
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Gently.

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay.

154
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I want you to explain the things in the room.

155
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Explain it to her.

156
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No, what do I explain?

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I...

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Master Li.

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You really don't have to explain it to me.

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I understand everything.

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Don't show this to anyone else.

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Since you are...

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You are...

164
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You...

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You...

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You...

167
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You...

168
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Just treat me as a selfish person.

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Then we will...

170
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We will never go back.

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Su Yimeng!

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I...

173
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Did you do it on purpose?

174
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I...

175
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No wonder.

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
No wonder.

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The brother in your hand.

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Said that you are not good at women.

179
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No wonder you always...

180
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Don't care about that Shangguan He.

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
He is a traitor.

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's a night of lonely men and women.

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Let's keep a distance.

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's just that it's boss's personal territory.

185
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But sister-in-law, don't worry.

186
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There must be no woman.

187
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Boss doesn't like women.

188
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I forgive you for going into the room and spilling the drink.

189
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
My love...

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Has not started yet.

192
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's over because of you.

193
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Su Yimeng.

194
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I...

195
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I...

196
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I...

197
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You are here.

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
My sister.

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Sit down.

200
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Sit down.

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Drinking in the room alone in the middle of the night.

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's dangerous.

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Let me tell you.

204
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I thought you were good to me.

205
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Said you like me.

206
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I didn't expect it, Mr. Li.

207
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I didn't expect...

208
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You always treat me as a good sister.

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's not what you think.

210
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I...

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Don't make noise.

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Don't make noise.

213
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
There are so many people here.

214
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's not good to hear your secret.

215
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's not good for you.

216
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Enough.

217
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Listen to me, Su Yimeng.

218
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Listen to me.

219
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't like men.

220
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Do you hear me?

221
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You don't like men?

222
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yes.

223
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So you just like Shangguan He.

224
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Are you stupid?

225
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
If I really have that kind of relationship with Shangguan He,

226
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Then the people in the museum are blind.

227
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
They can't see.

228
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What's wrong?

229
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You don't just like Shangguan He.

230
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Who else?

231
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
A'Long.

232
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
A'Hu.

233
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Or that...

234
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What's the name of the play?

235
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm Sun.

236
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Don't say anything.

237
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm afraid it's harder for you to accept.

238
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I know, Mr. Li.

239
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Like someone.

240
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I can't force it.

241
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I know all of these.

242
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I really know.

243
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So I like you.

244
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This is my business.

245
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's none of your business.

246
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
No matter what kind of person you like,

247
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Or what.

248
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You are always the best in my heart.

249
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You are the best.

250
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I will always support you.

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Really.

252
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Cheers.

253
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So you don't believe me no matter what I say, right?

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Then I'll prove it to you.

255
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Sorry.

271
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Really, really sorry.

274
00:14:35,000 --> 00:15:00,060
Let the yearsglass

275
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

276
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

277
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

278
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

279
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

280
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

281
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

282
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

283
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

284
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

285
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

286
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

287
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

288
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

289
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Listen to this,

290
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,160
and

291
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:42,360
the mooneling's

292
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,160
coming to its inner surface.

293
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,060
Your zither is too high-pitched.

294
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,060
Guqin can't make a decision about killing the hair.

295
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,060
Everyone says you are talented.

296
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,060
But I know you have your own wish.

297
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:17,060
So it seems that you are more compatible with Lord Chu.

298
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,060
I'm just a dog who has no face.

299
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,060
So you like Seventh Prince?

300
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,060
He is cunning and full of hatred.

301
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,060
I'm just a dog.

302
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,060
So there are only 18 princes left.

303
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,060
Yin Zhu,

304
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:41,060
People can't fall in love with fools.

305
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,060
Don't you understand?

306
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:52,060
A person like me should have gone to the sky.

307
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:56,060
But his mother forced me to marry.

308
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,060
I'm so depressed and sad.

309
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,060
I can't help myself.

310
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,060
Yue,

311
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:10,060
Can only you understand my sorrow?

312
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,060
Wait!

313
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:29,060
The moon and the moon are bright.

314
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:33,060
The flowers are blooming.

315
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,060
Lord.

316
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,060
Where are you from?

317
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,060
Where are you going?

318
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,060
You don't need to know the location.

319
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,060
You don't need to know the map.

320
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,060
The moon and the moon are bright.

321
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,060
I didn't expect there would be such a person who despises me.

322
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,060
Shanna, I want to know all his information in one day.

323
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,060
I was drunk last night.

324
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,060
You two were taken back by me.

325
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,060
I didn't see anyone else.

326
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,060
Someone else?

327
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,060
Girl, I don't know how you came back.

328
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,060
I'm willing to be a bee in the sky.

329
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,060
I'm willing to be a good sister in the earth.

330
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,060
Girl, you...

331
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:30,060
Don't worry about the road ahead.

332
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,060
Sisterhood is deep.

333
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,060
It's a long way.

334
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,060
Girl, what's wrong with you?

335
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,060
You talk nonsense like a ghost when you wake up in the morning.

336
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,060
What should I do?

337
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,060
Li Shiliu, you hurt her like this.

338
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,060
If I say that Suoxin broke up with him,

339
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,060
I'll be with General Chu.

340
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,060
Girl, you don't know that General Chu visits us every day.

341
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,060
He's going to wipe out our door.

342
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,060
How about seeing him?

343
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,060
See him.

344
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,060
What a bad idea.

345
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,060
He's a Bees.

346
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,060
What Bees?

347
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,060
Don't worry about Bees.

348
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,060
You can't keep being so quiet.

349
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,060
The best way to heal your heart is to cut off old feelings.

350
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,060
Open a new relationship.

351
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,060
If you don't like someone, you have to reject him.

352
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,060
He's a bad guy.

353
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,060
I've thought about it.

354
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:30,060
I'm going to cancel Chu Weihong's wedding.

355
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,060
Don't involve him.

356
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,060
And don't say that marriage is a sacred command.

357
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,060
Girl, think about it.

358
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,060
You've only been in love with Li Shiliu for a few days.

359
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,060
And you've become like this.

360
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,060
General Chu has been in love with you for more than ten years.

361
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,060
Did he do anything extreme?

362
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,060
Good.

363
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,060
General Chu.

364
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,060
What is this?

365
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,060
Cangjiang Music Hall.

366
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,060
The notice was posted on the street.

367
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,060
The government of Jingzhou is coming to investigate.

368
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,060
What a joke.

369
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,060
Which store in Jingzhou doesn't post a notice?

370
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,060
For such a small thing,

371
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,060
you even let General Chu come here.

372
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,060
Tell Li Shiliu to come out.

373
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,060
The chief is not here.

374
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,060
I'll take care of Cangjiang Music.

375
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,060
If Li Shiliu is not here,

376
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,060
I'll arrest you and take you back to Jingzhou.

377
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,060
Come on. Stop.

378
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,060
General Chu.

379
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,060
Didn't we work together a few days ago?

380
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,060
What do you mean?

381
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,060
Someone reported to the street of Qianyu Army.

382
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,060
Last night, you secretly broke into Song's Mansion.

383
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,060
Hero Li, can you explain?

384
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:24,060
You broke into the female army yard at midnight.

385
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,060
What did you do?

386
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,060
General Chu.

387
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,060
Didn't you say you were going to post a notice?

388
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,060
Why did you get me into Song's Mansion?

389
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,060
I've been to Song's Mansion many times before and after.

390
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,060
I don't see anyone reporting.

391
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,060
I think you brought so many people here today

392
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,060
just to mess up the place.

393
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,060
So what?

394
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,060
You asked Meng to cancel the engagement with me.

395
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,060
Song Yimeng wants to cancel the engagement? Stop pretending.

396
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,060
Meng is about to marry me.

397
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,060
Please stay away from her.

398
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,060
What if I don't want to?

399
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,060
The wedding invitation is here.

400
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,060
Hero Li, if you still don't want to,

401
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,060
don't forget to come and have a drink.

402
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,060
How many years have I been in the sand?

403
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,060
How many years has Meng been waiting for me?

404
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:41,060
Now, this wedding is arranged by Lord Song and His Majesty.

405
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,060
Li Shiliu, even if you have the ability to break the heaven,

406
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:49,060
you can never shake this marriage.

407
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,060
If you're so confident,

408
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,060
why don't I make a bet with you?

409
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,060
I'll bet with you for ten days.

410
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,060
I'll make you have to cancel this engagement.

411
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:21,060
Didn't you say yesterday that you didn't want to involve Song Yimeng?

412
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,060
Why are you betting on her canceling the engagement today?

413
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,060
It's different now.

414
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,060
Tell me, what's different?

415
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,060
Didn't you hear that?

416
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:37,060
Song Yimeng is the one who wanted to cancel the engagement.

417
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,060
He doesn't want to get married. I'm helping him.

418
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,060
That's clear.

419
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,060
But I have to remind you.

420
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,060
Song Yimeng doesn't want to marry Chu Guihong,

421
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,060
but he definitely doesn't want to marry you.

422
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,060
That's to say, he might have considered you yesterday.

423
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:58,060
Now, I think it's enough for us to do this.

424
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:03,060
Why are you so anxious again?

425
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,060
Let me tell you.

426
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,060
From now on, you can't talk to me during our walk.

427
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,060
Or else, I'll drag you out of the prison and put you back in there.

428
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,060
Do you understand?

429
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,060
I understand.

430
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,060
I'm sorry.

431
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:29,060
You know you can't do anything to send me back to prison.

432
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,060
No wonder you can't even get rid of Song Yimeng.

433
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,060
You're so stupid, Qi.

434
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:53,060
I'll marry Chu Guihong and then marry you.

435
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,060
I'm the one who offended you.

436
00:24:55,060 --> 00:25:01,060
But you've been the one who's been talking about the benefits of marriage and fighting the enemy.

437
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,060
I just want to see you.

438
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,060
I just want to see you.

439
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,060
I just want to see you.

440
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,060
I just want to see you.

441
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,060
I just want to see you.

442
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:17,060
If you want to see me, then you have to marry Chu Guihong.

443
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:21,060
So you can be with Chu Guihong.

444
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,060
You're such a wimp.

445
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,060
You're such a wimp.

446
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,060
You're such a wimp.

447
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,060
You're such a wimp.

448
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,060
I'm not wimp.

449
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:35,060
I'm the one who's been talking about the benefits of marriage and fighting the enemy.

450
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,060
You're the one who's been talking about it.

451
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:41,060
Wake up, Your Highness, don't fall asleep.

452
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,020
But stillaka

453
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,240
wavelength

454
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,240
what happened to you

455
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,180
in your heart

456
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,980
Am I not a cold-handed

457
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,820
doing something he was not normal

458
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,880
now

459
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,280
Just let him bite some small grudges

460
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,100
But as long as I want

461
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,080
I can asked to be his ciller

462
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,880
also

463
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,100
what do you think

464
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,260
can threaten me with him

465
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,060
Don't pretend to be with me.

466
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,060
I have a lot of spies in the capital.

467
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:21,060
I know when you went to the Moon of the Moon.

468
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,060
Including what you told Li Shiliu.

469
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:28,060
As long as I want to know, I can know.

470
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:32,060
A prince is really rich.

471
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:37,060
A matter of a person in the world is worth your effort.

472
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,060
I don't care about him.

473
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,060
I care about you.

474
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,060
If you marry Chu Guihong.

475
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,060
The power of your Song family will be in the hands of Nanrui.

476
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:51,060
I do this to protect myself.

477
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,060
Now Chu Guihong is holding a knife on my neck.

478
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,060
How can I sit and wait?

479
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,060
So you use Li Shiliu to threaten me.

480
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,060
I really want to do it.

481
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,060
So what do you say?

482
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:11,060
Anyway, you have to listen to me.

483
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,060
Come, stop.

484
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,060
You care about Li Shiliu so much.

485
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:27,060
Don't you like him?

486
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,060
Yes, that's right.

487
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,060
I like him.

488
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,060
What does it have to do with you?

489
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:44,060
I like him so much that I'm not afraid of him designing you.

490
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,060
Anyway, he can't like me.

491
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,060
You can design whatever you want.

492
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,060
What if he likes you?

493
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,060
Will you marry him?

494
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:58,060
Are you really a man of money?

495
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,060
This has nothing to do with you.

496
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,060
It does have nothing to do with me.

497
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:11,060
But I heard that Li Shiliu and the second master of Cang Jiangyue, Shang Guanhe, they two...

498
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,060
Shut up.

499
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,060
You don't have to worry about it.

500
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:22,060
It's not that easy to control the marriage.

501
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:26,060
Give me some time to think about it.

502
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,060
I'm sorry.

503
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,060
But before that,

504
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,060
if you dare to hurt Li Shiliu,

505
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,060
I'll kneel down and beg for forgiveness.

506
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,060
I'll do as you say.

507
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,060
I thought I'd pretend to be Li Shiliu and go out in person.

508
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,060
I didn't expect that I only spent one arm.

509
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:05,060
Song Yi Meng agreed to do the rest of the things.

510
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:12,060
What else are you unhappy about?

511
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,060
I'm not unhappy.

512
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,060
I just think this is too smooth.

513
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,060
It's a little strange.

514
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:22,060
Song Yi Meng doesn't think Li Shiliu and you are useless.

515
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:26,060
Song Yi Meng doesn't think Li Shiliu and you are useless.

516
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,060
Is that the kind of relationship?

517
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:36,060
Then why did he still take the risk of being a victim and agree to cancel the engagement?

518
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,060
If it weren't for me,

519
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,060
Song Yi Meng wouldn't have been able to realize his own heart.

520
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:51,060
Look, he knew it was impossible to be with Li Shiliu,

521
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,060
but he didn't care about his own life.

522
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,060
This is what a relationship is.

523
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:06,060
Seventh Prince, you finally made up your mind.

524
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,060
Sixth Prince

525
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:30,060
Sixth Prince

526
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,060
Anyway, this is the situation.

527
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,060
I'm not going to marry someone I don't like.

528
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:45,060
Father, I think you should go back on this wedding.

529
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,480
Who caused this?

530
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,780
Dad, what are you doing?

531
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,560
Stop.

532
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,100
This thing

533
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,620
was originally

534
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,620
I didn't expect that

535
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:24,620
My good daughter forced me to do this today

536
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,620
Say something

537
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,620
You come down first

538
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,620
Don't fall again

539
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,620
What else

540
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,620
This marriage decree

541
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,620
It was invited by my father

542
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,620
The emperor's anger

543
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,620
The master is a thousand miles away

544
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,620
Am I seeing you jump into the sea of fire

545
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,620
Hit the seven prince's fist

546
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,620
Let people use the frame

547
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,620
Parents love their children

548
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,620
I remember

549
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,620
Meng's mother

550
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,620
I'm here for you

551
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,620
Stop stop stop

552
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,620
Stop

553
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,620
You come down quickly, dad

554
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,620
Don't say anything

555
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,620
I don't need your help either

556
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,620
You don't force me to die either

557
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,620
OK

558
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,620
Good or not

559
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,620
Hurry up and come down

560
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,620
Come down quickly

561
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,620
Come down quickly

562
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,620
No words

563
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,620
Your Highness, Miss Song is here

564
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,620
Bring her here

565
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,620
Yes

566
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,620
Why are you not talking?

567
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,620
Didn't you say yesterday

568
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,620
I'll leave the marriage to you

569
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,620
Is there any good news today?

570
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,620
There was an accident with my father

571
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,620
Anyway, I don't know

572
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,620
I don't know

573
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,620
I don't know

574
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,620
I don't know

575
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,620
I don't know

576
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,620
Anyway, I didn't quit

577
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,620
What are you doing

578
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,620
It's because my father can play the stone pig

579
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,620
It looks like you are a vicious person

580
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,620
There are things between us

581
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,620
Not enough to quit

582
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,620
Blame me

583
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,620
Of course

584
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,620
You

585
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,620
You believe in ears

586
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,620
You give this

587
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,620
You give this

588
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,620
Why is it so good?

589
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,620
This end

590
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,620
It depends on me

591
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,620
Really

592
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,620
There will be no mistake

593
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,620
I bought it

594
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,620
My cousin's cousin

595
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,620
My cousin's cousin's aunt's cousin's cousin's nephew

596
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,620
Focus

597
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,620
The one who came to our Song's house that night

598
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,620
It's really Li Shiliu

599
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,620
A master in the mirror

600
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,620
The person who runs the hall of the Cangjiang Academy

601
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,620
I heard about it

602
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,620
But I didn't expect it to be him

603
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,620
Girl

604
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,620
So many years

605
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,620
You are the first time

606
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,620
The first person to meet the new moon

607
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,620
How about going to the Cangjiang Academy now?

608
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,620
How about

609
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,620
Mother is staring at me like this

610
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,620
The place like Cangjiang Academy

611
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,620
I'm afraid I haven't been there yet

612
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,620
I'm going to be brought back

613
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,620
You are right

614
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,620
Listen

615
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,620
Madam

616
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,620
The big room's dream of送衣

617
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,620
Have already started to start a wedding

618
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,620
Why are you here

619
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,620
No movement at all

620
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,620
Can't you really want to let the eighteenth prince

621
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,620
Wait until next year?

622
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,620
I'm talking to you

623
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,620
I'm talking

624
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,620
Then I will ask the eighteenth prince

625
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,620
To go to the Cangjiang Academy

626
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,620
How about

627
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,620
You are finally starting

628
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,620
How about

629
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,620
The old-fashioned dress

630
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,620
Said to be the most handsome man in the Qing Dynasty

631
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,620
I'm afraid I'm not sure

632
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,620
Jin Xiang

633
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,620
You don't know

634
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,620
This is the first time Tingting

635
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,620
Actively asked me

636
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,620
I'm afraid

637
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,620
Finally broke the new law

638
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,620
Can meet with me confidently

639
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,620
Not easy

640
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,620
You said

641
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,620
He asked for today

642
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,620
Hard to commit

643
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,620
Propose to marry this Qin Jinzhi

644
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,620
I promised him right away

645
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,620
Or should I delay it

646
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,620
I consider and agree

647
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,620
Promise again

648
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,620
Don't worry, Your Highness

649
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,620
This kind of trouble will not find you

650
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,620
You are talking nonsense

651
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,620
I

652
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,620
Your Highness is coming

653
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,620
Tingting, Tingting is coming

654
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,620
Come slowly

655
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,620
Come, I help you

656
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,620
Walk around

657
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,620
Tingting, this way

658
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,620
You are quite good

659
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,620
Lai Hama wants to eat goose meat

660
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,620
All the good dishes are taken away

661
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,620
What do you mean

662
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,620
The way you think of a break-up is to ride a horse

663
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,620
I said, Your Highness

664
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,620
You'd better give me a reasonable explanation

665
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,620
This is the royal horse farm

666
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,620
The guards around are the imperial guards around the emperor

667
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,620
I ride a horse with you alone

668
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,620
In less than half an hour

669
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,620
Will spread to the emperor's ears

670
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,620
This trick again

671
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,620
Old trick

672
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,620
The trick is not old

673
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,620
Just use it

674
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,620
This problem doesn't work

675
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,620
Just based on the flyers between us

676
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,620
It's not enough to let the emperor decree the marriage

677
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,620
Didn't you play it last time?

678
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,620
Still make the palace so messy

679
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,620
And implicated the empress

680
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,620
What are you doing this time

681
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,620
Aren't you afraid of offending your father?

682
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,620
Offended many times

683
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,620
Not this time

684
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,620
Come up

685
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,620
Three or two horses

686
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,620
Help

687
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,620
The horse is about to crash

688
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,620
You slow down

689
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,620
The palace is here

690
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,620
Do you have to climb like this?

691
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,620
Am I afraid of horses?

692
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,620
I'm afraid of you

693
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,620
No

694
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,620
Here

695
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,620
Halliesen

696
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,620
Tastes good

697
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,340
The table is red and sour

698
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,860
Golden silk is so beautiful

699
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,420
The owner of the moon is really a good person

700
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,340
18th prince

701
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,740
What are you doing

702
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,740
Miss Tingting

703
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,140
Today, no matter what

704
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,860
Whatever you like

705
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,020
I will buy it

706
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,620
Send to your house

707
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,500
Your Highness is in the stock market

708
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,820
No, I

709
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,420
I didn't

710
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,060
No, Tingting

711
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,340
Can you

712
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,180
Don't be so fierce when you see me

713
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:04,940
I

714
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,100
Jixiang

715
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,820
OK, put it down

716
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,580
Tingting

717
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,860
Aunt wants to say

718
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,820
What you said

719
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,140
Aunt put it in her heart

720
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,300
I will never do this to others

721
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,820
Your Highness wants to marry a folk girl

722
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,420
why

723
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,540
Men are married and women are married

724
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,020
A good man is good at playing the ball

725
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,220
What's the problem

726
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,420
Then I dare to ask 18th prince

727
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,540
What does marriage mean

728
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,460
Means

729
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,580
Means

730
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,420
This

731
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,180
Marriage is a man and a woman

732
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,380
Willing to accept the other person

733
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,700
Become your partner

734
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,540
Whether healthy or ill

735
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,300
Poor or rich

736
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,460
Are willing to comfort him

737
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,620
Protect him

738
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,380
Love him

739
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,380
Respect him

740
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,700
Never leave

741
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,140
Until death

742
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,660
Separate the two

743
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,100
No, this is from

744
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,100
Which folk song

745
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,060
Song Yimeng

746
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,260
Is the sister of the maid

747
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,260
Song Yimeng told me

748
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,340
Miss Tingting

749
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,620
You are not

750
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,100
Playing with the fun

751
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,220
Your Highness knows a lot about folk girls

752
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,740
Want to marry a folk girl

753
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,180
Just don't want to lose to the seventh prince

754
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,340
If it's not for the elder sister and the seventh prince

755
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,740
Filled with wind and rain

756
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,340
The person you married

757
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,580
Whether it's a folk girl

758
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,780
Actually doesn't matter

759
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,580
right

760
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,460
Absolutely not

761
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,740
I really like you

762
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,620
And father also thinks you are good

763
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,860
The one who marries the prince is not the emperor

764
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,380
The emperor is long and the emperor is short

765
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,860
Is the prince going to get married

766
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,180
Or the emperor wants to marry the consort

767
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,140
I am not

768
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,380
I mean i

769
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,620
This this

770
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:01,780
Sorry

771
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,820
Sorry for the folk girl's words

772
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:04,940
Tingting

773
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:05,860
Tingting

774
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,500
No, am I not clear enough?

775
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,900
It's only half an hour

776
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,220
I learned to ride a horse

777
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,660
How is it, Your Highness

778
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,900
The skill is not bad

779
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,140
I taught it well

780
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,540
But the war horses on the battlefield

781
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,580
Can't compare to the good living in the palace

782
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,900
In this battlefield

783
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,860
Not enough food and not enough horse food

784
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,620
Many war horses have been injured

785
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,700
Whether it's a meteorite or a fire in the war

786
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,340
Will affect the horse

787
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,060
Don't say it's so miserable

788
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,020
Isn't it your own choice?

789
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,460
Who doesn't know the seventh prince

790
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,300
Struggling to kill on the battlefield

791
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,900
Is it to brush the military?

792
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,780
Isn't it

793
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,420
Correct

794
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,500
Brush military power and seek fame and fortune

795
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,860
You are right

796
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,780
You are so strange

797
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,020
Anyway, you won't believe whatever I say

798
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,620
Who doesn't know in this Great Jin Dynasty

799
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,300
The emperor is not happy because of some old things

800
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,300
If I don't go to the border to fight the enemy

801
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,860
Is there any other way to keep it until now?

802
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,260
The battle field is so long

803
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,300
Why are you here

804
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,820
It's a way to save lives

805
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,540
Since I was nine years old

806
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,180
I was beaten into the cold palace

807
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,020
Bullied and abused

808
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,220
Also thrown into the fire

809
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,500
Food was poisoned

810
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,780
These emperors all know

811
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,500
But he never asked

812
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,100
I won't kill you

813
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,660
Which hand of yours removed Rui'er's arm

814
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,180
Just cut off this hand for me

815
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,060
Or do you want the world to scold me

816
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,780
Is a cruel emperor

817
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,900
You are real father and son

818
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,580
Why are you so low?

819
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,980
No father and son in the temple

820
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,140
Everything I have now

821
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,460
Are in the blood of the mountains and the sea

822
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,660
I got it by myself

823
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,540
This kind of person

824
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,140
No wonder the personality is twisted

825
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,420
No no no

826
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,740
Why did I come to pity my sister?

827
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:29,620
Song Yunmeng

828
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,420
Don't be a mother

829
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,460
Wake up

830
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,180
Stop

831
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,420
Although people are in the capital now

832
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,260
But the martial arts on the horse can't be wasted

833
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,260
Go back and let the brothers practice

834
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,300
Yes, general

835
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,380
General

836
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:00,900
General

837
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,220
look

838
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,940
let me go

839
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,680
All the trouble

840
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,860
it is all because of me

841
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:30,900
Come

842
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,580
I can do it

843
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:37,940
You let me go

844
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,860
This is Ku Kui Hong

845
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:41,780
Don't make it

846
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,660
You want to die, right?

847
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,660
Let me go.

848
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,660
You didn't hear me.

849
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,340
General.

850
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:54,340
General.

851
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,260
Don't touch me.

852
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,740
He is the prince.

853
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:58,260
Lan Yihong.

854
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,620
Let him go.

855
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,780
You are the prince.
