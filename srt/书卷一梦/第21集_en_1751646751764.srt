00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

62
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,160
How could someone

90
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,160
kill you?

91
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,220
I kill you.

92
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,740
I want to kill Song Yi,

93
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,600
why I have time little time little time

94
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,460
authors

95
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Eat congee

96
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,580
singing

97
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,120
reading

98
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,280
Song Yimeng said he took the runaway

99
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,800
I didn't mean that

100
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,720
Tell you

101
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,000
I said the ugly words in front

102
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,600
The knife was taken back and then cleaned up

103
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,920
This is over

104
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,160
But if you can't get the knife back

105
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,680
What mess did you cause me?

106
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,280
I didn't do it to Song Yiting

107
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,200
But I didn't promise not to do it to you

108
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,320
understand

109
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,880
understand

110
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,160
Can get me out of prison

111
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,280
Can also put me back

112
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,680
Don't worry

113
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,080
I've been angry with him today

114
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,680
I won't see him again tomorrow

115
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,160
Until the three-day period comes

116
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,960
I immediately go to the door

117
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,800
What three days

118
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,680
Go tomorrow

119
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,320
I see

120
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,280
Not when you

121
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,320
So sad for a woman

122
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,920
I

123
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,320
I

124
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,800
You won't fall in love, will you?

125
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,320
How can it be

126
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,760
That's good

127
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,600
As a brother

128
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,040
Tell you

129
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,280
This love story

130
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,960
Heroic

131
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,720
It's good to know

132
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,480
I want to show you

133
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,520
Stick to the current

134
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,700
I don't want your

135
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,160
I still prove it

136
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,280
Is it really

137
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,240
Does anyone see

138
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,480
Are you a river

139
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,480
No matter how much you paint,

140
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,480
it can't change your mind.

141
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,480
I paint these paintings not to give them to him,

142
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,480
but to remind myself

143
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,480
how stupid I am.

144
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
If I can get a heart,

145
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,480
there will be a result.

146
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,480
The way he saved me that day,

147
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,480
always lingers in my mind.

148
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,480
I remember once,

149
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
I paint again.

150
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,480
In fact,

151
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,480
I thought

152
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,480
I really understood.

153
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,480
Miss!

154
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,480
How many paintings can you use to get him?

155
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,480
How many paintings can you use to forget him?

156
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,480
If you can't paint,

157
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,480
just take off your clothes!

158
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Miss!

159
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,480
Miss!

160
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,480
These are all your hard work.

161
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,480
Don't die!

162
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
Don't die!

163
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,480
Miss!

164
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,480
Miss!

165
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,480
These are all your hard work.

166
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,480
Don't die!

167
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,480
Don't die!

168
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,480
You're just an ordinary man.

169
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,480
What's the difference

170
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
between being poor and being poor?

171
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,480
I, Su Yi Ting,

172
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
will never be concerned about love.

173
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
There are three thousand water in the world.

174
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Why do you only need one?

175
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Cheers!

176
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
He's been eating two bowls of rice since this morning.

177
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,480
He's in a good mood.

178
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,480
He looks so happy.

179
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
Is it because of Ting?

180
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,120
Gosh!

181
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,880
It's salty.

182
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,420
What a formality of a salty dish!

183
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,320
Teasing me,

184
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,040
polarization does it really work?

185
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,440
Don't you want to eat it?

186
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,100
I'm afraid it doesn't suit your appetite.

187
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:19,960
Or should I tell you

188
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,560
you fed me medicine,

189
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,840
now I feed you medicine?

190
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,400
Don't worry.

191
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,040
Or else I'dish to soil

192
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,580
your clothes again.

193
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,600
Since tiny

194
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,760
Time to come home

195
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,600
Give you your debt

196
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
If not for you

197
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,480
Who knows

198
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,160
I want to like Ah-ting

199
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,560
Bigger and prettier

200
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,860
So I will

201
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,320
I will

202
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,720
You will

203
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,240
I will

204
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,720
I have a big money

205
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,400
I really this

206
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,480
You will marry me.

207
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Your family will be mine.

208
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,480
I know you are not good-natured.

209
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,480
By the way, does your sister have a lover?

210
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
I heard she has a good taste.

211
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
The engagement date is not fixed yet.

212
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,480
What kind of man does she like?

213
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
What kind of man?

214
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
You bastard!

215
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,480
You want to kill me so soon?

216
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,480
Why did you fall down?

217
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,480
What's wrong?

218
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
Your Highness.

219
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,480
My stomach hurts suddenly.

220
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Your stomach hurts suddenly?

221
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,480
No, I have a stomachache.

222
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,480
Your Highness, you can eat alone.

223
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,480
I'll go back first.

224
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Go to the doctor.

225
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Did you hear that?

226
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,480
Song Yi Meng moved to the Seventh Prince's mansion.

227
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,480
He hasn't married yet.

228
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
He moved to the Seventh Prince's mansion.

229
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,480
What kind of man is he?

230
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
He is a very ridiculous man.

231
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,480
When did he care about his man?

232
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,480
I also heard that he went to the clinic

233
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,480
and bought that kind of medicine for the Seventh Prince.

234
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
Really?

235
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
He doesn't even want a tooth?

236
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Ting Ting, you know the most about the inner world.

237
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Tell us, what has been the progress?

238
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,480
Ting Ting.

239
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Ting Ting.

240
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
What's wrong?

241
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
You don't care about me.

242
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
Are you in a bad mood?

243
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,480
You didn't come to the show a few days ago.

244
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
What happened?

245
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,480
I'm not feeling well, I must be sick.

246
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
I know

247
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
I haven't seen you for a long time

248
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
I miss you so much

249
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,480
I understand Miss Ting Ting's illness the best

250
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,480
18th Prince

251
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
Everyone, don't stand on ceremony

252
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,480
What are you doing here?

253
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,480
I'm here to pursue Miss Ting Ting

254
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,480
Ting Ting, 18th Prince came for you

255
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,480
Ting Ting, I have a new answer to your question

256
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,480
I came today to tell you in person

257
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
What's the answer for 18th Prince?

258
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,480
I think marriage is a matter of two people

259
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Miss Ting Ting's talent is both appearance and taste

260
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,480
What I really like is your heart

261
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,480
Tell me, what's my heart like in your eyes?

262
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,480
You don't want to be entrusted with a marriage between the secular and the religious

263
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,480
You are not satisfied with what your parents control

264
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,480
You want to escape from the word destiny

265
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,480
You refuse to follow others because you think everyone only loves your appearance

266
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,480
But no one has ever asked you who you are

267
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,480
But listen, I'm different from others

268
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,480
The reason I like you is because you are you

269
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,480
You like to draw, I like it

270
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,480
You like to be rich, I like it

271
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,480
You are the old and the new, I like it

272
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,480
You are the rich and the old

273
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,480
I like it too

274
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,480
Ting Ting, I want to marry you

275
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,480
From now on, I will be responsible for liking you

276
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,480
And you only need to be yourself

277
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,480
18th Prince is trying to marry you

278
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Ting Ting, didn't he say what you always wanted to hear?

279
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,480
18th Prince, please come with me

280
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Tell me, who taught you this?

281
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,480
I...

282
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,480
No one taught me, it's all 18th Prince's sincere words

283
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,480
Ting Ting, I've liked you for so long

284
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,480
I will have some new experiences

285
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,480
Besides, today is just what I want

286
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
I just want to get it out

287
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,480
You suspect me so much that I will be sad

288
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,480
Really?

289
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Sorry, I was too much

290
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,480
It's okay

291
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
Check inside

292
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Ting Ting, look, look

293
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,480
The heart of не Mu

294
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,480
Ting Ting, now I solely know the beating

295
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,480
Let go

296
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,480
I'll check it

297
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,740
Oh sweet you

298
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,800
What is the tongue

299
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,240
What are you dealing with

300
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,980
Did i say the wrong thing

301
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,920
He send this pregnancy

302
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,420
He would have been a��ja

303
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,380
But he insisted that

304
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,340
The raised Yinitates Princess and said he's made up with him

305
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,780
You're so stubborn.

306
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,780
You're so afraid of Huanyin City.

307
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,780
You're so arrogant.

308
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,780
Tingting is not like that.

309
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,780
She's pretending.

310
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,780
She looks like she's not afraid of anything.

311
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,780
But she's the most arrogant girl in the whole city.

312
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,780
She's the most arrogant girl in the whole city.

313
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,780
Otherwise, how could she be liked by 18th prince?

314
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,780
Liu Huanyi, you're not a friend to me.

315
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,780
Liu Huanyi, you're not a friend to me.

316
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,780
Enough. Stop it.

317
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,220
We've been sisters for so many years.

318
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,220
It's not worth to hurt each other for such a small thing.

319
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,220
We're her sisters.

320
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,220
She doesn't think so.

321
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,220
She's been looking at us for so many years.

322
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,220
Has she ever seen who's in our eyes?

323
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,220
You're so mean.

324
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,220
You...

325
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,220
What do you mean?

326
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,220
You're the most arrogant girl.

327
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,220
You're always chasing after her.

328
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,220
You don't understand anything.

329
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,220
Today, she planned it in advance.

330
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,220
The sisterhood between people is like a knife between two sides.

331
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,220
Ms. Liu, you're really a good woman.

332
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,220
Who's that?

333
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,220
You should be the one to teach me a lesson about our sisterhood!

334
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,220
It's not my turn to teach you about sisterhood.

335
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,220
But I think that...

336
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,220
...to be friends with others is to be a good friend.

337
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,220
She's here to see you today.

338
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,220
She's here to see you today.

339
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,220
Even if you don't like each other,

340
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,660
you shouldn't treat her as if you're a friend.

341
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,660
You shouldn't treat her as if you're a friend.

342
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,660
I understand.

343
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,660
There's another one who's here to help her.

344
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,660
One side is a prince,

345
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,660
and the other side is a person who's pretending to be a ghost.

346
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,660
Song Yi Qing is really capable.

347
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,660
She can seduce anyone.

348
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,660
Are you okay?

349
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,100
Who are you?

350
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,100
I'm just a stranger who has no way to find peace.

351
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
You...

352
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,100
You hit me well, you hit me well, you hit me well.

353
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,100
Hero, do you want to come in and have a cup of tea?

354
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
Let's have a talk.

355
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,100
Why is the hero still here?

356
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
I just pass by.

357
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,800
The whole capital is far away from you.

358
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
Why do you pass by here?

359
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Just pass by.

360
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Why do you still have to interfere with my affairs?

361
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
I just pass by here.

362
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Why do you still have to interfere with my affairs?

363
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
I just pass by here.

364
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Why do you still have to interfere with my affairs?

365
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Anyway, Xiang Jing Chu,

366
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,960
It's reasonable to say a few words to protect you.

367
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,440
Moreover, it's really too much for them to talk about you behind your back.

368
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,560
I'm talking about His Highness the Eighteenth.

369
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,160
You taught him what he said, right?

370
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,320
You know me very well, but you deliberately angered me and pushed me away.

371
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,560
Why?

372
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,840
It's two different things to understand you and to like you.

373
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,560
You're the most special and beautiful girl I've ever met.

374
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,480
Even if I don't like you, you're still worth being appreciated and treated kindly.

375
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,400
You're lying!

376
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,240
You said that you'd be a good friend and that you'd be a good friend.

377
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,600
Then, Li Shiliu, please tell me honestly.

378
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,000
Have you ever fallen in love with me?

379
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,680
If there's a lie, it'll be a big blow.

380
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,680
I...

381
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,800
Li Shiliu has never fallen in love with you.

382
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,520
Say it again.

383
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,360
No matter how many times I say it, it's the same.

384
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,600
Li Shiliu has never fallen in love with you.

385
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,720
That's why you pushed me away from His Highness the Eighteenth

386
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,960
and let him come to me when I was forced by you?

387
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,840
You're wrong.

388
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,640
I just think that I've hurt you.

389
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,840
If someone who truly loves you is by your side, you'll feel better.

390
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,640
Don't lie to yourself!

391
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,440
You just want to make yourself feel better.

392
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,640
In your eyes, I'm just a doctor and a jewel.

393
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,040
Even if you don't like me, why would you push me away?

394
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,240
I never thought that way.

395
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,440
Li Shiliu, I'm sorry.

396
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,040
I'm sorry.

397
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,840
I'm sorry.

398
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,840
Li Shiliu, you're a good person.

399
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,840
But you don't deserve it.

400
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,440
You're trying to teach someone else how to love and how to hate.

401
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,840
But you don't understand anything.

402
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,040
You teach others to treat other people with love.

403
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,240
But you never really care.

404
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,640
I liked you because I thought that you were different from other people.

405
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,640
But I won't like you anymore.

406
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,640
It's because you're more despicable than others.

407
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,640
I'm sorry.

408
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,240
No need.

409
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,040
Tomorrow at noon, at the Purple Golden Pavilion outside the city.

410
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,840
I'll return what you want.

411
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,640
I'll also ask the hero to return my painting.

412
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,240
I'll also take it back and don't ruin my things.

413
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,640
They...

414
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,840
They're a couple?

415
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,240
What about Gu? What does Gu mean?

416
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,440
He took the small copy of Hero Li's painting and confessed to Wei Guo.

417
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,840
Nonsense!

418
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,440
Li Shiliu must have done it on purpose.

419
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,040
So that I can help him.

420
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,440
Gu is so proud and wronged.

421
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:54,040
Wait and see. I must prove to TianTian that Li Shiliu is not a good person.

422
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,840
Ye?

423
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,040
Did I say Ye?

424
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,240
Ye?

425
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:37,020
You

426
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,840
Meng Er.

427
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,480
You'd better tell me

428
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,200
what's going on.

429
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
Whose portrait is it?

430
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,760
What do you mean?

431
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,160
What's wrong with Song Yuting?

432
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,480
Meng Er.

433
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,800
There are some things

434
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,480
I didn't dare to make you worry.

435
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,720
But I don't know what happened to Ting recently.

436
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,120
She likes someone else.

437
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,400
She didn't listen to her mother

438
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,880
and married the 18th prince.

439
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,920
The whole family was in a mess.

440
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,480
Oh no.

441
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,000
She has fallen in love with him.

442
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,400
Father, don't worry.

443
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,920
I'll take care of this matter

444
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,840
till the end.

445
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,040
Boss.

446
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,440
Miss Song is here.

447
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,040
Why do you come to me today?

448
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,880
Hero Li.

449
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,720
You really have to help me this time.

450
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,240
Please.

451
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,320
Tell me.

452
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,480
Who is that man?

453
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,720
I...

454
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,560
I really don't know.

455
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,520
Fine.

456
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
If he doesn't tell me,

457
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,440
I won't spare this bitch.

458
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,480
Beat him.

459
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,840
Stop it.

460
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,920
Stop it.

461
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Mother.

462
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,120
Stop it.

463
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,280
Mother, what are you doing?

464
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,680
Why do you ask me?

465
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,920
I want to ask you what are you doing.

466
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,520
I heard from the gatekeeper that

467
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,720
you are always in a mess

468
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,520
just to go out and meet with men.

469
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,920
I raised you up

470
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,560
just to let you be self-reliant

471
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,440
and date with those scum?

472
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,840
I'm not a scum

473
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,280
and I'm not a scum.

474
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,880
Self-reliant?

475
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,160
How can you say something

476
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,920
that is not reasonable?

477
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,520
You want to make me angry?

478
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,920
What is reasonable?

479
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,960
You dress up to be a scum

480
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,080
and go to those scum

481
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,480
and act like a scum?

482
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,280
If you were the Eighteenth Prince today,

483
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,440
even if you were a concubine,

484
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,920
you would burn incense

485
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,560
in front of your ancestors

486
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,480
and let everyone in the whole capital know it.

487
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,040
You want to make me angry?

488
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,320
You know

489
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,520
if this thing

490
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,880
really gets out,

491
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,120
your reputation

492
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,800
will be ruined.

493
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,240
Your reputation will be ruined

494
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,360
and you will be abandoned.

495
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,280
Shao Nan, let's go.

496
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,960
Impossible.

497
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,280
It's impossible.

498
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,760
I know.

499
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,000
It sounds ridiculous.

500
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,040
But the thing that I had a big fight with you last time

501
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,280
happened the same thing.

502
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,920
Nan Heng is going to kill Song Yi Tian.

503
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,520
Hero Li, you really have to help me.

504
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,200
Or A Tian will be dead.

505
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,840
You should tell me the evidence.

506
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,680
From what I know,

507
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,920
Nan Heng will never have anything to do with Song Yi Tian.

508
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,360
Anyway,

509
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,680
it must be a misunderstanding.

510
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,400
What misunderstanding?

511
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,600
In the world of men and women,

512
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,880
do you know how much I know?

513
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,560
I...

514
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,080
I...

515
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,000
I...

516
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,160
Hero Li,

517
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,680
stop arguing with me.

518
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,840
A man looks at a woman

519
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,160
for a reason.

520
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,720
I can tell it at a glance.

521
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,040
For example, Nan Heng looks at A Tian

522
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,400
for a reason.

523
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,720
Hero Li, if you look at me,

524
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,240
it must be a sisterly relationship.

525
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,160
You...

526
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,080
You...

527
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,440
What are you doing?

528
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
So...

529
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,400
You were kissing me just now.

530
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,560
You still don't believe me?

531
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,000
So,

532
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,000
if you don't believe me,

533
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,840
then listen.

534
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,840
Do you believe it

535
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,880
that I will ask for your hand

536
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,200
to pay your fee?

537
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,600
If you don't believe me,

538
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,040
then move on.

539
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,680
If you don't believe me,

540
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,280
then move on.

541
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,320
If you don't believe me,

542
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,920
then move on.

543
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,600
If you don't believe me,

544
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,320
then move on.

545
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,480
Then what should I do with you now?

546
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,480
I will never be tired of you

547
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
Now you believe it?

548
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,480
So I don't want to hear any more sister words from you

549
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,480
Didn't you say you know more about love than I do?

550
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Then you say, you and I are like this now

551
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
What is it?

552
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Three

553
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
She is not a sister

554
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,480
She is not a sister

555
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,480
But, how can someone wear a mask to kiss?

556
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,480
Boss, you are good

557
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,480
You really cleaned it up

558
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
If you have the ability, take off the mask and kiss

559
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
Kiss

560
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
What? Are you drinking alone?

561
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
I am drinking alone

562
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,480
Hu has told me about these days

563
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,480
What? Blame me for messing up the work again

564
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
Come on

565
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
You are touched

566
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,480
I was still laughing at you a few days ago

567
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,480
Saying that Song Yi Meng is your soul-dead

568
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
The wind and water turn

569
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
It's only a few days

570
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Now you are the one who watches the show

571
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,480
And I am the one who acts

572
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,480
Your little shit is not worth my effort to see

573
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,480
But the problem is that you like her

574
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
So you chase her back

575
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
What are you worried about?

576
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
And then?

577
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,480
Do I pretend to be her?

578
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,480
Or one day my identity will be exposed

579
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
And the whole Cang Jiang Yue

580
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
And she will be all involved?

581
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Don't overestimate yourself, okay?

582
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,480
I need you to consider Cang Jiang Yue

583
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,480
Yes

584
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,480
I have no right to overestimate myself

585
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,480
I didn't forget

586
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,480
You and I were originally a deal

587
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
I am sorry

588
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,480
That's right

589
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
Do you remember me three years ago?

590
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,480
Three years ago

591
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,480
The famous hero of Jiangnan, Shang Guan Bai He

592
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
The hero of Bai He

593
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
In half a month

594
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,480
Ten robberies have been committed

595
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Two thousand black armor troops

596
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
In three states and six cities

597
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
Didn't catch you

598
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,480
But later you were still betrayed by your friends

599
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,480
Only exposed the whereabouts

600
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,480
The person Bai He was wrong

601
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
The mountain is filled with clouds

602
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,480
It's hard to escape again

603
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,480
Only

604
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Cut off the wings to survive

605
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
You blame me

606
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Blame me for cutting off your clothes

607
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,480
Tied you up in this small Cang Jiang Yue

608
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
Correct

609
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,480
I hate you for being the seventh prince

610
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Let me beg for death

611
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
The criminal record has been issued

612
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,480
Declared to be executed

613
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,480
Will be executed tomorrow

614
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Seven days

615
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
Seven days

616
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,480
You come every day

617
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,480
Can you give this person a day of silence?

618
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
If I were you

619
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,480
I will try to survive

620
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,480
Go see for two thousand gold

621
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Can hurt the blood of your partner

622
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
What color is it?

623
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,480
The person you hurt your partner with your mouth

624
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
Is the enemy

625
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
Friend

626
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,480
Your enemy framed you

627
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
Sell ​​you and take away your wealth

628
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,480
You still treat him as a friend

629
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
You are not willing to die

630
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
Like you

631
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Born noble

632
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,480
What kind of days did he and we live in the past?

633
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
You won't understand

634
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,480
The fruit of the horse is the knife and the blood of the tiger

635
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,480
Give the back to the partner

636
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,480
I believe what you said before

637
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Will not be as difficult as this

638
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,480
I

639
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,480
Who are you

640
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,480
Who am I doesn't matter

641
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,480
What matters is that your life is still there

642
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
If people are alive

643
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,480
Should cherish the morning and evening of every day

644
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
If no friends, don't

645
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
If the road is gone, the mountain is not clear

646
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
If no friends, don't

647
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,480
If the road is gone, the mountain is not clear

648
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
But if the life is gone

649
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
That's the end

650
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,480
To the tiger

651
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
Good to the dog friend

652
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480
Heart like a stone

653
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,480
Heartless

654
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
Dirty

655
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,480
But I didn't expect

656
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
You will be trapped by love

657
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
The upper grain is not right, the lower grain is crooked

658
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,480
In terms of being trapped by love

659
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,480
The boss is the one in the middle

660
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,480
I'm not one of you

661
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,480
That's the key

662
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,480
I didn't put my lover in someone else's arms

663
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
Not to mention the girl

664
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
Not to mention the girl

665
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,480
I don't like men at all

666
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,480
You still think you are a man

667
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,480
Ah Hu is a broken mouth

668
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
What to say

669
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,480
What does it have to do with Ah Hu?

670
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,480
Blame yourself

671
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,480
Not only messed up

672
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,480
Also hurt the girl's heart

673
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,480
I am a prisoner who should have died

674
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,480
There is no way to fall in love with the girl

675
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,480
Boss, do you understand?

676
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,480
It doesn't matter if I understand

677
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,480
What matters is that Song Yi heard her understand

678
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,480
It doesn't matter if she understands

679
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,480
Because what she likes is not the real me

680
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
Then you tell her

681
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
What are you really like under the mask

682
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,480
What if Song Yi Meng knows

683
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
What do you really feel under the mask

684
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,480
What does she feel

685
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
I

686
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,480
You see

687
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,480
Li Shiliu's clothes are really harmful

688
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,480
All your feelings now

689
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
It's all because of Song Yi Ting

690
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
Then why don't you ask her out

691
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,480
Tell her what you think in your heart

692
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,480
So there will be no regrets in the future

693
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,480
What if i don't want to go

694
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,480
Don't want to go

695
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,480
Then your Shangguan Baihe will be trapped in his heart

696
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,480
Only Shangguan left

697
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,480
Tomorrow noon

698
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,480
Li Shiliu's clothes

699
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,480
Let me wear it again

700
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,480
That's right

701
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,480
Come tomorrow

702
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,480
You cut the fish into the moon

703
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,480
And there is no new rice

704
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
Bring it back with me

705
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,480
Did you hear

706
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
The horse is successful

707
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
I'm going to the market

708
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,480
I'm going to the market

709
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,480
I'm going to the market

710
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
I'm sorry

711
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,480
I'm so careless

712
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
This is what the wife found

713
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,480
Not important

714
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,480
Anyway, he won't be with me

715
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,480
He would rather push me to others

716
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,480
I don't want to say anything

717
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,480
In his eyes

718
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,480
I am nothing

719
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Since you have seen so clearly

720
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,480
Then you don't have any other choices

721
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,640
Now you understand.

722
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,520
Why do you like him?

723
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,120
I know what I'm doing.

724
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,120
I don't need others to explain.

725
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,760
If you're here to help your parents,

726
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,840
please go back.

727
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,520
Song Yiting.

728
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,160
You're always the most thoughtful.

729
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,280
Why do you like someone like him?

730
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,000
Who is he?

731
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,680
He's thoughtful and secretive.

732
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,600
Do you know how many dirty secrets he has?

733
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,920
He's thoughtful and secretive.

734
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,960
But Ruo Fei has been suffering from life

735
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,160
and he wants to survive.

736
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,600
Why does he do that?

737
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,760
Fine.

738
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,520
You don't have to mind that.

739
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,920
But do you know he's trying to get close to you?

740
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,000
Of course I know.

741
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,560
Ruo Fei won't agree to meet me

742
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,760
for what he wants.

743
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,920
You know it.

744
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,480
Why are you still trying to get close to him?

745
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,720
I believe that

746
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,480
he's trying to kill or save someone.

747
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,360
I believe that.

748
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,840
I won't be wrong.

749
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,080
Save?

750
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,920
Don't be fooled by his nonsense.

751
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,280
The mask of Sikai

752
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,320
is a total devil.

753
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,640
Who is not a mask?

754
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,720
In the capital,

755
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,920
there are many people who follow the fame and power.

756
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,560
Who will reveal their true face

757
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,080
in front of others?

758
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,680
It's him.

759
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,920
He's so self-righteous.

760
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,560
He's so ungrateful.

761
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,400
I don't understand.

762
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,920
I'm begging you, okay?

763
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,760
Don't be with him.

764
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,360
In this world,

765
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,000
you can fall in love with anyone.

766
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,480
But only him.

767
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,640
Why can't it be him?

768
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,960
Just because he's not Prince 18,

769
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,320
he's not worth being loved?

770
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,560
That's not what I mean.

771
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,120
Then why did you persuade me?

772
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,120
Why do you think you can interfere with my life?

773
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,360
Song Yiting.

774
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,280
I don't know

775
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,120
how to explain this to you.

776
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,040
But please believe me.

777
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,720
It's really dangerous

778
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,280
to be with him.

779
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,000
I'm going to sleep.

780
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,880
You go back.

781
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,080
Song Yiting.

782
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,240
You will die.

783
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,720
Cousin.

784
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,600
Cousin.

785
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,680
Cousin.

786
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,560
Cousin.

787
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,960
Something happened.

788
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,320
Something big.

789
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,280
Don't worry, Your Highness.

790
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:31,880
Take your time.

791
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,600
No.

792
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,760
I saw Tingting and Li Shiliu yesterday.

793
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,720
They were together.

794
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,640
And they seem to be close.

795
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,680
So I sent someone to investigate

796
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,360
Li Shiliu who is hiding behind the curtain.

797
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,640
I've checked him.

798
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,840
He's clean.

799
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,720
No weirdos.

800
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,320
Yeah.

801
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,680
I just found it.

802
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,880
But I'm not happy.

803
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,960
So I checked the people around him.

804
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,360
Guess what I found.

805
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,080
He...

806
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,680
Come on.

807
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,840
Come on.

808
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,240
There's a man called Shangguan He.

809
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,880
He's the fourth ball of the peach fish.

810
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,720
Search carefully.

811
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,480
Yes.

812
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,640
Search.

813
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,440
Yes.

814
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,840
Who dares?

815
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,640
General Chu is so angry this morning.

816
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,760
You brought me here.

817
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,320
What do you want?

818
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,880
I'm not here to trouble you.

819
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,960
But for him.

820
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,760
May I ask why you are here?

821
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,040
I'm here to see you.

822
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,440
I'm here to see you.

823
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,840
I'm here to see you.

824
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,040
I'm here to see you.

825
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,240
I'm here to see you.

826
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,440
What do you want?

827
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,240
Three years ago,

828
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,360
the hero Bai He from the south of the river

829
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,600
committed a serious crime and escaped before death.

830
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,800
Do you want me to say more?

831
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,040
Rong Hua.

832
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,360
Wait.

833
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,280
Although I'm a bunch of street thieves,

834
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,040
I can't take him away

835
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,640
with your words.

836
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,520
Li Shiliu.

837
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,960
You can't stop the investigation of the Jinzhao Mansion.

838
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,400
So what?

839
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,840
If I don't turn myself in today,

840
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,160
you can't take anyone away.

841
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,440
What if I have to take him away today?

842
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,680
You can try.

843
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,400
I'm here to see you.

844
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,600
I'm here to see you.

845
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
