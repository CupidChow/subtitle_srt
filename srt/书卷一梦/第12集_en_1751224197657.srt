2018 Slina

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sword is heavy.

4
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the deep roots of the enemy.

5
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

6
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,200
It's better to be a man than to be a man.

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,200
I am a hero.

8
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,600
I am a hero.

9
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,600
I am a hero.

10
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,600
I am a hero.

11
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,600
No need to wait.

12
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,600
No need to hate.

13
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,600
Write your own script.

14
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,600
For all the broken wishes.

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,200
I will be a hero forever.

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,600
The storm of Yangxi.

17
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,600
I will not run away from it.

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,600
I will not regret my youth.

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,800
I will be a man in the future.

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,600
For this life and for all the lives.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I will give my all.

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600

00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
A Dream of Book and Paper

26
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Episode 2

27
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
You are a famous hero

28
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
You have been involved in the court several times

29
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
What is your plan?

30
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,600
What do you think I have in mind?

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
I don't know.

32
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,600
But if Meng Er is your purpose.

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,600
I advise you to give up this idea.

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
You are a young general of Qianyu army.

35
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
You always think about these things.

36
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
No wonder Miss Song knows you well.

37
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,600
How can I let others know about me and Meng Er?

38
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,600
I don't care about your business.

39
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
But I remind you.

40
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Miss Song is most concerned about

41
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
the repair of the South City.

42
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
To solve the problem of the people.

43
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
So you pretend to be a hero.

44
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Come here to repair the city.

45
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Dealing with Nan Heng and the assassination.

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,600
You are all deceiving Meng Er.

47
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
So that's what you think.

48
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
How about this?

49
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
I make a bet with you.

50
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,600
It's better than anyone who repairs the city.

51
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
But if you lose, you will be divorced.

52
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
You are so childish.

53
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
I am a good man.

54
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Why should I bet with you?

55
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,600
With 61 houses in the South City.

56
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
347 refugees.

57
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Although the court doesn't give us money.

58
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600
But to finish the repair before the spring.

59
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Money and people are not enough.

60
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
So you need our help.

61
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Otherwise, Nan Heng will be in trouble.

62
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
How should you deal with it?

63
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
I can let you participate in the repair.

64
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
But I hope you understand.

65
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
This repair is about the people's livelihood.

66
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Not the tricks in the world.

67
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
If I find you are hiding something.

68
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,600
This time, it's not easy to make a bet.

69
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,600
And no matter what happens.

70
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,600
I won't bet with Meng Er's marriage.

71
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Miss Song, don't move.

72
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Don't move.

73
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,600
You scared me with this thing.

74
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Your master threatened me with the debt.

75
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
You also do this.

76
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
We have a CP line.

77
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
You are blind.

78
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Miss Song.

79
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
I just...

80
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
I beg you.

81
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
I have a hard time getting this job.

82
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Tell me.

83
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
What does this mean?

84
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
I beg you.

85
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
You are all workers.

86
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
It's not easy for you.

87
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Go back and tell your master.

88
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Ask him to ask me.

89
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Don't make it difficult for you.

90
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Miss Song.

91
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
I was blinded by the oil.

92
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
I don't know you are kind.

93
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Tell me.

94
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Who is the master of this thing?

95
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
But the money.

96
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
No.

97
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
No money.

98
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
I told your master.

99
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
I did the assassination.

100
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
It has nothing to do with others.

101
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
It's not a assassination.

102
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
It's a fire.

103
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
What's the complicated and complicated?

104
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
Tell me.

105
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Tell me.

106
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Tell me.

107
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
It's a coincidence.

108
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
It's a plot.

109
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
I didn't lie to you.

110
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Really.

111
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
I understand.

112
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
The relationship is not in place.

113
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Can't tell the secret.

114
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Well.

115
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
I can go to the girl's boat

116
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
as long as I scold the Seventh Prince.

117
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Listen.

118
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Seventh Prince.

119
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
He killed Zhongliang.

120
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Seventh Prince.

121
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
He is ruthless.

122
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Seventh Prince.

123
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
He is a fool.

124
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Seventh Prince.

125
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
He...

126
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
Isn't this the rich man around Nan Heng?

127
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Let's have a meal first.

128
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Master Li.

129
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Master Li.

130
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
People around Nan Heng are so cunning.

131
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
You leave here first.

132
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,600
Don't get involved with them.

133
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Go back and shut your mouth.

134
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Don't tell Nan Heng

135
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
you've seen him here.

136
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Otherwise, I'll tell him

137
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
all the words you just scolded the Seventh Prince.

138
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Everyone dies together.

139
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Don't think about the good.

140
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Round one.

141
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Good.

142
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Good.

143
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Good.

144
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Good.

145
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Take it.

146
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Round two.

147
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Good.

148
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Good.

149
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Come on.

150
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
K.O.

151
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Good.

152
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Good.

153
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Good.

154
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Good.

155
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Good.

156
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Good.

157
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Good.

158
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Good.

159
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Master Li.

160
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Master Li.

161
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
I asked Shangguan to go back.

162
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
I saw him wash his hands

163
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
after doing his job.

164
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
His hands were about to be washed away.

165
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
So I asked him to leave.

166
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Okay.

167
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Thank you.

168
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
What's wrong with you?

169
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Are you in a bad mood?

170
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Chu Yue Hong bullied you?

171
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
He bullied me?

172
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Am I that weak in your heart?

173
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
You have to protect me

174
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
when you deal with Nan Heng.

175
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
You have to protect me

176
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
when you deal with Chu Yue Hong.

177
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Even that rich man

178
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
you still have to protect me.

179
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
I...

180
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Although you're a hero,

181
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
you're just a supporting role.

182
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
People like me

183
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
who have the leading role

184
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
shouldn't be so arrogant.

185
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
The leading role?

186
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
What do you mean?

187
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
It's...

188
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
It's this.

189
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
This.

190
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Okay.

191
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
You have it too.

192
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Thank you, everyone.

193
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Thank you.

194
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Come on.

195
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Let's eat.

196
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Thank you, everyone.

197
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Be careful.

198
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Thank you.

199
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Come on.

200
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Let's eat.

201
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Come on.

202
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
You eat.

203
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Okay.

204
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Look at the people of Nan City.

205
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
In this world,

206
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
they may not have a complete life.

207
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
The fire that day

208
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
was really burning.

209
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
If it weren't for you,

210
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
they might have died like this.

211
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
And the leading role like Nan Heng

212
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
only cares about the latest plan

213
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
and doesn't care about the lives of the people.

214
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
He only wants to fight for power with Nan Ruo

215
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
and let the people do everything.

216
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Even their lives.

217
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Is it fair?

218
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
So this is the reason

219
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
why you hate Nan Heng.

220
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Because he's the leading role?

221
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
I often hear you

222
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
mention the words of leading role.

223
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
But I don't know what it means.

224
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
I want to change everything for you.

225
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
I also want to help you deal with Nan Heng.

226
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
But I can't even understand

227
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
what you say.

228
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
So Miss Sun,

229
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
can you tell me?

230
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
I...

231
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
I...

232
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
I...

233
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
I understand.

234
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
When the relationship is still shallow,

235
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
many secrets can't be told.

236
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
It seems that Miss Sun

237
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
still doesn't believe me.

238
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
No, Hero Li.

239
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I believe you.

240
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
But

241
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
if I really tell you everything,

242
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
you will be afraid of me.

243
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Hero Li,

244
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
you are the most important friend

245
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
in my world.

246
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
You are the only one who understands me

247
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
and trusts me.

248
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Maybe...

249
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Maybe you can

250
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
change my fate.

251
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
So

252
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
I really can't lose you.

253
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
I dare not lose you.

254
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Just let me keep this secret.

255
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
The only secret.

256
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Can you?

257
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Okay.

258
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Big brother,

259
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
thank you for building a house for us.

260
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Let's eat.

261
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Okay, thank you.

262
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Did you wash your hands?

263
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Thank you, kid.

264
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
What's your name?

265
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
I don't have a name.

266
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Impossible.

267
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Grandma said

268
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
we live in Nan City.

269
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
I don't know your name.

270
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
I don't know your name.

271
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,600
We live in Nan City.

272
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
We are all lower-class people.

273
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,600
We don't need a name.

274
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
If you don't have a name,

275
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
how can you enter the government?

276
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Kid,

277
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
tell me,

278
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
what's your father's name?

279
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
My father's name is Lu Renjia.

280
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Lu Renjia?

281
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Lu...

282
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
Big brother,

283
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
I want to ask you

284
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
what's your name?

285
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
My name is Lu Renyi.

286
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Lu Renyi?

287
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Why?

288
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
What do you mean why?

289
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Don't you have your own name?

290
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Lu Renyi is my name.

291
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
You're crazy.

292
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
I...

293
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
What's wrong?

294
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Nothing.

295
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
So these people

296
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
don't have their own names.

297
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
It's the first time I know

298
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
there are so many

299
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
low-class people in the capital.

300
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
There are so many people

301
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
who are called low-class people.

302
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
They all have a good name.

303
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Kid,

304
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,600
since your father's name is Lu Ren,

305
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
from now on,

306
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
you can be called Lu Renbing,

307
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
okay?

308
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Thank you, big brother.

309
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Come on, eat the cake.

310
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Eat it.

311
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
Renbing.

312
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
It seems that

313
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
nothing can escape

314
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
this fake script world.

315
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
So handsome.

316
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Master Li is really extraordinary.

317
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Miss, it's him.

318
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
It's him.

319
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
Two days ago,

320
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
didn't you help

321
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
General Chu to talk?

322
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Now he's changed.

323
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,600
I've never seen the world before.

324
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
I think the only man

325
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
in the world who can help General Chu is the best.

326
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
Now he listens to stories every day.

327
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
He thinks that Master Li

328
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
is better than General Chu.

329
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
You two are like

330
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:16,440
chasing the

331
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,600
What are you talking about?

332
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Besides,

333
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,600
the break-up story is still early.

334
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Now,

335
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
as long as I can

336
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
escape from Nan Heng's trap safely,

337
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
I'll be able to get rid of the evil spirits.

338
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Miss,

339
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,600
please tell us more.

340
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Stop it.

341
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
But from what I know about Nan Heng,

342
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
he's just a wolf-like man.

343
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
He's cruel and ruthless.

344
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
He's cruel and ruthless.

345
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
He does everything he wants

346
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
to frame and fight against women.

347
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Do you understand?

348
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
He's a man who kills people without looking.

349
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
He's done a lot of bad things

350
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
over the years.

351
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Nan Heng is a sinister person.

352
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
But a hero like Nan Heng

353
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
only cares about his own plans

354
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
and doesn't care about the lives of the people.

355
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
I'm sorry.

356
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
I'm sorry.

357
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
I'm sorry.

358
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
I'm sorry.

359
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Anyway,

360
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
it's not a good thing.

361
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Fugui,

362
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
come in.

363
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Your Highness.

364
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Let me ask you.

365
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Do you think

366
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
I'm a man who only cares about his own plans

367
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
and doesn't care about the lives of the people?

368
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
What do you mean by wild?

369
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
No, no.

370
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
How is that possible?

371
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Our Highness is kind,

372
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
and is kind-hearted.

373
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
He's a gentleman

374
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
and a hero.

375
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
No, do you believe it yourself?

376
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
I...

377
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
You don't believe it.

378
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Of course, he won't believe it.

379
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
He?

380
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Come with me to the Song Mansion tomorrow.

381
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
I have something to ask him.

382
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
Yes.

383
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Twenty-five, ten, six, three, seven...

384
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Ten, six, seven, eight...

385
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Recently, the materials are short-lived.

386
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
To ensure the public period,

387
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
we have to save some money.

388
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
You two remember,

389
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
everything here

390
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
has to be divided into good parts.

391
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Lightly lighten it once a day.

392
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
If there are short-lived materials,

393
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
it will be put on the list in time.

394
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
This way, it's not easy to make mistakes.

395
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Miss, you're so good.

396
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Hero Li.

397
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
He has done so much for the people.

398
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
I have to do something, too.

399
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Right?

400
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Why are you here?

401
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Is this the attitude you should have

402
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
when you don't pursue your killer,

403
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:28,180
your

404
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,600
Your Highness, pay attention to the gentlemanly manner.

405
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
I have something to tell Miss Song.

406
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
You two go out.

407
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Your Highness,

408
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,600
he... he...

409
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
He's not here.

410
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
He's not here.

411
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Your Highness,

412
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
he... he...

413
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
They don't know anything.

414
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Don't scare them.

415
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Besides,

416
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
if there's anything,

417
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
you can't say it in front of them.

418
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
You have to talk to me alone.

419
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Miss Song,

420
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
what you mean is

421
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
the warehouse is boring.

422
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
I want you two to go out and take a breath.

423
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Ladies, please.

424
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
It's really a bit boring here.

425
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
It's not as good as going out.

426
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
What are you doing?

427
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
The first question.

428
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
In your heart,

429
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
what kind of person am I?

430
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
You're a good person.

431
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
I want you to tell the truth.

432
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Why isn't this telling the truth?

433
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Although you said that you wanted to kill me,

434
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
you finally let me go.

435
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
In this kind of drama,

436
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
there's a unique feeling of being in the heart.

437
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Why isn't it a good person?

438
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Okay.

439
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Then the second question.

440
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
What is the main character?

441
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
What is the main character?

442
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
What is the script?

443
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Everyone is asking this question.

444
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
No, I'm really a bit bored.

445
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
I really have to go out.

446
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
I want to go to the star house.

447
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
I've checked all the warehouses in Wenyuan Pavilion.

448
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
I've also asked all the scholars of Hanlin Academy.

449
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
No one knows about this.

450
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
I just said it casually.

451
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Your Highness, you're the same.

452
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Why are you taking these things?

453
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Just say it.

454
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
One can do.

455
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
But what about two times?

456
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
What about three times?

457
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
What about four times?

458
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
What about five times?

459
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
You said that I was the main character.

460
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Today you said that I was the main character.

461
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
You also said that I was the script mechanism.

462
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
What do these mean?

463
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
What do these mean?

464
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
I...

465
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Did I say it?

466
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Song Yunmeng.

467
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
I beg you to tell me.

468
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
What are you hiding from me?

469
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Your Highness.

470
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Do you have any qualities?

471
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
How can you be so rude to a girl?

472
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,600
Okay, I'll tell you today.

473
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
Top-class flow is top-class flow.

474
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
The script is the basis.

475
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
You're always rude to people.

476
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
You haven't even learned the script.

477
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Do you understand?

478
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Do you understand?

479
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
You don't understand.

480
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Not only don't you understand,

481
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
you also kill people like horses.

482
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
You kill innocent people.

483
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
You don't want to know

484
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
what the real script is about.

485
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
You just think I know more than you do.

486
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
You think I hide everything from you.

487
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
You want to control everyone.

488
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,600
But you don't believe anyone.

489
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Am I right?

490
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Your Highness.

491
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
I'm a P.O.A.

492
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
I'm a P.O.A.

493
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
Okay.

494
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
You're right.

495
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
I was rude to you before.

496
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
But I'll tell you.

497
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Except for this,

498
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
I never kill innocent people.

499
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
I don't believe anyone.

500
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
That's because no one has ever believed me.

501
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Even you.

502
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
You have to know

503
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,600
that the world is not what you think it is.

504
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
People's words may not be the truth.

505
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
On the battlefield,

506
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
I'll be the king if you die.

507
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
On the court,

508
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
it will only be more dangerous than the border.

509
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
If I don't fight for my life,

510
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
I'll be the one who is forced to die.

511
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
So

512
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
if

513
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,600
you really want to know me,

514
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
don't use your eyes.

515
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Who wants to know you?

516
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Everyone in the hunting

517
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,600
is a craftsman who makes weapons in the martial arts world.

518
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Our boss has invited you from two different places.

519
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,600
It took days, but there was no progress.

520
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
I'm sorry.

521
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
I'm sorry.

522
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
I'm sorry.

523
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
It's hard for me to explain.

524
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
Mr. Shangguan,

525
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
it's not that we're not good at it.

526
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,600
The knife you want was broken by the metal.

527
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
Now the metal mine in the world

528
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
is in the royal family's possession.

529
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
To break a steel knife with an ordinary iron mine,

530
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
it's a waste of time.

531
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Yes.

532
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
So if I give you the metal,

533
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
you can break it?

534
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,600
Sir, you don't know.

535
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,600
This metal needs to be broken to become steel.

536
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
And the way to break it

537
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,600
is in the hands of King Qianyu.

538
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
When I was young,

539
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,600
I was lucky enough to be a master of a broken knife in the army.

540
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
Even if he worked in the army for decades,

541
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
he never got King Qianyu's formula.

542
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
So it's...

543
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
So you still can't break it?

544
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Guards, take them away.

545
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Go, go, go.

546
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
Go.

547
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
What should we do?

548
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
We have to start from King Qianyu.

549
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
You go to the south city

550
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
and tell the chief

551
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
that the big thing hasn't happened.

552
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
We have to find a way from Chu Guihong.

553
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
Yes.

554
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
Good.

555
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Good.

556
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Good.

557
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
General,

558
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
look at them.

559
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
Are they here to help

560
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
or to cause trouble?

561
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,600
They are here all day long.

562
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
They are obviously the Rourou Army.

563
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
They are their trouble.

564
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,600
We do our own thing.

565
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Only when we finish the work before the next month,

566
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
can we help His Majesty

567
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
and His Highness to solve the problem.

568
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
General,

569
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
these people from the Three-Range Ninth Battalion

570
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
are all from the Three-Range Ninth Battalion.

571
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
We can't compete with them in terms of speed.

572
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
By then,

573
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,600
you won't really get married to Miss Song, will you?

574
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
It's none of your business.

575
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
Do your own thing.

576
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
Give it to me.

577
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,600
Give it back to me.

578
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,600
The gauze has been removed.

579
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
The gauze is weak.

580
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,600
It's hard to find it from outside.

581
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Let's go.

582
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,600
Brother Ronghua,

583
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
if the general knows about this,

584
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
let him fight.

585
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
It's better than letting Miss Song,

586
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
who is so worried,

587
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
get the gauze back.

588
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
Didn't you notice that

589
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Miss Song has been coming to Nan City for three days?

590
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
Which time is it about our general?

591
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Which time?

592
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,600
It's about that gauze.

593
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Let me tell you.

594
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
If you are my brother,

595
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
fight with me.

596
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Second Master said...

597
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
I know.

598
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Go back and tell Shangguan He

599
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
not to act rashly.

600
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Yes.

601
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
The rope is broken.

602
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
The rope is broken.

603
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
Go.

604
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
The rope was moved by someone.

605
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
If you keep fighting, the gauze will be broken.

606
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Did you do it?

607
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,600
I don't know.

608
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,600
I don't know.

609
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
You were sneaky just now.

610
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
What are you trying to do?

611
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,600
The bad guys will report first.

612
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
You came to Nan City to make a plan.

613
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
If you don't tell me, I won't talk to you again.

614
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
You are full of good manners.

615
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
You are doing despicable things.

616
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,600
You shouldn't be the one to be kept.

617
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Go.

618
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
Go.

619
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
The medicine for falling and damage in the previous battle

620
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
has a special effect.

621
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Thank you.

622
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,600
I'll go to the hospital.

623
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Ordinary people think that this pill is for internal organs.

624
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
You know the way to put the medicine in Qianyu Army.

625
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,600
What's so strange about it?

626
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,600
This kind of medicine is available in the Black City.

627
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,600
The military's goods are left in the Black City.

628
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,600
The people under me also ignore my orders.

629
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,600
It's ridiculous to do this last night.

630
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
I'm sorry.

631
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
Wait.

632
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
Aren't you afraid of being poisoned?

633
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
I'm not afraid.

634
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,600
If I'm poisoned to death,

635
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,600
you will all die with me.

636
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
Wine?

637
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,600
What?

638
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Is it a crime to bring wine with you?

639
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Why are you talking in a strange way?

640
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,600
You are not getting any better.

641
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
If you didn't do this for the people,

642
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,600
you don't need to do this today.

643
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
I've misunderstood you before.

644
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,600
I think you are a good person for now.

645
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,600
I have to thank General Chu for trusting me for now.

646
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
Here it comes again.

647
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,600
The provincial government's business is that Qianyu Army is not good to you.

648
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,600
I owe you a favor.

649
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,600
What can I return?

650
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,600
Can you give me the cut-off knife?

651
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,600
It's a serious crime to be addicted to the cut-off knife.

652
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,600
The reason why you Qianyu Army's weapons are used is to protect the Great Jing.

653
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,600
But is the Great Jing only protected by you?

654
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,600
I'm thinking if this law is passed on to the military,

655
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,600
how many soldiers will die at the border?

656
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:44,600
Maybe many people will die in the battle of Pingrong.

657
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,600
I understand what you said.

658
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,600
But if this law is passed on to someone else,

659
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:03,600
how many people will die in the battle of Pingrong?

660
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,600
You mean Nan Heng, right?

661
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Anyway, he's not a good person.

662
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,600
You don't have to investigate the cut-off knife.

663
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
My father is dead.

664
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,600
There will be no more truth about this secret in the world.

665
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
I'm sorry.

666
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
Since we're talking about Nan Heng,

667
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,600
I have a few questions to ask you.

668
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,600
What's the question?

669
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,600
I took someone to investigate the cut-off knife in the first time I met you.

670
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,600
Why are you prepared?

671
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Did you get the news from Nan Heng in advance?

672
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
I don't need to rely on others.

673
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,600
We're all people in the world.

674
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,600
We're all thinking about the cut-off knife.

675
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Can you get this news?

676
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,600
You led the army of Qianyin to investigate the cut-off knife.

677
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
If I can't get the news in advance,

678
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,600
how can we survive?

679
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
OK.

680
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
Even if you're right,

681
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:21,600
we three discussed about assassinating Nan Heng together.

682
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,600
But why didn't you come that night?

683
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
OK.

684
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,600
I admit.

685
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
I'm afraid.

686
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,600
After you and Miss Sun were high-ranking officials,

687
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,600
I was a horse in the field.

688
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,600
The assassination of the prince and the cut-off knife was a headache.

689
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Can I not keep a little bit of a secret?

690
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
Don't forget.

691
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,600
If I didn't keep something,

692
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,600
you would be arrested by General Chu that day.

693
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,600
I see.

694
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,600
You still don't believe me.

695
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
But think about it.

696
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
I'm just a busy man.

697
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Why should I collude with the prince?

698
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,600
Not to mention that you don't believe me.

699
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,600
Can Nan Heng believe me?

700
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
Tell me.

701
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
Can you believe it?

702
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,600
I think you're born into a family of three.

703
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,600
You've never been through anything.

704
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,600
You've thought about everything too simply.

705
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
Yes.

706
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,600
A friend of mine once told me this.

707
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
He said I've been through everything.

708
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,600
I've thought about many things too simply.

709
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:10,600
But I didn't know that I was too slow and too strong.

710
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Little rabbit.

711
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,600
Did you fall?

712
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
What should I do?

713
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,600
This is a medicine for the damage.

714
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
It's high quality.

715
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Do you want it?

716
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,600
This is an external medicine.

717
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
You can't take it inside.

718
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
Put your hands up.

719
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,600
You're the prince of Gao family, right?

720
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600
My name is Chu Guihong.

721
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,600
I know that the palace doesn't allow you to ride a horse.

722
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,600
From now on, my horse is yours.

723
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,600
I won't ride your horse for nothing.

724
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,600
I'll tell you the secret formula.

725
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
Great.

726
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,600
I want to give it to my father.

727
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,600
So that all the soldiers of Qianli Army will use this magical medicine.

728
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
Your riding skills are really good.

729
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
Teach me.

730
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
No.

731
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,600
You call me big brother.

732
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
No.

733
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
I call you master.

734
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
No.

735
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
I'll give you the ice-snowing ice.

736
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Do you want it?

737
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
Come on.

738
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
Come on.

739
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Don't tell anyone that I taught you to ride a horse.

740
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
Am I not good at riding horses anymore?

741
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
It's okay to fall off a horse once.

742
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Those great generals who fought with all their might know the principle of good horse riders.

743
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,600
But I learned it too slowly.

744
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,600
You've been teaching me for almost half a month.

745
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
You've never tried.

746
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,600
You think too simple.

747
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,600
But you don't know that if you don't speed up, you'll be a strong horse.

748
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Speed up?

749
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
A strong horse?

750
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
Brother Li is right.

751
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,600
I've thought about many things.

752
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
Thank you for your kindness.

753
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
Brother Li.

754
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,600
No matter you and Nan Heng are colluding,

755
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,600
it won't end well if you get entangled with him.

756
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Remember.

757
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,600
The farther away you are from him, the better.

758
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,600
He has been medical personnel for three years,

759
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,600
but you've even got into his longer service.

760
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
Your plan didn't work.

761
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Please 45light has been awarding you a presidency just for this reason.

762
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,600
I'm about to lose.

763
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,600
Mr. Wu,

764
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,600
this bitch is really unusual and beautiful that she recorded this video for me.

765
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
This person may sit in peace after топscol,

766
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,700
let him sit.

767
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:26,340
Then one person may N прит explore nên to topscol it to find's dong things.

768
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,640
terrified.

769
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,580
You didn't pay attention to that.

770
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,600
Retreat!

771
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
Retreat!

772
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Retreat!

773
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
Retreat!

774
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,600
Retreat!

775
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
Retreat!

776
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,600
The End

777
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,600
Rui Er is so humble

778
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,600
She doesn't want to kill

779
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,600
That's great

780
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,600
That's great

781
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,600
The End

782
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,600
The end

783
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
The end

784
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,600
The end

785
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,600
The end

786
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,600
Thank you, Your Majesty

787
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,600
You killed too many people

788
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,600
You killed too many people

789
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,600
Ridiculous

790
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,600
Ridiculous

791
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,600
Father

792
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,600
Rui Er

793
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,600
Let's go over there

794
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,600
Let's go over there

795
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,600
Rui Er

796
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,600
Father

797
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,600
Father

798
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,600
Today when we return to the palace

799
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,600
Let's have a sleep together

800
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,600
Let's go

801
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,600
Come

802
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,600
Come

803
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,600
What are you doing?

804
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,600
This expression is right

805
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,600
When I was your age

806
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
I was always with my father and brother

807
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,600
I went out to travel

808
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,600
I was so happy

809
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,600
If you have too much trouble

810
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,600
You will get old

811
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,600
Once you get old

812
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,600
You will never be able to go back to your youth

813
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,600
Your Majesty is right

814
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,600
At this age, you are still so childish

815
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,600
He didn't go to see you

816
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,600
He was fighting with Gao Xiang

817
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,600
Eat

818
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,600
Eat

819
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,600
Mother will take you to hunt a bigger night map

820
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,600
Also make a warm scarf for your mother

821
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,600
This is not the way to my palace

822
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,600
Mother brought me here

823
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,600
Come to catch wild rabbits

824
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,600
Bullshit

825
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,600
Do you want to eat or not

826
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,600
I will starve you to death

827
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,600
Come out

828
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,600
Come out

829
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,600
Come out

830
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,600
Come out

831
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,600
Come out

832
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,600
Come out

833
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,600
Come out

834
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,600
Come out

835
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,600
I will starve you to death

836
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,600
Come out

837
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,600
Leave

838
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,600
Yes

839
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,600
Open the door

840
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,600
Where is the thing I gave you

841
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,600
Give it back to me

842
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,600
Give it back to me

843
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,600
Burn it

844
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,600
Wait

845
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,600
Your aunt is not my Han Xi

846
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,600
Do you believe it

847
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,600
You and Chu Kui Hong

848
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,600
Have such a past

849
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,600
It's really a shame

850
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,600
I am sorry

851
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,600
I am sorry

852
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:41,600
Those who take me to the heart

853
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,600
All are evil

854
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,600
Can't be left behind

855
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,600
Didn't you two just rebuild it?

856
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,600
What's there to be repaired

857
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,600
Even if it's a moment of confusion

858
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,600
In the end, the action is still lost

859
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,600
And the emperor

860
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,600
No teacher, no guest

861
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,600
No more reminding

862
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,600
There must be a king in the two sides

863
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,600
If I don't win

864
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,600
Then only die

865
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:39,600
The city is surrounded by so many cold mist

866
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:48,600
You and I are destined to be entangled in the wrong

867
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,600
The wind blows gently in the ear

868
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,600
The black night's prayer

869
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,600
The black night's prayer

870
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,600
The eyes are so confused

871
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:11,600
Why is the day so strange

872
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,600
Although the wind is so strong

873
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,600
The wind blows gently in the ear

874
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:21,600
The wind blows gently in the ear

875
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,600
The wind blows gently in the ear

876
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,600
The wind blows gently in the ear

877
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,600
The wind blows gently in the ear

878
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,600
The wind blows gently in the ear

879
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,600
The wind blows gently in the ear

880
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,600
The wind blows gently in the ear

881
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,600
The wind blows gently in the ear

882
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,600
The wind blows gently in the ear

883
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,600
The wind blows gently in the ear

884
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,600
The wind blows gently in the ear

885
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,600
The wind blows gently in the ear

886
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,600
The wind blows gently in the ear

887
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,600
The wind blows gently in the ear

888
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,600
The wind blows gently in the ear

889
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,600
Alas!

890
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,600
The above is the general procedure

891
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,600
The above is the general procedure

892
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,600
The above is the general procedure

893
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,600
signaling the future

894
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,600
signaling the future

895
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:28,600
How can love and hate be hidden in the past that is so hard to erase?

896
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,600
How can I let go of the past that is so hard to wake up from?

897
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:37,600
Why is a life that is destined to be a dream come true?

898
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,200
If I have to hear your voice, how can I thank you for ending it?

899
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:49,600
Please stay by my side and let us part.
