1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sword is heavy.

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the deep roots of the enemy.

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,800
It's not as good as the dust.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am willing to be a beast.

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
I am willing to be a beast.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
A heart is not a sword.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
The four seas are in harmony.

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
No need to wait. No need to hate.

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Write a poem for myself.

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
I will follow all the wishes.

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,800
I will write a poem with my love.

13
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,800
I will follow all the wishes.

14
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
I will follow all the wishes.

15
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
I will follow all the wishes.

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,800
I will follow all the wishes.

17
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,800
For this life and for all the people.

18
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,800
I will do whatever I can.

19
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,800
I heard Miss Song has an engagement with the Chu family.

20
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Why is it with me?

21
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
So delicate.

22
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
I'm sorry. I almost forgot that you are an ancient person.

23
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Episode 16

24
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Gu Mingming has not made a plan.

25
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,800
But Song Yi Meng has said so much.

26
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Does he and Chu Hui Hong want to create chaos and bring back the country?

27
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,800
To create a good opportunity for Chu Hui Hong.

28
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Hero Li, think about it.

29
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Nan Heng has done so many bad things in the past.

30
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,800
If you are afraid of his identity as a prince.

31
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
If you are afraid of the chaos.

32
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
I can let Chu Hui Hong join us.

33
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,800
The three of us together.

34
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Let's do it together.

35
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
No need. You and Chu Hui Hong.

36
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,800
One is the daughter of the gods.

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
The other is the favorite weapon of the emperor.

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,800
And me.

39
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
I'm not worth mentioning.

40
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
I'm not good at it.

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
I'm not good at it.

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Hero, don't worry.

43
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
I'm the only one responsible for anything.

44
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
I've said it.

45
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
If you mention the importance of love.

46
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Chu Hui Hong will definitely be the one to do it.

47
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Don't trust me so much.

48
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
I doubt that he and Li Shiliu are good friends.

49
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
He is too insincere.

50
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Chu Hui Hong is my fiance.

51
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
As long as Hero Li is willing to join us.

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
And cooperate with us.

53
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Then he will definitely protect you.

54
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Chu Hui Hong will protect me thoroughly.

55
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Why do you trust her so much?

56
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Because I know her.

57
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
And she is the same as me.

58
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
She hates Nan Heng.

59
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,800
We will never allow anyone to die in Nan Heng's hands.

60
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Also the one person who Gen Man poder warrior doesn't hurt.

61
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,800
So he has to arrange the adjutant group a meeting forheavy smartest like Min Zan.

62
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
And hi what will tu do for tea.

63
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Hmmm.

64
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
看到 correctly.

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Power...

66
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Better left than third oldest Type Cultivate.

67
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Dangerous dial,

68
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Rare invitation,

69
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Dangerous scene,

70
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
But this is not the point.

71
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
The point is

72
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
the late empress, Chu Yurou,

73
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
died in that

74
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
assassination

75
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
related to Nan Heng.

76
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
This is not the way to the palace.

77
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Kill the emperor.

78
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
But the regret

79
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
is the love

80
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Chu Hui Hong's aunt

81
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
was also the person

82
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
she loved the most after her mother died.

83
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
She didn't want anyone

84
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
to die in front of her.

85
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
For this belief,

86
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
she started to learn martial arts.

87
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
She didn't stop

88
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
for a day.

89
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Ye Huang, for many years,

90
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
she guarded thousands of people at the border.

91
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
She suffered many injuries.

92
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
She saw many people's blood.

93
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
She was in the line of life and death.

94
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
At the age of eight,

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
she made a vow

96
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
in front of the empress's memorial.

97
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
She wanted to learn martial arts.

98
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
She wanted to use all her power

99
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
to make herself stronger.

100
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Because only in this way

101
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
can she protect anyone she wants to protect.

102
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
So that she can prevent those innocent lives

103
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
from falling in front of her.

104
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
But Nan Heng is different.

105
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Get in!

106
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
After she killed the empress,

107
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
she didn't reflect.

108
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
She became a

109
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
evil and cruel person.

110
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
She killed innocent people.

111
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
In her eyes,

112
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Jiaguo Da Yi is like a piece of soil.

113
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
She even killed her uncle

114
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
for the sake of the upper line.

115
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
General Chu is on the side of the country.

116
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,800
But the world is being harmed by the evil.

117
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,800
It's unforgivable to betray the enemy and the country.

118
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
It's time to kill.

119
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
What?

120
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Hero Li,

121
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
although you and Chu Guihong are of different backgrounds,

122
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I can see

123
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
that you two

124
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
are equally loyal

125
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
and equally righteous.

126
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
I know that

127
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
you treat A'Long and A'Hu like brothers.

128
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
You treat those innocent people

129
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
as your own brothers.

130
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
How can he be wronged?

131
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Even his favorite aunt and his father

132
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
are far away from him.

133
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
All the 20,000 people

134
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,800
are his real brothers.

135
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
All these things

136
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
are not just a simple

137
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
four-word report.

138
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
They are nothing.

139
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
He wants to do everything he can

140
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
to pay for his life.

141
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Hero Li,

142
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
isn't it worth your trust?

143
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Enough!

144
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
Hero Li,

145
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
did I say something wrong?

146
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
So in your heart,

147
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
you are also a soldier.

148
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Nan Heng is a murderer.

149
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Chu Guihong is a savior.

150
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
You are also a martial artist.

151
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Nan Heng is selfish.

152
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Chu Guihong is for the sake of the country.

153
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
I...

154
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Miss Song,

155
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
you are not a good partner.

156
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Why?

157
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Because you are trapped by your love.

158
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Hero Li, I'm not trapped by my love.

159
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
I'm not a love brain.

160
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Chu Guihong

161
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
is not worth my life

162
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
to play with you.

163
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Hero Li, what's wrong with you?

164
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
I really need you now.

165
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Oh my god!

166
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Why are there two Hero Li?

167
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Hero Li?

168
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
Why are there two bosses?

169
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Which one is real?

170
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
This one.

171
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
This one.

172
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
That one.

173
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Which one is real? I can't tell.

174
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Hu!

175
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Which one is real?

176
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
We can't tell.

177
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Oh my god!

178
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
How can we tell?

179
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Which one is real?

180
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Of course.

181
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
He is a good martial artist.

182
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Which one is good?

183
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Hu!

184
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
What if my cousin gets caught?

185
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Young general is not good at martial arts.

186
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Don't worry.

187
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Wait!

188
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
I am here.

189
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Chu Guihong

190
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
is not worth my life.

191
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Why are there two heroes?

192
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
I won't tell.

193
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
These two are not real.

194
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Which one is real?

195
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
Hu!

196
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
Which one is real?

197
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
This one.

198
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
This one.

199
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
This one.

200
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
This one.

201
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,000
Don't kill me!

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,400
Uncle!

203
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,460
We are almost there!

204
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,620
Are you sure you want to race run?

205
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,080
No, we are not going to race run.

206
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,020
Now let's have a race.

207
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,060
and then exchange splashes with the world twisted

208
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,700
and like grilled Doom of the deceased

209
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,200
The badog is eating book

210
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,660
It will be eaten by the shrimps

211
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,920
Besides, turn it to blow Navy

212
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,560
Don't let that evil spirit eat the counselor

213
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,600
I thought Ye You Shen was a group of

214
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,880
Black Gang members hiding in the capital

215
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,280
So he dressed up as Hero Li

216
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,280
What does Black Gang mean

217
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Want to find out

218
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,680
Is the meaning of our black clothes

219
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,680
The matter is such a matter

220
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,040
Miss Su

221
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,440
This big old Su

222
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,440
It's our old man who took their army's military line

223
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Who are you talking about

224
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,320
You are framed again

225
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,040
You put your mouth clean for me

226
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,800
Why is there a theft of military lines?

227
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,920
I don't know

228
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,000
what

229
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,320
I understand

230
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,680
I understand, I understand

231
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,320
General Chu just told me

232
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,080
I explained it clearly

233
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,680
Stealing military lines

234
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,720
It's also a beautiful misunderstanding

235
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,360
Miss Su

236
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,160
I saw it

237
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,240
She didn't say anything at all

238
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,120
You shut up

239
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,960
Girls are here to communicate

240
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,000
What do you know

241
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,800
OK

242
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,800
Misunderstanding has been solved

243
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,840
Why don't you draw a dry song and make a jade

244
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,880
Shake a little hand and make a friend

245
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,920
Brothers, shake your hands and make a friend

246
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,560
You are here

247
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,960
You are in the middle of the crowd

248
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,920
You have to line up

249
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,360
You hurry up and show your attitude

250
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,280
Don't let me end it

251
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,160
Let everyone end it

252
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,480
Hurry up, hurry up

253
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,840
I'm so embarrassed

254
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,880
Hero Li

255
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,960
Otherwise, you show your attitude first

256
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
I'm sorry

257
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
I'm sorry

258
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
I'm sorry

259
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
I'm sorry

260
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,280
Can you show your attitude first

261
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,640
You show your attitude first

262
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,840
Don't let me end it

263
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,840
You see now everyone in the big wild

264
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,800
All eyes on me

265
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,200
I'm really embarrassed

266
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,360
I'm so embarrassed

267
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,720
I'm so embarrassed

268
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,320
OK

269
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,840
You just show your attitude first, OK?

270
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
So annoying

271
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
You don't know they are so rude

272
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,600
Hurry up and go with me

273
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,960
Annoying

274
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
Finger

275
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,580
BL invit

276
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,400
Bring it on

277
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,920
Quick

278
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,520
Quickly

279
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,560
Let's go

280
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,840
Can we go to the front

281
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,000
Me, two people

282
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,600
I didn't say I wanted to work with him.

283
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,440
Yes.

284
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,400
You're so reckless and ungrateful.

285
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,480
You disturbed Night God without reason today.

286
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,240
Shouldn't you apologize to me?

287
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,920
If you want me to apologize,

288
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,040
at least you should let me know who you are.

289
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,400
Why should I tell you?

290
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,920
Fine.

291
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,600
Hero, take off your mask.

292
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,400
Show him your sincerity.

293
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,600
I'm injured on my face.

294
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I can't see you.

295
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,120
You heard that.

296
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,760
He has his own reasons.

297
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,560
Nan Heng is in the hall today.

298
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,680
If you want to go with me,

299
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,960
you made a scene at the Moon River

300
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,920
to prove that Nan Heng and I have a relationship.

301
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,040
Hero, you can't be a member of Nan Heng.

302
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,800
You scolded him with me two days ago.

303
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,200
Then please go with me to see Nan Heng

304
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
and prove yourself.

305
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,680
Why should I go with you?

306
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,800
Besides, Nan Heng is a prince.

307
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,600
It's endless to offend a prince.

308
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
It's endless to fight with him.

309
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,240
You're right.

310
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,520
It's a fight between a man and a woman.

311
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,600
Just give me a chance.

312
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,920
You still don't want to prove yourself.

313
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,040
Are you trying to make me

314
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,600
take you back to the Jinzhao Mansion?

315
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,520
Think about it.

316
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,160
Enough. Stop it.

317
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,360
Stop it, okay?

318
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,120
I'll say it again.

319
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,640
We gathered here today

320
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,960
to fight against Nan Heng.

321
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,800
We didn't ask you two to fight.

322
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,680
You...

323
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,200
You came to the Moon River to make trouble.

324
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,000
Even the hero didn't bother you.

325
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,160
You still have this face.

326
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,280
You're so good at it.

327
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,240
And you, hero.

328
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,080
The master of the Moon River,

329
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,280
the boss of the Night God.

330
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,280
You're amazing.

331
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,000
Okay.

332
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,480
Since you two are so good,

333
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,680
Nan Heng is in the temple today.

334
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,280
Why don't you two go to him?

335
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,240
Why are you so mean to me?

336
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,200
Just say it.

337
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,920
Can we talk about this cooperation today?

338
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,360
Okay.

339
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,840
You don't want to join me, right?

340
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,120
I'll go by myself.

341
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,840
Mo.

342
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,840
Mo trusts him.

343
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,320
I trust him.

344
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
Hero Li said a lot of nonsense today.

345
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,160
But there's one thing he said right.

346
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,160
Chu Guihong is indeed incompetent.

347
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,920
He can't afford to let Mo trust me so much.

348
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,800
Since he can do this for me,

349
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,400
I'll report it to him.

350
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,240
Nan Heng is still in the temple tonight.

351
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,280
I'll go and drag him out.

352
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,280
So,

353
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,600
this cooperation is a success.

354
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,560
Boss.

355
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,400
Boss.

356
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,240
Boss.

357
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,560
A guest wants to see you.

358
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,800
You should go and have a look.

359
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,040
Miss Sun.

360
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,360
I have something to do.

361
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,360
You can go ahead.

362
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,320
Go ahead, hero.

363
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,280
Go ahead.

364
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,280
It's great.

365
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:54,880
Hurry up.

366
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,840
Chu Guihong has gone.

367
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,200
Hurry up.

368
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,280
Be gentle.

369
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,440
Why are you so fierce?

370
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,520
You're the only one who has a temper.

371
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,800
Hurry up.

372
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,040
After the matter is over,

373
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,240
take a break.

374
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,120
After the matter is over,

375
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,200
I'm still looking for you to settle accounts.

376
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,960
I care about you.

377
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,600
You still...

378
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,720
Fine.

379
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,760
You should have withdrawn me earlier.

380
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,480
What kind of boss are you?

381
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,560
I don't want to work anymore.

382
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,640
If you keep nagging me,

383
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,840
I'll make you the big boss.

384
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,440
Hurry up.

385
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,240
Take off your clothes.

386
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,200
Cousin.

387
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,720
You want to work with Li Shiliu.

388
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,120
Why did you change your mind?

389
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,560
I didn't change my mind.

390
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,560
I still suspect Li Shiliu

391
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,920
has colluded with Nan Heng.

392
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,400
Then you promised Song Yimeng.

393
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
This trick of mine

394
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,400
is called the trick of the snake coming out of the hole.

395
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,080
The snake coming out of the hole?

396
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,200
Who is the snake?

397
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,320
Song Yimeng?

398
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,120
The beautiful snake?

399
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,160
Don't ask anymore.

400
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,560
Why can't I ask?

401
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,960
With your performance today,

402
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,960
the less you know,

403
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,480
the safer we are.

404
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,360
Your guest is here.

405
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,520
General Chu, you've worked hard.

406
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,840
You came back to Wenbo.

407
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,680
Are you going to

408
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,480
vote for my 18th brother?

409
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,400
His Highness is a kind person.

410
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,080
He has the power of heaven.

411
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,560
No need for others to vote for him.

412
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,720
General Chu's words are so arrogant

413
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
that he doesn't know how to be ashamed.

414
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,480
I think your face

415
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,040
is better than that mask.

416
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,160
Nan Heng.

417
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,840
Three guests.

418
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,280
The food is ready.

419
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,120
Please enjoy.

420
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,840
Sit down.

421
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,600
Just have a meal.

422
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,400
If you're so afraid of me,

423
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,840
then leave.

424
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,120
Don't spoil my mood.

425
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,680
I want...

426
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,560
This delicious dish

427
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,880
is so wonderful.

428
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,280
Wow.

429
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,280
I didn't expect this canbright TVs

430
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,440
are more tasty than restaurant-style food.

431
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,320
Is the meal comfortable?

432
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,720
The three dried fruits, three fresh fruits, three secret keys, three tea points are ready.

433
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,240
I'll bring them to you now.

434
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
General Chu,

435
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,840
since you're in the west, why don't you know how to eat?

436
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,320
The tiger and the wolf are in the west.

437
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,360
They know nothing about food and they know nothing about the west.

438
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,760
You're in the same boat with the tiger and the wolf.

439
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,080
I also think so.

440
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,160
You're pretending to be Li Shiliu,

441
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,000
just to test him,

442
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,680
to see if you have any collusion with him.

443
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,320
So what?

444
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:28,600
Chief Di,

445
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:34,720
who are you?

446
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
Sorry, sorry.

447
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,720
You're so stupid. How can you do this?

448
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Get out of here!

449
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
Yes.

450
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
Three guests,

451
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,720
calm down.

452
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,720
I'll get a new plate.

453
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
No need.

454
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
The wine house is too small.

455
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,720
I don't have much time to think.

456
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
Goodbye.

457
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,720
Observe with자.

458
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
What about Linyuan?

459
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,720
Not into my nest?

460
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Eh?

461
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,720
You...

462
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,720
Not into the nest?

463
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,720
Never better not to go into my nest then!

464
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,720
하세요 ?

465
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,720
This way please.

466
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,720
Gang sorry, this way please.

467
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
This way!

468
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,440
teacher.

469
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,320
Who is so clumsy today?

470
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,800
He checked again!

471
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,400
Let me.

472
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,560
I'm hungry.

473
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,080
By the way, Mr. Shangguan,

474
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,480
where's your boss?

475
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Why hasn't he come yet?

476
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,400
Chief,

477
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,320
Miss Song is waiting for you.

478
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,440
She's even playing flute.

479
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,640
Isn't it just a meal?

480
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,520
Why is she so exaggerated?

481
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,320
It's not enough to make a show.

482
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,560
I'm sorry.

483
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,320
I'm sorry.

484
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,160
I'm sorry.

485
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,040
I'm sorry.

486
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,920
I'm sorry.

487
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:30,460
You

488
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:55,680
The

489
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,040
I don't like you.

490
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,080
So I came to find you.

491
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,280
You're welcome.

492
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,280
Meng.

493
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,920
Why are you here?

494
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,280
Didn't you go to find Nan Heng?

495
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,080
Nan Heng left.

496
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,600
Meng, it's late.

497
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Let me send you back.

498
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,120
I just had lunch.

499
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,200
I haven't eaten yet.

500
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,600
Mr. Song is waiting for you at home.

501
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,360
Hurry up.

502
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,080
But...

503
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,920
Hero Li, let's talk later.

504
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
I'll go home first.

505
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,840
Wait a minute.

506
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,920
Did you see the princess?

507
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
Fu Guer.

508
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,960
I didn't say anything.

509
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,000
How old are you?

510
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Why are you playing with mud?

511
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,760
I'm not playing with mud.

512
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,920
I don't know which bitch

513
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,920
threw the flowers on my head.

514
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
You're so stupid.

515
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
I'm not a fool.

516
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,240
You're not a fool.

517
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,440
I just want to see you.

518
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
I'm not a fool.

519
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
I'm not a fool.

520
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,440
I'm not a fool.

521
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,440
You're not a fool.

522
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,440
It's not a fool.

523
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,440
You're not a fool.

524
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,440
You're not a fool.

525
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,440
I'm not a fool.

526
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,440
You're not a fool.

527
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
Did you see it?

528
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,040
I don't need to ask you.

529
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,440
Your Highness.

530
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,440
Your Highness.

531
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,440
What did you say?

532
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,440
Shangyuan Lantern Festival.

533
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,440
Your Highness.

534
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,840
His Majesty is going to unite with 18th Prince

535
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
and announce it at the morning of tomorrow.

536
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,440
He's going to recommend

537
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
Lord Chu Guihong

538
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,440
to lead the Shangyuan Lantern Festival.

539
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,440
This is the plan

540
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,440
His Majesty is going to appoint Chu Guihong

541
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,440
to lead the defense of the capital and the palace.

542
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,440
Your Highness.

543
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
Your Highness.

544
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,440
Your Highness.

545
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,060
Prince of Wencheng

546
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,440
I have a suggestion

547
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,440
for Your Majesty and in particular.

548
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:18,100
Please allow me to

549
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,300
lead the defense of the capital in order to

550
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,440
address with an organized and planned plan.

551
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,440
It's really Shangyuan Lantern Festival.

552
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,000
If they are defeated, they will run away in panic

553
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,720
and lose their lives.

554
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,560
Your Highness.

555
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,480
Your Highness.

556
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,840
If the ceremony goes well,

557
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,840
Chu Guihong's reputation in the folk

558
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,600
will be highly praised.

559
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,240
If His Majesty proposes him step by step,

560
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,680
and let the thief lead the army to fight,

561
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,960
and make some achievements,

562
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,560
18th Prince will be like a tiger in the sky,

563
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,920
be a dragon in the water,

564
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,440
and be a strong hand to fight against himself.

565
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
Then,

566
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,000
the world will be a great country,

567
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,440
and the land will be hard to reach.

568
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,000
It will be hard to reach the sky.

569
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Enough. I know.

570
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,600
I...

571
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,560
Without my order,

572
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,400
no one is allowed to act rashly.

573
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,280
Yes.

574
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,600
Actually, I want to say

575
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,600
whether you are willing to participate in the court affairs

576
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,600
or not.

577
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,160
Thank you for saving my life last time.

578
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,400
Many pardon programs have been offered for six years.

579
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,960
If there are no restrictions,

580
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,160
it is confirmed that

581
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,080
the king to WILL led the Gu Изäh in this year's Summer Court.

582
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,820
Why don't you explain, uncle?

583
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,320
Wootho is at theенти radiate

584
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:41,800
and are praying passing the featured

585
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,600
still under the sword of the righteous and righteous

586
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,200
Now the battlefield is not over yet

587
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,200
The border is still in the middle of the river

588
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,600
If this person is the one to take this big responsibility

589
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,800
He will be angry with the heaven

590
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,200
Hope the emperor can take back his order

591
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,400
Hope the emperor can take back his order

592
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Hope the emperor can take back his order

593
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,800
Success or disappointments

594
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,800
How long will the emperor protect the land

595
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
How long will the emperor protect the land

596
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,100
discredit

597
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,100
discredit

598
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,100
discredit

599
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,540
mask

600
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,640
Who is this

601
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,140
Qinglu

602
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,000
Whoever М

603
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,520
to disaround others.

604
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,080
Report this order.

605
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,800
Obeying Chu Guihong,

606
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,280
please cancel The Lantern Show at Shangyuan.

607
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,800
The blanks of Procurator Prison are

608
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,880
distorted and black and white.

609
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,080
What aht cinema they are!

610
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,860
Obeying Chu Guihong shall beب

611
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,040
demBlack dominates.

612
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
It's over.

613
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,760
But isn't Yao Qian

614
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,080
from Nan Heng?

615
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,000
So there's no such thing in the script.

616
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,960
The power of the hero can be wronged.

617
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,960
Is the plot really changing?

618
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,440
Will the ending be different?

619
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,760
His Majesty has decided to

620
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,200
weaken Nan Heng's power in the capital.

621
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,200
He has been trying to make things right for so long.

622
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,440
It's time for him to be in trouble.

623
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
It won't be long before

624
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,640
18th Prince can be just and just

625
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,160
be the crown prince.

626
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,280
Mu Er.

627
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,080
I've been busy with the war these years.

628
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,280
I neglected you.

629
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,680
I only found out yesterday

630
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,120
that you love me deeply.

631
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,200
Don't you like Jiangnan?

632
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,000
When the dust settles,

633
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,360
we can move there.

634
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,400
If...

635
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,120
If I give you a chance to stay away from the government,

636
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,800
will you let go of everything and leave?

637
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,760
Mu Er.

638
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
You know me.

639
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,080
Qian Yu Jun

640
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,080
is...

641
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,000
You said

642
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,800
you didn't want anyone around you to get hurt.

643
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,480
But if you're among them,

644
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,280
someone will get hurt.

645
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,640
Why are you saying that?

646
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,040
Yesterday, Hero Li asked me

647
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,680
how I think of Nan Heng.

648
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,400
I've been thinking

649
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,080
that he's

650
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,920
really cruel and merciless.

651
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,440
He's always been a devil.

652
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,480
But maybe

653
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,160
everything has changed.

654
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,320
Miss. Miss. Miss.

655
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,240
Mr. Chu.

656
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,880
Bad news. Something happened.

657
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,680
Rong Hua.

658
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:37,760
You...

659
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,680
Didn't you catch the bandits?

660
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,720
How did it turn out like this?

661
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:41,920
General.

662
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,440
The bandits

663
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,560
led us to the 10-mile-long

664
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,520
minefield outside the city.

665
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,600
Before we saw them,

666
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,160
they detonated the gunpowder

667
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,640
and hurt our brothers.

668
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,240
Which minefield?

669
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,920
The one in the west.

670
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,960
The place where Yao Qian was thrown away?

671
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,160
Yes.

672
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,920
Nan Heng is showing me mercy.

673
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,720
Mu He.

674
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,720
Do you still think

675
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,800
that you can get away with this?

676
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,520
This time,

677
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,320
we must think of another way

678
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,200
to stop him.

679
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,760
Please forgive me, Hero.

680
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,680
I'm just a small flower pot.

681
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,320
I really don't know anything.

682
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,480
Today, the imperial censorate was punished by the minister.

683
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,160
You're the one who was punished, right?

684
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,640
When someone instructed you to punish someone,

685
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,040
you should hit him in a very harsh way.

686
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,320
Although it's 20,

687
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,080
if you can beat someone up,

688
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,480
you'll get a reward.

689
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,720
Is that right?

690
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,240
I...

691
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,160
Speak up!

692
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,440
Who instructed you to do this?

693
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,320
What evidence do you have?

694
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,200
Something bad happened.

695
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,320
Miss Song is here.

696
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,920
Is your boss here?

697
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,600
Miss Song.

698
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,560
This way, please.

699
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,560
Hello.

700
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,400
This is the cleaning site.

701
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,040
Hu, destroy the evidence.

702
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:08,880
The rest,

703
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,120
delay the enemy.

704
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,080
Yes.

705
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,240
This way.

706
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,520
Are you okay?

707
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,760
Miss Song, there's another way.

708
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,680
Hurry up.

709
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,840
I won't show this back to you at my place.

710
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,920
Let's find a sabotage.

711
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,680
Sure, this way, please.

712
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,480
Let's standardise this.

713
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,720
Please move forward.

714
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,840
Turn left.

715
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,960
Don't worry about Tao Ye and Qing Cao.

716
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,640
I have something urgent to discuss with your boss.

717
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,000
What is it?

718
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,560
You have to tell me in private?

719
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,400
If you fail to succeed, you become a man.

720
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,400
If you fail,

721
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,200
you will be punished with bloodshed.

722
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,160
You will be severely punished.

723
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,320
Is it that serious?

724
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,480
Tell me.

725
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:31,920
Master,

726
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,360
do you dare to...

727
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,360
Come down a little.

728
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,080
Master, master.

729
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,560
Are they in love?

730
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,640
What are they talking about?

731
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,760
What can a man and a woman do together?

732
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,720
They must be talking about love and laughing.

733
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,680
Could it be about killing and setting fire?

734
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,520
Kill Nan Heng?

735
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,760
Me?

736
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,600
No.

737
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,680
I promised to deal with him.

738
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,320
You even asked me to kill him.

739
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,400
That's why I'm here to ask you.

740
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,040
How can I agree to it?

741
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,320
I will never agree to it.

742
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,560
If Miss Song wants to die,

743
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,240
you go by yourself.

744
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,000
Don't drag me down.

745
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,680
Master, stop.

746
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,840
You still say you don't like Miss Song.

747
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,320
You just stop when I say so.

748
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,480
Master Li,

749
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,240
didn't you ask me last time

750
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,880
why my surname is Chu Guihong

751
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,160
but not Nan Heng?

752
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,680
Master, do you know

753
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,160
he was exposed to the mine

754
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,320
and ambushed the Qianyu Army?

755
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,640
If there is a little bit of a dead body,

756
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,520
many innocent people will die.

757
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,160
If we don't stop him,

758
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,840
the consequences will be even worse.

759
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,360
What is the hidden mine?

760
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,240
Rong Hua saw it with his own eyes.

761
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,040
He also hurt a lot of Qianyu Army.

762
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,720
Have you verified it?

763
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,520
The motive,

764
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,480
means,

765
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,320
and the witness are all here.

766
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,000
How can we verify it?

767
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:02,880
I understand.

768
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,520
Everything

769
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,760
is done by Nan Heng

770
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,040
as long as it's wrong.

771
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,800
Even if the village woman in the east of the city

772
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,680
lost an egg,

773
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,120
it's also done by Nan Heng.

774
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,480
Cheng Xi

775
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,480
was drunk and fought with that official.

776
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,720
Nan Heng can't be taken away, right?

777
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,080
Who knows if it's true?

778
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,320
Cheng Xi and his house

779
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,880
are not far away.

780
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,480
Maybe Cheng Dong

781
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,280
will be able to find the right place

782
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,880
when he's free.

783
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,640
Maybe he will go there

784
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,080
when he's free.

785
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,880
Who knows what he does every day

786
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,360
to steal chickens and dogs

787
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,120
and do evil things?

788
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,240
Hero Li,

789
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,920
actually,

790
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,920
I was the same as you.

791
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,480
I always feel that

792
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,320
everything in front of me

793
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,160
is fake.

794
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,600
I just need to stop Nan Heng

795
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,520
and protect myself.

796
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,680
But until that night,

797
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,640
Wu Ji

798
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,160
almost died because of me.

799
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,080
You can't blame yourself for that.

800
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,960
But he really

801
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,920
almost died because of me.

802
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,840
Because I thought

803
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,080
I wanted to change the story

804
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,800
and change the world.

805
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,680
Wu Ji is like this.

806
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,560
Rong Hua and others are like this.

807
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,840
If I don't interfere

808
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,160
in the so-called story,

809
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,880
will it

810
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,440
not lead to such a consequence?

811
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,120
But since I've already

812
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,360
made my choice,

813
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,360
I can't just leave halfway.

814
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,480
Hero, maybe you can't understand

815
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
what I'm saying.

816
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,960
But I do want you

817
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,440
to understand my heart.

818
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,560
I can understand

819
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,840
your concerns.

820
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,040
Indeed, I'm selfish now.

821
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,000
I want to use you

822
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,080
to get rid of Nan Heng with me.

823
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,880
If...

824
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,240
If you really don't want to,

825
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,160
I'll report you.

826
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,000
I'll tell my father and Chu Gui Hong

827
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,280
all the criminal evidence

828
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,840
of your club and the business population.

829
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,360
I'll ruin all your efforts.

830
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,760
But that's an accident.

831
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,880
I don't care.

832
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,800
Anyway, the incident

833
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,400
happened in your Canjiang Yue.

834
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,760
Don't think about it.

835
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,080
No, you...

836
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,640
Why do you turn around

837
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,160
so fast?

838
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:35,080
When will the sun rise again?

839
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:39,640
Although the wind blows, the sandstorms break.

840
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:44,680
The unfulfilled wishes are all gone.

841
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,840
The flowers and rain are all gone.

842
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,120
If the dream is true,

843
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,920
how can the love and hate be hidden?

844
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,440
Although the wind blows, the sandstorms break.

845
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,400
The unfulfilled wishes are all gone.

846
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,680
If the day is not set,

847
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,880
how can the love and hate be hidden?

848
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:14,840
The love and hate are still here.

849
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,480
Although the wind blows, the sandstorms break.

850
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,200
The unfulfilled wishes are all gone.

851
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,400
The unfulfilled wishes are all gone.

852
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,880
The love and hate are still here.

853
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,640
The unfulfilled wishes are all gone.

854
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,240
The unfulfilled wishes are all gone.

855
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,840
I don't want to be the only one who's left.

856
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,320
If we meet again,

857
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,520
how can I thank you for the ending?

858
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:12,280
Please stay by my side.
