1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sword is heavy.

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the deep roots of the enemy.

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,200
It's better to be a man than to be a man.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am willing to be a beast.

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
I am willing to be a beast.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
A heart is not a sword.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
The four seas are in harmony.

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
No need to wait.

10
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
No need to hate.

11
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Write your own script.

12
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
For all that I have.

13
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,800
I will write my own script.

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
The wind blows.

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
I am not capable of running.

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
I don't regret my youth.

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,800
I will be a man for the rest of my life.

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,800
For this life and for all the lives.

19
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
I will sacrifice my life.

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
What kind of character will you encounter this summer?

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,800
A heart-to-heart blood.

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
A character full of sense of shame.

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
A character that finds the original self.

24
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
A character that is quiet.

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
A heart-to-heart heart.

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
A heart that flies.

27
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
A heart that gives you the joy of blood.

28
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
I invite you to watch the book.

29
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Big! Big! Small!

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Small!

31
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Amazing!

32
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,800
I didn't expect that there is such a world in the script world.

33
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,800
The people and things that I have never written are so interesting.

34
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
It's more exciting than what I wrote.

35
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I didn't say that, editor teacher.

36
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,800
The things you wrote are really not good.

37
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Look at the plot that our actor himself wrote.

38
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
It's much better than yours.

39
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
I didn't say that, editor teacher.

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,800
The things you wrote are really not good.

41
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Look at the plot that our actor himself wrote.

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
It's much better than yours.

43
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
It's much better than yours.

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,800
I say, why did you bring me here?

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,800
I want you to know what is a character that is quiet.

46
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
A character that is quiet?

47
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,800
I know that in your eyes, Nan Hong is a fraud.

48
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Including Jia Yi and Bing Ding on the street.

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
And the brothers of Cang Jiang Yue.

50
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,800
They are all some lowly people, right?

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,800
But in my eyes, they are all living people.

52
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
They are real every day.

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,800
They want to live in the present every day.

54
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,800
So I hope you can be generous.

55
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Let everyone live according to their own wishes.

56
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Okay?

57
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Song Xiao Yu?

58
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,800
You are determined not to go back with me, right?

59
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Yes.

60
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,800
If you force the plot to go back to the so-called right track.

61
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
It means that many people will die.

62
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Nan Heng and I will never stand aside.

63
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Mr. Yan Jun.

64
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Are you making some bad ideas again?

65
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Me?

66
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
What bad ideas can I make?

67
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
I'm just thinking.

68
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,800
How can I better adapt to this world?

69
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Shang Guan He! Come out!

70
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Oh no, the doctor is here.

71
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Don't blame me for being ungrateful.

72
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,800
It's because I'm too smart to treat the producer as a real person.

73
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Shang Guan He!

74
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
You little bastard!

75
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,800
What trick did you use to destroy my daughter and 18th Prince's marriage?

76
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
I'm telling you.

77
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,800
If you have any conscience, go to Song's Mansion with me.

78
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Tell Ting in front of A Ting.

79
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Tell her to give up on you.

80
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Marry me into the royal family.

81
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
I understand what you mean.

82
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,800
But I can't let anyone marry Ting Ting.

83
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
What?

84
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,800
You dare to tell me that you can't marry her?

85
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Are you going to marry A Ting?

86
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,800
If she's willing to marry, I'm willing to marry her.

87
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
What right do you have to marry my daughter?

88
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Yes, I thought so a few days ago.

89
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Song Yi Ting is indeed a woman who is very elegant and elegant.

90
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:11,900
How can I, a

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
woman, be able to marry her?

92
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
I'm not a woman.

93
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
I'm a woman.

94
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
I'm a woman.

95
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
I'm a woman.

96
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
I'm a woman.

97
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
I'm a woman.

98
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
I'm a woman.

99
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm a woman.

100
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
I'm a woman.

101
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
I'm a woman.

102
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
I'm a woman.

103
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
I'm a woman.

104
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
I'm a woman.

105
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
I'm a woman.

106
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
I'm a woman.

107
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
I'm a woman.

108
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
I'm a woman.

109
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
I'm a woman.

110
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
I'm a woman.

111
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
I'm a woman.

112
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
I'm a woman.

113
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
I'm a woman.

114
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
I'm a woman.

115
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I'm a woman.

116
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
I'm a woman.

117
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
I'm a woman.

118
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Lanshan,

119
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
I'm a woman?

120
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
She owes me one thousand years!

121
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Look at him.

122
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
He's worth a thousand years' worth of a wife.

123
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
This is a married man's debt.

124
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
This guy,

125
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
their love,

126
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
his love,

127
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
theirlatboxing.

128
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
He still wants me to be fire?

129
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,800
I always try my best to make him suffer.

130
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,800
How much pain can someone 92แบทt have in the reality of the world,

131
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
and such a complaints-ch townist like Xue Yi have?

132
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Wouldn't it be a losing that if you preordane Song Yi Ting D produkt fully?

133
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,000
But he hasn't fully recovered yet.

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,840
No.

135
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,960
The most serious injury of His Highness

136
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,680
didn't make him so weak.

137
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,320
How come he got better

138
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,160
after a few days?

139
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,240
It seems that

140
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,240
he was seriously injured

141
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,360
and got a serious injury.

142
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,440
But what's the cure?

143
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,960
I can only try some tonics

144
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,360
to get rid of the blood and then wait for the result.

145
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,880
Your Highness.

146
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,480
Your Highness, why are you here?

147
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,600
I'm going back to the capital.

148
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,400
I shouldn't have come here to discuss your family affairs.

149
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,000
Then please don't meddle in my affairs.

150
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,200
What you said

151
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,000
is not true.

152
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,280
No matter how not true it is,

153
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,080
it's our Song family's business.

154
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,080
It's not the time for outsiders to meddle.

155
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
It was your Song family's family affair before.

156
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
But now,

157
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,920
it's also my Chu family's affair.

158
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,480
Your Ladyship, don't you want to ask for

159
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,360
a family member who can take care of you?

160
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,880
Today,

161
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,680
I'll take Shangguan He as my son-in-law.

162
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,920
I'm from the Prince's Mansion.

163
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,160
I'm here to help him.

164
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,160
Your son-in-law?

165
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,920
That's great.

166
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,400
My father and the old prince

167
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,720
were good friends before.

168
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,960
Now, Ting and Chu He

169
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,920
are in love.

170
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,160
Isn't that great?

171
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,480
I'm not sure.

172
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,480
I'm not sure.

173
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,240
Your Ladyship,

174
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,400
your father will be happy to know it.

175
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,600
But, is that Chu He?

176
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,840
He sacrificed so much to get a wife.

177
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,600
A man should be a man.

178
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,400
He should be a man of his own.

179
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Mrs. Song,

180
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,840
didn't you say that

181
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,640
you didn't like him?

182
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,480
Now, you should be satisfied.

183
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,280
I...

184
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,360
I...

185
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,240
What are you doing?

186
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Call your father.

187
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,480
Well...

188
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,280
It's so sudden

189
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,600
that you have a father.

190
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
Don't hesitate.

191
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,080
Hu,

192
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,960
give me the pen.

193
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,000
It's better to be a man.

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,200
I'll sign the marriage contract

195
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,000
between the two families today.

196
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,800
You've done a good thing.

197
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,040
What does your father mean?

198
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,680
He's doing it for Nan Heng.

199
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,160
For Nan Heng?

200
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,080
What does it have to do with Nan Heng?

201
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,200
Is it possible that

202
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,000
your father wants to pull Shang Guan He and Song Jia

203
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,200
into the trap

204
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,400
and divorce Nan Heng?

205
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,640
It's your logic.

206
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,800
You're right.

207
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,600
I have my reasons.

208
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,320
I think Nan Heng

209
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,480
is close to the highland of the sick.

210
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,680
I...

211
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,200
ยกยญ

212
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,560
It's Shang Guan, Bai He.

213
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,320
After that, it's Shang Guan He.

214
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,040
Now

215
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,120
Shang Guan isn't available.

216
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,240
I mean Que

217
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,900
you're such a

218
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,400
Shut up.

219
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,960
Prince Qian Yu extent to be suspicious

220
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,600
pretty suspicious.

221
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,440
I'll go around.

222
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,800
There's no one around, Your Highness.

223
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,760
What's so mysterious?

224
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,960
You can't even listen to the rich?

225
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,480
Have you ever heard of

226
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,000
the Ju Ben incident?

227
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,520
It is said that

228
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,040

230
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
I said, Dad

231
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
What about Qing?

232
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,920
Of course I want to prove that she's in this world.

233
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,640
Of course I want to help you solve your big problem.

234
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,880
Dad, actually,

235
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,480
you like Shang Guan He, right?

236
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,320
And you don't want Qing to marry into the royal family.

237
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,560
Right?

238
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,640
I can't escape from your eyes.

239
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,080
Look.

240
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,360
The battle of the wild children in the family is finally over.

241
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,120
Let dad calm down.

242
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,240
Bao Yun Ge, I'm looking for you everywhere.

243
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,280
Madam,

244
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,240
the marriage is fixed.

245
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,360
Stop it.

246
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,840
No, I'm not.

247
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,640
Can you talk clearly?

248
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,120
Your baby daughter is making trouble.

249
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,560
She said she's not getting married.

250
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
What did she say?

251
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,960
She didn't listen to Chu He's sincere words.

252
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,640
She's not willing to entrust her life to him.

253
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,520
You're so mad at me.

254
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Wait.

255
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,800
Let me taste it again.

256
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,280
You said this painting is a perfect match.

257
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,680
We're both scholars.

258
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,840
When I first heard about this,

259
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,360
I reacted the same way as you.

260
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,160
This...

261
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,760
This is just like a fairy tale.

262
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
I know.

263
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,840
I can't accept all of this.

264
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,280
No, no, no.

265
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,920
I've been feeling strange for a long time.

266
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,080
How could there be such a handsome face in this world?

267
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,120
So you're a painting artist.

268
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,360
That explains everything.

269
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,000
What do you think of me?

270
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,680
What kind of ending do I have?

271
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,480
I'm sure I'm more attractive than a cold-faced prince like you.

272
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,680
You don't have an ending.

273
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,080
That means Shang Guan He is not in the original script.

274
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,680
How is that possible?

275
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,480
How did I come out?

276
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,800
I think it must be the birth of the script.

277
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,560
It comes and goes.

278
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,960
Comes and goes?

279
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,200
Yes.

280
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,200
Li Shiliu's identity

281
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,640
must be because of the variables in the process of the script.

282
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,480
Because there are too many variables, it can't be controlled.

283
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,280
That's why the script became the King of Qianyu.

284
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,120
Let me ask you.

285
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,800
Is Song Yiting in the script?

286
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,800
Yes.

287
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,600
Who did he marry in the end?

288
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,920
Prince 18th.

289
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,160
He married me.

290
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,400
Married you?

291
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,240
Don't worry.

292
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,840
I have no feelings for Song Yiting.

293
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
I'm telling you this

294
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,080
because I think the King of Qianyu is very perverted.

295
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,160
But it's strange.

296
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,680
According to the direction of the script,

297
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,120
he should try his best to cooperate with you and Song Yiting.

298
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,520
Why did he make a mistake in my marriage with him?

299
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,240
A wise man will never know what he is doing.

300
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,800
So we have to know

301
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,600
what he is going to do next.

302
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,760
Know yourself and know your enemy.

303
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
Fight for nothing.

304
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,080
But I don't think I should be the one to investigate.

305
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,880
I shouldn't be the one to investigate, right?

306
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,560
You've learned to answer after staying with Song Yiting for a long time.

307
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,920
Besides, now you are the King of Qianyu.

308
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,960
You are the most suitable one to investigate.

309
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,760
Why are some people who are both cheaters

310
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,480
able to do something good?

311
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,880
And some people

312
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,840
don't even have a place to resist.

313
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,760
I forgot to tell you.

314
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,520
I'm the leading man.

315
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,000
What is the leading man?

316
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,080
Isn't your destiny

317
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,040
controlled by the people who write the script?

318
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,960
Is it interesting?

319
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,320
A life that comes and goes like me.

320
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,720
That's interesting.

321
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,800
Wait.

322
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,680
Isn't that

323
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,240
the meaning of appearing in the sky and disappearing in the sky?

324
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,440
Will I disappear in the sky?

You don't understand.

350
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,960
I've been thinking about him for so long.

351
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,480
He never said anything.

352
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,200
I don't understand.

00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,840
I was also very surprised.

368
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,560
But after I ate eight steamed buns

369
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
and ran around the Crown Prince's mansion for ten rounds,

370
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,560
I suddenly realized that

371
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,840
besides the drawing book,

372
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,640
have I ever seen the real world?

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,840
I haven't seen it.

374
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,040
That means it doesn't exist.

375
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,520
Since it doesn't exist,

376
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,040
why can't I

377
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,080
treat this place as the real world?

378
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,960
I didn't expect you to think of these.

379
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,920
After all, I grew up with His Highness.

380
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,160
Unlike Shangguan He,

381
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,880
I don't know where it came from.

382
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,480
Why don't you tell Shangguan He

383
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,640
about your vomiting blood, Your Highness?

384
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,960
I'm afraid he'll be worried if I don't tell him.

385
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,480
You want to keep the secret from the Crown Princess?

386
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,800
That's right.

387
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,400
We must not let him know about this.

388
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,160
Since the King of Qianyu is so powerful,

389
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,640
if you go against him,

390
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,800
what will the result be, Your Highness?

391
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
I don't know yet.

392
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,800
But no matter what,

393
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,800
I must find a way to change the ending.

394
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
Because of the marriage, I promised her

395
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
to protect her for the rest of her life.

396
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Your Highness,

397
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,800
the same is true for a lowly person.

398
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
A lowly person is stupid,

399
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,800
but he doesn't have a brain.

400
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
If what you told Shangguan He

401
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
is not dangerous,

402
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
why didn't you tell me?

403
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Aren't you afraid that I

404
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,800
would expose your blood and blood relations

405
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
and affect the plan to wrong the King of the Clouds?

406
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
I have my own plans.

407
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Yes, you have plans all the time.

408
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
You have plans outside the Pass.

409
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
You have plans when you return to the court.

410
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
You have plans when you are wronged.

411
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
You have plans when you are in danger.

412
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Your Highness, I just want to ask you one question.

413
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
In your plan,

414
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,800
have you considered your own safety?

415
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
I will consider my own safety.

416
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,800
What safety?

417
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
If there is any script,

418
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
I will write it out

419
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
to protect you.

420
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
I know what you want to do.

421
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
I know it all.

422
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
If I say if

423
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
I want to know

424
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
that you are hurt like this,

425
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,800
I will definitely not listen to you.

426
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
I will kill Chu Guihong first.

427
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
Your Highness.

428
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
Enough.

429
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
I know your loyalty.

430
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Then you promise me

431
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
to put your own safety

432
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
into the plan.

433
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
Okay.

434
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
I still don't believe it.

435
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Unless you tell me

436
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
Zhou Mi's plan now,

437
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
I can be at ease.

438
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Don't go too far.

439
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
Okay.

440
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,800
Then when you go out for a meeting,

441
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
you take me with you.

442
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Your Highness.

443
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
You just remember.

444
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
The little people in the painting book

445
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,800
are written out

446
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
to be loyal to you.

447
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
Unlike Shangguan He,

448
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
who doesn't know when

449
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,800
he will go back and forth.

450
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
He will not let me go.

451
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Who will you order?

452
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
It should be me.

453
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
I know.

454
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
I know.

455
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
Nan Hong.

456
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Nan Hong.

457
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I smelled the medicine

458
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
on my way back home today.

459
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,800
Is your wound

460
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
still not healed?

461
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Come on.

462
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Turn around.

463
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Let me see.

464
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
No, no, no.

465
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
I'm fine.

466
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,800
I've been fine for a long time.

467
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
The doctor prescribed me

468
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
a few prescriptions.

469
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
I'm fine now.

470
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
Really?

471
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
Really.

472
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Nonsense.

473
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
You are so narrow-minded.

474
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
I have to see it

475
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
before I can rest assured.

476
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
Take a look.

477
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,800
I have something to ask you.

478
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
I just take a look.

479
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
I have something to ask you.

480
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
What did you and Qian Yu Wang

481
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
go to the moon for today?

482
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
And why did he

483
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
take Shangguan He as his only son?

484
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Nan Hong.

485
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
Can you not always

486
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
talk about business

487
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
in private?

488
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Don't worry.

489
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Qian Yu Wang has gradually

490
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,800
become a part of this world.

491
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
How could he make a bet

492
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
to help Shangguan He

493
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
and Ting to get married?

494
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
But he wanted to

495
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
take you away this morning.

496
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
When women

497
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
are busy with business outside,

498
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
can you men

499
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
stop thinking

500
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,800
about it at home?

501
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Stop thinking about it.

502
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Okay?

503
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
Trust me.

504
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
Okay.

505
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Nan Hong.

506
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Take off your boots.

507
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Take off your belt.

508
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Take off your coat.

509
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
Take off your coat.

510
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
You look a little strange today.

511
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
Come on.

512
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
I'm not a man.

513
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
I'm a man.

514
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Come on.

515
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
What?

516
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Nan Hong.

517
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
What's wrong?

518
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
Nan Hong.

519
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
I like you.

520
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
How much do you like me?

521
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
I like you

522
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
and ATM machine

523
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
falling into the river at the same time.

524
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
I will definitely

525
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
like you first.

526
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
ATM machine?

527
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Although I don't know

528
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
what he's thinking,

529
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
but I'm sure

530
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
he's not as good as Xuan Jia Juan.

531
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
You're a fool.

532
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
You're a fool.

533
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Anyway,

534
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
you should say it in a sweet way.

535
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
And I will

536
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
often tell you in the future.

537
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
You used to

538
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
walk so many steps towards me.

539
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
From now on,

540
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
I will walk towards you.

541
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,800
You can't just say

542
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
you like me.

543
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
You have to act.

544
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Really?

545
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
Yes.

546
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
I didn't mean that.

547
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
Didn't you ask me to act?

548
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Then I'll act for you.

549
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
That...

550
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
Wait.

551
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,800
Let's go.

552
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,800
Let's go.

553
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
We can just stick it in the trash.

554
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
What if it gets caught?

555
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
You have obsessive compulsive disorder,

556
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
right?

557
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
We'll talk about it after it gets caught.

558
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Come on.

559
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
Dongting red orange.

560
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
Dongting red orange.

561
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,800
Dongting red orange is so beautiful.

562
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
Take a look.

563
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Dongting red orange.

564
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Something happened

565
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,800
when I bought Dongting red orange last time.

566
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,800
This time...

567
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:23,320
You're so

568
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
You're so

569
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
sweet.

570
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
I'm so

571
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
sweet.

572
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
I'm so

573
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
sweet.

574
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
I'm so

575
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
sweet.

576
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
Brother Zhu

577
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
is so

578
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
kind

579
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
to our family.

580
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Brother Song, you're going too far.

581
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,800
You are the most respected family in the capital,

582
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
but we are the only two in the whole district.

583
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
How could you be like this?

584
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
On the contrary,

585
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
the Crown Prince

586
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
and his sister's little brother

587
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
came to me.

588
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,600
I'm a little suspicious of the marriage.

589
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
I'm old.

590
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,800
What can I do?

591
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,680
I just want to see the kids

592
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,720
get married and have a family.

593
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm not lucky enough to marry a Song girl.

594
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,800
But He'er

595
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,880
is my old friend.

596
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,960
That's true.

597
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,320
But I've been looking for a wife

598
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,880
for a long time.

599
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,240
It seems that there is no suitable wife

600
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,200
within half a year.

601
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,160
Otherwise, this thing...

602
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
I think Mr. Song

603
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,360
is because Miss Song'er is unwilling to get married

604
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,800
and wants to push it off.

605
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,240
Chu Gui Hong, why are you everywhere?

606
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,160
You know about the Song family.

607
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,600
Yesterday, Gui Hong was on a business trip.

608
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,400
He happened to meet Mrs. Song.

609
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,720
So he chatted with her.

610
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,040
It happened.

611
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,920
Mrs. Song went to Cangjiang Yue.

612
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,680
The prince happened to receive an apology.

613
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,960
About the Song family,

614
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,880
Chu Gui Hong also happened to hear about it.

615
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,800
How can it be so coincidental?

616
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,080
That's it.

617
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,960
It's a coincidence.

618
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,320
Brother Song, I suddenly want to ask you a favor.

619
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,280
Can you wait a moment?

620
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:09,920
Okay.

621
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,720
Please.

622
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,280
Shang Guan He.

623
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,840
You've already been exposed.

624
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,040
Is it that hard to say I like you?

625
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,680
What are you hesitating about?

626
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,040
Crown Princess Consort.

627
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,280
Sister-in-law.

628
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,960
Leave this matter alone, okay?

629
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,920
I'm begging you.

630
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,080
Stop.

631
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,080
Come back.

632
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,080
You and Tian are involved in

633
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,920
the relationship between Nan Heng and me.

634
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,640
I have to repay you for the kindness.

635
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,320
Did you tell me before?

636
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,000
People like you and me

637
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,160
have to risk everything for someone in our life.

638
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,040
You and I are both lazy.

639
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,760
We don't have any ambition.

640
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,000
What we want is a stable and free life.

641
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,440
But if you say that in this life,

642
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,920
if we can't even meet someone

643
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,440
who is worth risking everything for,

644
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,000
and only live,

645
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,720
is that still living?

646
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,880
I believe you.

647
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,080
I did what I said.

648
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,520
But you,

649
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,080
you obviously value Ting more than anyone else.

650
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,760
Then why do you have to talk about those sweet words behind your back?

651
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,480
You're a mute in front of him.

652
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,240
The Chief told me

653
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,480
that I'm not in the script.

654
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,040
How can an unexistent person

655
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,600
give him a good ending?

656
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
The script?

657
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,200
You knew it all?

658
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,600
So,

659
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,800
you don't want me to disappear suddenly

660
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,320
and leave your sister alone in the world, right?

661
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,280
How can you disappear suddenly?

662
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,760
It's not as bad as you think.

663
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,920
It's not that bad.

664
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,880
Trust me.

665
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,400
Really.

666
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,200
Second Master.

667
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,240
Second Master.

668
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,400
Oh no.

669
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,360
Something happened.

670
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,240
The house was stolen.

671
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,280
Go and have a look.

672
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,720
Your Highness.

673
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,320
You asked me to come to the Moon of the River.

674
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,880
What's the matter?

675
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,200
Please.

676
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,280
Sorry for being careless.

677
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
I'm here.

678
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
Come here.

679
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,760
Ting Ting,

680
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,760
you gave him 73 paintings.

681
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,360
I have one more.

682
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
If you agree,

683
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,360
the imperial decree of the emperor

684
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,760
will be given to the marriage of the Chu family.

685
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,360
Your Highness,

686
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,960
didn't you ask His Majesty to cancel the marriage?

687
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,360
What does it mean?

688
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,160
Well,

689
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,960
just take it as an impulsive story.

690
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,160
Don't blame me, Ting Ting.

691
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,760
I'm sorry.

692
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,360
Ting Ting,

693
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,760
you may dislike me,

694
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,760
but I can't just watch you

695
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,760
marry someone who doesn't care about you.

696
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
Ting Ting,

697
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,160
I like you.

698
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,960
I can write a love poem for you,

699
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,360
and I can be honest in front of the noble ladies in the capital.

700
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,360
I can ask for marriage from my father.

701
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,960
I can do everything you want.

702
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,160
But what about Chu He?

703
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,760
What can he do for you?

704
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,960
So, Your Highness,

705
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,760
you are here to get married today?

706
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,760
Yes.

707
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,560
I really love you.

708
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
So today,

709
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,560
I'm here to get married in front of you.

710
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,160
I'm so scared.

711
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,160
Your Highness,

712
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,160
you are so rebellious.

713
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,160
Life is not a waste of time.

714
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,960
You don't have to be afraid of being cheated.

715
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,160
Why are you so worried

716
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,360
in this clear day?

717
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,360
Is it because

718
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,360
you are planning to get married

719
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,160
in front of the noble ladies in the capital?

720
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,560
You are suspecting me so soon.

721
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,560
Song Yi Mo told me that

722
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,160
you have been

723
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,160
so bold and unyielding

724
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
for this script.

725
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,960
But now,

726
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,760
you are changed to this.

727
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,560
If I were you,

728
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,560
I would also want to turn the story around.

729
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,160
Why should I do that?

730
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,160
Of course you should.

731
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,960
I don't believe you

732
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,560
want to stay here.

733
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,360
You are right.

734
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,560
Nan Hang,

735
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,160
after the wedding,

736
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,960
are you feeling unwell?

737
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,560
Do you feel better

738
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,960
after the wedding ceremony?

739
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:46,760
Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!

740
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,960
It's not the time yet.

741
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,160
Why are you still not saying anything?

742
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,960
Do you really want A Ting to marry him?

743
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:51,960
I...

744
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,760
I'll count to three.

745
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,160
If no one is against it,

746
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,360
I'll take it as a yes.

747
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,360
I'm telling you, Shang Guan He,

748
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,560
don't regret it.

749
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,160
Three.

750
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,560
Two.

751
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,360
No need to say it.

752
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,960
I promise you.

753
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,760
No, you promised so soon.

754
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,960
You should think about it.

755
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,360
I've been pursuing you for so many times,

756
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,160
but you didn't agree.

757
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,760
Why are you suddenly...

758
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,360
You didn't want to marry him before,

759
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,760
but now you want to marry him.

760
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,760
I want to marry him, but I can't.

761
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,760
Ting Ting,

762
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,760
I'm happy to hear you say that.

763
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
But you should know

764
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,560
that sometimes,

765
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,160
we must...

766
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,960
I'll cut the crap.

767
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,160
You men

768
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,560
are so slow.

769
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,560
I'll go to the palace and beg for mercy.

770
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,760
Ting Ting.

771
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,360
Wait.

772
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,560
Song Yi Ting, let me ask you.

773
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,360
What kind of love do you want?

774
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,560
I don't care about where I come from,

775
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
or the way I go back.

776
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,160
I want to know and protect you.

777
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,960
I want to be with you.

778
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,160
You don't care about the way you go back.

779
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,160
What if I suddenly disappear?

780
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,160
You can decide

781
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,360
whether you want to leave or stay.

782
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,960
When did I force you?

783
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,760
What if I leave this world first?

784
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,360
Then you can stay in your heart

785
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,360
and find another one.

786
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,160
Another love.

787
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,560
There are so many men in this world.

788
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,360
Song Yi Ting,

789
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,560
will you stay in the country

790
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,560
and live a life of luxury?

791
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,560
I'll go.

792
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,560
What a heartless Song Yi Ting.

793
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,160
I don't understand.

794
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,160
But I can understand.

795
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,760
They two

796
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,960
have made it.

797
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,760
Shangguan He,

798
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,960
don't talk nonsense.

799
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,760
Do you like me or not?

800
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,960
Rong Hua.

801
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:13,960
Your Majesty.

802
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,960
I'm Officer Li.

803
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:39,160
Sure.

804
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,560
Lord Ah Xu.

805
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,760
Tiantian.

806
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,720
Tiantian.

807
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,360
I...

808
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,240
I can explain it now.

809
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,000
Let go.

810
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,440
Tiantian.

811
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,440
If...

812
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,960
I mean if...

813
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,880
If Shangguan He is not here,

814
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,200
or if he is not good to you,

815
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,000
you...

816
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,760
will rely on me.

817
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,960
Stop it.

818
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,560
I promise you.

819
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,560
Who is waiting for a long look?

820
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,520
If I am disappointed,

821
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,560
and the road is too steep,

822
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,560
I will...

823
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,760
Your Highness.

824
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,040
What do you mean?

825
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,760
Huang Cao.

826
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,600
Well...

827
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,320
Actually,

828
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,240
uncle asked me to help.

829
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,600
Help?

830
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,680
You mean

831
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,920
you did it on purpose?

832
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,920
Fake proposal?

833
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,360
Nanhang.

834
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,880
There are rules in the script world.

835
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,360
Except for the two you know,

836
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,440
there are two more.

837
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,480
One.

838
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,600
It involves the way back.

839
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,880
As long as you and Song Yimeng

840
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,200
finish the scene of the script

841
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,160
and get to the end,

842
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,320
I can go back.

843
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,080
And the last one is...

844
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,880
Change theres and events

845
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,560
