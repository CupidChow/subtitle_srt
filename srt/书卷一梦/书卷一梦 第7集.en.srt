00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,030
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,240
Then let's not talk about that.

4
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,120
Ten years ago,
in the full-scale war with Dongshuo,

5
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,510
5,000 soldiers from the Xuanjia Army

6
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,590
faced 40,000 elite soldiers from Dongshuo.

7
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,280
If Nan Heng hadn't charged into battle

8
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,430
and taken the enemy commander's head,

9
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,840
how else could we have turned the tide
after three months of losses

10
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,040
and won ten years of peace at the border?

11
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,800
What's wrong?

12
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,840
Mr. Li, listen to yourself.

13
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,560
What do you mean?

14
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,680
How reckless Nan Heng was!

15
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,079
5,000 against 40,000.

16
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,190
What was he thinking?

17
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,360
Instead of staying in the back
and commanding the troops,

18
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,800
he, the commander,
ran straight to the front lines

19
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
to steal the spotlight.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,400
Let me tell you, Mr. Li.

21
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,870
Nan Heng…

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,310
He, he...

23
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,280
he might've had a few screws loose.

24
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,360
You're right.

25
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,360
He's definitely got a few screws loose.

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,960
Otherwise, why would I
be telling you all this?

27
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,920
Mr. Li, what did you say?

28
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,840
Nothing.

29
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,530
I'm just saying,

30
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,079
everyone else is forgivable,

31
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,690
and Nan Heng is always the one to blame.

32
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,480
Miss Song, you really
see people for who they are.

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,080
You're so…

34
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,970
So sharp and insightful.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I saw straight through Nan Heng,

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,680
didn't I?

37
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,010
I already know all that.

38
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,870
Let me put it this way, Mr. Li.

39
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,950
In this world,

40
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,070
no one knows Nan Heng

41
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,400
better than I do.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No.

43
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,360
There's one more person now.

44
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,430
Guess who it is.

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,310
I won't guess.

46
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,140
We've arrived at the Song Residence.

47
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,610
Goodbye forever.

48
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,840
Mr. Li.

49
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,150
Mr. Li, don't go.

50
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,300
Think about what I said.

51
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,730
Come find me
when you've made up your mind!

52
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,150
Ambitious and ruthless.

53
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,860
Cruel and heartless.

54
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,540
Capable of any evil.

55
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,440
Framed loyal officials

56
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,360
and even harmed innocent women.

57
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,430
In that wicked woman's eyes,

58
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,620
I'm so despicable.

59
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,010
Ambitious, ruthless,

60
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,190
capable of any evil,
and framed loyal officials.

61
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,590
That's what everyone says.

62
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,850
I'm already used to it.

63
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,800
But Your Highness,

64
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,660
when have you ever harmed a woman?

65
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,190
Go to Waning River Crescent.

66
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,590
Bring Shangguan He to me!

67
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,750
Yes.

68
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,980
Did I say something wrong again?

69
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,480
In His Highness's eyes,

70
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,079
even that useless
Shangguan is better than me.

71
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,240
It hurts!

72
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:22,830
It hurts!

73
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,510
Are you trying to kill me?

74
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,310
Guihong.

75
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,560
Guihong.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,620
I came as soon as I got the news.

77
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,290
What happened?

78
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,920
Weren't you off fighting bandits?

79
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,450
How did you end up like this?

80
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,930
Your Highness.

81
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,000
Waning River Crescent's Hall

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,860
might not be as simple as it looks.

83
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,130
Li Shiliu?

84
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,210
Was he really that Li Shiliu?

85
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,070
My Lady, you're so lucky!

86
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,120
Why?

87
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,630
Is he that famous?

88
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,630
Of course.

89
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,360
He is

90
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,390
the number one dream husband,

91
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:58,390
voted by all
the eligible ladies in the capital.

92
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,070
Always neck and neck

93
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,530
with General Chu Guihong.

94
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,680
Rumor has it he's cold and aloof

95
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,240
and rarely shows his face in public.

96
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,040
But today, he actually appeared

97
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,240
and saved you.

98
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,450
You must have been
a loving couple in a past life

99
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,310
and still deeply love each other.

100
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,430
Stop.

101
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,430
You're hopelessly romantic.

102
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,580
I rushed through the script,

103
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,510
focused only on the main plot,

104
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,250
and totally missed
such a popular character.

105
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,070
Wait, is it possible that

106
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,680
he isn't in the script

107
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,970
and is actually

108
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,250
a wild card who exists independently?

109
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:43,940
[Li Shiliu]

110
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,900
[Nan Heng] [Song Yimeng]

111
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,560
What else do you know

112
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,630
about his past?

113
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,000
Tell me everything.

114
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,870
What is this?

115
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,480
"Famous Men in the Martial World—
Li Shiliu Edition?"

116
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,870
He even has a biography?

117
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,640
There's stuff like this?

118
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,430
Miss Song sure has a sharp tongue

119
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,290
and a unique way of seeing things.

120
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,310
She made all of His Highness's
heroic deeds

121
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,250
sound utterly worthless.

122
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,310
Nonsense!

123
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,970
His Highness just had a few slip-ups.

124
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,830
Hardly even a handful of them.

125
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,270
He got tricked once by a schemer,

126
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,430
ambushed once by enemy scouts,

127
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,940
and had his supplies stolen once

128
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,340
and burned another time.

129
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,990
They all happened when he was young.

130
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,040
What's that supposed to mean?

131
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,180
Are you saying
His Highness isn't young anymore?

132
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,680
Quit stirring the pot!

133
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,920
His Highness is in his prime.

134
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,390
Sure, he's weathered a bit

135
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,920
and has a few lines on his face,

136
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,750
but he still does 80 push-ups a day!

137
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Back to the point!

138
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,900
Your Highness.

139
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,950
Mr. Shangguan
knows nothing about politics,

140
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,950
so I must speak plainly.

141
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,159
You've spent years
building Waning River Crescent

142
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,510
to grow your power base in secret,

143
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,830
gather intel, and prepare for the future.

144
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,280
This identity of yours
must be kept secret.

145
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,000
Even if you want to ally with Miss Song

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,360
as Li Shiliu,

147
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,480
there's no guarantee

148
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,430
she won't uncover
your secrets and plans someday.

149
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,000
If the Eighteenth Prince
and his men find out about this,

150
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,480
it'll be too late to fix.

151
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,360
Fugui.

152
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,850
There is no free meal in the world.

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,630
No risk, no reward.

154
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,890
Still, His Highness
can't take the risk himself!

155
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,000
Let me ask you.

156
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,190
Do you have a way

157
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,450
to break the rule
Song Yimeng mentioned?

158
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,720
Since we can't break it, we use it.

159
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,310
Don't forget—

160
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,040
you attacked Chu Guihong tonight.

161
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,100
How are you planning to clean that up?

162
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,650
Why would a man from the martial world

163
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,310
show up just to test out your weapon?

164
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,900
Could it be that

165
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,440
he's after the method of weapon forging?

166
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,360
There's only one person

167
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,920
who cares about that.

168
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,060
So I suspect

169
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,080
Li Shiliu

170
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,270
is most likely working for Nan Heng.

171

And not just that—

176

the bandit operation
was supposed to be top secret.

177

But Li Shiliu

178
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,310
acted as if he already knew about it.

there's no guarantee
the Song family will side with us.

But if we let the two families get united,

I'm afraid before Chief
gets the method of weapon forging,

lost his shot at the throne.

It's hard to win her heart.

00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,600
to help you.

340
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,390
Handsome, strong, yet miserable?

341
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,200
Nonsense!

342
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,670
Serves you right!

343
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,040
Hope this letter finds you well.

344
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,670
The rumors swirling around the capital
lately could break even the strongest man.

345
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,320
I have no way to explain myself,

346
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,120
but knowing you believe in me is enough.

347
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,000
What other people
think of me doesn't matter.

348
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,820
I've heard the court struggles
grow fiercer by the day.

349
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,950
General Chu
is now in charge of palace security.

350
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,110
He may not have time to look after you.

351
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,510
If you'd like,

352
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,080
you're always welcome
to visit Waning River Crescent.

353
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,280
It might help take your mind off things.

354
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,930
What's Song Yimeng playing at?

355
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,270
Your Highness, it might be poisoned.

356
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,000
Let Mr. Shangguan try it first.

357
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,840
I'll shut up.

358
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,910
What do you think?

359
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,460
Your Highness,

360
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,870
Song Yimeng

361
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,060
has taken the bait.

362
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,100
Your Highness.

363
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,930
A letter just arrived
from the Eighteenth Prince.

364
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,670
He's asked to meet you

365
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,190
tomorrow at noon
at Waning River Crescent.

366
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,390
The Eighteenth Prince
must be out of his mind,

367
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,520
asking to meet you outside the palace.

368
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,480
Just days ago, Chu Guihong

369
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,000
exchanged blows with you there,

370
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,780
and today Nan Rui sent an invitation.

371
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,810
Interesting.

372
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,740
He thinks he's clever

373
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,130
and even dragged Rui into it.

374
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,780
Are you going?

375
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,450
Yes.

376
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,980
Opportunities like this

377
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,119
don't come easy.

378
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,510
After his release from prison,

379
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,160
His Majesty sent
his father's belongings

380
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,640
back to the Qianyu Mansion,

381
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,069
calling it returning them,

382
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:13,530
but it was actually meant
to intimidate you.

383
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,030
He thinks with that thing in hand,
he'll be unstoppable.

384
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,119
Then I'll make sure he falls
and never gets up.

385
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,200
Looks like Shanhu's thieving skills

386
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,960
will finally come in handy.

387
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,490
Maybe with that thing,

388
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,490
we can uncover
the method of weapon forging.

389
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,790
Wait, what are you talking about?

390
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,390
Can someone explain it to me?

391
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,600
The Qianyu Moon-Cleaving Blade.

392
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,160
What?

393
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,550
This way, please.

Excellent, excellent!

395

Truly eye-opening!

Come, please.

397
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,030
Excellent, excellent!

398
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,360
Don't be afraid.

399
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,550
Don't be afraid.

400

Leave.

402

Are you deaf?

403
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,230
He asked you to leave.

Miss Song?

408
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,350
Why is she here?

Chief?

00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,230
Didn't Chief say
he wouldn't be here today?

Is he here or not?

did you invite me here?

434
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,080
Why?

Yeah, why did I invite you?

You don't need to go into all that.

510
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,510
I-I'm not that interested anyway.

511
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,270
No.

512
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,440
You're gonna be
the lady of the house one day.

513
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,320
You need to know everything clearly.

514
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,140
The more I know, the sooner I die.

515
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,730
But Shanhu,

516
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,100
you've been
dragging me around for an hour.

517
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,240
When can I

518
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,000
see your chief?

519
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,440
It's the Second Master's order.

520
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,400
He said I must help you

521
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,750
understand the full
workings of the Nightwalkers

522
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,400
and make you feel at home.

523
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,530
Now, I'll take you to the fourth floor.

524
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,830
This is the fourth floor.

525
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,880
It's called Wan Crescent.

526
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,270
You can overlook the entire
Waning River Crescent from here.

527
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,070
Look!

528
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,030
This is the empire

529
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,200
Chief built for you!

530
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,130
So melodramatic.

531
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,720
Besides this,

532
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,240
there's one more place beneath the water.

533
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,700
It's called Yin Crescent.

534
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,110
But that's Chief's private domain.

535
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,030
We don't actually know

536
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,110
what goes on there.

537
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,000
But don't worry.

538
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,090
There are definitely no women there.

539
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,270
Yunlong.

540
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,110
Come with me.

541
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,650
We're done for. We're done for.

542
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,720
Miss Song insists on seeing Chief now.

543
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,000
The way she looked just now—

544
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,200
it was like she'd never leave

545
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,970
without seeing him today.

546
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,510
I finally got her
to rest in a suite just now.

547
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,040
What's Chief doing today?

548
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,440
Why can't he see her?

549
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,280
I don't know.

550
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,830
Wait, wait.

551
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,490
Can't you help me look for him?

552
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,830
Did you forget
what Second Master said earlier?

553
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,720
He told us Nan Heng
would be here at Waning River Crescent,

554
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,380
so we're to keep a low profile
and not act rashly.

555
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,830
We have guests.

556
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,420
Move, move!

557
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,510
What's going on?

558
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,310
What's happening?

559
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,510
What's going on?

560
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,440
Go, go.

561
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,740
The Qianyu Army is here to make an arrest!

562
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,130
No one leaves!

563
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,410
What's happening?

564
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,270
What's going on?

565
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,350
No idea.

566
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,870
No idea.

567
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,250
Yeah, what's going on?

568
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,380
[Big Fortune]

569
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,240
Get up there!

570
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,590
Hurry! Move!

571
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,030
Stand still.

572
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,790
All of you, stay right where you are!

573
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,040
Sir,

574
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,230
may I ask who you're here to arrest?

575
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,720
-Who's that?
-No idea.

576
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,280
I've never seen him before.

577
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,400
Nan Rui.

578
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,950
If you keep eating like this,

579
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,840
I won't be able to see you anymore.

580
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,160
Even if I stop, you still can't see me.

581
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,400
Who is it?

582
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,160
Come in!

583
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,750
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

584
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,150
Great to see you, Rong Hua!

585
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,280
What are you doing here?

586
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
Your Highness.

587
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,310
I'm here with the Qianyu Army
to make an arrest.

588
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,000
I ran into Jixiang

589
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,000
and heard you were both here,

590
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,790
so I came

591
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,640
to greet you.

592
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,160
Who are you here to arrest?

593
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,920
The chief of Waning River Crescent—

594
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,720
Li Shiliu.

595
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,810
Then what does this Li Shiliu look like?

596
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,720
What exactly did he do

597
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,880
to make you
bring so many people to arrest him?

598
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,030
Military equipment has been
going missing now and then.

599
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,450
We suspect the Nightwalkers are involved.

600
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,960
So we set a trap to lure him out.

601
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,750
Less than two hours ago,

602
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,240
someone took the bait.

603
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,400
That person was Li Shiliu.

604
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,550
There are so many of you,

605
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,270
yet you still haven't caught him?

606
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,920
That guy is extremely cunning.

607
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,680
Even surrounded by dozens,

608
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,160
he still managed
to slip away and flee here.

609
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,960
However,

610
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,640
he's badly injured and compromised.

611
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,680
We believe
he's hiding somewhere in this building.

612
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,310
We've already captured two of his men

613
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,110
and are interrogating them now.

614
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,070
If you do catch him,

615
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,270
you must come report it to me.

616
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,030
Yes.

617
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,160
I'll take my leave.

618
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,340
Li Shiliu's in this building.

619
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,170
Aren't you afraid?

620
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,350
No.

621
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,850
No way I'm not afraid.

622
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,200
A bloodthirsty killer

623
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,240
is hiding somewhere near me.

624
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,590
I'm terrified!

625
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,450
Then call Jixiang in.

626
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,350
Jixiang?

627
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,820
Well, he…

628
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,210
he's, um… a gambling addict.

629
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,590
He snuck off to gamble.

630
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,530
That's strange.

631
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,090
Jixiang is always glued to your side.

632
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,790
Why is it that today of all days,

633
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,750
he left you alone to meet with me?

634
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,110
He...

635
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,510
I...

636
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,680
You...

637
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,920
Have some sunflower seeds.

638
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,780
We have nothing else to do anyway.

639
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,820
By then, I'll barge into your room

640
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,110
disguised as Li Shiliu

641
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:30,670
[One day ago]

642
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,240
and pretend to be injured and pass out.

643
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,480
Very exciting!

644
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,640
And then?

645
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,400
Then you come to check on me

646
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,920
and try to remove my mask.

647
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,970
If Li Shiliu really
is connected to Nan Heng,

648
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,230
Nan Heng will definitely try to stop you.

649
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,110
Got it.

650
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,220
If Heng dares to stop me,

651
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,920
I'll inform Father immediately

652
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,070
and get an imperial order to look into him

653
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,730
and the Nightwalkers, right?

654
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,440
His Majesty knows you're pure of heart

655
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
and speak only the truth.

656
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,170
He'll definitely believe you.

657
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,350
But what if Heng

658
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,830
doesn't stop me?

659
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,440
I can't really pull off your mask

660
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,160
and let him see your face.

661
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,200
If Nan Heng doesn't stop you,

662
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,840
I'll pretend to wake up
and leave the room.

663
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,340
All you have to do is stall him.

664
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,270
I don't know if I can stall him.

665
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,800
Don't worry, Your Highness.

666
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,000
Jixiang and Rong Hua
are standing by outside to back me up.

667
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,750
But what if Heng really

668
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,160
has nothing to do with Li Shiliu?

669
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,880
Then all our efforts in this investigation

670
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,030
would've been a wild goose chase.

671
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:34,680
That's…

672
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,680
If Li Shiliu isn't Nan Heng's pawn,

673
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,220
we can use this opportunity

674
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,430
to make him your pawn instead.

675
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,450
And…

676
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,610
how exactly do you plan to do that?

677
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,640
I'll bring a shipment of weapons

678
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,200
into Waning River Crescent.

679
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
After I leave,

680
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,550
Rong Hua will lead a search of the place

681
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,950
and discover them
hidden in a private room.

682
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,890
You're trying to frame him!

683
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,110
Calm down, Your Highness.

684
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,960
Hear me out.

685
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,000
Once Rong Hua finds the weapons,

686
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,800
the Qianyu Army
and the Nightwalkers will clash.

687
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,200
At that point, you can step in

688
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,750
and smooth things over.

689
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,230
By doing so,

690
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,270
Li Shiliu will feel indebted
and be willing to serve you.

691
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,790
You can then persuade both him

692
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,160
and the Nightwalkers
to choose the right path

693
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,490
and submit to the court.

694
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,330
General, Rong Hua has come down.

695
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,680
It's time you showed up.

696
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,470
Waiting for someone?

697
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,350
No.

698
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,160
Who could I possibly be waiting for?

699
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,880
I'm just waiting for you
to say something.

700
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,140
Then why do you keep glancing over there?

701
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,580
Who are you?

702
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,800
He looks like he fainted.

703
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,570
He seems to be the one from the poster!

704
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,750
Gosh, he's Li Shiliu!

705
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,610
Really?

706
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,160
Heng, don't be scared.

707
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,400
I'm here.

708
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,920
Today, I'm taking off his mask

709
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,400
and seeing who he really is.

710
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,110
Wait.

711
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,400
Shouldn't you go out and call for help?

712
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,750
C-Call for help?

713
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,120
Rong Hua and the Qianyu Army
are waiting right outside.

714
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,920
Ask them to come in and catch him.

715
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,640
If you're too scared,

716
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,070
I'll do it myself.

717
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,200
Hold on, hold on.

718
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,350
Be patient.

719
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,580
Don't look down on me.

720
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,200
He's already passed out.
Why would I be afraid?

721
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,160
Today, I'm going to see

722
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,490
with my own eyes
what he really looks like.

723
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,750
Heng,

724
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,400
I'm going over now.

725
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,350
Don't stop me.

726
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,410
Go ahead. I won't stop you.

727
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,480
I'm already walking over.

728
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,700
I'll pull off his mask soon.

729
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,880
Wait.

730
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,150
What did you say?

731
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,280
I mean you're too slow.

732
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,110
Walk faster.

733
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,510
Alright.

734
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,780
I'm standing right next to him now.

735
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,500
I'm really gonna do it.

736
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,280
What do you want? What do you want?

737
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,070
You're trying to stop me.

738
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,440
You're definitely
trying to stop me, aren't you?

739
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,440
If you won't do it,

740
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,110
I will!

741
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,590
Get in!

742
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,790
[Excellence and Distinction]

743
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,670
Sir,

744
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,070
may I ask if that big guy called Fugui

745
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,150
is your attendant?

746
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,000
What's wrong?

747
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,880
He's so hot-tempered.

748
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,610
He crossed
a high-ranking official's daughter.

749
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,840
Please go check things out.

750
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,380
An official's daughter?

751
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,920
Didn't I tell you
to take care of everything?

752
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,450
Why is Song Yimeng here?

753
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,760
I only wrote those letters

754
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,090
to bring her here for you!

755
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,490
How was I supposed to know
she'd come today?

756
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:28,910
Let me help you.

757
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,690
You can't be serious.

758
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,890
I've got it!

759
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,900
It's stuck.

760
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,630
I love my hair.

761
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,550
Keep yapping

762
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:47,410
and I'll shave your head
and send you to a monastery.

763
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,810
[Fugui was here]

764
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,520
Why isn't the general back yet?

765
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,000
Why isn't he here yet?

766
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,710
It's not like
there are traffic jams in ancient times.

767
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,000
You...

768
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,960
Why is Yimeng here?

769
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,340
Mr. Li.

770
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,750
You're finally here.

771
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,420
You swordsmen are quite interesting.

772
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,000
The front door is right there,

773
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,960
but you just have to
climb in through a window.

774
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,640
Men will always be boys, huh?

775
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,540
How does she even know Li Shiliu?

776
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,030
Why are you hiding?

777
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,440
We're basically friends now.

778
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,840
Don't be so shy.

779
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,250
Mr. Li?

780
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,130
Is Yimeng having an affair with Li Shiliu?

781
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,260
Impossible. Absolutely impossible.

782
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,630
Miss Song.

783
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,710
Mr. Li,

784
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,800
what's wrong with your voice?

785
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,930
Did you catch a cold?

786
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,400
I heard that

787
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,550
you're engaged to Young Master Chu.

788
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,190
So why are you acting like…

789
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,740
like we're close?

790
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,030
Sorry.

791
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,170
I forgot you're from ancient times.

792
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,100
Men and women should keep a distance.

793
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,500
Got it, got it.

794
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,840
Mr. Li, since you're here,

795
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,030
let's get down to business.

796
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,190
I'll get you some tea.

797
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,670
Have a seat.

798
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,510
Miss Song.

799
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,000
Chief is here to see you.

800
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,200
Miss Song.

801
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,750
You...

802
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,590
You teleported?

803
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,170
What?

804
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,290
And your voice is fine now.

805
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,480
You guys talk.

806
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,320
I've got something to do,
so I'll be going.

807
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,450
Where are you going?

808
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,420
That's strange.

809
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,510
So,

810
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,940
Miss Song,
what brings you here today?

811
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,610
I've been a little bored lately,

812
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,630
so

813
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,320
I prepared some gifts for you.

814
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,670
Much appreciated.

815
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,480
But I've got something urgent today.

816
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,710
Let's talk another time.

817
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,500
Mr. Li,

818
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,140
why are you suddenly

819
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,190
so cold toward me?

820
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,760
When was I ever warm toward you?

821
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,930
Didn't you write in your letter

822
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,200
that Chu Guihong was always busy,

823
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,150
and you were worried I'd be lonely,

824
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,320
so I should drop by

825
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,470
whenever I had free time?

826
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,970
I did say that.

827
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,810
So enjoy yourself here.

828
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,250
But I really do
have an urgent matter today.

829
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,350
We'll talk next time.

830
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,140
No.

831
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,410
I have something more important.

832
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,470
I want to talk to you in depth

833
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,150
about Nan Heng.

834
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,090
Nan Heng?

835
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:06,360
[The master and his servant
care for each other.]

836
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,280
The master and his servant
care for each other.

837
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,150
His Highness just told me to get lost.

838
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:22,880
I understand.

839
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,580
Nan Heng

840
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,190
is a prince after all.

841
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,370
People in your world are bound

842
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,840
to fear him.

843
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,930
But, Mr. Li,

844
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,810
have you ever thought about this?

845
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,160
If one day,

846
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,340
the feud between
the Seventh and Eighteenth Princes

847
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,190
throws the whole nation into chaos,

848
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,760
what should we do then?

849
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,590
Going up against a prince is not easy.

850
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,100
Miss Song, I need to know
what your trump card is.

851
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,480
Song Yude is my father.

852
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,840
Chu Guihong is my fiancé.

853
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,340
Isn't that enough?

854
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:02,880
Yimeng wants me to join forces
with Li Shiliu to go against Nan Heng?

855
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,120
I need to know your full plan.

856
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,480
If it's not airtight,

857
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,230
I won't risk

858
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,110
my men's lives.

859
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,710
Goodbye.

860
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,140
The Lantern Festival.

861
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,550
During the Lantern Festival,

862
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,850
there'll be a citywide
celebration in the capital.

863
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,000
Everyone will be there.

864
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,740
That day, Nan Heng

865
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,500
is bound to make his move.

866
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,860
He'll turn the whole city
into a sea of fire.

867
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,730
Countless civilians will die.

868
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,350
Mr. Li,

869
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,220
if you're willing to trust me,

870
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,700
help me stop Nan Heng.

871
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,400
What do you say?

872
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,240
The Lantern Festival

873
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,370
is celebrated every year.

874
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:57,150
People light lanterns
and pray for blessings.

875
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,710
It's all routine.

876
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,650
Why are you so sure Nan Heng will act?

877
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,180
Exactly because it's routine.

878
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,160
That's what makes it the perfect cover
for him to suppress rivals

879
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,850
and pull people to his side.

880
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,550
[Four hours earlier]

881
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,260
The palace guards were punished?

882
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:21,630
His Majesty punished them repeatedly.
That's no coincidence.

883
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,590
I suspect he's planning
to hand control of palace security

884
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,110
to Chu Guihong as well.

885
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,000
If that happens,
both the capital and the palace

886
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,030
will fall under the control

887
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,750
[Gentle Breeze and Auspicious Clouds]

888
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,990
of Chu Guihong and the Eighteenth Prince.

889
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,510
Chu Guihong has only held
his current post for less than ten days.

890
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,890
If he wants a promotion,

891
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,820
he'll need some kind of achievement.

892
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,470
The Lantern Festival?

893
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,620
If he's put in charge
of the Lantern Festival

894
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,830
and does a good job,

895
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:45,810
he'll naturally

896
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,230
get promoted.

897
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,080
Mr. Li,

898
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,970
I know you still have a lot of questions.

899
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:58,000
But this time is different.

900
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,230
If we don't stop Nan Heng,

901
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,630
it won't just be Chu Guihong—

902
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,150
many innocent lives

903
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,790
will be dragged down as well.

904
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,070
Mr. Li,

905
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,710
you have a heart
that cares for the people.

906
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:11,310
Are you really
going to stand by and do nothing?

907
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:14,520
I haven't even made a plan yet,

908
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,810
and Song Yimeng's already said all this.

909
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,760
Could it be she and Chu Guihong
are trying to stir up chaos

910
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,840
to frame me

911
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,560
and give Chu Guihong
a political advantage?

912
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:25,410
Mr. Li,

913
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,510
think carefully.

914
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,590
Hasn't Nan Heng committed

915
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,370
enough crimes over the years?

916
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,080
If you're hesitant

917
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,170
because he's a prince,

918
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,930
afraid to face him alone,

919
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,360
I'll have Chu Guihong join us.

920
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,840
The three of us together
can take Nan Heng down!
