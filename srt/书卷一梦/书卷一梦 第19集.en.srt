00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,960
Oolong milk tea.

176
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,560
What are matcha pearls?

177
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,750
It tastes good.

178
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,030
I haven't had it before.

179
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,480
Same here.

180
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
It's really good.

181
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,520
I've invited you all here today

182
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,000
because there's something urgent

183
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,600
I'd like to discuss with you.

184
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,750
My Lady,

185
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,630
you flatter us.

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,480
If you need anything,

187
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,840
just say the word.

188
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,670
Exactly.

189
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,390
Heng is my only son.

190
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,200
He spent years stationed at the border.

191
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,390
Now it's time

192
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,390
for him to get married
and carry on the royal line.

193
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,670
Aside from Yimeng,

194
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,440
your daughters

195
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,480
are the most graceful and virtuous

196
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,750
in the capital.

197
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,030
All fine matches.

198
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,200
What does this mean?

199
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,910
My Lady,

200
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,670
hasn't His Highness already been engaged

201
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,000
to the eldest daughter of the Song family?

202
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,480
According to tradition,

203
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
a prince may have one principal consort

204
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,670
and up to two concubines.

205
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,630
Miss Jia,

206
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,970
are you engaged yet?

207
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,770
Guess she's not lucky enough
to marry the prince.

208
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,700
Her fiancé is just about
to send the betrothal gifts.

209
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,050
But I heard that

210
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,960
you're still shopping around.

211
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,390
You've basically

212
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,360
visited every matchmaker in the capital.

213
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,150
Are you lying

214
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,200
to Her Ladyship
because you think His Highness

215
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,670
isn't good enough for your daughter?

216
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,630
Mrs. Song,

217
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,070
Miss Yiting is famous
all over the capital.

218
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,840
Why don't you say yes?

219
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,240
My eldest daughter

220
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,240
is the prince's principal consort.

221
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,440
If my second daughter
became his concubine,

222
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,100
wouldn't that be ridiculous?

223
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,870
Even if I agreed,

224
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,960
surely Her Ladyship wouldn't.

225
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,150
I agree.

226
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,550
What's wrong with two sisters

227
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,840
sharing a husband?

228
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,390
Oh right, Mrs. Liu,

229
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,790
I heard that

230
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,390
your daughter's birth chart
is incredibly auspicious,

231
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,000
and she's a perfect match for the prince.

232
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,750
Why don't you seize

233
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,010
this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity?

234
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,480
My daughter's…

235
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,130
birth chart is indeed good,

236
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,870
b-but…

237
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,370
her grandfather just passed away.

238
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,360
She's still in mourning.

239
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,480
But if I recall correctly,

240
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,880
your father passed away
over ten years ago.

241
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,670
Why do I feel that

242
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,840
none of you want

243
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,200
your daughters to marry Heng?

244
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,150
Is there something wrong with him?

245
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,030
No.

246
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,150
My Lady, you've misunderstood.

247
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,350
His Highness is brilliant and valiant.

248
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,630
It's not that my daughter

249
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,870
refuses to be his concubine.

250
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,790
It's just…

251
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,360
just that…

252
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,240
there's still Song Yimeng.

253
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,840
Yeah.

254
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,270
I-It's because of Song Yimeng.

255
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,080
Me?

256
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,630
Exactly.

257
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,200
Everyone in the capital knows that

258
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,480
Miss Song is rude, spoiled,

259
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,680
grumpy, and jealous.

260
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,030
If any other girl had to
share His Highness with you,

261
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,230
she'd be tormented to death.

262
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:05,800
[Misty Milk Tea]

263
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,790
Yes!

264
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:09,780
Song Yimeng

265
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,240
is downright vicious.

266
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,480
She has done more wrongs

267
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,600
than you can count.

268
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,150
S-Song Yimeng

269
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,390
bullied people

270
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,400
and terrorized her neighbors.

271
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,000
Song Yimeng

272
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,960
kicked down widows' doors,

273
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,180
dug up graves,

274
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,690
and beat up the disabled.

275
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,670
Yes, yes, yes!

276
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,110
Exactly!

277
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:32,750
Yeah.

278
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,480
Yeah.

279
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,080
Yeah.

280
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,870
Yeah, yeah.

281
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,450
I see what's going on now.

282
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,550
So basically,

283
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,430
you're trashing me

284
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,860
just to get out of marrying Nan Heng, huh?

285
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,790
What trashing?

286
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,030
Heng?

287
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,530
What are you doing here?

288
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,790
The ladies

289
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,540
were just talking about
your marriage to Yimeng.

290
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,030
I just caught a few fugitives

291
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,030
and gutted them

292
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,960
in the celestial prison.

293
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,550
I was passing by the Fanghua Hall,

294
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,150
so I dropped in to see you.

295
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,240
I heard that

296
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,240
you don't want to marry
your daughters to me

297
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,670
because of my principal consort.

298
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,600
Well then,

299
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,550
since I'm here today,

300
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,440
if any of you are truly interested,

301
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,640
come up and let me
take a good look at you.

302
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,350
If it feels right,

303
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,240
I'll

304
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,670
divorce Song Yimeng.

305
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,360
Why are you so quiet?

306
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,670
What are you trying to do?

307
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,630
I'm bored.

308
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,720
Just having a bit of fun.

309
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,390
What's your name?

310
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:36,840
I...

311
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,600
I'm…

312
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,030
the daughter

313
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,440
of Qiao Yue,

314
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,480
Vice Director of the Palace Library.

315
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,240
My name is…

316
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,870
Q-Q-Qiao…

317
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,200
So you're a stutterer.

318
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
So useless.

319
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,320
Maybe I should throw her in prison
and have her executed.

320
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,120
Mother.

321
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,790
Mother.

322
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,960
My Lady.

323
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,600
This...

324
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,660
You.

325
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,710
Just now, I heard Mrs. Song say

326
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,960
your birth chart matches mine best.

327
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,150
What year were you born?

328
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,910
The…

329
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,730
the year of Renyin.

330
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,150
Renyin? Then you're a tiger.

331
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,870
But if you're a tiger,

332
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,590
that clashes with my sign.

333
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,030
If you marry me,

334
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,360
will I bring misfortune on you,

335
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,320
or will you bring misfortune on me?

336
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,250
I wouldn't dare.

337
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,670
You wouldn't dare?

338
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,240
Then you must've lied to Her Ladyship.

339
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,430
In the Xuanjia Army,

340
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,950
lying like that gets you gutted

341
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,880
and your heart boiled and eaten.

342
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,770
Please forgive us, My Lady.

343
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,370
Please spare us.

344
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,660
Some street fortune-teller

345
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,480
told me that!

346
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,270
I would never dare lie to you!

347
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,530
Weren't the two of you
the loudest ones earlier?

348
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,240
Why so quiet now?

349
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,250
Say something!

350
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,820
Your Highness.

351
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,150
Please forgive us!

352
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,440
Please spare us!

353
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,440
Spreading lies and causing trouble—

354
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,120
the two of you should be thrown in prison

355
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,780
and have your tongues cut out!

356
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,270
My Lady.

357
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,390
My Lady, save us!

358
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:26,600
My Lady!

359
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
My Lady, save us!

360
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,600
I'll say it one more time today—

361
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,820
Song Yimeng

362
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,000
is marrying me because I begged her to.

363
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,030
Her honor

364
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,480
is my honor.

365
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,990
Anyone who disrespected me

366
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,190
has already died by my sword.

367
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,340
Anyone who dares disrespect her—

368
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,270
go ahead, try it.

369
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,270
Please spare us.

370
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:53,720
Please spare us.

371
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,320
Please spare us.

372
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,870
Please spare us.

373
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,870
Please spare us.

374
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,480
Please spare us.

375
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,240
Please spare us.

376
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,200
Please spare us.

377
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,550
My Lady, please save us.

378
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,880
My Lady, please save us.

379
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:06,880
My Lady.

380
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,200
My Lady.

381
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,160
What's wrong with you?

382
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,680
My Lady.

383
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,310
My Lady.

384
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:09,750
My Lady.

385
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,310
Mother!

386
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,349
My Lady.

387
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,609
Mother, what's wrong?

388
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,680
Send for the imperial physician.

389
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,349
Go!

390
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:15,000
Yes.

391
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,440
There's milk in it?

392
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,960
Mother has a weak stomach.

393
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,089
She can't take milk.

394
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:26,550
I made it for Her Ladyship.

395
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,190
I didn't know she couldn't have milk.

396
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,920
My Lady.

397
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,510
My Lady.

398
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,200
You should let the servants

399
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,480
prepare the medicine.

400
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,480
Sitting in the draft
in the middle of the night—

401
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
if you fall ill,

402
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,890
are you going to blame me for it?

403
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,240
Her Ladyship fell ill because she drank

404
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,300
the milk tea I made.

405
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,090
I have to do something

406
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,480
to make up for it.

407
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,680
Did I

408
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,750
scare you today?

409
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,680
You're always either yelling at me

410
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,140
or threatening to kill me.

411
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,440
I'm used to it.

412
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,000
Can you not be so sarcastic?

413
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,080
In this palace, people are tricky.

414
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,680
You can never be too careful.

415
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,080
You may not hurt others,

416
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,970
but others may want to hurt you.

417
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,480
Soon after you got into the palace,

418
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,030
you prepared food for Mother.

419
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,290
That was a big mistake.

420
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,790
What if someone had tried to poison her?

421
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,650
What if they had framed you for it?

422
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,960
This is a romance drama.

423
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,830
It can't be so serious.

424
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,470
What did you just mutter?

425
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,480
Nothing.

426
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,570
I heard you loud and clear, Your Highness.

427
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,790
Here.

428
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,480
Your Highness.

429
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,480
This medicine

430
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:40,350
was prepared exactly
as the imperial physician instructed.

431
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,440
Now that you've touched it,

432
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,830
if something goes wrong,

433
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,160
it's on you.

434
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,030
Thank you.

435
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,190
I said…

436
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,590
thank you.

437
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,370
Are you thanking me?

438
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,090
Are you out of your mind?

439
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,310
You're the one who's out of your mind.

440
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,110
Fine.

441
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,750
I'm just out of my mind.

442
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,070
That's why I thanked you.

443
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,800
Just take it as an insult.

444
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,110
Anyway,

445
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,970
you're not used to being thanked.

446
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,480
I've been insulted by plenty of people.

447
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
One more doesn't make a difference.

448
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,680
You said all those terrifying things

449
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,240
in front of those ladies today.

450
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,610
What if they took them seriously?

451
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,440
To them,

452
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm just the murderous God of Death.

453
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,310
Then explain it to those

454
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,790
who misunderstand you.

455
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,160
Tell them the truth.

456
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,800
If I

457
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,880
explained it to you,

458
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,080
would you believe me?

459
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,120
They call me God of Death.

460
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,930
Isn't that what you think too?

461
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,480
The world insults and curses me.

462
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,410
And haven't you done the same?

463
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,630
If even you won't believe me,

464
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,480
why would I bother
explaining myself to anyone else?

465
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,060
Was I…

466
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,720
a little too harsh on you?

467
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,160
Yeah, you were.

468
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,070
But...

469
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,880
it's fine.

470
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,680
Miss Song drew this painting herself.

471
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,750
Please make sure it gets to Mr. Li.

472
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,240
Well, well, Yunlong,

473
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,240
I didn't think I'd live to see

474
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,920
the day you caught feelings.

475
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,240
Why is it you?

476
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,070
Do I know you?

477
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,440
Lewd.

478
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,640
You don't know me,

479
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,830
and you're calling me lewd?

480
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,160
You showed up uninvited

481
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,890
and insulted me when you saw me.

482
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,790
I'm just telling the truth.

483
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,760
You were out there on the street,

484
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,370
arms around two girls.

485
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,160
I wonder

486
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,000
why such an upright guy like Mr. Li

487
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,240
keeps someone like you around.

488
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,160
Fine.

489
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,110
Guess I'm just unlucky
to have run into you,

490
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,880
okay?

491
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,480
Yunlong,

492
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,750
let's go.

493
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,240
You forgot the drawing.

494
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,970
The drawing.

495
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:41,680
You…

496
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,640
you drew me this time?

497
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,310
A fine sword for a noble man;

498
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,720
a bamboo branch for a graceful lady.

499
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,880
May I ask,

500
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,680
what's your name?

501
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,480
The 73rd painting.

502
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,440
It's only…

503
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,040
It's only the third day of the month.

504
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,190
Miss Song Yiting, your hands

505
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,310
are surprisingly strong.

506
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,240
I like drawing.

507
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,480
I want to draw. I'm good at it.

508
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,660
What's it to you?

509
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,970
Stop beating around the bush.

510
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,400
Where is

511
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,790
Mr. Li?

512
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,550
I must see him today.

513
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,270
Chief

514
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,590
isn't here.

515
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,480
He's not here right now,

516
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,080
but he might come back later.

517
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,600
Yunlong,

518
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,480
go take Miss Song Yiting
upstairs to rest for a bit.

519
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,290
Chief will be here soon.

520
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,550
Stop!

521
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,410
Second Master.

522
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,470
This is not appropriate.

523
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,400
What are you planning to do to Chief's

524
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
sister-in-law while he's not here?

525
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,400
You jerk.

526
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,880
Am I that kind of person?

527
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,440
Really?

528
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:56,960
Yes.

529
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,640
No!

530
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,590
Look.

531
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,590
Three days,

532
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,830
73 paintings.

533
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,360
She's obsessed with Chief.

534
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,350
If we let her

535
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,960
keep showing up like this,

536
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,680
she'll end up causing trouble
for Chief sooner or later.

537
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,000
If Chief's in trouble,

538
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,880
I'll be in trouble too.

539
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,960
So in the end,

540
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,350
I made this mess,

541
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,920
and I have to clean it up.

542
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,070
So what's your plan?

543
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,200
I'm a pro

544
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,830
at breakups.

545
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:33,920
Miss.

546
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,640
Have a seat.

547
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,510
Shannai.

548
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,790
No need.

549
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,480
The things outside

550
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,510
are dirty.

551
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,750
Waning River Crescent is too shabby.

552
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,950
I hope you don't mind.

553
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,110
Don't get me wrong, Mr. Li.

554
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,880
I'm just really into cleanliness

555
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,140
and never eat outside.

556
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,450
It's not that I'm being picky.

557
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,510
No worries,

558
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,880
I get it.

559
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,510
You're someone who appreciates kindness.

560
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:19,070
I helped you once,

561
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,410
and you sent me 73 paintings

562
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,030
in three days.

563
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,240
I really do appreciate the thought.

564
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,000
As long as you like them.

565
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,200
But sometimes, when you go overboard,

566
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,860
it ends up becoming pressure.

567
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,440
You're elegant

568
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,430
and admired by everyone.

569
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,200
If you were in danger,

570
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,240
anyone would step in to help.

571
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,750
What I did

572
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,340
was not worth mentioning.

573
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,030
But

574
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,720
if you really want to thank me,

575
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,480
why don't we just have some tea together

576
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,070
and become friends?

577
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,270
After that,

578
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,590
you don't have to thank me again.

579
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,920
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

580
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,240
I went overboard

581
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,200
and made you feel uncomfortable.

582
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,350
I get what you're saying.

583
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,970
I won't send you

584
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,510
any more paintings.

585
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,310
Mr. Li,

586
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,830
I didn't send you

587
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,640
those paintings just to say thank you.

588
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,640
Like you said,

589
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,940
I sent you 73 paintings in three days.

590
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,830
Who does that

591
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,400
just to say thank you?

592
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,880
I like you.

593
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,110
But you're pretty, talented,

594
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,070
and from a powerful family.

595
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,730
You're like a cloud in the sky.

596
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,720
I have nothing to my name

597
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,110
and am always risking my life.

598
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,480
I'm like the mud on the ground.

599
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,880
We are so different.

600
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,160
You're way out of my league.

601
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,500
How about this?

602
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,640
Let's finish this cup of tea

603
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,750
and go our separate ways.

604
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,550
I see.

605
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,070
Mr. Li,

606
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,110
you're refusing me.

607
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,310
Falling petals want to follow the stream,

608
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,880
but the stream has no interest in them.

609
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,790
Love

610
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,070
can't be forced.

611
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,960
I'll drink…

612
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,350
this cup of tea.

613
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,800
Sure, I'm a cloud in the sky,

614
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,750
but since I like you,

615
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,830
you're hardly mud on the ground.

616
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,880
I'm just surprised that

617
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,110
someone as free-spirited as you

618
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,680
would care about family status.

619
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,730
You've lived a sheltered life.

620
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
How could you know how tough life is?

621
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,880
People in the martial world

622
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,400
don't get a monthly salary,

623
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,400
own land, or have houses.

624
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,740
Home is wherever we go.

625
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,270
You won't even drink from a cup here,

626
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,270
but I'm usually out there

627
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:40,350
surviving on whatever I can find.

628
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,200
I can drink this tea,

629
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,840
but it looks like you can't.

630
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,830
It seems you didn't get my point.

631
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,030
I...

632
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,750
I get it.

633
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,000
You don't get a salary,

634
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,550
but I can support you
with my monthly allowance

635
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,640
from my family.

636
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,830
Land and houses are no problem.

637
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,260
Across all 36 prefectures of Great Jing,

638
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,480
the Song family has estates everywhere.

639
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,110
If you want to roam the world,

640
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,680
as long as you marry me,

641
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
my home will be your home.

642
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,590
No, wait,

643
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,210
how could I accept that?

644
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,960
I'd be living off a woman.

645
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,790
When two people love each other,

646
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,070
nothing else matters.

647
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,070
If you keep me happy,

648
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,350
who cares who pays the bills?

649
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,170
B-But what if I don't like you?

650
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,840
What if I'm not into you?

651
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,270
Then I'll make you fall for me.

652
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,660
You just said it yourself,

653
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,880
someone like me

654
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,440
is admired by countless people.

655
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:54,680
But

656
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,550
I'm not one of them.

657
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,350
Look at me.

658
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,030
I love freedom.

659
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,960
I don't want to be tied to anyone.

660
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,240
Mr. Li,

661
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,270
running a place this big

662
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,720
must give you little freedom.

663
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,560
You hit the nail on the head.

664
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:17,880
That's right.

665
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,770
I need to keep
Waning River Crescent running.

666
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,030
Building a career

667
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,510
is my top priority right now.

668
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,350
Romance

669
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,830
just gets in the way of business

670
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,830
and making money.

671
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,200
A month has 30 days.

672
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,640
I spend five playing the qin,

673
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,680
five reading,

674
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,720
five painting,

675
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,640
five out with my friends,

676
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,510
and five with my parents.

677
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,750
The days I need you

678
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,270
add up to just five.

679
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,680
On those five days,

680
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,480
I'll pay you double your daily take.

681
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,830
You won't lose a cent.

682
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,840
[Three years ago]

683
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,830
I can run it for you.

684
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,580
But let me make it clear.

685
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,150
A month has 30 days.

686
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,590
I spend five traveling,

687
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,880
five playing the flute,

688
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,160
five feasting,

689
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,440
five visiting old friends,

690
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,400
and five…

691
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,550
I'm not telling you.

692

In short,

693

695

How's that?

696
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:15,960
Wait,

697
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,690
is that how you treat feelings?

698
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,440
Can money fix everything?

699
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,270
Can your money buy company

700
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,350
or true affection?

701
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,070
Money is just a worldly thing.

702
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,880
If money can solve matters of the heart,

703
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,240
why not use it?

704
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,590
What I want is you

705
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,740
and your heart.

706
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,720
Love not weighed down by money

707
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,590
is the purest love of all.

708

is there anyone else?

731

My Lady,

732

isn't that a little too obvious?

733

Since drinking the milk tea yesterday,

741
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,670
I've been feeling so uncomfortable.

742
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,280
Fine, I'll go.

743
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,480
I'll go right now.

744
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,840
I heard you made a scene
in the Fanghua Hall yesterday

745
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,880
and scared those
noble ladies half to death.

746
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,670
Song Yimeng is my principal consort.

747
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,800
How could I let people speak ill of her?

748
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,360
Judging from your tone,

749
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,760
the marriage with the Song family

750
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,400
is already set in stone.

751

Uncle, why does this
matter concern you so much?

752
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
Regarding the enfeoffment,

753
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,630
it's clear that His Majesty
has revived the old rule

754
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,440
from the previous dynasty
just to target you.

755
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,480
Yet the Eighteenth Prince
runs to the Song Residence every day,

756
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,920

757
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,030
with attention and gifts,

758
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,110
showing no restraint at all.

759
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,970
I have my own plan for the enfeoffment.

760
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,550
As for Nan Rui,

761
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,320
although I don't know Song Yiting,

762
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,880
I doubt she thinks much of Nan Rui.

763
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,110
Miss Song Yiting may not care,

764
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,840
but her mother, Madam Zhou, clearly does.

765
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,880
My view remains the same:

766
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,000
rather than letting
Miss Song Yiting marry someone else

767
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,730
and strengthen another force,

768
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,480
you should marry both Song sisters.

769
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,800
A wife should be chosen for her virtue,

770
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,260
a concubine for her looks.

771
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:48,070
We need to get a firm grip
on the Song family's power.

772
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,360
