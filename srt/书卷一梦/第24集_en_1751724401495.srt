I'm sorry.

91
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,280
Why would you do this?

92
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,360
Are you Han Shang Cuong or is it just me?

93
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,960
Why are you here and doing this?

94
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,240
I...

95
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,320
I want to go home with you.

96
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,960
We still work atπε cleau.

97
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
Let's go.

98
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,480
We switch places.

99
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
Okay.

100
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Get off.

101
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,700
I love you.

102
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,680
So awesome.

103
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,480
Let me explain that..

104
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,740
Alright.

105
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
I should change my destiny

106
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,000
You say

107
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,440
I listen to you

108
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,040
How to write the ending

109
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,280
How to write the ending

110
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,640
Please tell me

111
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,440
You can't even say a word

112
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,640
What do you want me to hear you explain

113
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm sorry

114
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,680
I

115
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,960
Aunt Zi Yu

116
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,280
You approached me without hesitation

117
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,800
Use me

118
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,640
You see me like a fool

119
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,960
You played it short

120
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,600
Are you satisfied now

121
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,600
I'm really a fool

122
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,960
I thought all the hurt you encountered

123
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,480
I was all involved

124
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,040
I've been worried all the time

125
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,960
You will be hurt by Nan Heng

126
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,520
I've been worried about you all the time

127
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,120
But you

128
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,240
You

129
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,880
You've been lying to me all the time

130
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,440
You've been using me all the time

131
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,960
No

132
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,280
Listen to me

133
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
Stop it

134
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,800
You don't have to say anything

135
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,880
Nan Heng

136
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,640
You have so many chances to explain to me

137
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,320
But you never told me

138
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,800
You never

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,240
It's not like that

140
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,000
I didn't lie to you on purpose

141
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,040
Can you believe me

142
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,800
Just believe me once

143
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,160
What do you want me to believe you

144
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,560
Believe you are not Nan Heng

145
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,000
Or Qin Li Shiliu

146
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,400
Never told me

147
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,800
Never lied to me

148
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,480
Say something

149
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,840
I want you to say something

150
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,040
I've never seen it

151
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,280
It's always like this

152
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,440
I can die in confusion

153
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,160
Su Yunmeng

154
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,720
Let me go

155
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,320
Su Yunmeng

156
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,040
What should I do

157
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,600
I want you to let me go

158
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,680
I want you to let me go

159
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,960
Did you hear me

160
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,040
Okay

161
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,360
You don't let go

162
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,160
Don't let go

163
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,480
I do

164
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,880
Please

165
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,480
Don'taut depressed

166
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,660
I

167
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,800
I said I laughed

168
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,640
I'm sorry

169
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,840
My upper lip

170
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,680
Getting used to

171
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,680
Because you will only make me hate you more.

172
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
Do you understand?

173
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,680
Let the blue sky block my blood-red hair.

174
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,680
Let me be separated from the world for the next life.

175
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,680
Did you find it?

176
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,680
General, we've searched everywhere.

177
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
No one is here.

178
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
Search the place below.

179
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Yes.

180
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,680
Let's go back to the past.

181
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
Miss Song?

182
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Where is Li Shiliu?

183
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
His business has nothing to do with me.

184
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
Miss Song.

185
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
What do you mean?

186
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,680
The case of the King's Mansion is still going to arrest innocent people?

187
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Please forgive me, Miss Song.

188
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
This matter is related to the court's case.

189
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,680
You'd better explain it to the general yourself.

190
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,680
The King's Mansion

191
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,680
The King's Mansion

192
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
Fugui.

193
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,680
Song Yimeng has been taken away by Ronghua.

194
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
You go to Chu Guihong Mansion.

195
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
Keep an eye on the things there.

196
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,680
Report to me at any time.

197
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,680
I'm talking to you.

198
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,680
The King's Mansion

199
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,680
How long are you going to keep it from me?

200
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,680
Uncle, do you want to ask me about the crime?

201
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
You are my staff.

202
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,680
I don't need to explain to you.

203
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,680
The Shangguan White Crane has been hidden by the King for three years.

204
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,680
Don't you need to explain this to me?

205
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,680
The old father was in the disaster relief fund.

206
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,680
I have told you the serious situation.

207
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,680
I gave you the last chance for the sake of my mother.

208
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,680
The most ignorant and ignorant people

209
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,680
know the truth of the relationship.

210
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Do you want to push your old father into the disaster relief fund?

211
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,680
Are you really a man of evil?

212
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
I'm not a man of evil.

213
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,680
I'm a man of evil.

214
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,680
I'm a man of evil.

215
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
I'm a man of evil.

216
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,680
A man of evil?

217
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
I'm a man of evil?

218
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,680
What my uncle has done these years

219
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,680
I've always been a man of evil.

220
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,680
If it weren't for the love of my life

221
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,680
I would have already confessed your crime to the whole world.

222
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,680
You don't know how many times you have died.

223
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,680
Since we're talking about this today

224
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,680
I have something to ask you.

225
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,680
The battle of Pingrong.

226
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,680
Have you ever touched your hands and feet?

227
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,680
No.

228
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,680
Never.

229
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,680
Okay.

230
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,680
I believe you for the time being.

231
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,680
But if I ever know that you have done anything to betray the country

232
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,680
even if you were my uncle

233
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,680
I would never let you off.

234
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,680
I understand.

235
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,680
Your Highness is thinking that I'm old and useless

236
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,680
and want to get rid of you.

237
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,680
I don't want to talk about this with you.

238
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,680
Chu Guihong has already targeted Cang Jiangyue

239
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,680
and found out the truth sooner or later.

240
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
If you don't get rid of Shangguan Baihe

241
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,680
you, me, your mother and the lives of the Gao family

242
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,680
will be the ones who will be buried.

243
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,680
The one who will be buried is not me.

244
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,680
It's you.

245
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,680
General.

246
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,680
Meng.

247
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,680
Li Shiliu is Shangguan He's criminal.

248
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,680
Why are you still looking for him?

249
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,680
What did you say?

250
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,680
Chu Guihong

251
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
even if Shangguan He is guilty

252
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
he has the right to be punished.

253
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,680
He has the right to be punished.

254
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,680
He has the right to be punished.

255
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
He has the right to be punished.

256
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
He has the right to be punished.

257
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
Even if Shangguan He is guilty

258
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,680
the other people in Ye Yousheng are innocent.

259
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
You don't have to talk for them.

260
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,680
They are all the party members of Nan Heng.

261
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,680
No one is innocent.

262
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
What are you talking about?

263
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,680
Why are you like this now?

264
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,680
When you were young

265
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,680
did you forget what you said before your aunt's funeral?

266
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,680
I never forgot.

267
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
I won't let anyone innocent die.

268
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,680
This is what I, Chu Guihong, said.

269
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,680
It's also my current condition.

270
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
Everything I did

271
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,680
was just doing things according to the law.

272
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,680
But they sealed the Cangjiang Courtyard

273
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
and arrested Ye Yousheng.

274
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
This is what involves the innocent.

275
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,680
They saved my life before

276
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,680
and helped you and Qianyu Jun.

277
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
But now

278
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,680
you are forcing them to do nothing.

279
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,120
Of course, Onento Ono.

280
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,720
How much do you actually care for Li Shliu?

281
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,680
You force me?

282
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
I force you?

283
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
What do you mean?

284
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,780
You force me to become like Nan Heng.

285
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,560
He is your enemy.

286
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,880
So you don't blame him for using evil tricks to deceive you.

287
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But I

288
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,400
was born to be a good person like you think.

289
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,720
I have to be questioned by you for using some dirty tricks.

290
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Why?

291
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,720
Why good people have to be with bad people again and again?

292
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,520
Good people have to watch you being with bad people but can't do anything.

293
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,320
Just to prove that you are a good person.

294
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Chu Gui Hong

295
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
Being a good person

296
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,680
is not to prove anything to others.

297
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,600
But to ask for peace and good.

298
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,880
The old king has been working hard to accompany you for more than 20 years.

299
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,320
If he sees your dirty tricks now...

300
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,600
If I didn't choose to be a good person that day,

301
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,320
maybe my father wouldn't die.

302
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,720
If I should be a good person,

303
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,920
I should fight back.

304
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,520
I should watch my father die.

305
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,720
I should let the person I love die.

306
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Then I would rather

307
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,120
be more cruel than Nan Heng.

308
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Even worse.

309
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,520
Your Majesty, long live Your Majesty.

310
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,520
Long live Your Majesty.

311
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,520
Rise.

312
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

313
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,520
Your Majesty, I have something to report.

314
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,520
I heard that the capital of Jingzhao has been in a lot of trouble recently.

315
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
Tell me.

316
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,120
Tell me.

317
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,120
Recently, I caught a man from Jianghu.

318
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,120
His name is Bai He.

319
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,520
I found out that he was the thief who escaped from the robbery case three years ago.

320
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,120
Now he has changed.

321
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,920
He became the second leader of Ye You Shen.

322
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,120
The robbery case in Jianghu.

323
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,320
Isn't this the case of the old wife?

324
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,520
I still remember that the criminal was already arrested.

325
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,520
Your Majesty, you are right.

326
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,520
I suspect that the wife was involved in the case.

327
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,120
Now she has colluded with Ye You Shen.

328
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:27,120
I beg Your Majesty to order me to lead the army of Qianyu to investigate the case.

329
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,520
If so, I...

330
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,320
Your Majesty, think twice.

331
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,320
General Chu has no evidence.

332
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,120
Even if you want to accuse me,

333
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,120
you should at least listen to the wife.

334
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,720
What's there to say?

335
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,120
After the investigation is over,

336
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,520
I will give you all the evidence.

337
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,520
How can a prince be accused of something he doesn't know?

338
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,520
You can't just say that you have been caught.

339
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,120
Minister Song, you are the head of the six departments.

340
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,120
What do you think of this?

341
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,720
Minister Song.

342
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
Minister Song.

343
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,720
Minister Song.

344
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,320
I want to ask you something.

345
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,920
What is it?

346
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,120
I'm sleepy.

347
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,920
It's about the old wife.

348
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,520
The old wife?

349
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,920
My family has a feud with the old wife.

350
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,720
So it's not appropriate to ask me about the old wife.

351
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,720
General Chu suspects me.

352
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,720
Then I will testify.

353
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,720
I don't need to involve anyone else.

354
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,720
But today, I have something to report.

355
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,720
Your Majesty,

356
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,120
recently, the people who have colluded with the world

357
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,920
have been involved in many incidents.

358
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,120
It's the leader of the army of Qianyu,

359
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,720
Chu Guihong, who accused me.

360
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,520
What nonsense!

361
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,720
You are so bold!

362
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
Old wife,

363
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,720
is it your fault to accuse me?

364
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,320
Your Majesty is right.

365
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,320
But that day, when the mountain was on fire,

366
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,920
General Chu led the army of Qianyu to guard the mountain.

367
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,520
I was still able to assassinate him.

368
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,120
Now I think it's also a good thing.

369
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,120
Today, General Chu has also destroyed the city and destroyed the East Lake.

370
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,720
So I have to say something.

371
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,120
Then tell me.

372
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,320
The assassination case of Deng Jie has been closed.

373
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,520
It was done by the people of Jianghu.

374
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,720
But there are two reasons why I don't explain.

375
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,320
One, the person who was responsible for the defense of Deng Jie that day was the army of Qianyu.

376
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,520
A wounded person in Jianghu

377
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,920
was able to stand out in the hands of General Chu and several thousand soldiers of Qianyu.

378
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,720
This is strange.

379
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,120
So I think someone should have a reason to do it.

380
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,920
The second reason is that the person who came to do it was also strange.

381
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
And there was no mastermind behind it.

382
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,120
So I was very worried at that time.

383
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,120
Why don't you want to investigate it?

384
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,720
I had to use the state to be stable and temporarily cut off.

385
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,920
A few days ago, General Chu was accused of the case of Baihe.

386
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,520
He forced me to go to the prison in Jingzhao.

387
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,720
But coincidentally, I met a man who robbed the prison.

388
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,320
I was also injured.

389
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,920
What's more,

390
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,120
General Chu didn't catch the mastermind behind it.

391
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,120
He buried everything in the body of Ye Youshen.

392
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,520
You mean the assassin and the person who robbed the prison

393
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,520
are not the people of Cang Jiangyue?

394
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,120
Your Majesty is wise.

395
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,720
I suspect that General Chu hired people from Jianghu

396
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,320
to assassinate and rob two cases and then frame Cang Jiangyue.

397
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,520
Your Highness, if there is no evidence, you can convict him.

398
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,520
What's the use of the law of the Great Jin?

399
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,320
Did you hear it, old man?

400
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,720
Everything should have evidence.

401
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,920
If you just guess...

402
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,920
I have evidence.

403
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,120
Announce.

404
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,120
Announce.

405
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,920
Do you recognize this mask?

406
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,320
Yes.

407
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,520
If Lord Chu is dead,

408
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,520
I believe that 18th Prince knows the origin of this mask.

409
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,120
Yes.

410
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,520
Old man, don't be so dumb.

411
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,920
Just say it.

412
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,320
Your Majesty,

413
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,920
a few days ago, I was in Shangyuan,

414
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,520
General Chu took this mask

415
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,920
and made a scene in Cang Jiangyue.

416
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,920
He had a grudge against Ye Youshen.

417
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,920
There were many people who were involved.

418
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,720
18th Prince was also there.

419
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,320
Is there anything else you want to say, General Chu?

420
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,520
Chu Gui Hong, how do you explain this?

421
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,520
I disguised as Li Shiliu

422
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,120
to find out if Ye Youshen and 7th Prince had colluded.

423
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,320
Collusion?

424
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,520
General Chu, do you think

425
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,520
I and Ye Youshen are both illegal?

426
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,520
It's a crime to accuse the court of corruption.

427
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,120
Your Majesty,

428
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,120
I think that both assassinations and rapes are Chu Gui Hong's revenge.

429
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,720
He can harm me and frame Ye Youshen.

430
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
Chu Gui Hong is a member of the imperial court.

431
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,720
He is guilty of revenge.

432
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,520
Nan He, you are accusing him of corruption.

433
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
This is a crime of deceiving the emperor.

434
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,320
Stop arguing.

435
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,720
The prince and the imperial court are fighting each other.

436
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,920
What do you think?

437
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,120
You are fighting with a wild man.

438
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,520
You are causing chaos in the court.

439
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,920
I think that this Shangguan Bai He is a murderer.

440
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,120
So, why don't you kill him tomorrow?

441
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,720
Your Majesty, this case has not been investigated.

442
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,120
Please reconsider.

443
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,320
I understand that you are kind.

444
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320
But if Shangguan Bai He is not killed,

445
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,320
this case will never be solved.

446
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,320
For the sake of justice,

447
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,520
you should be the one to be executed.

448
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,120
If that thief dies under your sword,

449
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,120
you should be punished for the crime of defamation.

450
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,720
You should be honest and confess your crime of colluding with someone to assassinate the prince.

451
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,720
And resign from the imperial court.

452
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,920
You will be pardoned.

453
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,520
Stop talking nonsense.

454
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,320
What if Shangguan Bai He and Ye Youshen are fighting each other?

455
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,120
They will not be able to kill the thief.

456
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,520
I will report to the emperor

457
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,120
to make an apology for the crime of defamation.

458
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,820
Don't eat too fast before你想答应我.

459
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,320
Uncle passed the preliminary selection exam today.

460
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,120
Yes.

461
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,920
Nan Hao.

462
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,920
Yesterday I told Shang Guan He that I would lose my life if I trusted you wrong.

463
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
Today you really disappointed me.

464
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,080
Thank you.

465
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,960
In this way,

466
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,800
I won't have any more worries no matter what I do.

467
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,720
Why do you talk to him so much?

468
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,120
Such a despicable person.

469
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,880
You have the same air as his breath.

470
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,120
It makes me feel disgusting.

471
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,760
Let's go.

472
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
Miss.

473
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,440
Miss, at least have some food.

474
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,200
Miss.

475
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,520
You locked yourself in the room for a whole day.

476
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,880
What happened to you?

477
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,120
Tell us.

478
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,920
Miss.

479
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,120
Miss.

480
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,120
Miss.

481
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
Miss.

482
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,120
Miss.

483
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
Miss.

484
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
If the palace orders,

485
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,120
Shang Guan He will be beheaded.

486
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,120
Please save him.

487
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,120
Save him.

488
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Your Highness.

489
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,120
Prime Minister Gao has destroyed all the clothes in the mansion about Li Shi Liu.

490
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
And Shang Guan He.

491
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,320
Now,

492
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,320
the people who guard the prison of Jin Zhao mansion are the soldiers of Qian Yu.

493
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,320
And the people who are from the Imperial Army that Prime Minister Gao asked from His Majesty.

494
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,920
My uncle is really a man of deep heart.

495
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,520
He really wants me to completely break the wall of Ye You Shen.

496
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,720
He is the only one I can rely on in the future.

497
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
Your Highness.

498
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,320
Tomorrow,

499
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,320
will you really kill Shang Guan He?

500
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
I will.

501
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
I will kill him.

502
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
I will kill him.

503
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,920
Now His Majesty forces me to commit a crime.

504
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,120
Chu Gui Hong forces me to admit my crime.

505
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,920
Even my uncle

506
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,120
is forcing me to kill people.

507
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,320
Everyone wants me to be the pawn that they can't control.

508
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,520
But even if the path of the poor is blocked,

509
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,320
I have to kill a blood dragon.

510
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,920
I'm afraid that I can't save Shang Guan He.

511
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,320
I have only one way.

512
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,320
What is it?

513
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,720
I will start from the case of that year.

514
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,720
I will completely erase his crime.

515
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,920
It's only one night. I'm afraid it's too late.

516
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
A-Ting, don't worry.

517
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,320
If things don't end well, there will be a turn.

518
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,720
But we don't have any help now.

519
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,120
We can't ask Nan Heng and Chu Gui Hong for help.

520
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,720
And we can't let Father know.

521
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
I think

522
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,520
we should ask Ye You Shen for help.

523
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,920
And delay the execution.

524
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,120
Brother Hu! Brother Hu!

525
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,720
Brother Hu!

526
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,320
Tell me, how's the investigation?

527
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,720
Gao Xiang sent 200 cavalrymen to rescue the soldiers.

528
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,320
They are waiting outside Tian Lang.

529
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:31,920
Two?

530
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,120
It's more difficult to rescue them tonight.

531
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,320
How can we rescue them?

532
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,320
Yeah, we have to be strong.

533
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,520
What's wrong with Nan?

534
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,720
What did Ye You Shen fear?

535
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,520
The worst is to ask the second master to leave first.

536
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,520
We are brothers on the road to the imperial palace.

537
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,920
If you are afraid,

538
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,320
don't follow me.

539
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,920
A-Long, what do you mean?

540
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,920
There are many people in the imperial palace.

541
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,320
If you go, you will die.

542
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,520
I will go.

543
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,920
Stay alive.

544
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,320
We will meet outside the city.

545
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,920
If you die,

546
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
you don't have to rescue us.

547
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,520
No!

548
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,920
The Imperial Palace

549
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,720
Sister-in-law is here.

550
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,120
Which one?

551
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,520
Both of them.

552
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,120
Open the door.

553
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,120
Nan Heng took off the mask in front of you.

554
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,920
He threatened us to leave the capital.

555
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,320
Otherwise, he would kill us.

556
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,920
He said something cruel to you.

557
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,320
He didn't want you to risk your lives.

558
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,520
He is quite kind at this time.

559
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,920
If he is Li Shiliu,

560
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,520
it's normal to say these cruel words.

561
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,720
But he is Nan Heng.

562
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,920
The cruel and ruthless God of Sand

563
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,520
is not our boss.

564
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,920
Li Shiliu and Seventh Prince,

565
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,720
which one is the real Nan Heng?

566
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,920
Sister-in-law,

567
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
don't be too sad.

568
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,320
Nan...

569
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,520
Boss is sincere to you.

570
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
Even if he is like this to us...

571
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,120
Stop.

572
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,320
I don't want to talk about this now.

573
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,720
In this world,

574
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,320
there is no Li Shiliu anymore.

575
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,920
Boss is still here.

576
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Second Master also wants to be rescued.

577
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,720
You are going to the prison?

578
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,120
No!

579
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,920
But the second master is going to be executed tomorrow.

580
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,720
Is there any other way except for the prison?

581
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,720
Of course.

582
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,720
Take some time to solve the case.

583
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,120
Sister-in-law,

584
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,520
can you really save your son?

585
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
Don't talk nonsense.

586
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,520
Be careful, I'm not polite to you.

587
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,520
Shangguan Heng committed a crime.

588
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,520
In the end,

589
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,720
it's still his own money.

590
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,320
As long as he can get rid of this crime,

591
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,320
his head can be saved.

592
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,120
Then you have to think clearly.

593
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,120
Jiangnan case is also a case of the second master.

594
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,320
Then you have to think clearly.

595
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,120
Once Jiangnan case is solved,

596
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
it means that

597
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,320
he is the enemy of Nan Heng.

598
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,320
Even Li Shiliu is fake.

599
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,320
How does Nan Heng think it's important?

600
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,120
I save Shangguan Heng

601
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,320
for my friend,

602
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
for everyone.

603
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,920
It has nothing to do with him.

604
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,720
You are talking nonsense.

605
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,920
Sister-in-law,

606
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,320
actually Boss is not what you think.

607
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
Don't talk nonsense.

608
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,520
It's not as simple as you think.

609
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,520
You don't understand.

610
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,120
I understand.

611
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,520
Why don't I understand him?

612
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,920
You like Li Shiliu.

613
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,120
Li Shiliu likes you too.

614
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,520
You are angry because Boss lied to you.

615
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,320
But Boss is such a person.

616
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,120
He is always tough.

617
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,520
His face is cold,

618
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,720
but his heart is hot.

619
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,520
He usually sees other women

620
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,520
who are not fake.

621
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
But as long as he sees you,

622
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,920
he will be very happy.

623
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,920
He wears a mask.

624
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,720
How do you know if he is happy?

625
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,320
I...

626
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,520
Sister-in-law, who are you helping?

627
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,120
Stop yelling.

628
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,920
I think you are living a comfortable life.

629
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,920
You are always in trouble.

630
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,320
He is so cold.

631
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
He has a crush on you.

632
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,920
Is it easy for him?

633
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,320
Ting,

634
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,720
if Shangguan Heng lied to you,

635
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,720
would you believe he likes you?

636
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,720
Didn't he lie to me like this?

637
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,720
Well...

638
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
It's different.

639
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,920
Yes, it's different.

640
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,720
I'm worse than you.

641
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,520
He ran away when he saw me.

642
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,920
He ran away when he saw me.

643
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,120
But what's the point?

644
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,920
He did lie to you.

645
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,920
But you lied to him too.

646
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,120
Does he like you?

647
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,920
Don't you know?

648
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,520
I saw it.

649
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,320
He secretly drew your portrait in the room.

650
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
He even hid the documents that recorded your information.

651
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,520
He did it several times every day.

652
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,120
By the way,

653
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,320
there are two river ponds.

654
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
Sister-in-law, do you remember?

655
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,120
Every time you quarreled,

656
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,320
he used a stick to break them apart.

657
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,720
He is a fish. Do you know?

658
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
A fish.

659
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,720
Who is Nan Heng?

660
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,120
I don't know.

661
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,720
But Ye Youshen,

662
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,720
Ye Youshen,

663
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,920
16 years apart.

664
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,720
He said he liked you.

665
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,320
He likes you.

666
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,920
You are our sister-in-law.

667
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,320
Now you are.

668
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,720
You will be.

669
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,520
You will always be.

670
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,920
It's a really big tray.

671
00:34:43,720 --> 00:35:07,480
So many

672
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,120
Yes.

673
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,800
Why are you so fond of Shen Ze?

674
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,640
Did you and Shang Guan have an canon vanishing entourage?

675
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,000
Am I soft?

676
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,240
I'm notes to prove it.

677
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,140
soul- historia

678
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,400
Pink fairy

679
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,360
Don't be so hard on yourself

680
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,620
And your pain

681
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:51,360
The

682
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,040
Your Highness.

683
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,360
Today, all eyes of Lord Qianyu are watching.

684
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,040
He can't be in a panic.

685
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,480
Your Highness.

686
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,440
Shangguan is not dead.

687
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,120
Tomorrow, in the hall,

688
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,600
I will be the one who will die.

689
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,640
I hope you can think twice.

690
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,240
Xiangyuan is a high-ranking official.

691
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,520
He has the same taste as Heaven.

692
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,240
Are you kidding me?

693
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,440
The traitor Shangguan Bai He

694
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,520
committed many crimes.

695
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,560
He is not allowed to die.

696
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,200
His Majesty ordered his own troops.

697
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,240
He ordered the Seventh Prince to personally supervise

698
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,240
and execute him immediately.

699
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,720
Your Highness, please give the order.

700
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,640
I am Yan Ming.

701
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,560
Yan Ming?

702
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,840
Why did you die so many times?

703
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,600
If I killed the wrong person,

704
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,160
and His Majesty punished me,

705
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,320
wouldn't it be against your wish?

706
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,840
What are you doing?

707
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,640
You are a man.

708
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,520
When will it end?

709
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,640
You still have to die.

710
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,400
Can't you just let me die faster?

711
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,480
Why do you have to do this?

712
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,080
It's not that easy to die.

713
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,240
What do you mean?

714
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,640
Execute.

715
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,480
Let go!

716
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,640
Look there!

717
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,600
They are all estáre Ladies only!

718
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,800
Oh!

719
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:24,840
Look!

720
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:25,960
A snake!

721
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,440
tôi sẽ làm nó h substantive lُ portalъ

722
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,560
Đ Dee.

723
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,240
So many snakes!

724
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,120
So many snakes!

725
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,080
That's why we need to get to the bottom first.

726
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,180
who mitigated these crimes

727
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,640
Take them off

728
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,280
Hold on, I have something to say

729
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:22,080
Your Highness, I know I'm guilty and I only ask for death.

730
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,080
It's just that I'm a little drunk.

731
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,680
I want to drink some wine to get drunk.

732
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,080
Please allow me.

733
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,480
You're a dead man. How can you talk so much nonsense?

734
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,480
Your Highness, don't blame me.

735
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,480
After drinking this wine, I'll be dead to atone for my sins.

736
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:52,080
If I reveal my identity?

737
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:57,080
I'll atone for my sins with my death.

738
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,080
It's already past noon. Let's go.

739
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,080
I'm the new officer.

740
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,080
Prime Minister, do you want to take the role of the Emperor?

741
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,080
Why are you still delaying after the imperial edict?

742
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:25,080
Are you trying to delay the time deliberately?

743
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:51,080
If things change, we should quickly light the explosives and cause chaos to find a chance to save people.

744
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,080
Ghosts are strong dragons.

745
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,080
Flick the lantern and let the night dragon fly.

746
