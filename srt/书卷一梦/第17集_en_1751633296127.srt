1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sword is heavy.

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the deep roots of the enemy.

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,200
It's better to be a man than to be a man.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am a beast.

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
I am a beast.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
I am a beast.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
I am a beast.

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
I am a beast.

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
I am a beast.

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
I am a beast.

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,600
I will be a hero forever.

13
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,580
The

14
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,580
I am a beast.

15
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,580
I am a beast.

16
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,580
I am a beast.

17
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,580
I am a beast.

18
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,580
I am a beast.

19
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,580
I am a beast.

20
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Episode 1

21
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
I heard that your boss is called Liu.

22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
He is the master of the art of martial arts.

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
He is the master of the art of martial arts.

24
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
He is the master of the art of martial arts.

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Hurry up.

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Tell him to come out and see me.

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
Brother, this bitch is really strong.

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Miss, do you think I look like your future husband?

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
You look like a fly.

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Miss.

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
You look like a fly.

32
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Beautiful.

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
What's wrong?

34
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
What's wrong?

35
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
What's wrong?

36
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Catch that bitch.

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Stop.

38
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
The ghost is strong enough to walk.

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
The ghost is strong enough to walk.

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
The ghost is strong enough to walk.

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
The ghost is strong enough to walk.

42
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
The ghost is strong enough to walk.

43
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
The ghost is strong enough to walk.

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
The ghost is strong enough to walk.

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
I want to ask the mister.

46
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Straighten the hair on his head.

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Who dares to be nagged to leave is to be sinning.

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Si defended the general.

49
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
First time...

50
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,360
I was sure she wouldn't minor

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,760
because of Somethingesters

52
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,860
You said you were going to kill me

53
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,000
What was your mission

54
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,020
Anna

55
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,760
What?

56
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,000
Prosecution

57
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,700
How the hell do you operate the proportion needle

58
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,200
I can self-prote mafia

59
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,340
Which isчитl

60
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,240
So great

61
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,300
I believe all of female maids

62
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,340
in Hua Biao Family

63
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,780
are sarcasms

64
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,060
And also

65
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,120
She did the job

66
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,160
Science

67
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,440
The silver is on this guest's account.

68
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,320
Pay up.

69
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,360
Your grandfather, I...

70
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,400
Shen Tuo, Hu.

71
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,560
This broken axe is worth a few silver taels.

72
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,920
I think,

73
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,960
how about giving it to the lady to calm her nerves?

74
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,840
You see, your axe has disturbed the lady again.

75
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,600
Kneel down and confess.

76
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,000
You stupid...

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,040
Shen Su, Long.

78
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,880
Your boss has kneeled down.

79
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,240
What are you waiting for?

80
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,960
The Sword of the Sword

81
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,720
Peony.

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,120
Su Qi.

83
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,640
Fuchu.

84
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,640
Yongcheng.

85
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,200
Yuejie.

86
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,200
Wu Chi.

87
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,840
The sword is a gift from the jade pearl to the beauty.

88
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,680
May I ask,

89
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,440
why do you call me Fang Ming?

90
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,160
I dare not.

91
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,440
I live in the west of the city.

92
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,200
I live outside the stone bridge.

93
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,520
I live in the Ministry of War of the Imperial Court.

94
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,720
My name is Song Yiting.

95
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,880
Chu Guihong,

96
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,880
since you can shoot him,

97
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,320
why do you have to come to Yangqiu Town

98
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,880
to clean up this mess?

99
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,960
Well, Father.

100
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,480
No, your old master

101
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,080
can't possibly miss this arrow.

102
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,360
He must have done it on purpose.

103
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:50,840
He...

104
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,760
He wanted to drive his cousin out of the capital long ago.

105
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,360
You can't fall into his trap.

106
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,240
Shut up.

107
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,280
You're not a good man.

108
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,280
Your Majesty,

109
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm sorry for the horse farm.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,960
But Seventh Prince

111
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,640
has occupied the capital

112
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,320
and is now in the city of Jianghu.

113
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,240
He's holding the black armor of the army.

114
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,680
He's even trying to win the Song family's seal

115
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,600
to increase his power.

116
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,400
This kind of wild ambition is so weak.

117
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,840
Please make a decision, Your Majesty.

118
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,720
Yes.

119
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,400
Your Majesty.

120
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,440
Your Majesty.

121
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,800
Your Majesty,

122
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,720
they're at the gate of the palace.

123
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,520
The palace?

124
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,800
What are you doing?

125
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Don't make it worse.

126
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,320
If you make His Majesty angry,

127
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,080
he'll be punished.

128
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,200
Chu Guihong is guilty of killing the prince.

129
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,400
I, Yao Qian,

130
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,880
beg Your Majesty to decide.

131
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,840
Please decide, Your Majesty.

132
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,280
I'm going to be found out by you if you keep sighing.

133
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,280
Get up.

134
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,560
Be gentle.

135
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,360
I'm not.

136
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,320
I'm not.

137
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,280
I'm not.

138
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,160
I'm not.

139
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,040
I'm not.

140
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,520
I said that the Seventh Prince is a good move.

141
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,080
You used me to anger Chu Guihong again.

142
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,240
Now His Majesty is angry in front of the palace.

143
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,240
You've stirred up the entire court.

144
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,480
Are you playing too much this time?

145
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,200
Didn't you say that you were pretending to be old?

146
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,480
Just be tough.

147
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,520
You...

148
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,720
This kind of trick that hurts the enemy and hurts yourself.

149
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,320
Only you can do it.

150
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,280
If I don't risk it and let Chu Guihong make a big mistake,

151
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,880
how can you get married?

152
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,680
And let me tell you.

153
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,800
When they come,

154
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,240
you should say what you should say.

155
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,600
Think about it.

156
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
We're all in the same boat.

157
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,240
Let me tell you.

158
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,680
Getting married and getting married to you are two different things.

159
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,440
You're a killer.

160
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,680
You should keep your words.

161
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,640
Don't play with me.

162
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,600
Do you hear me?

163
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,720
Do you hear me?

164
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,840
It hurts.

165
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,040
Do you hear me?

166
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,880
Who is playing with me?

167
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,040
Does the Seventh Prince know it hurts now?

168
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,440
Why didn't you avoid it when you knew it hurt?

169
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,600
His Majesty has arrived.

170
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,880
Please come in.

171
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,840
Please come in.

172
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,640
His Majesty has arrived.

173
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,000
Your Highness.

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,760
Your Highness, are you okay?

175
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,520
Why are you bleeding so much?

176
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,560
Wait a little longer.

177
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,080
You can go to the toilet.

178
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,000
Your Highness.

179
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,760
Mother.

180
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,200
Why are you bleeding so much again?

181
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,840
It's...

182
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,040
It's her.

183
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,520
It's her.

184
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,720
Your Highness.

185
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,240
It's all my fault.

186
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,600
I scared you.

187
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,560
Good girl.

188
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,480
You're just worried about the trouble.

189
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,800
It's okay.

190
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,040
I...

191
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,160
I don't want it.

192
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,880
It's okay.

193
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,000
Go back.

194
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,280
Come here.

195
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,480
Your Majesty.

196
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,000
Song Shi, you may rise.

197
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

198
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,360
You!

199
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,000
Answer me!

200
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,840
Answer me!

201
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,240
Yes.

202
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,120
Your Majesty, Heng is seriously injured.

203
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,360
Can you let him get up and answer me?

204
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,600
Your uncle is trying to force me to attack outside the palace.

205
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,960
What?

206
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,440
You want to defy me here?

207
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,720
I dare not.

208
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,080
How do you want to deal with Chu Guihong?

209
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,040
Your Majesty.

210
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,840
Your Highness.

211
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,840
Chu Guihong is a subordinate of the imperial edict.

212
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,480
He's also the only son of Prince Qian Yi.

213
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,440
He's also a great talent of the country.

214
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,840
If we deal with him,

215
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,800
I believe the officials will be disappointed.

216
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,080
But the Eighth Law of the Qing Dynasty

217
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,800
has a rule.

218
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,880
It's to kill the royal family.

219
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,760
To kill the royal family

220
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,040
is to rebel

221
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,400
and to be executed.

222
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,280
It's hard for me

223
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,680
to do the same as you.

224
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,480
All these bystanders

225
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,800
are at my expense.

226
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,600
The old State'm interested in this huge situation.

227
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,240
But judging by the wound you've done to them,

228
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,040
one inch from the chest and the upper body,

229
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,880
I think that's not serious.

230
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,840
Thank you for your care.

231
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,320
But if Your Majesty

232
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,880
take back the edict and the marriage certificate

233
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,000
of Miss Song and Chu Guihong,

234
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,000
then I have no regrets.

235
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,720
I believe this wound will heal faster.

236
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,760
What about the horse farm today?

237
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,600
The horse farm

238
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,320
was a mess between Chu Guihong and me.

239
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,040
It was just a mess.

240
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,680
It's inevitable that the wound will be healed.

241
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,120
Even if it's just a misunderstanding,

242
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,840
it's easy to solve.

243
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,800
Miss Song,

244
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,800
I want to ask you

245
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,560
if you have any feelings for General Chu.

246
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,120
Your Majesty,

247
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,440
I have no ill intentions.

248
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,040
Good.

249
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,720
Although the edict of the marriage

250
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,600
was issued 18 years ago,

251
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,640
now,

252
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,480
you two are not in love.

253
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,600
I

254
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,880
have no intention to make a fuss.

255
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,360
Let's call it a day.

256
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,600
However,

257
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,600
Song's age is not small.

258
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
Song Yu De is old.

259
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,760
He hopes that his children will get married and live a happy life.

260
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,000
This marriage

261
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,360
is no different from mine.

262
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,640
This marriage is a broken one.

263
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,160
But

264
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,880
we have to compensate with another one.

265
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,720
Liu Mingxi.

266
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,040
Your Majesty.

267
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,160
Go to my imperial wedding.

268
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,600
Today,

269
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,800
I will make the imperial concubine

270
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,040
to make Song's wife the concubine.

271
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,480
Your Majesty, it's not like that.

272
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,880
The edict is just to cancel the marriage.

273
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,440
Your Majesty.

274
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,280
Thank you for the marriage.

275
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,720
I...

276
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,760
By the way,

277
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,760
there was a saying in the previous dynasty.

278
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,160
The prince will be old after getting married.

279
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,760
Now you remember the old saying.

280
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
According to this,

281
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,000
when you get recovered,

282
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:45,460
you can go to the Mach

283
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,720
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,880
Ji Yi is here.

285
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,600
Sit down and have a drink with me.

286
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,640
Olue.

287
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,520
What's going on?

288
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,800
There's nothing.

289
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,760
It's my first time seeing

290
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,360
你说the truth.

291
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,800
Why did you act this way?

292
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,240
Maybe not that good.

293
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,680
I used to think I was a bad person.

294
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,200
Maybe I have my own difficulties.

295
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,320
Here?

296
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,000
Did you come from another place?

297
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,840
But who is not?

298
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,800
It's hard to escape from the busy life.

299
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,040
Everyone has the responsibility to keep the singer.

300
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,200
You are like this, I am like this.

301
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,520
Everyone is like this.

302
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,040
Why didn't you notice it before?

303
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,200
You are quite generous.

304
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,600
Girl?

305
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,080
It doesn't matter.

306
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,040
What matters is you know how to stick to it.

307
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,280
If you don't get married, you will never get married.

308
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,640
Don't you think I am weird?

309
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
No.

310
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,600
Not at all.

311
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,040
That's the best.

312
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,600
You should stick to everything you want.

313
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,200
Don't be crushed by the world,

314
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,080
the responsibility or the life.

315
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,640
You know it so well.

316
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,560
Why are you drinking with me here?

317
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,680
Hmm.

318
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,720
Because the situation is not good.

319
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,560
The person I like doesn't like me.

320
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,160
The person I don't like is hurt by me.

321
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,440
And there is a person I can't escape from.

322
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,000
But I am tied up by fate.

323
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,920
I know.

324
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,000
I didn't know what love was.

325
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,400
But now I know.

326
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,760
I can't talk about anything.

327
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,080
You have someone you like?

328
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,160
Could it be Nan Heng?

329
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,560
How is that possible?

330
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,720
That's good.

331
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,280
I am scared to death.

332
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,400
Remember, Song Yating.

333
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,240
If you stick to Nan Heng,

334
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,760
it's the beginning of your misfortune.

335
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,480
You can't contact him no matter what.

336
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,200
Especially when you are alone,

337
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,320
or when you are alone.

338
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,920
Or when you are assassinated.

339
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,240
Do you hear me?

340
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,920
You said you experienced all these with him.

341
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,520
That's different.

342
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,880
What's different?

343
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,280
You don't like Nan Heng,

344
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,840
but you are with him all the time.

345
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,560
You will fall in love with him.

346
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,040
Instead of worrying about me,

347
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,760
you should worry about yourself.

348
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,440
At least I know what I want.

349
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,440
But you?

350
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,920
Do you really know

351
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,920
what kind of person you like?

352
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,800
Of course I know.

353
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,880
What I like is...

354
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,600
I like...

355
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,680
You like your father, your mother,

356
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,120
and you like Zhixia Yingqiu.

357
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,160
You like me.

358
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,320
You seem to like everyone.

359
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,960
But it means you don't love anyone.

360
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,440
Sometimes,

361
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,720
I find you strange.

362
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,160
You seem to be happy with everyone.

363
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,840
But you never love anyone.

364
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,160
You never know anyone.

365
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
Song Yi Meng.

366
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,280
If you treat this place as your home,

367
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,200
you will never have a good life.

368
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,720
Secret rap then?

369
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:10,320
Root of adventure and

370
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,680
valley- lifts and

371
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,280
And it turns you into an ant.

372
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,000
This lion мог not approve.

373
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,520
Surprisingly.

374
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,120
Looks good.

375
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,680
Let me have a try.

376
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,520
Look.

377
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,680
I was the second inё

378
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,000
Feel 그냥

379
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,720
Why the hell are you back door again

380
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,120
Everyone is quantity

381
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,480
Come to see her

382
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,900
He goimientos

383
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,940
Today.

384
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,340
What?

385
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,140
Why are you here and now?

386
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,640
What did you come back to?

387
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,880
No.

388
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,580
Yes.

389
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,540
What did you go out today?

390
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,200
Nothing.

391
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,400
What is your friend?

392
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
I'm from the Wennuai here.

393
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,580
Linda.

394
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,580
Open it.

395
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,580
No, this is for someone else.

396
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,580
I...

397
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,580
I told you to open it! Do you want me to say it again?

398
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,580
Hurry!

399
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,580
You...

400
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,580
Okay.

401
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,580
The moon falls, the stars fall.

402
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,580
This...

403
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,580
Miss Song'er is willing to make friends with the Master.

404
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,580
She left a special treasure.

405
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:04,580
I hope that the Master can understand her feelings.

406
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,580
That's why I like you.

407
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,580
Like me?

408
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,580
I haven't even seen how Gu Lin looks like.

409
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,580
How can I like him?

410
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,580
This...

411
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,580
Explain!

412
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,580
Gu Lin's Secret

413
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,580
Miss, it's so late. What are you doing?

414
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,580
I'm thinking.

415
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,580
According to the theory,

416
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,580
I have to marry Chu Gui Hong first,

417
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,580
then get a divorce,

418
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,580
and then be beaten by Nan Heng.

419
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:17,580
And then I get married to Nan Heng.

420
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:23,580
Why is the plot suddenly developing so fast?

421
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,580
Did I really change my fate?

422
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,580
Miss, you're about to be a princess.

423
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,580
It's time to change this.

424
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,580
A princess can't sit on the ground.

425
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,580
The plot has been changed.

426
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,580
It's impossible to play it again.

427
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,580
Divorce is a one-way street.

428
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,580
Nan Heng wants to marry me.

429
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,580
I'll be his dream girl.

430
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,580
According to the rules,

431
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,580
the Duke of Guangping, the Minister of the Left,

432
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,580
and the Minister of the Ministry of War, the eldest daughter of Song Yu De,

433
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,580
are obedient and honest, gentle and kind.

434
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,580
They are obedient and obedient.

435
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:27,580
They are good enough to make the Duke of Qing a favorite.

436
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,580
Yu De is the wife of the Duke of Qi.

437
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,580
She's still a private.

438
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,580
Miss Song,

439
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,580
you've worked so hard to get this marriage.

440
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,580
Please accept it.

441
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,580
Eunuch Liu,

442
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,580
may I ask you a question?

443
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,580
If I don't accept the imperial edict,

444
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,580
I'll...

445
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,580
Anti-imperial edict?

446
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,580
That's easy.

447
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,580
The super-village is closed.

448
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,580
The horse is divided into four.

449
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,580
The male is swaying.

450
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,580
The female is out.

451
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,580
Miss Song,

452
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,580
take your time to choose.

453
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,580
Fine.

454
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,580
I understand what you mean.

455
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,580
Then...

456
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,580
I'll take it.

457
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,580
I'll take it.

458
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,580
Then...

459
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,580
I'll ask you again.

460
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,580
Do you know that

461
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,580
His Highness Qi came to announce the edict today?

462
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,580
Didn't His Majesty say yesterday

463
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,580
that the prince should be married and be a courtesan?

464
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,580
I was thinking

465
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,580
that I should discuss this with His Highness Qi first.

466
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,580
You see...

467
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,580
This is for you.

468
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,580
His Highness doesn't need you to worry about it.

469
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,580
Miss, take it.

470
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,580
Otherwise...

471
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,580
I'll take it.

472
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,580
Wait.

473
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,580
Father.

474
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,580
Master.

475
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,580
No.

476
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,580
Lord Song,

477
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,580
you're offending the imperial edict.

478
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,580
I'm going to the palace

479
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,580
to report this to His Majesty.

480
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,580
Please don't bother to go alone.

481
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,580
I'll go with you to the palace.

482
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,580
I have something to ask His Majesty.

483
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,580
18 years ago, the gold-billed prophecy

484
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,580
is now true.

485
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,580
It can be used to meet the power of the King of Qianyu.

486
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,580
Is there such a thing in the script?

487
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,580
Father.

488
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,580
Chu Gui Hong and I

489
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,580
are married.

490
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,580
We don't have any feelings.

491
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,580
But I'm different from His Highness Qi.

492
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,580
We love each other.

493
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,580
Ming Chang Mian.

494
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,580
Is he here?

495
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,580
Master.

496
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,580
Master, are you crazy?

497
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,580
You always follow the way of loyalty.

498
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,580
You offended people when you were in trouble.

499
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,580
If you go against the edict,

500
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,580
the whole imperial family will be completely offended.

501
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,580
Then you don't want your official post?

502
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,580
You don't want our whole Song family?

503
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,580
Shut up.

504
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,580
A gentleman should be modest

505
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,580
to gain fame and fortune.

506
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,580
You all get out of my way.

507
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,580
I've made up my mind.

508
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,580
Master.

509
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,580
Master, calm down.

510
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,580
His Majesty is already dissatisfied with this marriage.

511
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,580
If you go against the edict,

512
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,580
it will only make my sister in a worse situation.

513
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,580
If you insist on going against the edict,

514
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,580
you can just step over me today.

515
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,580
Master, please think twice.

516
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,580
Master, please think twice.

517
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,580
Master.

518
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,580
I've been in the official position for decades.

519
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,580
I still have the dignity in the court.

520
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,580
My daughter

521
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,580
will never marry Seventh Prince.

522
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,580
No one can stop her.

523
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,580
Shut up.

524
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,580
Father.

525
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,580
Father, go.

526
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,580
Go against the edict.

527
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,580
I beg you.

528
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,580
Don't stay here and watch my play.

529
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,580
Go.

530
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,580
Go.

531
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,580
Go.

532
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,580
Father.

533
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,580
Father.

534
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,580
Chu Gui Hong and I

535
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,580
are just married.

536
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,580
We are not in love.

537
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,580
But I'm different from Seventh Prince.

538
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,580
We love each other.

539
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,580
Father.

540
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,580
Even if there is a day

541
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,580
when he is not willing to go against the edict,

542
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,580
I will go against the edict.

543
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,580
If he is in trouble,

544
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,580
I will follow him till the end of my life.

545
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,580
I will follow him till the end of my life.

546
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,580
Do you really think so?

547
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,580
You are just like what I said before.

548
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,580
You always say those things

549
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,580
to Seventh Prince.

550
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,580
You lied to me.

551
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,580
Of course not.

552
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,580
I can't see how far he is now.

553
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,580
I ran so far.

554
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,580
Yes.

555
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,580
Even if I have to

556
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,580
marry him today,

557
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,580
I will marry him

558
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,580
as soon as possible.

559
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,580
You bastard.

560
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,580
Where is the man?

561
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,580
Take him away.

562
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,580
What are you looking at?

563
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,580
Before Chu Gui Hong is dead,

564
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,580
I will allow him to go to the kitchen.

565
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,580
Yes.

566
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,580
Father.

567
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,580
Father.

568
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,580
Just let me marry Seventh Prince.

569
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,580
We are not in love.

570
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,580
Father.

571
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,580
Father.

572
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,580
Father.

573
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,580
Father.

574
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,580
Father.

575
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,580
Song Yi De.

576
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,580
You are my junior.

577
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,580
After I came to the court,

578
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,580
I have been protecting and trusting you.

579
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,580
Now, you are now

580
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,580
in the hands of thousands of people

581
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,580
in the Ministry of War.

582
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,580
I don't understand

583
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,580
what you are still dissatisfied with.

584
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,580
I beg Your Majesty to take back your order.

585
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,580
Your daughter is the one who is not ashamed to die first.

586
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,580
She made a scene with Old Qi.

587
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,580
What I did was just to fulfill my duty.

588
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,580
Your Majesty.

589
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,580
Eighteen years ago,

590
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,580
Your Majesty wanted to

591
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,580
make Seventh Prince the heir.

592
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,580
You made me marry General Chu.

593
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,580
Now, Seventh Prince is not good enough.

594
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,580
Your Majesty is afraid that Seventh Prince

595
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,580
is too scheming and too arrogant.

596
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,580
You want to use me as a trap

597
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:26,580
to make Seventh Prince fall into the trap.

598
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,580
I'm afraid that you would be

599
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,580
in danger if you watch over me well.

600
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,580
So damnきた.

601
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,580
Only you,

602
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,580
so old andhstradorous,

603
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,580
would dare to say this to me.

604
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,580
So in your opinion,

605
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,580
which seek the order?

606
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,580
Your Majesty is uncertain about this marriage.

607
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,980
In fact, you are uncertain about the position of the crown prince.

608
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,380
Now, the Gao family has seven princes.

609
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,780
And the Chu family behind the eighteenth prince is in danger because of the平庸 war.

610
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,780
At this time,

611
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,380
I let the two sides conflict and fight.

612
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,180
If the two sides compete,

613
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,780
the one who will be lost will be the eighteenth prince.

614
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,980
Your Majesty is for the balance of the court,

615
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,380
and for protecting the eighteenth prince.

616
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,980
So you let me marry the seventh prince.

617
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,780
In this way,

618
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:57,580
the seventh prince will not fight with the eighteenth prince for the time being.

619
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,780
It will be a loss for the nine-time outing.

620
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,980
Old fox.

621
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:11,580
I should call you to be the official Huang Kong.

622
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,980
The emperor, the minister, the father, the sons.

623
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,180
Huang Kong's position is always the lower position.

624
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,980
Your Majesty is wise.

625
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,380
I will not obey the order of the little girl.

626
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,180
I am afraid.

627
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,580
Song Yimeng disobeyed your order,

628
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,780
not my order.

629
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,980
The seventh prince disobeyed his destiny,

630
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,180
not your Majesty's.

631
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,980
If Song Yimeng's destiny is to marry the seventh prince,

632
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,180
Your Majesty.

633
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:19,980
I think my daughter should marry a man who is sincere and kind.

634
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,780
He loves his son.

635
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,780
Your Majesty loves your son wholeheartedly.

636
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,180
I have no problem with that.

637
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,180
How do you know who will be the one who is sincere and kind?

638
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,780
It must be Chu Guihong.

639
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,180
Song Yide.

640
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,580
I agreed to the marriage of the seventh and Song Yimeng.

641
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,380
It was a rightful decision.

642
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,380
But you are not happy about it.

643
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,180
You disobeyed the imperial decree.

644
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,580
What should you do?

645
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,580
I deserve to die.

646
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,980
Song Yimeng agreed to the marriage?

647
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,980
Miss Song has long been in love with you?

648
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,380
Look at her.

649
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,180
She is not in love with me.

650
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,780
And the one who is going to marry her today is her and Nan Heng.

651
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,980
It's not Li Shiliu.

652
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,580
You are too much.

653
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,380
I really can't tell.

654
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,380
No.

655
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,580
If Miss Song agrees,

656
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,380
you will have to change your mind.

657
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,780
What should I do?

658
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,580
Song Yimeng agreed.

659
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,580
But Song Yide may not agree.

660
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,980
She doesn't deserve to marry her daughter to me.

661
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,180
You are so wise.

662
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,380
I heard from the Song family that

663
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:44,580
Lord Song locked Miss Song in the woodshed in anger.

664
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,180
She was so confused.

665
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,380
And she said she wanted to die in the fire.

666
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,180
She wants to die in the fire?

667
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,180
I don't understand.

668
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,580
In theory,

669
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,580
Miss Song doesn't want to die for you.

670
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,580
She is not for me.

671
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,980
She is worried about Li Shiliu.

672
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,580
Miss Song wants to see Li Shiliu?

673
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,780
Why are you here again?

674
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,780
Chief.

675
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,380
Something happened in the palace.

676
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,380
Cousin.

677
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,380
We are here today to save Lord Song.

678
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,180
You feed Song Yimeng, I feed Tingting.

679
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:21,980
So we...

680
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,380
Don't be impulsive.

681
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,980
How could I be like this?

682
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:26,980
Qian.

683
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,380
Stop.

684
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,180
What does this mean?

685
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,180
You don't say hello to me?

686
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,180
Don't you see me?

687
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,180
Chu Guihong.

688
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,180
Lord Song disobeys the edict.

689
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,580
His Majesty will punish him.

690
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,380
In fact, the Song family is in danger.

691
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,580
If you want to attack me,

692
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,980
we can put down the old grudges

693
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,380
and solve this together.

694
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,380
What do you think?

695
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,980
Lord Song and Qianyu Mansion are old.

696
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,180
It's reasonable.

697
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:57,980
He just left?

698
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,580
Song Yuede.

699
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,780
You disobeys the edict and disobeyed the edict.

700
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,980
You should be executed.

701
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,380
You have been serving the country for many years.

702
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,780
You are not worthy of the credit.

703
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,180
You will be executed for thirty times.

704
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,380
Do you know your crime?

705
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,980
I know my crime.

706
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:23,980
Eunuch Liu.

707
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,380
Yes.

708
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,780
Execute him.

709
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,380
Your Majesty, calm down.

710
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,180
Your Majesty.

711
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:43,980
Your Majesty, calm down.

712
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,380
You two

713
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,380
dare to defy the edict?

714
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,780
Father, father.

715
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,780
And me.

716
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,580
Why are you here again?

717
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,780
This Yulan Village

718
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,380
is not a place for you to pass the door.

719
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,380
I, I...

720
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,180
Your Majesty, calm down.

721
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:02,980
Your Majesty.

722
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,780
Lord Song is old.

723
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,980
The thirty whipings are like a hand of a minister.

724
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,780
In addition, ten days later

725
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,780
will be your birthday.

726
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,180
Don't be too late.

727
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,580
Ridiculous.

728
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,380
If this is the reason,

729
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,580
I would rather not celebrate my birthday.

730
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:20,780
Your Majesty.

731
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,580
Seventh Prince is right.

732
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,580
Your Majesty is wise.

733
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,780
You can't kill the ministers.

734
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,180
We risk our lives to

735
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,980
protect your life

736
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,380
in the future edict.

737
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,780
I am still standing here.

738
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,180
I don't need to think about the future edict.

739
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,180
Father.

740
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:39,780
Shut up.

741
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,180
Your Majesty.

742
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,180
Lord Song is old.

743
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,180
I am willing to take the punishment for him.

744
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,780
Good.

745
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,380
One is my son.

746
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,580
The other is the empress's niece.

747
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,580
Today,

748
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,780
you all are fighting against me

749
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,780
for an outsider.

750
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,980
Do you all want to save Song Yide?

751
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,180
Good.

752
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,580
Then today,

753
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,180
I will give you all a chance.

754
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,980
I will hand over ten thousand troops

755
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,180
to the east side of the city.

756
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,380
I will grant his request.

757
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,180
Your Majesty.

758
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,380
No.

759
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,780
Seventh Prince and Lord Chu

760
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,580
are all the officials of our country.

761
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,580
How can they be punished by me?

762
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,980
I want to hear them say

763
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,780
that they are all loyal to the country.

764
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,380
What?

765
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,380
You don't want to talk?

766
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,380
Both of you

767
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,180
want to marry Song Yimeng, right?

768
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,180
You are willing to

769
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,780
suffer the pain of being a woman

770
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,580
for the sake of the country, right?

771
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,180
You are willing to

772
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,180
hand over the military power

773
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,580
and all of you are promoted.

774
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,380
Are you dumb?

775
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,180
Cousin, are you crazy?

776
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,380
Father.

777
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:14,980
How about

778
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,780
I...

779
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,580
Your Majesty.

780
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,380
I am willing to suffer for Lord Song.

781
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:18,980
Good.

782
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,780
Your Majesty.

783
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,980
But

784
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,180
your ten thousand military power

785
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:25,980
will not be

786
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,580
in your country again.

787
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,980
Cousin.

788
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,980
You have to think it over.

789
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,580
I have thought it over.

790
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,580
Song Yimeng

791
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,180
is the concubine I have been looking for.

792
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,580
Lord Song

793
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,980
is my father-in-law.

794
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,780
It is the best

795
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,380
to be punished for my father-in-law.

796
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,980
In that case,

797
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,580
I will fulfill your wish.

798
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,980
Eunuch Liu.

799
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,780
Take a rest.

800
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,780
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

801
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:50,380
The night is dark.

802
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,580
The night is dark.

803
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:59,380
When will I return?

804
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,380
The wind blows in the distance.

805
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,980
The wind blows in the distance.

806
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:08,980
The wind blows in the distance.

807
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,180
The wind blows in the distance.

808
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,380
If this dream is real,

809
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:17,180
how can love and hate be hidden?

810
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,780
The years pass by like a wind.

811
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,780
The wind blows in the distance.

812
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:26,780
The past life is not for the sake of the destiny.

813
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,980
If it is not decided one day,

814
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,180
how can I write the ending?

815
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:39,180
Please stay by my side.

816
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,580
Friends,

817
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,580
there is the usualuri of love.

818
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,980
Some screaming scenes often can be seen by those who are jumping around.

819
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,380
When their language cannot live up to it,

820
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,520
and they cannot find their home

821
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,780
and you in mine is not어

822
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:56,480
At the Liturgy Hall there is an aroma in this aroma.

823
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:02,980
In theences of a rose,

824
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,780
right and wrong

825
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:09,180
is citizens' pleasure.

826
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,180
How can I hide the love and hatred

827
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:15,180
from you?

828
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:19,180
As time goes by, it is hard to tell if it is good or bad.

829
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:24,180
Life is like a dream, but it is not real.

830
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:29,180
If we can meet and part, how can we end it?

831
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:36,180
Please stay by my side.

832
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:45,180
Love is like a dream.
