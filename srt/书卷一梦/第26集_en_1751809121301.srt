The end of the world is near

The end of the world is near

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The end of the world is near

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The end of the world is near

The end of the world is near

The end of the world is near

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The end of the world is near

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The end of the world is near

The end of the world is near

Episode 16

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You can't drink, don't be a man.

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You have to drink so much.

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You have to drink so much.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Come on, cover yourself with a blanket.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Meng.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Dad, I'm here.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Dad.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You are the most miserable.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You are not as good as the capital.

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
How can you have so many people to take care of you?

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You should think about it.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Dad, you know it all.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Your dad is a man of the world.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I know you are leaving.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I also know that you are leaving because of Nan Heng.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Right?

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't know what happened between you and Nan Heng.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But dad thinks that if there is a misunderstanding, it should be explained clearly.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But if this problem doesn't come from him,

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
but from my heart,

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
when he is a good person, I will believe him unconditionally.

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
When he is a bad person, I will not be kind to him.

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
When a good person and a bad person are the same person,

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I will hate myself for not being able to believe in him.

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Dad, do you think a relationship can be called a relationship?

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I can't even understand my heart.

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
How can I look at it?

46
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I can't even understand it.

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Dad, I'm sorry.

48
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I love you.

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I love you.

60
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Love you too.

61
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,000
I did what I could.

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I loved you.

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I loved you.

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I love you too.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay, Qiu.

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If you really care about me,

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
then you should get a bigger carriage.

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And get more clothes for the 4 seasons.

70
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The most important thing is

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
to get the chef

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
to prepare more delicious food.

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay?

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay, okay.

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay, okay. Go.

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Go. Go.

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Go.

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Where are you going?

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
How did you get in?

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This is my house.

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I know it's your house.

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Where are you taking these things?

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I can go wherever I want.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Wherever I want.

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So you don't care about me?

86
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You have hands and feet.

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Why should I care about you?

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You know I didn't mean that.

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Song Yi Meng.

90
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Song Yi Meng.

91
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's all my fault.

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Give me another chance.

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What's wrong with you?

95
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What chance do I give you?

96
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Between us...

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Enough, stop talking.

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm telling you.

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I won't fall in love with a liar.

100
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I won't be a clown.

101
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I know you.

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Just take it as I fell on the road.

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm unlucky.

104
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm unlucky.

105
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So, your Highness.

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Leave here right now.

107
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And don't come here again.

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm not leaving.

109
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I won't leave no matter what you tell me today.

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Give me another chance.

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Give me another chance.

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Stop bothering me, okay?

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Leave here right now.

114
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Leave my house.

115
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What can I do to make you forgive me?

116
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Get out of my sight.

117
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Don't let me hear your voice

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and see your face again.

119
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What if I don't?

120
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Then I'll make you even more sad.

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I can figure out something about Gao Xiang.

122
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll make you feel better.

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll make you feel better.

124
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'll make you feel better.

125
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I can figure out something about Gao Xiang.

126
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I can figure out more.

127
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You mean

128
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
you won't marry me

129
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and be my enemy?

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This is your answer.

131
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So, you won't forgive me

132
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
no matter what I do?

133
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yes.

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I won't forgive you.

135
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I will never forgive you.

136
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What else do you want to ask me?

137
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Do you like me?

138
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
No.

139
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Do you hate me?

140
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Of course I do.

141
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
If I knew you were the same person earlier,

142
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
would everything have changed?

143
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

144
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
If I knew all this earlier,

145
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I would hate you more

146
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and hate you more.

147
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I would kill you earlier.

148
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Do you understand?

149
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I do.

150
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
If you understand,

151
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
come here.

152
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You can't leave me.

153
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You can't leave me.

154
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You can't leave me.

155
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Who is the one who is in the dark?

156
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Who is the one who is waiting

157
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
for the passing of time?

158
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If the world is too far away,

159
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and the path is too steep,

160
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
love and hate are too far away,

161
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
but I will never forget.

162
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Miss,

163
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I have prepared some snacks in the kitchen.

164
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
There are both sour and sweet.

165
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Where is the beautiful girl?

166
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Miss,

167
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
why are you crying?

168
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's nothing.

169
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The wind is too strong.

170
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Close your eyes.

171
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I see.

172
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Father!

173
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
General, I saw Miss Song.

174
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
She said she was leaving the capital.

175
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Where is she going?

176
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Keep an eye on Song's manor.

177
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
No matter where she goes,

178
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
protect her.

179
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I understand.

180
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
General!

181
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
General!

182
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
General, news from the palace.

183
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The noble consort is going to beg for the emperor's happiness.

184
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
General!

185
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
This is not the place for you to come.

186
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I have no choice.

187
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Liangzhou is cold and there are many mountains.

188
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
My brother is old and can't stand it.

189
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Please show mercy.

190
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I can give up the noble consort's title and go to guard the imperial mausoleum.

191
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I only want my brother alive.

192
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Your Majesty, I beg you.

193
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Your Majesty, what should I do to spare your brother?

194
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
As long as Nangeng gives the title of black armor, I can leave Gao Changyi.

195
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But if Heng gives the title of tiger, the people in the court will harm him.

196
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The people of tiger and wolf?

197
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Do you know who I am to be the people of tiger and wolf?

198
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's your good son and brother.

199
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Brother, I'm sorry.

200
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Brother, you did make a big mistake.

202
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But what's wrong with Heng?

203
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
He sent his uncle to the imperial mausoleum.

204
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Your Majesty, why are you making it difficult for him?

205
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Because he is my son, right?

206
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Okay.

207
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So all the mistakes were caused by me.

208
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I know I'm guilty.

209
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Please kill me.

210
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Mother, don't blame yourself.

211
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Get out.

212
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Your Majesty, I can't stop him.

213
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Your Majesty, it's all my fault.

214
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's not my fault.

215
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Please don't blame yourself.

216
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I told you to get out.

217
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Didn't you hear me?

218
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Is this the place you should come?

219
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's my fault.

220
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I shouldn't have come.

221
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You should blame me instead of Heng.

222
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Okay.

223
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
In the Empress's palace, you two should be ashamed.

224
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I dare not.

225
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I dare not.

226
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I think you dare.

227
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The Empress died because of you.

228
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Do you want her to be in peace after death?

229
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Do you want her to be in peace after death?

230
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Do you want her to be in peace after death?

231
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
If it wasn't for your son,

232
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I would have killed you on the battlefield.

233
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

234
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You...

235
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Okay, Qi.

236
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I have something to tell you.

237
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I've already left the Crown Prince position to Rui.

238
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
If you want to protect your mother,

239
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
then hand over your military uniform.

240
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I promise to protect her for the rest of my life.

241
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And from now on, no one will touch her.

242
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I dare not ask you.

243
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Your Majesty, the only one who can protect her is the Black Armor Army.

244
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
If we want to live, we have to rely on the sword in our hands.

245
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So I can't give you the uniform of the Black Armor Army.

246
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Nan Heng, do you really think I dare not kill you?

247
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Your Majesty, I dare not die.

248
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Okay, if you don't teach me, I'll send you to the capital.

249
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You can't go anywhere.

250
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Your whole life will be under my eyes.

251
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

252
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm going to die.

253
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Heng, we owe your uncle too much.

254
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You must not let anything happen to him.

255
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Mother, don't worry. I will make sure that everyone is well.

256
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I will not let him suffer.

257
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Your Majesty, Nan Heng is a brave soldier.

258
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What if he takes the opportunity to rebel in the future?

259
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
My son is not worthy of your wisdom.

260
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yes.

261
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Come on, let's eat.

262
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Eat, Xiang Ye.

263
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Stop.

264
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
coriander

265
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Please forgive me, Prime Minister.

266
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You should be cut off.

267
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You are indeed a good prince, which I have taught you.

268
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Let's go.

269
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yes.

270
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Please, Prime Minister.

271
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm afraid that we will never meet again.

272
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I have a matter to ask you in person.

273
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Please be straightforward.

274
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
In the battle at the border, the enemy attacked two cities in a row.

275
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Pingrong was in danger.

276
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I sent a letter of invitation to the city of You.

277
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I have a letter of invitation to the city of You.

278
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I have a letter of invitation to the city of You.

279
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I have a letter of invitation to the city of You.

280
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
After the battle, I sent a letter of invitation to the city of You.

281
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I have a letter of invitation to the city of You.

282
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It says that...

283
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
This battle is for the sake of the country and the people.

284
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
As long as the Black Armor Army is sent,

285
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
the general is willing to make up for the grudges with him.

286
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You have seen it?

287
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Where is the letter?

288
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The evidence must be destroyed completely.

289
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Otherwise, how can you be the one to be punished for the defeat?

290
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I have been teaching the king for more than 20 years.

291
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
He will turn his head when I shoot him.

292
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Such a big blow...

293
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
If the general still has a fantasy about him,

294
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
then it's no wonder you lost.

295
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It's time. Let's go!

296
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
General, do you want to go to the palace and tell the king about this?

297
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
With the testimony of the prime minister,

298
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
maybe we can...

299
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Miss, do you have to leave at night?

300
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Didn't the lord say that he would send you off tomorrow morning?

301
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You just saw my father and Atin.

302
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
By tomorrow, there will be a lot of trouble.

303
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
But it's too late. I'm afraid it's not safe.

304
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Can you really do it alone?

305
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Don't worry. My father has already made a plan.

306
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
He will be fine.

307
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Miss, it's time to go.

308
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm going to bed.

309
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Take care of my father for me.

310
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Miss, you have to take care of yourself.

311
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I can't stand you.

312
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
General!

313
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
General!

314
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
General!

315
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
What happened?

316
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Miss Song is in danger.

317
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
What?

318
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
General, why did you stop?

319
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
General, where are you going?

320
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
General!

321
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
No!

322
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
General!

323
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
General!

324
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
General!

325
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
General!

326
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
No! It's Hu Yang and Zhu Li!

327
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Who are you?

328
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Why did you kill me?

329
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Wait. I'm late.

330
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I'm coming.

331
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It's that scene.

332
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
In the original play, Song Yi Mu is angry with Nan Heng

333
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
so he was killed by the man in black.

334
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
In order to capture his heart, Nan Heng set up a hero rescue team.

335
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
What's going on this time?

336
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Search carefully.

337
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I've found it. Kill them on the spot.

338
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Yes!

339
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Let's go.

340
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Hurry.

341
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Your Highness, you're bleeding.

342
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Don't be afraid. I'm fine.

343
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
But those people won't give up without catching us.

344
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
There's a mountain cave ahead.

345
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You and I will hide in there.

346
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Before dawn, the Black Armor Army will come to us.

347
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Let's go.

348
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
We can only get to the Yellow Crescent.

349
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I have your cave.

350
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Let's go.

351
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Song Yi Mu!

352
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Your Highness, your wound isn't healed yet.

353
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Be careful.

354
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Everyone, search separately.

355
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Yes! Search!

356
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Song Yi Mu!

357
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Song Yi Mu!

358
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I'll do it myself.

359
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Go!

360
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Stop!

361
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,780
Take your weapon.

362
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,000
No.

363
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,580
Take the weapon.

364
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,300
Go.

365
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,540
What's going on?

366
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
Zip it up.

367
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm here.

368
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Kill him!

369
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Why do you have so many ways?

370
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
How dare you use the secret mechanism here?

371
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Kill him!

372
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Kill him!

373
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Are you okay?

374
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Are those people you sent here?

375
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
What do you mean?

376
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Are you okay?

377
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
You're bleeding.

378
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's okay.

379
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
They're coming.

380
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Go down from here.

381
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
You go first from the car.

382
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Leave me alone.

383
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I'll stay here and wait.

384
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Go!

385
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I...

386
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
He won't die.

387
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
He won't die.

388
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
He won't die.

389
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
He won't die.

390
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
He won't die.

391
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
He won't die.

392
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
He won't die.

393
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
There's no need to be so quick.

394
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
We only want that woman's life.

395
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
We can't leave now.

396
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Uncle, who sent you here?

397
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Looks like you're not going to leave.

398
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Think about it.

399
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
You're not our opponent if you're injured.

400
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Is it worth it for a woman?

401
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Kill him!

402
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Are you okay?

403
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You're bleeding.

404
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Will he die?

405
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
He's a man.

406
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
In the world of dramas,

407
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
a doctor should be fine.

408
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
A woman who doesn't know martial arts

409
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
will only cause trouble when she goes back.

410
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Go!

411
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Why are you back?

412
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Go!

413
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Go!

414
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Jump with me!

415
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Are you crazy?

416
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Jumping will kill you!

417
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Just trust me once.

418
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Jumping in this world will not kill you.

419
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I trust you, you bastard!

420
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You bastard!

421
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Why are you so high?

422
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
General, we've checked.

423
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
At least four of the fire engines were tied to the car.

424
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
He's not going to die.

425
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It should have been set up this morning.

426
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
The one who set up this is Nan Heng.

427
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
General, Nan Heng even killed his uncle.

428
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Our plan is to use Gao Chang's hidden identity

429
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
to restart the Pinglong case.

430
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I can imagine that he's not going to die.

431
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
He's going to die.

432
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I can imagine that he's not going to die.

433
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I can imagine that he's not going to die.

434
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Gao Xiang is right.

435
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It's his nature to kill the grass and root it.

436
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Let our people come and bring the body back.

437
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I will find out the truth.

438
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
This time I will not give him a chance.

439
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yes, General.

440
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Nan Heng, are you okay?

441
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
What's wrong with you?

442
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
What's ini the baby doing here?

443
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
What happened to those assassins?

444
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Nan Heng, wake up!

445
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Say something!

446
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Nan Heng!

447
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Don't be so dumb!

448
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I've never seen a man who can jump to death.

449
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Don't pretend!

450
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Nan Heng!

451
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Nan Heng!

452
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Nan Heng!

453
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Nan Heng, don't scare me!

454
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Nan Heng!

455
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Nan Heng!

456
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
What should I do in this world?

457
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I'm telling you, I won't blame you for your death!

458
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Wake up!

459
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Nan Heng!

460
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Nan Heng!

461
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Nan Heng!

462
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
This is the script world.

463
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
There must be a trick in the script.

464
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Nan Heng, wake up!

465
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Nan Heng!

466
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Nan Heng!

467
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Why isn't he waking up?

468
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Doesn't he wake up when he's kissed in the costume?

469
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Nan Heng!

470
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Nan Heng!

471
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Nan Heng!

472
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Nan Heng!

473
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Nan Heng!

474
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Nan Heng!

475
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
You can't die!

476
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,980
and that you watch over my clients and the school.

477
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,460
What a shameless!

478
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,220
Tell me your name and..?

479
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,220
Yes.

480
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,820
Shame on you.

481
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,300
A Yiming man will be always right before you.

482
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,500
Where are you going?

483
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,140
Get out of this car and get out of here.

484
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,500
Who?

485
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,020
What are you doing?

486
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,060
Do you want to kill someone?

487
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,640
I…

488
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,720
Can't let him thank you in advance?

489
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,640
You outlaw!

490
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,660
You are playing dead, eh?

491
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,360
I was lucky enough to escape from the cliff.

492
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,080
Can you spare me somerés?

493
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,060
Let me be.

494
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,060
It's okay.

495
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,060
all right, give me a minute.

496
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,820
See.

497
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,580
Who knows?

498
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,020
Maybe we love each other.

499
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,740
Kylin...

500
00:38:51,420 --> 00:39:07,420
You need to wipe the tears off this Foundation's shirt,

501
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,340
you better to come out.

502
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,060
And don't cry like this.

503
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,060
You...

504
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,060
You're hurt.

505
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,060
You caused it.

506
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,060
Let's go.

507
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,060
Be careful.

508
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,060
Stay there.

509
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,060
Be careful.

510
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,060
You're hurt.

511
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,060
Can you get out of here?

512
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,060
Don't worry.

513
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,060
If Fugui doesn't find me,

514
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,060
he'll search for me in the Black Armor Army.

515
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,060
We'll find him in the evening.

516
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,060
Tomorrow morning?

517
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,060
You're hurt like this.

518
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,060
I'm afraid you can't wait until tomorrow morning.

519
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,060
You'll freeze to death here.

520
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,060
Well,

521
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,060
help me

522
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,060
pick up these branches.

523
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,060
And then

524
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,060
find a thicker stick.

525
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,060
You want

526
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,060
to make a fire?

527
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,060
I'm so tired.

528
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,060
Brother,

529
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,060
can you do it?

530
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,060
How about you?

531
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,060
No, no.

532
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,060
You do it.

533
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,060
I can't.

534
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,060
I did it.

535
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,060
How's it going?

536
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,060
I'm still good, right?

537
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,060
It's been half an hour.

538
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,060
What's there to be proud of?

539
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,060
I think the male lead in other scripts

540
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,060
is always proud of it.

541
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,060
Did your script tell you

542
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,060
that the Black Armor Army will die?

543
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,060
Are you dead?

544
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,060
I'm hurt.

545
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,060
That's the first time you've been hurt.

546
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,060
The assassin hurt me.

547
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,060
Besides,

548
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,060
I've never seen

549
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,060
any main character

550
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,060
in a drama

551
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,060
jump off the cliff.

552
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,060
You know, the main character is just a ring.

553
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,060
I don't know what you're talking about.

554
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,060
Come on.

555
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,060
You're hurt so much.

556
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,060
Okay.

557
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,060
Su Yunmeng,

558
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,060
I didn't send those assassins here.

559
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,060
I see.

560
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,060
Why had you

561
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,100
There was something

562
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,180
