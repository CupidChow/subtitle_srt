[Episode 26]

3
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,950
Careful, careful.

4
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,680
Slowly, Honey.

5
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,280
Careful, careful.

6
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,950
Why did you drink so much?

7
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,560
-Here, be careful.
-I didn't drink much.

8
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,150
Easy now, easy.

9
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,640
Hurry!

10
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,990
Let's have two more drinks.

11
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,870
Slow down, slow down.

12
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,070
Take it easy, Father.

13
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,030
Look at you, at your age,

14
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,630
still acting so recklessly.

15
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,280
Keep an eye on him here.

16
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,010
I'll go get some hangover soup.

17
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,370
Don't worry, Madam.

18
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,079
Father, seriously,

19
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,600
if you can't handle alcohol,
don't push yourself.

20
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,630
Why did you have to drink so much?

21
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,720
Look at the state you're in.

22
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,079
Here,

23
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,360
tuck in.

24
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,100
Yimeng.

25
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,030
Father,

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,190
I'm here.

27
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,240
You've always been

28
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,910
the one who can't handle hardship.

29
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,850
Being out there isn't like
being in the capital.

30
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,840
You won't have such a big
house to live in,

31
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,970
with so many people to take care of you.

32
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,910
You should reconsider.

33
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,840
Father,

34
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,360
so you already know?

35
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,910
I sometimes

36
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,840
just play dumb.

37
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,820
Not only do I know you're leaving,

38
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,310
but I also know

39
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,710
you're leaving because of Nan Heng.

40
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,190
Right?

41
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,800
I don't know exactly what happened

42
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,430
between you and Nan Heng.

43
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,030
But I believe

44
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,920
if there's a misunderstanding,

45
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,000
you should clear it up.

46
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,310
But what if the problem

47
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,560
isn't with him,

48
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,750
but within my own heart?

49
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,310
When he was a good person,

50
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,640
I trusted him unconditionally.

51
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,840
When he was a bad person,

52
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,800
I confronted him without mercy.

53
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,750
When the good and bad person

54
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,430
were the same person,

55
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,430
I started to hate myself

56
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,390
for no longer being able to trust him.

57
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,480
Father,

58
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,830
tell me.

59
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,120
When a relationship becomes like this,

60
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,090
can it still be called love?

61
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,800
I can't even understand
my own heart anymore.

62
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,950
How can I look to the future?

63
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,840
Very well.

64
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,190
Since you want to go,

65
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,950
I'll have someone escort you to Jiangnan.

66
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,230
When you've figured things out,

67
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,680
I'll send someone to bring you back.

[Laiyi House]

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,800
My Lady,

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,560
have you really thought this through?

71
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,070
You won't even take me or Zhixia with.

72
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,800
Who will take care of you there?

73
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,390
You have your own plot to follow.

74
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
You shouldn't change because of me.

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,950
Alright, Yingqiu.

76
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,600
If you really care about me,

77
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,750
just make sure the carriage is spacious

78
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,750
and pack me clothes for all seasons.

79
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,000
Most importantly,

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,510
ask the kitchen to prepare
some good food for me,

81
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,270
okay?

82
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,950
Alright, alright,

83
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,560
that's enough, go now.

84
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,270
Just go.

85
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,000
Hurry up.

86
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,170
Where are you going?

87
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,890
How did you get in here?

88
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,390
This is my home.

89
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,840
I know it's your home.

90
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,080
Where are you going with all these things?

91
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,159
I'm going wherever I want.

92
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,920
It's none of your business.

93
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,440
So you're abandoning me?

94
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,980
You're an able-bodied man.

95
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,870
Why should I take care of you?

96
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,720
You know that's not what I meant.

Song Yimeng.

100
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,270
Everything that happened before

101
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,310
was all my fault.

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,750
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,770
Please give me another chance.

104
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,090
What was your fault?

105
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,970
What chance should I give you?

106
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,980
Between us,

107
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,750
you and I...

108
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,010
Enough, stop talking.

109
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,760
I'm telling you,

110
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,070
I won't fall for a liar again,

111
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,290
nor will I be made a fool again.

112
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,510
Meeting you

113
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,120
was like tripping on the road.

114
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,510
I was just unlucky

115
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,810
and I accept that.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,430
I...

117
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,090
So, esteemed Seventh Prince,

118
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,560
leave immediately

119
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,240
and don't ever come back.

120
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,530
I'm not leaving.

121
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,960
No matter what you say today,
I won't leave.

122
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,520
Just give me one more chance.

123
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,120
Just give me one more chance.

124
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,800
Nan Heng!

125
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,370
Can you please stop pestering me?

126
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,160
Just go.

127
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,560
Iâ€”

128
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
Get out of my house.

129
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,430
Leave now.

130
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,280
What do I have to do
for you to forgive me?

131
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,660
Disappear from my sight completely.

132
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,390
Don't let me hear your voice

133
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,050
or see your face again.

134
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
What if I refuse?

135
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Then I'll make you suffer even more.

136
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,960
Since I could expose
Chancellor Gao's affairs,

137
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,390
I can dig up much more.

138
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,720
You mean

139
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,540
you won't marry me anymore

140
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,210
and want to be my enemy instead?

141
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,630
Is this your answer?

142
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,720
So no matter what I do,

143
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,910
you'll never forgive me?

144
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,720
Yes.

145
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,000
I will never forgive you.

146
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,030
Never ever.

147
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,390
What else do you want to ask me?

148
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,790
Do I like you?

149
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,440
I don't.

150
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,390
Do I hate you?

151
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,600
Of course I do.

152
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,960
Would things have been different

153
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,760
had I known earlier
that you were

154
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,320
the same person?

155
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,780
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

156
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,840
If I had known all this earlier,

157
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,320
I would have despised you even more,

158
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,270
hated you even more,

159
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,800
and even killed you sooner.

160
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,000
Do you understand?

161
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,000
I understand.

162
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,790
If you understand,

163
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,360
then get out.

truth and illusion, Iâ€™m still willing â™ª

170
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,750
Leave now,

171
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,870
get out of my house.

172

â™ª Above all sounds,
the moon flows like silver â™ª

Wait, Chancellor.

352

As we part today,

353
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,730
I fear we may never meet again.

354
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,200
There is one matter

355
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,200
I wish to ask you in person.

356
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,590
Please speak freely, General.

357
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,440
When enemy forces launched
surprise attacks

358
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,180
and captured two cities
during the war years ago,

359
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,440
and Pingrong City was in imminent danger,

360
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,550
I sent a scout

361
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,070
with a handwritten letter requesting aid

362
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,030
to Youcheng,

363
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,110
asking Nan Heng to send reinforcements.

364
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,110
That letter said...

365
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,070
This battle

366
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,960
was to defend

367
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,860
Great Jing's borders and people.

368
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,630
As long as the Xuanjia Army
deployed soldiers,

369
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,110
you would put aside your
years of grievances with him.

370
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,650
You've seen it?

371
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,310
Where's the letter?

372
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,200
Where is it now?

373
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,150
Such evidence must be
thoroughly destroyed.

374
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,720
Otherwise, how could we have
firmly established

375
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,580
your crime for losing the battle?

376
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,590
I raised His Highness for over 20 years,

377
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,610
yet when matters concerned himself,

378
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,510
he turned around and cast me aside.

379
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,160
Such ambitious character.

380
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,830
If you still harbor illusions about him,

381
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,790
no wonder you lost.

387

So you're not planning to step aside?

518
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,310
Think carefully.

519
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,680
You're injured.

520
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,220
You're no match for us.

521
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,590
Is this worth it

522
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,590
for a woman?

523
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,480
Kill!

524
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,540
Are you okay?

525
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,500
You're bleeding.

526
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,210
Will he die?

527
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,720
He's the male lead.

528
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,790
In the script world,

529
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,550
he should be fine.

530
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,910
And a female lead who can't fight

531
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,970
will only get in the way by going back.

532
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,160
Why did you come back?

533
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,970
Run!

534
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,240
Come on!

535
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,760
Jump down with me!

536
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,790
Are you crazy?

537
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,830
We'll die if we jump!

538
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,030
Just trust me this once.

539
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,400
In this world, jumping off a cliff

540
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,550
definitely won't kill us!

541
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,860
No way I'll trust you!

542
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,000
Holy crap,

543
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,240
why is it so high up?

544
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,110
General,

545
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,270
we've checked.

546
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,680
There were at least four containers
of petroleum tied to the prison cart.

547
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,900
He must be dead.

548
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,130
It must have been set up in advance.

549
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,000
Such ruthlessness.

550
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,770
That's Nan Heng for you.

551
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,110
General,

552
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,350
Nan Heng

553
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,440
could even kill his own uncle.

554
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,110
I had planned

555
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,550
to use Gao Changyin as a witness

556
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,150
to reopen the Pingrong case.

557
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,720
Since I thought of it,

558
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,650
he could naturally think of it too.

559
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,380
Chancellor Gao was right.

560
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,480
Eliminating a problem at its source

561
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,800
is indeed his nature.

562
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,670
Have our men come over

563
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,880
to take the body back.

564
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,070
I will

565
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,010
investigate this thoroughly.

566
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,760
This time,

567
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:25,050
I won't give him any
opportunity to exploit.

568
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,360
Yes, General.

569
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,960
Nan Heng,

570
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,960
how are you?

571
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,670
My God.

572
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,330
Why is it so cold?

573
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:50,780
Nan Heng,

574
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,600
wake up and tell me

575
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,989
what was with

576
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,840
all those assassins just now.

577
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,360
Nan Heng,

578
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,480
wake up.

579
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,670
Say something!

580
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:12,970
Nan Heng?

581
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,070
Stop pretending.

582
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,240
I've never seen a male lead

583
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,800
die from jumping off a cliff.

584
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,670
Stop faking it!

585
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,290
Nan Heng.

586
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,630
Nan Heng.

587
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,390
Nan Heng?

588
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,400
Nan Heng, don't scare me like this.

589
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,140
Nan Heng!

590
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:45,960
Nan Heng!

591
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,710
We're in the middle of nowhere.

592
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,040
What am I supposed to do?

593
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm telling you,

594
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,630
I don't care if you live or die.

595
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,890
Wake up now,

596
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,030
do you hear me?

597
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,110
Nan Heng!

598
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,670
Nan Heng!

599
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,360
Nan Heng!

600
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,650
This is a script world.

601
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:05,300
Scripts always have clichÃ©s.

602
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,370
Nan Heng.

603
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,960
Please wake up!

604
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,580
Why aren't you waking up?

605
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,140
Don't people in costume dramas
wake up after a kiss?

606
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,370
Nan Heng.

607
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,510
Nan Heng!

608
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,480
Nan Heng.

609
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,550
Nan Heng.

610
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,180
You can't die.

611
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,100
I haven't forgiven you yet.

612
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,060
What gives you the right to die first?

613
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,230
Get up now!

614
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,760
If you can't do something,

615
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,480
don't make empty promises.

616
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,730
Who asked you to save anyone?

617
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,180
Why did you have to play hero?

618
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,700
Who needs your protection?

619
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,520
Get up now.

620
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,280
Wake up, do you hear me?

621
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,400
I told you,

622
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,930
I haven't forgiven you yet.

623
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,320
Get up right now!

624
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:28,960
Nan Heng.

625
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,820
Nan Heng.

626
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,080
Nan Heng!

627
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,320
Please wake up.

628
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,080
Please wake up now!

629
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,200
You're awake?

630
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,890
You finally woke up.

631
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,030
I thought you were going to die.

632
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,560
Couldn't you say something nicer?

633
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:01,730
You didn't die.

634
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,810
Why were you pretending to be dead?

635
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,840
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

636
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,960
I just fell off a cliff

637
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,320
and barely survived.

638
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,830
Give me a break, will you?

639
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,330
How did your hand get injured?

640
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,150
What's it to you?

641
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,310
Don't touch me.

642
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,230
You got hurt because of me?

643
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,370
Stop flattering yourself.

644
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,030
You'd better worry about yourself.

645
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,670
You've lost so much blood.

646
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,910
Don't die on me again.

647
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,320
Wouldn't it be better if I died?

648
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,590
Then you wouldn't have to cry like this

649
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,320
and still refuse to forgive me.

650
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,890
It's too exposed here.

651
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,040
The assassins might catch up.

652
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,100
Let's find somewhere to hide.

653
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:12,950
Let's go.

654
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,920
You...

655
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,070
I-I'm injured

656
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,340
because of you.

657
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,510
Let's go.

658
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,670
Careful.

659
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,640
Sit there first.

660
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,620
Take it easy.

661
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,530
We're in the middle of nowhere,

662
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,630
and you're injured.

663
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,160
Will we ever get out of here?

664
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,400
Don't worry.

665
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,670
If Fugui can't find me,

666
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,400
he'll surely bring
the Xuanjia Army to search,

667
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,190
and by

668
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,940
dawn at the latest, they'll find us.

669
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,000
Tomorrow morning?

670
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,550
With injuries like yours,

671
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,550
I'm afraid you won't make it till then.

672
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,480
You'll freeze to death here first.

673
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,000
Here.

674
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,670
Help me

675
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,730
gather these branches,

676
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,480
and then

677
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,400
find a thicker stick.

678
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,190
Are you trying to

679
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,290
make fire by drilling wood?

680
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,190
Bro,

681
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,760
can you do it or not?

682
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,690
Why don't you try?

683
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:35,130
No, no,

684
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,280
you go ahead.

685
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,190
You did it!

686
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,710
How was that?

687
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,400
I did pretty well, right?

688
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:22,160
It took you an hour

689
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,630
and you're proud of that?

690
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:28,030
I've seen male leads in other scripts

691
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,710
who succeed in one swift move.

692
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,920
Well, did your script

693
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,960
ever mention

694
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:37,250
that jumping off cliffs can kill you?

695
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,190
Did you die?

696
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,330
I got injured.

697
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,550
That was from the assassin's blade.

698
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,150
Besides,

699
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,400
I've never seen

700
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
any protagonist in a costume drama

701
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,920
who actually died
from jumping off a cliff.

702
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,400
Ever heard of plot armor?

703
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,970
I have no idea what you're talking about.

704
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,760
Alright,

705
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:12,570
stop acting tough
when you're so badly hurt.

706
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,000
Song Yimeng.

707
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,960
I didn't send those assassins.

708
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,030
I know.

709
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,400
Then why did you

710
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,480
come back to save me?

711
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,070
Because

712
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,550
I made a bet with myself.

713
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,400
What bet?

714
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,230
Did you win?
