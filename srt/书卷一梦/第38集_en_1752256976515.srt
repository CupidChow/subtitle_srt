1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sword is heavy.

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the deep roots of the enemy.

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,200
It's not as good as the dust.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,200
I am still a beast.

6
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,600
The fire of the Yangtze River.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
A heart that can't be burned.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
The four seas are in harmony.

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
No need to wait. No need to hate.

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Write the script.

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
For all that's broken.

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,800
I will write my life down.

13
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,600
The fire of the Yangtze River.

14
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,600
I will not run away from it.

15
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
I will not regret my youth.

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,600
I will be the one to make the world a better place.

17
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,600
For this life and for all lives.

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,600
I will sacrifice my life.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,600
In the next episode,

20
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,600
the dragon number is grows.

21
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
eins, teeth is true.

22
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
I will not let the punishment want to score,

23
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
I will not regret.

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Please subscribe my channel!

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
See you next time, there'll be sending out.

26
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
Floral steam bath is also a similar as the scene in Yangtze River.

27
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
I will buy two whole bath.

28
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Before that....

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Not only in the temple,

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
relatively open

31
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,380
I feelANGER

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,080
a recommended

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,960
play

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,260
I am

35
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,720
engage

36
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,260
As long as

37
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,700
Hares

38
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,780
Yanshan

39
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,600
is

40
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,020
the

41
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,920
last

42
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,160
I did the

43
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,300
insuran

44
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,260
interaction

45
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,120
Bonolate

46
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,620
On guard

47
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,700
some people

48
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,300
None of them can kill me.

49
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,260
Qianyu Army,

50
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,100
at the order of Young General.

51
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,580
Fu Hua, save me.

52
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,220
I'm number three.

53
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,140
Chu Feihong, what do you want?

54
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,740
Of course, I'm going to kill you.

55
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,620
Sui Meng, come down.

56
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,940
I don't believe you.

57
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,100
You don't.

58
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,020
Today, as long as the second blood test is done,

59
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,620
everything will not end.

60
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,340
It's the crown princess.

61
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,340
She went to Qianyu's mansion.

62
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,420
There are other signs.

63
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,380
It has nothing to do with the boy.

64
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,980
My daughter is getting married.

65
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,260
I'm afraid I can't make it this time.

66
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,300
I'm so worried.

67
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,380
I can't kill Fu Hua.

68
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,820
Chu Feihong, you can't do this.

69
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,820
Your Highness, go find the crown prince.

70
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,700
The prince of Shi Ba killed the emperor.

71
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,820
I'm thinking of buying a red orange to comfort Fu Hua.

72
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,180
If I can't do this,

73
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,460
I can't trust anyone but you.

74
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,700
It's the wind again.

75
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,580
Where did the wind come from?

76
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,180
That's right.

77
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,460
Chu Feihong pulled the talisman from the border

78
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,780
to return to the capital.

79
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,940
vaccinated

80
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,580
Please, please.

81
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,780
I'm dead.

82
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,060
I'm back.

83
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,100
Nangeng.

84
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Nangeng.

85
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,620
Nangeng!

86
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,020
Nangeng!

87
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,820
Nangeng!

88
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,260
Nangeng!

89
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,220
Nangeng!

90
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,500
You can't see me!

91
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,460
Nangeng!

92
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,900
Nangeng!

93
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,180
Nangeng!

94
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,780
Nangeng.

95
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,100
Nangeng.

96
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,340
It's really you.

97
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,540
Nangeng.

98
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,220
Nangeng.

99
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,500
Why did you do this?

100
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,300
You really love me, right?

101
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,620
I thought I wouldn't see you again.

102
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,900
What's wrong?

103
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,900
What happened?

104
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,780
What's wrong?

105
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,780
Who bullied you?

106
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,780
No one bullied me.

107
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,780
Nangeng, I'm really back.

108
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,780
You're still alive.

109
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,780
You're so great.

110
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,780
What do you mean I'm not dead?

111
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,780
I'm living well.

112
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,780
What's wrong?

113
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,780
You liar!

114
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,780
You've clearly been in that bad shape.

115
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,780
You're still trying to hide it from me?

116
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,780
You're trying to hide it from me?

117
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,780
Do you want to be the only one who can be blamed?

118
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,780
What do you mean?

119
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,780
No.

120
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,780
I'm fine.

121
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,780
You're still not going to tell me?

122
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,780
You've already become like this.

123
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,780
You're still not going to tell me?

124
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,780
Okay, okay, okay.

125
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,780
Chief.

126
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,780
Aren't you going to discuss the key to the King of Qinyu?

127
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,780
What do you mean by dragging it out this early in the morning?

128
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,780
I have something very important to tell you.

129
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,780
I've already known everything.

130
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,780
And...

131
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,780
I also died with you.

132
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,780
In a while,

133
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,780
send someone to take care of the Songyi Hall's daughter.

134
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,780
This way, Songyi Meng will be obedient.

135
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,780
Also,

136
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,780
make sure the emperor's poisoning is arranged properly.

137
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,780
There's only one Songyi Meng.

138
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,780
There's only one Songyi Meng.

139
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,780
It's not enough to threaten the South Marquis.

140
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,780
Did you hear me?

141
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,780
It's too late if you don't do it.

142
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,780
I know.

143
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,780
As soon as the incident happens,

144
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,780
I'll enter the palace to take care of the King of Qin.

145
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,780
You must listen to me this time.

146
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,780
You can't act without permission.

147
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,780
Everything today

148
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,780
is to promote the second selection of the City Hall.

149
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,780
Only when the plan is done and the scene is clear,

150
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,780
can I return to the present

151
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,780
and arrange the best ending for you.

152
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,780
Where did you come from?

153
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,780
You're talking nonsense.

154
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,780
I'm not talking nonsense.

155
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,780
I'm just talking about the situation.

156
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,780
You're here to talk nonsense?

157
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,780
It's crazy again.

158
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,780
Everything

159
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,780
has just begun.

160
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,780
So Chu Guihong and King Qianyu

161
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,780
are not on the same page.

162
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,780
King Qianyu's purpose

163
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,780
is to return to the present after the scene is clear.

164
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,780
And Chu Guihong

165
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,780
is seemingly willing to cooperate.

166
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,780
In fact,

167
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,780
he wants to poison the emperor

168
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,780
and frame you.

169
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,780
Then he can make it clear

170
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,780
and play the trick of the rebels

171
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,780
to send troops to kill you

172
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,780
under the city.

173
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,780
Kill him?

174
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,780
And then?

175
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,780
And then?

176
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,780
Of course, he's trying to get the throne

177
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,780
and be the emperor himself.

178
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,780
What are you nodding for?

179
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,780
He just woke up.

180
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,780
Can he believe it?

181
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,780
Sister-in-law,

182
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,780
I think you've been over-exaggerating recently

183
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,780
and had a strange dream.

184
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,780
I believe him.

185
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,780
Think about it.

186
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,780
Even the world is locked by the brush.

187
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,780
What's impossible?

188
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,780
Is there any clue

189
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,780
in this round?

190
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,780
In fact, when I first came here,

191
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,780
I also experienced a round.

192
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,780
At that time,

193
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,780
I wanted to marry Chu Guihong.

194
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,780
And in the script,

195
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,780
I wrote that

196
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,780
I would run away from the wedding on the day of my wedding.

197
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,780
So later,

198
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,780
no matter how hard I tried to turn the plot,

199
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,780
it was all a cruel ending.

200
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,780
You can't come!

201
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,780
Wait for you.

202
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,780
Miss.

203
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,780
You can't come!

204
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,780
Let go of me!

205
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,780
I won't read this script.

206
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,780
I won't read it.

207
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,780
And this time,

208
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,780
the first round

209
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,780
seems to be because

210
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,780
I died.

211
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,780
So you mean

212
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,780
as long as you're dead,

213
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,780
we can go back to this moment?

214
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,780
That's right.

215
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,780
Then what does the Chu family

216
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,780
have to fight with us?

217
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,780
If it's not good,

218
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,780
you can just kill yourself.

219
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,780
You make sense.

220
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,780
If at that time,

221
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,780
I die again.

222
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,780
What's the point?

223
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,780
What if there's a failure?

224
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,780
Don't worry.

225
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,780
I've experienced it.

226
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,780
There won't be a failure.

227
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,780
That's not good.

228
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,780
What if the round fails?

229
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,780
Or what if there's a change in the round?

230
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,780
I tell you,

231
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,780
I will never let you risk your life.

232
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,780
Nan Heng,

233
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,780
this time is really different.

234
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,780
Let everyone have a second chance.

235
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,780
Only I can do it.

236
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,780
I don't risk it.

237
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,780
Cheng Lu, the key to the second round is you.

238
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,780
As long as you don't appear on the tower,

239
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,780
they can't complete the plan.

240
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,780
But...

241
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,780
But...

242
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,780
But I can't just watch you...

243
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,780
Listen to me.

244
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,780
Listen to me.

245
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,780
You've told us everything.

246
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,780
That's enough.

247
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,780
Leave the rest to us.

248
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,780
Later,

249
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,780
I'll let Fu Gui

250
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,780
take care of you.

251
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,780
Before I control

252
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,780
Chu Shifu,

253
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,780
you can't go anywhere.

254
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,780
Nan Heng.

255
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,780
Listen to me.

256
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,780
If Qian Yi Wang

257
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,780
wants to be the second-choice player,

258
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,780
he will be a subordinate to Song Yuting.

259
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,780
I think

260
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,780
they will do it outside the city.

261
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,780
Okay.

262
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,780
I'm the one who saves me.

263
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,780
I'm the one who saves me.

264
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,780
You're the one who saves you.

265
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,780
I'll leave the palace to you.

266
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,780
Remember to take the team.

267
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,780
Don't forget.

268
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,780
He said you died in front of me.

269
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,780
This time,

270
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,780
I will die behind you.

271
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,780
Nan Heng.

272
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,780
I know I can't go with you.

273
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,780
It will be a mess if I go.

274
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,780
But you have to promise me.

275
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,780
Be careful.

276
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,780
You have to protect yourself.

277
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,780
Okay?

278
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,780
Don't worry.

279
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,780
Good.

280
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,780
Take it.

281
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,780
Okay.

282
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,780
Let's go.

283
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,780
Attack.

284
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,780
Hurry.

285
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,780
Hurry.

286
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,780
General.

287
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,780
What you asked for

288
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,780
has been done.

289
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,780
But

290
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,780
our people

291
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,780
just received the report from the informant.

292
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,780
They said Nan Heng went to the emperor's palace this morning.

293
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,780
And the guards in the palace

294
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,780
have increased a lot.

295
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,780
This is strange.

296
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,780
Where are Song Yiting and Mu Ni?

297
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,780
Our people are watching them.

298
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,780
Okay.

299
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,780
I have my own arrangement in the palace.

300
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,780
Song Yiting, you go ahead.

301
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,780
Yes.

302
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,780
Ruo Hua.

303
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,780
Now, except you,

304
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,780
I can't trust anyone.

305
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,780
Remember.

306
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,780
If the prince has orders,

307
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,780
you can do as you want.

308
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,780
But

309
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,780
you don't have to listen to me.

310
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,780
Your Majesty.

311
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,780
Prince Eighteen is here.

312
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,780
Call him in.

313
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,780
Yes.

314
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,780
Father.

315
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,780
Father.

316
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,780
Let me peel an orange for you.

317
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,780
Okay.

318
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,780
Father.

319
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,780
You are so old.

320
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,780
You can't even peel an orange.

321
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,780
When my mother was alive,

322
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,780
she peeled it for me.

323
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,780
I didn't peel an orange for others.

324
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,780
Here.

325
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,780
You are so clumsy.

326
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,780
I'll do it.

327
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,780
Okay.

328
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,780
Father is the best.

329
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,780
Your Majesty.

330
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,780
Your Highness.

331
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,780
Your Highness.

332
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,780
You are getting better.

333
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,780
This thing is poisonous.

334
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,780
No.

335
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,780
Qi.

336
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,780
Are you confused?

337
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,780
I'm afraid that father is in a bad mood.

338
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,780
So I bought red orange.

339
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,780
How can you frame me for poisoning?

340
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,780
You are so sad.

341
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,780
When did I say you were poisoned?

342
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,780
Chu Guihong poisoned you.

343
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,780
Let me ask you.

344
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,780
Where did you get this?

345
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,780
I...

346
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,780
I bought it in time.

347
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,780
Did you meet anyone on the way?

348
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,780
Yesterday...

349
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,780
Well...

350
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,780
I met Ronghua.

351
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,780
Ronghua?

352
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,780
That's it.

353
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,780
Her Majesty is in a bad mood.

354
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,780
Red orange is her favorite food.

355
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,780
Every year,

356
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,780
Brother 18th will eat it with His Majesty.

357
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,780
He will miss his old friend.

358
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,780
There are not many people who know about it.

359
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,780
But Chu Guihong is one of them.

360
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,780
So I guess he must have bought the food.

361
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,780
He poisoned it.

362
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,780
He wanted to poison His Majesty.

363
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,780
Impossible.

364
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,780
Even if he is brave,

365
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,780
he doesn't dare to kill the emperor.

366
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,780
If he really wants to kill someone,

367
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,780
he will kill you first.

368
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,780
You are right.

369
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,780
He didn't plan to let go of

370
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,780
the lives of the three of us.

371
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,780
Qi.

372
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,780
I'm afraid it's just your guess.

373
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,780
I ask you.

374
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,780
Do you have any evidence?

375
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,780
Your Majesty.

376
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,780
Have you asked the people of the Imperial Hospital

377
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,780
to verify if it's true?

378
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,780
No.

379
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,780
Why do you need to verify it?

380
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,780
If you don't believe me,

381
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,780
I'll have a taste now

382
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,780
and let you see if it's poisonous.

383
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,780
I believe you.

384
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,780
Liu Mingxu.

385
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,780
Send someone to the Imperial Hospital to verify the poison.

386
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,780
Yes.

387
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,780
Qi.

388
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,780
Send your people to Nancheng.

389
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,780
Send the criminal to the Ministry of Justice

390
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,780
to be sent to jail first.

391
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,780
Give it to Yan Yi.

392
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,780
Yes.

393
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,780
Your Majesty, I have one more thing to say.

394
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,780
Go ahead.

395
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,780
I beg Your Majesty

396
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,780
to transfer the soldiers outside the city to the city.

397
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,780
Then send the Black Armor Army back to the capital

398
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,780
as soon as possible.

399
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,780
What...

400
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,780
What's going on today?

401
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,780
Young General.

402
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,780
As you expected,

403
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,780
after Nanhang entered the Emperor's palace,

404
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,780
His Majesty and 18th Prince

405
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,780
didn't eat your poison.

406
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,780
Not only that,

407
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,780
His Majesty also ordered the Black Armor Army to enter the capital.

408
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,780
The soldiers are sent to the capital?

409
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,780
Is the news true?

410
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,780
Absolutely.

411
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,780
It's what our little eunuch

412
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,780
who lives in the palace said.

413
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,780
What about the little criminal who sold red blood?

414
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,780
Have you sent him to the capital?

415
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,780
It's too late.

416
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,780
When you asked me to rush over,

417
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,780
he was just taken away by the Black Armor Army.

418
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,780
Young General.

419
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,780
What should we do next?

420
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,780
That little criminal

421
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,780
must not be able to endure the torture

422
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,780
and will tell us to get out.

423
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,780
If we are charged with treason,

424
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,780
what about...

425
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,780
So what if we are treacherous?

426
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,780
He pushed me to the dead end.

427
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,780
I can still be soft.

428
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,780
Inform Rong Hua to act in advance.

429
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,780
Yes.

430
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,780
The wound is 2 inches deep.

431
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,780
Qianyu's knife is damaged.

432
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,780
I'm afraid that the second sister-in-law

433
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,780
has been taken away by the Qianyu Army.

434
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,780
The footprints are going that way.

435
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,780
It should be just gone.

436
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,780
Chase.

437
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,780
Second Master.

438
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,780
The situation has changed.

439
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,780
Should we report to the boss first?

440
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,780
The big boss is still in the palace.

441
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,780
It's definitely too late to come back and forth.

442
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,780
The brothers are all here now.

443
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,780
Let's save them first.

444
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,780
Go.

445
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,780
Go.

446
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,780
Go.

447
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,780
Go.

448
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,780
Go.

449
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,780
Go.

450
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,780
Hurry.

451
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,780
Hurry.

452
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,780
Hurry.

453
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,780
Go.

454
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,780
Go.

455
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,780
Go.

456
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,780
The second master.

457
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,780
Tingting's hairpin.

458
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,780
Second Master, there's one here too.

459
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,780
Second Master.

460
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,100
Second Sister-in-law left it on purpose

461
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,220
so that we can find it.

462
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,580
It might be a trap.

463
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,020
Should we go after it?

464
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,900
Let's go.

465
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,100
Let's go inside and have a look.

466
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,180
Second Sister-in-law.

467
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,700
Second Sister-in-law.

468
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,660
Ting Ting.

469
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,420
Second Sister-in-law.

470
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,940
Ting Ting.

471
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,140
Second Sister-in-law.

472
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,100
Second Sister-in-law.

473
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,460
Second Sister-in-law.

474
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,460
Run!

475
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,580
Are you crazy?

476
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,300
Chu Weihong, are you crazy?

477
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,060
What kind of curse is that?

478
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,060
What?

479
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,260
You see the person you love die in front of you.

480
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,060
But you feel helpless.

481
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,380
Is it hard to take it?

482
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,020
Ting Ting.

483
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,900
You bastard!

484
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,620
Ting Ting.

485
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,740
I've tasted this kind of taste

486
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,620
in the battle of Pingyong.

487
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,980
My father died in the hands of Nan Heng.

488
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,780
Why can't I kill him?

489
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,820
Let me go.

490
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,060
Weihong, listen to me.

491
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,740
The person you hate

492
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,220
should be Nan Heng, right?

493
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,820
It shouldn't be us.

494
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,700
Ting and I will never let you down.

495
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,100
I'm begging you.

496
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,740
Let Ting go.

497
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,540
I can help you

498
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,780
no matter how you deal with Nan Heng.

499
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,380
Can't I help you?

500
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,140
You don't have to do that.

501
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,900
You and I are nobodies.

502
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,980
We should be together.

503
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,620
Mother.

504
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,100
Let me go.

505
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,220
Let me go.

506
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,460
Mother.

507
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,420
You can't understand.

508
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,220
Ting.

509
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
Tell me.

510
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,420
What do you feel

511
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,900
when Qiao Jian Shangguan died?

512
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,580
Tell me.

513
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,540
I can't let you suffer

514
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,060
to make me feel sorry.

515
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,180
Ting.

516
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,180
That's right.

517
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,260
People have love and hate.

518
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,140
People have the guts to change their fate.

519
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,100
No one should be a burden to others.

520
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,900
Every pain I've been through

521
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,580
has become the end of Nan Heng.

522
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,620
I can't believe it.

523
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,820
Stop talking nonsense.

524
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,860
Kill me if you want.

525
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,500
If you let me live,

526
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,180
I'll let you die.

527
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,900
I won't kill you.

528
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,140
Just do me a favor.

529
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,740
Mu Er is not as good as you.

530
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,780
But he's always in trouble.

531
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,940
All these years,

532
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,500
I don't believe you don't have any feelings for him.

533
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,940
As long as you help me ask him out,

534
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,060
I'll give you a good ending.

535
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,140
You want me to help you make a deal?

536
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,420
Dream on!

537
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,340
Ting.

538
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,460
Ting!

539
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,700
Ting!

540
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,240
How about bestowing

541
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,700
Meng with something?

542
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,500
I just got the imperial decree to capture the father of Chu Shi.

543
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,700
Why are you here?

544
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,900
Your Highness, you're late.

545
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,300
Prince Qian Yu is already dead.

546
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,300
This is a trap.

547
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,500
The palace just got the news that they're going to capture the Chu family.

548
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,300
The late Prince Qian Yu is dead.

549
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,900
Chu Gui Hong also disappeared.

550
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,300
This is too coincidental.

551
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,500
Who else can it be, except Chu Gui Hong?

552
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,900
This Chu Gui Hong,

553
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,300
he has the ability to kill the Chu family.

554
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,500
This Chu Gui Hong,

555
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,100
he has the ability to use his power.

556
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,500
There must be other plans.

557
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,700
Take someone to search for Chu Gui Hong.

558
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,900
Yes.

559
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,500
Let's go.

560
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,100
Your Highness! Your Highness!

561
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,700
There's an explosion outside the Shulin Mountain Cave.

562
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,500
Ye Wu Shen is in the cave.

563
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,700
Your Highness, please let me in.

564
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,500
I have to see the First Miss today.

565
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,300
Song Fu, let me go in and report to the Crown Princess Consort.

566
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,900
There's no time. Move aside.

567
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,500
Fu Gui.

568
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
Aunt.

569
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,700
Madam, what happened?

570
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,700
Aunt, please save A-Ting.

571
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,500
Save A-Ting.

572
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,900
What's wrong with A-Ting?

573
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,900
Chu Gui Hong, that bastard, captured A-Ting.

574
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,500
A-Ting.

575
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
A-Ting.

576
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,300
A-Ting.

577
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,500
A-Ting...

578
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,100
A-Ting caught A-Ting.

579
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:34,500
Cad.

580
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,020
We entrance was closed.

581
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,100
A-Ting ran across A-Ting's foot.

582
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,900
Subscribe.

583
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,900
Wait, master.

584
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,540
Come, let's talk.

585
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,060
Aunt, I'm begging you.

586
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,300
This is nonsense.

587
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,020
You have to go alone

588
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,500
to the Song family.

589
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,500
You have to go alone.

590
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,340
I know.

591
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,100
I've done many things wrong to you.

592
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,100
But you can't leave me alone.

593
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,100
I'm begging you.

594
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,900
I'm begging you, okay?

595
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,860
Madam, don't say anything.

596
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,260
Come, take me there.

597
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,780
No.

598
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,740
Crown Princess,

599
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,700
I'll take care of Chu Weihong.

600
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,780
I'll take some soldiers

601
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,260
to save her.

602
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,500
No.

603
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,940
She asked me to go alone.

604
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,980
If she can't see me,

605
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,140
she won't stop.

606
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,420
You can't go.

607
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,860
Her Highness told me before she left.

608
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,860
You can't leave.

609
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,020
Fugui,

610
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,580
if there's a problem today,

611
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,780
will you leave?

612
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,260
How can I leave?

613
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,820
I'm her servant.

614
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,140
My life is hers.

615
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,300
You're different.

616
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,620
You're her family.

617
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,980
But Ting is my family.

618
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,980
I have to save her.

619
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,700
Then,

620
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,700
you have to report to her.

621
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,780
She's injured.

622
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,700
Don't tell her yet.

623
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,820
Don't worry.

624
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,380
They won't do anything to me.

625
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,580
Then,

626
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,180
tell her to take the soldiers.

627
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,180
Follow her.

628
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,340
The Song family

629
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,340
will be surrounded by Qian Yujuan.

630
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,340
You can't show up here.

631
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,660
There's a grassy grass

632
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,860
outside the Song's house.

633
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,860
You can stay there.

634
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,580
If Crown Princess

635
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,940
doesn't come out in an hour,

636
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,620
I'll fight with Chu Weihong

637
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,620
to win the country.

638
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,860
Please.

639
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,340
Please.

640
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,660
Chu Weihong,

641
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,940
where's Ting?

642
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,540
Where are the other people

643
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,540
of the Song family?

644
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,620
I'm just around here.

645
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,020
She stabbed him.

646
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,020
Right?

647
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,220
Yes.

648
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,620
But,

649
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,620
that's an old script.

650
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,620
And you'll die soon.

651
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,740
That's it.

652
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,700
Song Yi Mo,

653
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,620
why are you still helping her?

654
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,420
Because she's not

655
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,420
the same Nan Heng.

656
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,220
Chu Weihong,

657
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,220
I came to see you today

658
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,220
because my family is still in your hands.

659
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,020
I want to give you one last chance.

660
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,020
I'm just like you.

661
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,420
I hate that script

662
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,420
that can control everyone's fate.

663
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,820
What we're doing now

664
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,820
is to change

665
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,820
the fate of our family.

666
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,420
And the Song family,

667
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,820
the Cang Jiang Yue,

668
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,820
all the people, including you.

669
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,420
If you can let go of your obsession,

670
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,620
the world is big,

671
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,220
and you can build a palace

672
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,820
and a sand field in any place.

673
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,820
You can even be like your father

674
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,620
and become a bank.

675
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,620
Enough!

676
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,220
Why should I believe you?

677
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,820
Why should I be a

678
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,820
a person who will never die?

679
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,020
I learned to be a knife at six.

680
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,420
I was on the border at seventeen.

681
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,020
I have more injuries than Nan Heng.

682
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,020
The people of the Hu Xia are countless.

683
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,420
But in the end,

684
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,220
because he's the master of the Nan Chu,

685
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,620
because of the manipulator's little tricks,

686
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,020
I deserve to be trampled on.

687
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,020
I deserve to die.

688
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,820
Song Yi Mo,

689
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,620
tell me,

690
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,820
if you were me,

691
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,820
would you not fight?

692
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,820
Of course I would.

693
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,820
But I wouldn't be like you.

694
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,820
In order to achieve my goal,

695
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,820
I would hurt those innocent lives.

696
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,820
Have you thought about it?

697
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,820
For your selfish desires,

698
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,820
you made all the innocent people

699
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,820
become your victims.

700
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,820
Have you thought about all of this?

701
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,820
I also want to tell you,

702
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,820
the one who caused your tragic fate

703
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,820
is not Nan Heng,

704
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,820
but the script from before.

705
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,820
You're right.

706
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,820
It was the one who was born

707
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,820
in my father's body.

708
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,820
So I killed him.

709
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,820
What?

710
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,820
Is it strange?

711
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,820
Because Chu Gui Hong

712
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,820
is a good person

713
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,820
who loves the country and does not betray others,

714
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,820
so I can't kill anyone.

715
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,820
I should have known

716
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,820
that you are not

717
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,820
the Chu Gui Hong I knew.

718
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,820
Then are you the Song Yi Mo

719
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,820
I know?

720
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,820
My son is the most

721
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,820
dangerous person in the world.

722
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,820
He never stands in front of me.

723
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,820
He never fights with others

724
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,820
against me.

725
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,820
I...

726
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,820
Song Xiao Yu,

727
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,820
you don't have to say anything today.

728
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,820
Before the big event,

729
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,820
I won't let you go.

730
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,820
So you want to take me as a hostage

731
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,820
and lure Nan Heng here?

732
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,820
Let me tell you,

733
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,820
stop dreaming.

734
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,820
He won't come.

735
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,820
You guessed it right.

736
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,820
But that's just it.

737
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,820
It's not enough.

738
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,820
Come on.

739
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,820
Come on.

740
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,820
Wake up.

741
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,820
Wake up.

742
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,820
Your Highness,

743
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,820
I found it.

744
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,820
Hurry up.

745
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,820
Come on, help me.

746
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,820
Come on.

747
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,820
A'Lou.

748
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,820
A'Lou.

749
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,820
A'Lou.

750
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,820
Hurry up and save him.

751
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,820
Yes.

752
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,820
Come on.

753
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,820
Hurry up.

754
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,820
Shangguan Ke.

755
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,820
Shangguan Ke.

756
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,820
Help.

757
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,820
A'Hu.

758
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,820
A'Hu.

759
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,820
A'Hu.

760
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,820
A'Hu.

761
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,820
Your Highness.

762
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,820
A'Hu.

763
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,820
He's still breathing.

764
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,820
I'm afraid he can't get up.

765
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,980
Your Highness,

766
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,260
have some rest, please.

767
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,820
Well.

768
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,500
Well, could you please

769
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,840
turn off the lights?

770
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Okay, Your Highness.

771
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,240
A'Hu.

772
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,220
Let's go.

773
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,180
Go.

774
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,580
Hurry up.

775
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,040
Go.

776
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,260
Soon...

777
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,580
Ah Hu.

778
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,760
Ah Hu.

779
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,020
Boss,

780
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,300
it was did by my father after he turned out of hisпain.

781
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,000
Fine.

782
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,820
Don't talk.

783
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,340
Spread him out.

784
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,240
All right.

785
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,660
Get up.

786
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,820
If you want to save Song Yi Meng,

787
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,820
I will come to your mansion alone.

788
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,460
Get out.

789
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,740
Hurry.

790
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,940
Or I will beat you.

791
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:18,780
Meng.

792
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,580
Dad,

793
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,420
A'ting,

794
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:22,900
Madam,

795
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,460
I am sorry

796
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,140
for bringing you into this trouble.

797
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,620
vereat Wanywho,

798
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,900
your aim is Lanhang and I and

799
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,980
your family had no grudge.

800
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,140
It was just a misunderstanding.

801
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,140
I'm not angry with you.

802
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,140
At that time, Mr. Song

803
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,140
treated me with a little gift.

804
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,140
Song Yi Mo,

805
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,140
you changed first,

806
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,140
not me.

807
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,140
Crown Princess, don't listen to her.

808
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,140
It was Qian Yu Jun who broke into the house first.

809
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,140
Many people died in the house,

810
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,140
and a lot of blood was spilled.

811
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,140
You bastard!

812
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,140
Why did you kill the innocent?

813
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,140
Stop! Stop talking!

814
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,140
It's just a prison.

815
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,140
Just kill me.

816
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,140
Song Yi Mo,

817
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,140
listen to me.

818
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,140
My knife has already been stained with a lot of blood.

819
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,140
I don't mind killing a few more people.

820
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,140
If you want to save their lives,

821
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,140
you have to kill them.

822
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,140
I'm not afraid of you.

823
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,140
I'm not afraid of you.

824
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,140
I'm afraid that you will do as I say.

825
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,140
What do you want me to do?

826
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,140
I've already sent someone

827
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,140
to inform Nan He about your news in Song's Mansion.

828
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,140
I believe that he will come alone

829
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,140
in a few days.

830
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,140
I want you to persuade Nan He to hand over the ancient talisman.

831
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,140
I want to marry him.

832
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,140
I want to ascend the throne.

833
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,140
You're so wild.

834
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,140
You're shameless!

835
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,140
Even if I don't think about myself,

836
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,140
I have to think about your good father and sister.

837
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,140
As long as I get the talisman,

838
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,140
and Nan He dies,

839
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,140
I promise

840
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,140
to give you and the Song family all the gold and silver

841
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,140
to keep you safe.

842
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,140
Chu Gui Hong,

843
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,140
the Chu family has been loyal for generations.

844
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:47,140
How can they keep a bastard like you?

845
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,140
Master,

846
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,140
stop talking.

847
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,140
You can't be angry with him anymore.

848
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,140
Miss,

849
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,140
I know

850
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,140
I'm sorry.

851
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,140
But

852
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,140
I don't want you

853
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,140
to have anything to do with Yi Ting.

854
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,140
I hope you can live, too.

855
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,140
Shut up!

856
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,140
The Song family should have a family.

857
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,140
The Song family never had a son

858
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,140
who was a man of his word.

859
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,140
He betrayed His Highness and killed him.

860
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,140
I can't do it.

861
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,140
Xiaomeng is not allowed to do it.

862
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,140
Father is right.

863
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,140
If you betray the people of the Song family

864
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,140
because of your selfishness,

865
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,140
you won't have peace of mind in the future.

866
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,140
Instead,

867
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,140
you'd better die with this Chu thief.

868
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,140
Yi Ting,

869
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,140
what are you talking about?

870
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,140
What a good play

871
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,140
of sister and sister-in-law.

872
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,140
You're so worried about Song Yi Meng and Nan Heng.

873
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,140
Why don't you open your eyes and take a good look?

874
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,140
The one you're protecting now

875
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,140
is Song Yi Meng, right?

876
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,140
So what?

877
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,140
I only know

878
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,140
he can use his life

879
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,140
to protect us.

880
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,140
Ting,

881
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,140
Father,

882
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,140
you're a good son.

883
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,140
Stop!

884
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,140
I'm not your daughter.

885
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,140
She's right.

886
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,140
I'm not Song Yi Meng.

887
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,140
I'm

888
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,140
the son of a woman from another world.

889
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,140
Song Yi Meng, shut up!

890
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,140
You're my elder sister.

891
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,140
You're here for a day,

892
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,140
and you're my elder sister for a day!

893
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,140
She's my daughter, Song Yi Meng!

894
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,140
The bandage is not thin.

895
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,940
If you feel confused,

896
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,500
you'd better make a good choice.

897
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,060
Is it to protect Song family

898
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,140
to repay the kindness of the city?

899
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,220
Or to neglect your family

900
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,260
and choose Nan Heng?

901
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,420
Dad! Dad!

902
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,340
Master!

903
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,220
Dad!

904
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,540
Dad!

905
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,340
Si Huai Yin!

906
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,380
Dad! Dad!

907
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,500
Chu Wei Hong,

908
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,140
you'll be punished!

909
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,020
Dad!

910
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,460
Dad!

911
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,380
Meng.

912
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,460
Dad!

913
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,180
You're still as lovey-dovey as when you were a kid.

914
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,100
Dad! Dad!

915
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:58,660
Dad!

916
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,660
I can't protect you.

917
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,460
Dad!

918
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,820
Dad!

919
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,820
Dad!

920
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,780
Dad!

921
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,780
Dad!

922
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,780
Dad!

923
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,380
Dad!

924
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,140
Dad!

925
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,340
Dad!

926
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,380
Dad!

927
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,380
Dad!

928
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,260
You saw it, too.

929
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,860
He was the one who wanted to die.

930
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,860
Dad!

931
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,460
Forget it.

932
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:29,860
Song Yi Meng,

933
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,220
if you want to protect the lives of other people,

934
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,860
do as I said.

935
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,540
It's time.

936
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,380
Nan Heng should come, too.

937
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,500
Ting.

938
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,380
Madam.

939
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,980
I'm sorry.

940
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,620
It all started because of me.

941
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,100
I should be the one to end it.

942
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,180
As long as I'm dead,

943
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,860
everything will start over.

944
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,100
Song Yi Meng, what are you doing?

945
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,860
Yi Meng!

946
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,100
You're not dead.

947
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,100
You're not dead.

948
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,100
You're not dead.

949
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,100
You're not dead.

950
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,100
You're not dead.

951
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,100
You're not dead.

952
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,100
You're not dead.

953
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,100
You're not dead.

954
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,100
You're not dead.

How can love and hate hide?

Time has passed, as if it's not worth giving up.

987
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:30,580
Life is not destined to be changed.

988
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:35,580
If love is not determined, how can it be the end?

989
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:43,580
Please stay still.
