[A Dream Within A Dream]

2
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,910
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,710
I know that

4
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,759
this method of weapon forging

5
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,870
involves your identity as a prince

6
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,740
and must not be leaked.

7
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,240
But she's a young lady after all,

8
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,570
and such a good one at that.

9
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,650
Do you really expect me to torture her

10
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,680
or silence her by killing?

11
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,230
What I meant is that...

12
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:07,870
No, don't talk yet.

13
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,639
Listen to me.

14
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,789
You know who Song Yiting is.

15
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,330
Song Yiting is Song Yimeng's
younger sister.

16
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,630
If Song Yimeng's sister dies,

17
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,710
do you think she won't investigate?

18
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,310
And do you think she won't find out
it's you, Li Shiliu, behind it?

19
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:15,710
I...

20
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,470
So I think the top priority now

21
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,730
is to get the blade back

22
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,130
instead of assigning blame.

23
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,400
Tomorrow is the last day of the
three-day deadline.

24
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,930
Do you really have to get someone killed
at this critical point?

25
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,430
Are you done?

26
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,200
When did I ever say

27
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,510
I wanted to kill Song Yiting?

28
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,780
Or in your eyes,

29
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,270
am I just someone who takes lives lightly,

30
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,220
commits all kinds of evil,

31
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,550
and is beyond redemption?

32
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,320
No, it's just

33
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,610
I've heard Song Yimeng say those things
about you

34
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,430
so many times that I got influenced.

35
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,829
That's not what I meant.

36
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,000
Let me tell you,

37
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,050
I'll be blunt upfront.

38
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,410
If you get the blade back

39
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,740
and handle the aftermath properly,

40
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,540
we can put this matter behind us.

41
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,610
But if you can't get the blade back

42
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,730
and cause me any more trouble,

43
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,410
I won't lay a hand on Song Yiting,

44
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,500
but I make no promises about
not dealing with you.

45
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Understand?

46
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,010
I understand.

47
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,240
You can get me out of jail,

48
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,770
and you can throw me back in.

49
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,870
Don't worry.

50
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,100
I've already angered her today.

51
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,910
I won't go see her tomorrow, either.

52
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,150
The moment the three-day deadline is up,

53
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:21,910
I'll go collect it immediately.

54
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,900
Why wait for three days?

55
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,780
Go tomorrow.

56
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,510
Understood.

57
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,380
Wait, since when did you

58
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,320
start caring so much about a woman?

59
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,220
I... I...

60
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,130
I...

61
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,060
You're not in love with her, are you?

62
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,070
Of... Of course not.

63
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,790
That's for the best.

64
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,310
As your older brother,

65
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,240
let me tell you something.

66
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,000
This is the folly of love...

67
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,640
The weakness of heroes.

68
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,840
Good that you understand.

69
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,300
But for a worthless man like me,

70
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,700
my spirit's even weaker.

71
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,680
My Lady.

72
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,820
Please take a rest.

73
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,470
No matter how many paintings you make,

74
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,240
you can't change Mr. Li's mind.

75
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,740
I'm not painting these

76
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,220
for him,

77
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,930
but to remind myself

78
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,150
how foolish I've been.

79
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:58,870
I thought if I put my sincere heart
out there,

80
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,470
it would definitely lead to something.

81
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,020
The way he saved me that day

82
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,060
keeps lingering in my mind.

83
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,910
Every time I think of it,

84
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,520
I make a painting.

85
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,160
73 paintings.

86
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,500
I thought

87
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,570
I had truly fallen for him.

88
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,470
My Lady!

89
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:41,150
However many paintings I used
to think of him,

90
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,150
I'll need just as many to forget him.

91
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,360
If one isn't enough,

92
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,880
then I'll tear up another!

93
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,630
My Lady!

94
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,630
My Lady!

95
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:49,900
My Lady.

96
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,180
These...

97
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,409
These are all your hard work!

98
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,950
Stop tearing them up.

99
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,390
Please stop.

100
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,340
He's just an ordinary man.

101
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,030
What makes him any different

102
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,400
from the others?

103
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,020
I, Song Yiting, will never be
trapped by love.

104
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,510
There are thousands of rivers
in this world,

105
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,310
so why settle for just one ladle?

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,430
[Seventh Prince's Mansion]

107
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:40,670
He's had two bowls already this morning.

108
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,000
Good appetite suggests good mood.

109
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,630
If he's in such a good mood,

110
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,530
could it be because of Yiting?

111
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,490
This dish is too salty.

112
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,630
Pickled vegetables are supposed
to be salty, okay?

113
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,159
Being so picky,

114
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,920
could it be he had a fight with Yiting?

115
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,400
You're not eating?

116
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,220
Is it not to your taste?

117
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,420
Or is it because

118
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,780
you fed me medicine yesterday,

119
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,440
you're expecting me to feed you
today in return?

120
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,630
I'd rather not,

121
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,520
lest I soil Your Highness's clothes again.

122
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,710
You've been in the palace for 10 days now
since Mother brought you in.

123
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,390
Now that you've finally come out,

124
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,850
why not visit your family?

125
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,990
Don't you miss them?

126
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,170
Trying to get rid of me so soon,

127
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,909
can't wait to see Yiting, huh?

128
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,270
What's with that face?

129
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,870
I was just wondering

130
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,230
why Your Highness

131
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,600
suddenly started caring about my family.

132
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,070
After we get married,

133
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,650
your family

134
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,700
will be my family too, right?

135
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,140
I knew it,

136
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,630
you're up to something.

137
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,720
By the way,

138
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,340
does your sister have someone she likes?

139
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,450
I heard she's quite picky,

140
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,720
and hasn't settled on an engagement yet.

141
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,380
What kind of man does she like?

142
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,740
You scumbag,

143
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,640
already trying to make a move?

144
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,419
Why did you slam the bowl?

145
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,289
What's wrong?

146
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,400
Well, Your Highness.

147
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,370
I-I suddenly have a stomachache.

148
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,530
You're having a stomachache?

149
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,510
I can't take it anymore.

150
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,990
My stomach hurts too much.

151
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,850
Your Highness.

152
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,750
Please enjoy your meal without me.

153
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,950
I'll head back first.

154
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,480
Get an imperial physician to check on you.

155
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,230
Have you heard?

156
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,110
Song Yimeng has moved into the
Seventh Prince's Residence.

157
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,870
They haven't even gotten married yet,

158
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,540
and she's already moved into
his residence.

159
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,700
How inappropriate.

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,920
That one

161
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,420
always acts outrageously.

162
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,680
When has she ever cared about propriety?

163
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,010
I also heard that

164
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,150
she once went to a pharmacy

165
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,010
to buy that kind of medicine for
the Seventh Prince.

166
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,820
Really?

167
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,130
She really has no shame at all.

168
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,950
Yiting. Yiting.

169
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,710
You know the inside story best.

170
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,830
Tell us,

171
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,350
how far have they gotten?

172
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,060
Yiting?

173
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,480
Yiting.

174
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,680
What's wrong?

175
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,880
You seem distracted.

176
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,010
Are you in a bad mood?

177
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,140
You missed the gathering

178
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,450
the other day as well.

179
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,170
Did something happen?

180
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,030
Are you feeling unwell?

181
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,060
You're not sick, are you?

182
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,480
I know!

183
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,700
Not seeing me for days

184
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,350
has made her lovesick.

185
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,590
As for Miss Yiting's ailment,

186
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,390
I

187
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,070
[Bamboo Mist, Rippling Moon]

188
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,160
understand it best.

189
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,660
Your Highness.

190
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,520
Please, no need for formalities.

191
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,820
What brings you here, Your Highness?

192
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,210
I'm here

193
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,670
to court you, Miss Yiting.

194
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,010
Yiting.

195
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,900
His Highness is here for you.

196
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:37,690
Yiting.

197
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,460
As for the question you asked me before,

198
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,770
I now have a new answer.

199
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:41,650
I've come today

200
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,250
to tell you in person.

201
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,730
Your Highness.

202
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,060
What answer do you have?

203
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,470
I believe that

204
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,010
marriages should be based on
mutual affection

205
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,060
and natural attraction.

206
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,010
Miss Yiting's talents and beauty

207
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,700
are merely external qualities.

208
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,220
What I truly love

209
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,940
is your heart.

210
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,210
Then tell me, Your Highness,

211
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,420
in your eyes,

212
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,940
what is my heart like?

213
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,770
You refuse to be bound by
conventional etiquette

214
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,240
or commit yourself carelessly
to marriage.

215
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,300
You resent being controlled
by your parents,

216
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,940
and wish to escape what others call fate.

217
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,820
You reject others' advances

218
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,420
because you feel that

219
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,820
they only love your appearance,

220
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,770
and no one has ever asked

221
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,940
who you really are.

222
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,800
But Yiting,

223
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,660
I am different from others.

224
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,530
The reason I like you

225
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,600
is simply because you are you.

226
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,610
If you love poetry and painting,

227
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,750
I like you.

228
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,530
If you love splendor and prosperity,

229
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,420
I like you.

230
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,730
Even if you're from

231
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,370
every walk of life

232
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,890
or a mere commoner,

233
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,700
I still

234
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,610
like you.

235
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,180
Yiting.

236
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,580
I want to marry you.

237
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,180
From now on,

238
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,670
I'll be the one to like you,

239
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,570
and you

240
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,770
just need to be yourself.

241
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,650
His Highness is...

242
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,490
Proposing to you?

243
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,280
Yiting,

244
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,730
isn't this

245
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,130
exactly what you've always wanted to hear?

246
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,100
Your Highness,

247
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,530
please come with me.

248
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:47,820
Tell me,

249
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,300
who taught you to say that?

250
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,180
No, I...

251
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,490
No, I...

252
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,370
No one taught him.

253
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,260
Those were all His Highness's
sincere words.

254
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,890
Yiting.

255
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,250
I've liked you for so long after all,

256
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,420
so I should've picked up some insights
by now, right?

257
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,010
Besides,

258
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,130
today I was just overcome with emotion,

259
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,130
so I poured everything out at once.

260
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,580
Seeing you doubt me like this,

261
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,180
it kind of hurts my feelings.

262
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,980
Really?

263
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,770
I'm sorry.

264
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,380
I was overthinking.

265
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,070
It's alright.

266
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,940
Yiting! Yiting!

267
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,370
Don't. Don't!

268
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,220
Wait, what are you doing?

269
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,020
Yiting, stop!

270
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,010
Wait, Yiting!

271
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,060
Yiting.

272
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,540
Can I... Can I still explain myself?

273
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,490
Let go.

274
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,610
It's over, Jixiang.

275
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,990
I'm done for, Jixiang.

276
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,010
It's all over.

277
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,940
Liu Huaiyi.

278
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,400
What do you mean by that?

279
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,210
Am I wrong?

280
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,900
Song Yiting

281
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,270
clearly wants to be the prince's consort.

282
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,320
But she has to play hard to get,

283
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,820
making the Eighteenth Prince
beg for her attention.

284
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,250
When it comes to playing hard to get
the way she does,

285
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,280
no one else can compare.

286
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,250
Yiting is not that kind of person.

287
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,980
That's because she's good at pretending,

288
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,300
acting all innocent and unworldly.

289
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,490
But among all the unmarried ladies
in the capital,

290
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,670
she's the one

291
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,700
who knows best how to catch
men's attention.

292
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,940
Why else would the Eighteenth Prince
notice her?

293
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,170
Liu Huaiyi.

294
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,700
Talking behind her back,

295
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,060
what kind of friend are you?

296
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,170
Alright, alright.

297
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,530
Stop arguing.

298
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,100
We've been friends for so many years.

299
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,940
It's not worth ruining our friendship

300
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,940
over something so trivial.

301
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,940
We may consider Song Yiting our friend,

302
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,770
but she might not feel the same way.

303
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:02,940
All these years,

304
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,840
she's been looking down on us.

305
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,230
Has she ever truly respected any of us?

306
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,560
I'll tear your mouth apart!

307
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,080
You...

308
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,700
Alright, calm down, Ruru.

309
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,610
You're angry at me?

310
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,530
You're the most pathetic one, Jia Ruru,

311
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,530
following Song Yiting around all day

312
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,770
like some echo,

313
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,220
yet understanding nothing.

314
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,300
This whole scene today

315
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,900
was clearly planned by Song Yiting
in advance!

316
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,870
All sweet and sisterly in public,

317
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,750
but backstabbing in private.

318
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,200
Miss Liu, you truly

319
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,700
live up to your reputation as
a noble lady.

320
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,370
Who is it?

321
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,490
This is between us friends.

322
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,940
Who are you to lecture me?

323
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,700
Matters between friends

324
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,980
are indeed not my place to comment on.

325
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,420
However, I believe

326
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,850
that in relationships,

327
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,450
sincerity is most valuable.

328
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,580
She prepared new clothes and new jewelry

329
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,670
just for today's gathering.

330
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,990
Even if you cannot repay this friendship

331
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,210
in kind, you shouldn't treat

332
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,700
sincere feelings like they're worthless.

333
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,940
Now I get it.

334
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,970
Just another one defending her.

335
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,340
One's a prince,

336
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,320
the other's a charlatan like you.

337
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,320
Song Yiting really is something.

338
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,650
There's no man she can't seduce.

339
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,660
Are you alright?

340
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,920
Who exactly are you?

341
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:26,010
Just a stranger who couldn't stand by
and watch injustice.

342
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,890
You...

343
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:27,730
Well done!

344
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,340
Beautifully done!

345
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,690
Good job!

346
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,060
Mister.

347
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,490
Would you like to come in for some tea

348
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,670
and rest for a while?

349
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,980
Why did you come anyway, Mr. Li?

350
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:06,940
Just passing by.

351
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,170
Out of the entire wide capital,

352
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,089
you just so happened to "pass by"
right here?

353
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,619
If you were just passing by,

354
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,900
why did you bother

355
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,900
getting involved and defending me?

356
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,569
After all, we've known each other
for some time,

357
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:21,290
so it's only right that I
defend you a bit.

358
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,900
Besides, it's really unfair of them

359
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,010
to say such things about you
behind your back.

360
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,410
I was talking about the Eighteenth Prince.

361
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,770
Those things the Eighteenth Prince said,

362
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,900
you taught him to say them, didn't you?

363
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,780
You clearly know me well,

364
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,460
yet you deliberately anger me

365
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,650
and push me away.

366
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,730
Why?

367
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,450
Knowing you and liking you

368
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,970
are two separate things.

369
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,350
You're the most special

370
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,100
and wonderful girl I've ever met.

371
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,570
Even if I don't have feelings for you,

372
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,060
you still deserve to be appreciated

373
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,050
and treated well.

374
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:57,940
You're lying.

375
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,280
You just said

376
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,460
that in relationships,

377
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,980
sincerity is most valuable.

378
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,980
Then, Li Shiliu,

379
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,530
please honestly tell me,

380
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,050
have you ever had feelings for me?

381
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,560
If even half a word is a lie,

382
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,660
may heaven strike you down.

383
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,380
I,

384
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,240
Li Shiliu,

385
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,700
have never had feelings for you.

386
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,790
Say it again.

387
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,900
No matter how many times I say it,
it won't change.

388
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,930
Li Shiliu

389
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,220
has never had feelings for you.

390
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,380
So you pushed me toward the
Eighteenth Prince,

391
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,180
taking advantage of when you discarded me

392
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,760
to let him approach me?

393
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,980
You've misjudged me.

394
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,150
I, Song Yiting, am not someone
who can't accept defeat.

395
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,380
I just felt that I hurt you,

396
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,940
and if there could be someone who
truly cared for you

397
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,700
by your side,

398
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,660
you might feel better.

399
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,140
Stop deceiving yourself.

400
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,950
You just wanted to make yourself
feel better.

401
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,090
In your eyes, I'm nothing more than

402
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,690
a piece of clothing

403
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,010
or a piece of jewelry.

404
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,350
But even if you don't like me,

405
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,010
what right do you have to push me
onto someone else?

406
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,770
I never thought of you that way.

407
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,980
Li Shiliu.

408
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,390
You love to lecture others,

409
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,990
but you're not worthy.

410
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,170
You teach others that

411
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,460
marriages are about mutual affection and

412
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,660
natural attraction,

413
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,490
but you yourself don't understand
what love is at all.

414
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,660
You tell others

415
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,940
not to disregard true feelings,

416
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,420
yet you have no heart at all.

417
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,730
I used to like you

418
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,370
because I thought you were different
from others.

419
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,530
But from now on,

420
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,750
I won't like you anymore,

421
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,570
because I despise you

422
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,950
even more than anyone else.

423
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,570
I'm sorry.

424
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,050
Don't bother.

425
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,480
Tomorrow at noon,

426
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,730
at Zijin Pavilion outside the city,

427
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,820
I'll return what you asked for.

428
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,630
Please kindly

429
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,060
bring back my paintings too, Mr. Li.

430
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,120
Don't soil my belongings.

431
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,630
She... He... He...

432
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,650
They...

433
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,370
They're a real couple?

434
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,740
What about me?

435
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,350
What am I to her?

436
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,810
Probably just a laughingstock
who copied Mr. Li's love lines

437
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,540
yet failed in your confession.

438
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,490
Nonsense!

439
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,770
It must be that Li Shiliu.

440
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,440
He... He must have deliberately
played me,

441
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,850
making me look foolish in front of Yiting

442
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,580
and paving the way for himself.

443
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,570
I'm the auspicious sign of the Great Jing.

444
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,500
How could I be treated so unjustly?

445
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,270
Just you wait.

446
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,780
I must prove to Yiting

447
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,500
that Li Shiliu,

448
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,760
he... He's not such a good person either.

449
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:46,980
Either?

450
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,140
Did I say "either"?

451
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,060
[Gentle Breeze]

452
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,520
Father?

453
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,280
[Song Residence]

454
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,510
Madam...

455
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,400
You'd better explain to me

456
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,180
what this is about.

457
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,150
Whose portrait is this?

458
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,830
What do you mean by that?

459
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,670
What happened to Song Yiting?

460
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,370
Yimeng,

461
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,750
there are some matters

462
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,620
I shouldn't have troubled you with,

463
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,570
but I don't know what's gotten
into Yiting lately.

464
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,380
Maybe it's because she's fallen
for someone,

465
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,460
she wouldn't listen to her mother

466
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,660
about marrying the Eighteenth Prince,

467
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,590
and the whole family is in chaos
because of this.

468
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,620
Oh no.

469
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,700
She's already fallen in love with him.

470
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,730
Father, don't worry.

471
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,240
I'll see this matter

472
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,900
through to the end.

473
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,140
Chief.

474
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,630
Miss Song is here.

475
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,160
What brings you here today?

476
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:25,960
Mr. Li.

477
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,980
You really need to help me this time.

478
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,450
Please.

479
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,450
Spit it out!

480
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,670
Who exactly is that man?

481
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:37,860
I...

482
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,750
I really don't know.

483
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,560
Fine.

484
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,400
If she refuses to talk,

485
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,460
I won't keep

486
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,810
this wretched life of hers!

487
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:47,620
Beat her!

488
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,980
Stop beating her!

489
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,320
Stop it!

490
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,390
My Lady.

491
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,310
Stop this at once!

492
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,330
Mother!

493
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,490
What are you doing?

494
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,960
You're asking me?

495
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,440
I should be asking you what you're doing!

496
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,900
I heard from the doorman

497
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,010
that you've been calling for carriages
every day

498
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,080
just to meet a man in secret!

499
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,250
Did I raise you

500
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,860
just so you could degrade yourself

501
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,750
by associating with some scum?

502
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,330
My relationship with him is proper
and respectful.

503
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,380
And he's not some scum you make
him out to be!

504
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,780
Proper relationship?

505
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,140
How dare you say

506
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,860
something so improper!

507
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,640
Are you trying to anger me to death?

508
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
So what do you call proper behavior?

509
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,090
Dressing myself up

510
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,530
to parade before sons of noble families,

511
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,620
is that proper behavior?

512
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,330
If it were the Eighteenth Prince today,

513
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,490
forget about secret meetings,

514
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,900
even if I had an improper affair with him,

515
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,570
you'd still thank our ancestors
for the blessing

516
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,170
and wish everyone in the capital
knew about it!

517
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,290
Are you trying to anger me to death?

518
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,420
You should know that

519
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,940
if this ever gets out,

520
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,120
your reputation

521
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,750
will be completely ruined!

522
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,560
Reputation is like a shackle,

523
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,630
which deserves to be discarded
like tattered shoes.

524
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,270
Shannai,

525
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,180
let's go.

526
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:08,980
Impossible.

527
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,220
That's impossible.

528
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,590
I know

529
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,980
it sounds ridiculous.

530
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:15,810
But last time

531
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,090
when I predicted the fire,

532
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,380
didn't it happen as I said?

533
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,640
Right now, Nan Heng is really
planning to kill Song Yiting.

534
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,290
Mr. Li.

535
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,610
I really need you to help me.

536
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,610
Otherwise, Yiting will be done for.

537
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,730
Everything needs evidence.

538
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,860
As far as I know,

539
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,210
between Nan Heng and Song Yiting,
there's absolutely no...

540
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,250
Anyway,

541
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,910
this must be a misunderstanding.

542
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,300
How could it be?

543
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,720
When it comes to romance,

544
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,060
do you think you know
more than I do?

545
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:47,700
I...

546
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,620
Mr. Li.

547
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,330
Let's not argue about this right now,

548
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:53,940
okay?

549
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,140
I can tell at a glance

550
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,160
if a man has ulterior motives

551
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,440
toward a woman.

552
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,860
For example, from the way Nan Heng
looks at Yiting,

553
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,280
it's obvious he's up to no good.

554
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,340
But the way you look at me

555
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,100
is merely friendly, Mr. Li.

556
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,180
You...

557
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,090
You...

558
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,290
What are you doing?

559
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,350
Do you believe that I like women now?

560
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,530
So,

561
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,730
you were

562
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,250
kissing me just now?

563
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,020
You still don't believe me?

564
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:49,700
♪ Look at the sky, flowers bloom
and fragrance fills the air ♪

565
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:57,770
♪ The sound of heartbeats
resonates in the passing time ♪

566
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:05,490
♪ Look at the way you're going,
destiny has it all planned out ♪

567
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:16,530
♪ We lead remarkable lives
in this mundane world ♪

568
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,730
Do you believe me now?

569
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,630
So, I don't want

570
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,270
to hear any more of that talk

571
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,530
about us being friends
from you anymore.

572
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,800
Didn't you say

573
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,350
you understand romance better than I do?

574
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,420
Then tell me,

575
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,620
what does this

576
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,140
make us?

577
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,730
Well...

578
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:41,780
I think...

579
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,510
What we have between us isn't friendship.

580
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,270
It's not friendship.

581
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,270
But who

582
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,350
kisses with a mask on?

583
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,770
Chief really went for it.

584
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,500
He actually kissed her.

585
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,300
Let's see if he dares to kiss her
without the mask.

586
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,700
What's wrong?

587
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,080
Drowning your sorrows alone?

588
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,900
Shanhu has filled me in

589
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,300
on what's been going on
these past few days.

590
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,380
What?

591
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,640
You want to blame me for
messing things up again?

592
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,250
Go ahead.

593
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,590
You fell in love?

594
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,410
Just days ago, I was teasing you

595
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,810
about how Song Yimeng had you
completely smitten.

596
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,360
Look how the tables have turned.

597
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,170
It's only been a few days,

598
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,460
and now you're the audience,

599
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,640
while I've become

600
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,460
the performer.

601
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,740
Your little drama

602
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,970
isn't worth my time and effort to watch.

603
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,620
But the question is,

604
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,010
if you like her,

605
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,390
why don't you go win her back?

606
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,650
Why sit here brooding?

607
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,380
And then what?

608
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,810
Live happily ever after with her?

609
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,090
Or one day when my identity is exposed,

610
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,400
I'll drag the entire Waning River Crescent

611
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,160
and her into this mess?

612
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,790
Don't overestimate yourself, okay?

613
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,610
As if my Waning River Crescent
needs your concern.

614
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,780
You're right.

615
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,300
I have no right to think so
highly of myself.

616
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,060
I haven't forgotten that

617
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,590
you and I

618
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,800
are also just part of a deal.

619
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,470
That's true.

620
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,590
Do you remember who I was three years ago?

621
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,910
Three years ago,

622
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,940
you were a famous hero in Jiangnan,
Shangguan Baihe,

623
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,880
known as Mr. Shangguan.

624
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,380
Within half a month,

625
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,710
you committed more than 10 major thefts.

626
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,100
I led 2,000 Xuanjia Army soldiers,

627
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,740
mobilizing forces from three provinces
and six cities,

628
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,400
yet still failed to catch you.

629
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,330
But later,

630
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,980
you were exposed because

631
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,700
a friend betrayed you.

632
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,090
Back then, I, Baihe, trusted
the wrong person

633
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,330
and fell into a trap,

634
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,230
with no way out.

635
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,470
In the end, I had no choice but to

636
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,950
break my wings to survive.

637
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,910
Are you blaming me,

638
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,090
for clipping your wings

639
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,380
and trapping you in this small
Waning River Crescent?

640
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:09,810
Yes.

641
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,210
I hate you, the mighty Seventh Prince,
to the core

642
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,770
for not letting me die.

643
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,120
[Three years ago]

644
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,400
The Ministry of Justice has issued
their verdict.

645
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,060
You've been sentenced to
immediate execution,

646
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
which will be carried out tomorrow.

647
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,800
It's been seven days.

648
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,790
You come every single day.

649
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,740
Could you give a dying man
one day of peace?

650
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,160
If I were you,

651
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:43,090
I'd try my best to find a way
out of here alive

652
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,180
to see what color blood runs in someone

653
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,340
who would betray their companion

654
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,030
for 2,000 taels of gold.

655
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,960
The person you speak of
who betrayed their companion

656
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,010
is both an enemy

657
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,200
and a friend to me.

658
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,720
Your enemy framed you,

659
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:04,920
betrayed you,

660
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,660
and kept all the riches for himself,

661
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,750
yet you still consider him a friend.

662
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,780
It seems you deserve your fate.

663
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,240
Someone like you,

664
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,450
born into privilege,

665
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,250
could never understand what kind of life

666
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,770
he and I lived before.

667
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,140
Wrapped in horsehide upon death,

668
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,940
licking blood from blade edges,

669
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,940
and entrusting your back to comrades.

670
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,140
This prince believes the past you speak of

671
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,930
wasn't much harder than this.

672
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,040
"This prince"?

673
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,620
Who are you?

674
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,010
Who I am doesn't matter.

675
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,550
What matters is

676
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,860
you're still alive.

677
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:45,660
As long as we're alive,

678
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,790
we should cherish every single day.

679
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,580
Friends gone? So be it.

680
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,660
Path blocked? Carve through mountains.

681
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,470
But if your life is gone,

682
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,270
that's truly the end.

683
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,450
Here's to shady friends.

684
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,910
Alright.

685
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,530
To disreputable companion.

686
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,600
Heart like wood and stone,

687
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,460
utterly cold and unfeeling.

688
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,860
You're not speaking from the heart.

689
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,820
However, I never expected

690
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,490
you'd be troubled by love.

691
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,430
Like master, like man.

692
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:35,960
When it comes to being troubled by love,

693
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,960
you, Chief, are the true expert.

694
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,110
I can't hold a candle to you on that.

695
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,910
But the point is,

696
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,420
I never pushed the person I love

697
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,880
into someone else's arms.

698
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:47,920
Besides,

699
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,120
the lady doesn't even like Nan Rui,

700
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,270
yet you think you're doing her a favor.

701
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,700
That blabbermouth Shanhu,

702
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,060
telling everything.

703
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,940
What does this have to do with Shanhu?

704
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,740
You have only yourself to blame.

705
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,380
You not only messed it up,

706
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,380
but you also broke the lady's heart.

707
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,890
I was a prisoner

708
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,940
who should have died long ago.

709
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,490
There's no way I could fall in love with
a lady from a noble family.

710
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,560
Chief,

711
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,980
don't you understand?

712
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,960
It doesn't matter whether I understand.

713
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,210
What matters is,

714
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,920
does Song Yiting understand?

715
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,630
Whether she understands or not
doesn't matter,

716
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,810
because the person she likes
isn't the real me.

717
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,110
Then tell her

718
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,460
what you're really like beneath the mask.

719
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,750
So, if Song Yimeng knew

720
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,380
what you're really like beneath that mask,

721
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,440
how would she feel?

722
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,070
I...

723
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,010
See?

724
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,380
This Li Shiliu's outfit

725
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,170
has really caused quite a bit of trouble.

726
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,130
All the frustration in your heart

727
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,040
stems from Song Yiting.

728
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,199
Why not just ask her out

729
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,540
and tell her

730
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,170
everything that's on your mind?

731
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:11,940
This way,

732
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,409
you won't have any regrets in the future.

733
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,389
What if I don't want to go?

734
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,550
If you don't go,

735
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,949
then the crane in your heart

736
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,790
will remain trapped in your mental prison,

737
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,389
and you'll be left with nothing
but your title.

738
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,460
Tomorrow at noon,

739
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,130
let me borrow

740
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,449
Li Shiliu's outfit one more time.

741
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,920
That's more like it.

742
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:54,860
Here.

743
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,480
Tomorrow,

744
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,670
bring both the Qianyu Moon-Cleaving Blade

745
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,170
and yourself with your heart intact

746
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,650
back to me.

747
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,640
Understand?

748
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,090
Come on.

749
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,590
Success awaits you.

750
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,600
[Xiyue Pavilion]

751
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,690
My Lady.

752
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,090
I'm sorry.

753
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,250
It's all my fault for being careless

754
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,020
and letting Madam find out.

755
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,610
It doesn't matter anymore.

756
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:26,410
He wouldn't be with me anyway.

757
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,440
He'd rather push me to someone else

758
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,490
than admit he has feelings for me.

759
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,300
In his eyes,

760
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,830
I'm nothing.

761
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,740
If you see it so clearly,

762
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,770
why do you still have to love him?

763
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,410
I know exactly what I'm doing.

764
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,490
I don't need others preaching to me.

765
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,980
If you're here as our parents' messenger,

766
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,900
please leave.

767
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,460
Song Yiting,

768
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,050
you've always been so strong-willed.

769
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,380
Why would you fall for someone like him?

770
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,340
Don't you know what kind of person he is?

771
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,460
Deep and calculating,

772
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,770
and secretive in his actions.

773
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,780
Do you know how many dirty secrets

774
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,650
he's hiding?

775
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,490
Yes, he's deep and calculating,

776
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,940
and secretive in his actions,

777
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,380
but if he hadn't experienced

778
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,740
all the hardships of life in his
early years

779
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,900
and struggled to survive,

780
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,230
why would he be this way?

781
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,300
Fine.

782
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,070
You can ignore all that,

783
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,130
but do you know he's approaching you

784
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,630
with ulterior motives?

785
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,460
Of course I know.

786
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,210
If it weren't for what he wants,

787
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,470
he wouldn't agree to meet me.

788
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,630
You know all this

789
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,860
and still let him take advantage of you?

790
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,980
A blade in hand

791
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,170
can either kill

792
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,570
or save the world.

793
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,540
I trust my judgment.

794
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,210
I won't be wrong about him.

795
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,420
What're you talking about,
saving the world?

796
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,040
Don't be fooled by his twisted logic

797
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,050
and false words.

798
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,390
Beneath his mask,

799
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,500
he's nothing but a complete villain.

800
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,070
But who's not wearing a mask
in this world?

801
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,070
In the capital,

802
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,570
who's not scheming

803
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,260
and chasing fame and fortune?

804
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,420
And who

805
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,620
would ever show

806
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,140
their true self to others?

807
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:08,820
It's actually him

808
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,260
who lives freely and authentically,

809
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,630
without restraint.

810
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,550
I really can't get through to you.

811
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,060
Please, I'm begging you,

812
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,930
alright?

813
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,690
Don't get involved with him.

814
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,170
In this world,

815
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,170
you can fall for anyone,

816
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,750
anyone but him.

817
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,820
Why not him?

818
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,850
Just because he's not
the Eighteenth Prince,

819
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,580
he doesn't deserve to be loved?

820
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,630
That's not what I meant.

821
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,460
Then why are you trying to dissuade me?

822
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,800
And what gives you the right

823
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,130
to interfere in my life?

824
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,370
Song Yiting.

825
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,320
I really don't know

826
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,050
how to explain this to you.

827
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,980
But please believe me,

828
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,770
being with him

829
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,520
will really put you in danger.

830
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,950
I'm going to bed.

831
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:02,970
You should leave.

832
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,170
Song Yiting!

833
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,460
You'll die!

834
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:12,980
Guihong!

835
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,740
Guihong!

836
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,930
Guihong.

837
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:17,790
Guihong.

838
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,300
Something terrible has happened.

839
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,490
It's a disaster!

840
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,690
Your Highness, please calm down.

841
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:22,090
Take your time and tell me slowly.

842
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:22,780
Listen,

843
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:23,980
yesterday, I saw

844
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,130
Yiting and Li Shiliu

845
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,090
together,

846
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,010
and they seemed quite close.

847
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:28,820
So I immediately

848
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,090
had someone investigate

849
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,610
this mysterious Li Shiliu.

850
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,260
I've already investigated him.

851
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:33,980
His background is clean,

852
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,980
with nothing suspicious.

853
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,420
Yes,

854
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,940
that's what I just found out.

855
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,050
But I wasn't convinced,

856
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,050
so I looked into the people around him,

857
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,310
and guess what I found?

858
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,380
He...

859
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:46,900
Come here.

860
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:47,650
Listen,

861
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,790
there's someone called Shangguan He
with him,

862
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,820
who's a death-row prisoner that
escaped from prison!

863
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,030
Search thoroughly!

864
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:13,740
Yes!

865
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:14,960
Search!

866
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,690
Yes!

867
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,220
Who dares!

868
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,530
General Chu, you're certainly

869
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,130
in a fiery mood this morning.

870
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,370
Bringing the Qianyu Army here with you,

871
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,060
what are you planning to do?

872
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,260
I'm not here to trouble you today,

873
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,530
but for him.

874
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,020
May I ask, Mr. Chu,

875
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,900
what business do you have with me?

876
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,310
Three years ago,

877
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,680
in Jiangnan Province,

878
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,230
Mr. Shangguan

879
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,980
was accused of a serious crime

880
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,640
and faked his death to escape.

881
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,810
Do I need to say more?

882
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,020
Rong Hua.

883
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,420
Wait!

884
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:22,170
Though we at Waning River Crescent are
just nobodies from the martial arts world,

885
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,010
you can't just take someone away

886
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,260
with a few words.

887
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,380
Li Shiliu.

888
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,530
I'm here on official business on behalf of
the capital prefecture's office.

889
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,050
How dare you obstruct me?

890
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,780
So what if it's the
capital prefecture's office?

891
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,770
Unless I give the word,

892
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,010
you're not taking anyone away.

893
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,300
What if I insist on taking him away?

894
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,490
You're welcome to try.

895
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,620
