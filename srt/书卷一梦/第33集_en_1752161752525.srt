00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,460
Episode 15

3
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,420
Who says I like you?

4
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,840
Tell me!

5
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,280
Why are you so thermal?

6
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,760
Why did you buy these things?

7
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,600
And why this dress?

8
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,040
I just need it for tonight.

9
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,060
I'm so sick.

10
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,920
Brush it.

11
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,280
It's just smaller.

12
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,140
Isn't it ok?

13
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,860
If it weren't for this.

14
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,180
Be my guest.

15
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,980
Icycle?

16
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,020
You can give me one night.

17
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,040
I'll find one for you.

18
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,180
Are you happy?

19
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,900
Of course.

20
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:29,980
What would I be happy about?

21
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,340
Where did this problem come from?

22
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,480
How could it be still in thetsand?

23
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,240
Is the wound spreading tiredness again?

24
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:57,980
hacia

25
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:58,900
What...

26
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,880
steering wheel...

27
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,120
I...

28
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,720
You're awake.

29
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,120
You're awake.

30
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,960
Let me see it.

31
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Why are you so dumb?

32
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,740
Go on.

33
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,260
Keep going.

34
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,220
What?

35
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,320
I will intimidate you.

36
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:12,940
Do as you like.

37
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,640
It's my turn now.

38
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,440
I won't sit here.

39
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,880
I'm going to intimidate you, Your Highness.

40
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,860
You're infuriating me.

41
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,340
You let me go.

42
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,060
Don't press on your wound.

43
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,400
You're finally awake.

44
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,160
You...

45
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,160
Did you wake up early?

46
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,400
You woke up early. How come you didn't tell me?

47
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,640
Everyone started worrying about you for the whole night.

48
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,760
I even didn't dare to close my eyes for the whole night.

49
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,040
I was worried about what would happen to you. Do you know?

50
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,960
You escaped, but you didn't tell me you woke up.

51
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,980
Why didn't you tell me?

52
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,700
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,580
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,380
I said I could hurt you.

55
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,580
You really scared me to death.

56
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,180
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,980
Is it really that important to say sorry?

58
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,180
I'm sorry is all that matters.

59
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,780
Okay.

60
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,980
I've made you worry.

61
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,980
No, no.

62
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,380
If you dare to lie to me again,

63
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,380
I'll bite you to death.

64
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,780
Okay, I won't do it again.

65
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,780
You really scared me to death.

66
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,780
Could it be that they

67
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,980
were just now...

68
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,980
The flower petals in the cave are bright and bright.

69
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,180
I'm just blaming myself.

70
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,380
Look, even though the marriage

71
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,380
has caused an assassination,

72
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,980
nothing has been delayed.

73
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,380
It's still the Prince.

74
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,380
He's injured and still has such experience.

75
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,580
Fugui, in the next year,

76
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,180
we have to work hard.

77
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,780
We have to earn more money,

78
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,380
but we have to save money.

79
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,180
What are we going to do?

80
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,780
I think

81
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,980
we should give the Royal Descendant

82
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,380
a full moon gift next year.

83
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,780
Royal Descendant?

84
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,380
His Highness is too fast.

85
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,780
He's now fully enlightened.

86
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,380
The old iron tree is blooming.

87
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,380
Father.

88
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,780
My good son!

89
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,780
You're finally awake!

90
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,580
Father.

91
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,780
Son.

92
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,780
Father.

93
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,380
Son, you're strong.

94
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,780
Help me cut the firewood.

95
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,380
Your Highness, you're finally able to get up.

96
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,180
You've been pushing me for the past two days.

97
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,580
You're so annoying.

98
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,580
No, you...

99
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,380
Slowly, slowly. Be careful.

100
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,980
It's fine.

101
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,780
I can't even lift my arm.

102
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,780
How am I supposed to eat?

103
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,380
That's right.

104
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,980
How am I supposed to eat?

105
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,780
Fugui,

106
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,180
feed His Highness.

107
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,980
Jing'er, no, no, no.

108
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,580
That...

109
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,180
He's so clumsy.

110
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,780
Your Highness, do you want me to feed you?

111
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,980
That's not necessary.

112
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,780
But if it's possible,

113
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,780
it's not impossible.

114
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,380
Okay.

115
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,380
I'll feed you.

116
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,180
Thank you.

117
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,380
Here, open your mouth.

118
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,980
Wait a minute.

119
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,980
It's too hot.

120
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,780
You want me to blow on it for you?

121
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,580
You want me to blow on it for you?

122
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,380
You're a 1.9 meter tall man.

123
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,980
You're playing with me.

124
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,380
No, just blow on it.

125
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,380
It's a big deal. I'll do it.

126
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,780
Can I still eat it after you blow on it?

127
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,980
It's hot.

128
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,380
It's not hot for you to blow on.

129
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,780
Okay, okay.

130
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,380
I'll blow on it.

131
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,380
I'll blow on it for you.

132
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,380
Is it okay?

133
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,380
Wait a minute.

134
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,780
Get out first.

135
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,780
You guys eat yours.

136
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,780
No, I want to eat pickles.

137
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,780
Go buy some pickles.

138
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,180
So many pickles.

139
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,980
You want to buy more?

140
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,980
I want to eat the food from the city's south,

141
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,780
Xu Gong's pickles.

142
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,780
You haven't eaten it before.

143
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,180
Let him buy it for you.

144
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,380
The city's south is too far.

145
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,380
I'll let Lao Rong ride a horse.

146
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,980
You go, don't let others go.

147
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,380
No, Your Highness.

148
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,780
I haven't seen you for so long.

149
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,980
There are a few times to see you.

150
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,180
You're just one morning away.

151
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,980
Go.

152
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,580
Go.

153
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,180
Come on, Your Highness.

154
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,780
Now, we can drink porridge.

155
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,180
Pretend to be drunk.

156
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,780
Slow down.

157
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,780
Chief.

158
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,980
This is the income of this month's Tan Jiang month.

159
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,780
Please have a look.

160
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,380
I'll go get Song Yi Meng.

161
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,780
Song Yi Meng.

162
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,980
He just got married and he wants us to help you work?

163
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,180
After getting married,

164
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,580
you don't go to the honeymoon?

165
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,580
What is a honeymoon?

166
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,980
It's just going out to play.

167
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,980
There's a place to play.

168
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,780
Play?

169
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,780
There are plenty of opportunities to play.

170
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,980
But you're the Crown Princess and the Crown Prince's wife.

171
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,980
You have your duties.

172
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,180
You didn't tell me before I got the job.

173
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,580
I wouldn't have gotten the job.

174
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,380
My wound suddenly hurts.

175
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,380
I'll read it.

176
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,980
I can read it.

177
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,180
Just a few words.

178
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,180
Zhuo Jiang Shui Zhi...

179
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,180
Right to left, up to down.

180
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,980
Do you know it?

181
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,980
I know.

182
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,380
Zhichu Shui Xiang Yang.

183
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,380
Shui Xiang...

184
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,980
Shui Xiang Yang.

185
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,980
Ma Hao, what's this word?

186
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,580
Hu.

187
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,580
Shui Xiang Yang Hu.

188
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,380
Shui Xiang Yang Hu.

189
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,980
Jiang Tun Zhong...

190
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,180
Jiang Tun Chu... Chuai...

191
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,380
Chuai Chuai... Chuai Chuai Bun Bun.

192
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,380
Twenty taels of daily food.

193
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,380
Jiang Mian Qing...

194
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,380
This word...

195
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,180
Your Highness, I can't do this job.

196
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,440
When I was in school, I didn't do well in the

197
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,180
book of torture.

198
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,180
Why did you make me read it?

199
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,180
I'm dizzy.

200
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,180
I can't read the words.

201
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,180
So you have to read it.

202
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,180
Why didn't you let him read it?

203
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,180
Don't point at me.

204
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,180
You need to be careful.

205
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,180
Why am I dizzy?

206
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,180
Because I'm hurt.

207
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,180
Why am I hurt?

208
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,180
You don't want to reason with me?

209
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,180
The script made you help me.

210
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,180
Why do you blame me?

211
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,180
Besides, if I hadn't

212
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,180
asked Zhao Bo to point at you that night,

213
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,180
you would have died.

214
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,180
Do you know?

215
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,180
Yes.

216
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,180
What about the next morning?

217
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,180
You were the one who took the initiative.

218
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,180
You suddenly...

219
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,180
Read it.

220
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,180
I can read it.

221
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,180
No, let him finish.

222
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,180
What did you do?

223
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,180
Nothing.

224
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,180
What did I do? Does it have anything to do with you?

225
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,180
How about you go out?

226
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,180
I'll teach him.

227
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,180
I need to be serious.

228
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,180
Do you know that the axe gang is here to make trouble again?

229
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,180
It's just an axe gang.

230
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,540
As the second master of the

231
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,180
Cangjiang Yue, do I have to do this?

232
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,180
Go out. You handle it.

233
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,180
Go out. You handle it.

234
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,180
I should be there.

235
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,180
You act like he scooped a pig last night.

236
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,180
Ange, did you forget

237
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,180
since we first met each other?

238
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,180
再見.

239
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,180
question mark

240
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,180
Use it as your way to highlight hits.

241
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,180
There's no April Fool't samoranslations,

242
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,180
let's let the walls out.

243
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:20,180
Then we'll go call the professor.

244
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:24,580
Hey, you're not coming out either?

245
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,580
Sit down, let's drink together.

246
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,260
It seems that Your Highness has really changed your mind.

247
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,100
Is that really a change of heart?

248
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,020
That's not a heart.

249
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,020
He gave his heart to Song Yi Meng.

250
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,700
What about us?

251
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,980
Since he got married, he has always been in love with you.

252
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,980
He has no one else in his heart.

253
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,380
I wanted to help you.

254
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,380
But in the end, I ended up with you.

255
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,140
But to be honest,

256
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,220
you haven't been easy these years.

257
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,140
Look at you, you're not smart.

258
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,820
You like to pretend to be a man.

259
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,980
But your loyalty is really rare.

260
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,540
You're not bad either.

261
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,140
If it weren't for you,

262
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,380
His Highness wouldn't have gone up the mountain

263
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,220
and become the current Crown Prince.

264
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,780
That's because of me.

265
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,980
I did all that because you forced me to.

266
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,420
I just want to lie flat.

267
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,180
If I had known that we would be in the same boat today,

268
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,500
why would I have been so hard on you?

269
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,980
Are you serious?

270
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,620
What else?

271
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,140
Brother Shangguan, let me toast to you.

272
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,940
I was just a little chicken before.

273
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,940
I admit that you're capable.

274
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,340
Brother Fugui, you're too kind.

275
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,060
There aren't many people who are as honest as you.

276
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,820
But you're worth my praise.

277
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,100
Let me toast to you.

278
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,300
What can I do to make you think that I'm rich?

279
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,660
You can make Shangguan Xiong, the best of the world,

280
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,500
become my friend.

281
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,740
I'm a man of the grass.

282
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,860
I never thought that I could drink with the vice general of the Black Armor Army.

283
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,420
Let's toast.

284
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,740
Let's toast.

285
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,740
We're friends who share the same fate.

286
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,980
Why don't we do a toast?

287
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,460
A toast?

288
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,860
Okay.

289
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,460
A toast to the brothers who have been through hardships.

290
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,020
Let me see.

291
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,100
Let's toast.

292
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,620
From now on, we'll call each other brothers.

293
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,940
Cheers.

294
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,700
I swear that from now on,

295
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,700
your friend is my friend.

296
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,020
And your enemy is Shangguan Baihe's enemy.

297
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,820
I swear that from now on,

298
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,460
I'll be with Brother Shangguan to end the case

299
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,020
and protect His Highness with my life.

300
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,460
Why didn't you say anything?

301
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,940
I don't know why I wanted to end the love.

302
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,140
You said it.

303
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,260
Look at His Highness.

304
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,620
Since he got married, he's been cold to us.

305
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,660
So we can't be friends who are close to each other.

306
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,460
No, you can be friends who are not close to each other.

307
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:26,460
But don't you think that ending love is a little extreme?

308
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,180
What does Brother Shangguan mean?

309
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,620
Does he already have a lover?

310
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,900
No.

311
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,900
No?

312
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,860
Is he the second daughter of Song's family?

313
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,060
No.

314
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,020
I knew it.

315
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,900
When A'Long and A'Hu saw him,

316
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,700
they called him second sister-in-law.

317
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,220
So you and him are already in love, right?

318
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,420
No.

319
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,420
Okay.

320
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,260
Your Highness, you two are great.

321
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,380
Have you considered my feelings?

322
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,540
Okay.

323
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,180
I'll get married in a few days.

324
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,220
You can't be with Song.

325
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,780
It's not enough.

326
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,180
You drink it yourself.

327
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,980
Love is like a magic circle.

328
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,180
I miss you so much that I want to turn the night upside down.

329
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,340
But I'm afraid that love will only last for a moment.

330
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,580
You're done?

331
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,020
Father.

332
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,580
I have a lot of questions for you today.

333
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,100
Go ahead.

334
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,940
Why did a lot of my friends see you die in the battle of Pingrong?

335
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,340
But you're alive.

336
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,980
Why didn't you come back to me when you were alive?

337
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,100
Do you know that Rong Hua and all my brothers

338
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,020
are waiting for you?

339
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,020
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,980
I didn't mean to hurt you.

341
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,940
Oh.

342
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,220
I know you'll ask me these questions sooner or later.

343
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,740
But first, you have to be in my role.

344
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,740
And experience my difficulties.

345
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,060
Father.

346
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,180
What do you mean?

347
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,580
Who am I?

348
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,220
God of War.

349
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,740
I've been in the battlefield for decades.

350
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,540
I've never lost.

351
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,940
Everyone has high expectations of me.

352
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,700
But I've become a miserable person.

353
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,100
When I woke up,

354
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,340
I really hope I'm dead,

355
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,860
not living in this world.

356
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,940
You can understand my feelings.

357
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,580
I understand you.

358
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,900
But the battle is also the heart of all Qianyu brothers.

359
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,540
No matter what,

360
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,540
you shouldn't ignore the Qianyu army in the capital.

361
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,980
Do you know what kind of fire we're in?

362
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,460
Of course I know.

363
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,860
In fact...

364
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,900
I've been struggling for thousands of times.

365
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,700
But Hong.

366
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,580
A young general under the influence of the King of Qianyu

367
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,860
can never be the real top.

368
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,980
Only when I leave,

369
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,740
you can grow up completely.

370
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,580
Well.

371
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,460
Aren't you doing pretty well now?

372
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,340
I'm so proud of you.

373
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,900
Do you really think so?

374
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,060
Yes.

375
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,140
You really...

376
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,260
You think I'm proud?

377
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,580
I'm the most proud person

378
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,260
since I created you.

379
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,020
After more than 20 years,

380
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,260
you've never been so sure of me.

381
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,820
It's different now.

382
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,780
If it weren't for you,

383
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,980
I don't know if I would come this time.

384
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,980
In the future, you and I will work together

385
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,380
to take Nan Heng away

386
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,180
and bring him back.

387
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,180
I'm not going to let you go.

388
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,180
I'm not going to let you go.

389
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,180
I'm not going to let you go.

390
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,980
Game怎樣?

391
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,740
It's really the end.

392
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,840
Brother San핑 told opening of mercy

393
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,260
to kill all of our friends.

394
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:32,980
Okay.

395
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,380
We'll utiliz occurring shots on the Macau degree now.

396
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,980
Yes.

397
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,620
Where should I stand?

398
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,620
I'm standing right here.

399
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,620
I'm so stupid.

400
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,420
How much did I calculate just now?

401
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,460
It's all your fault.

402
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,900
I calculated it well just now.

403
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,500
But when you talked to me, I was all confused.

404
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,580
Why are you blaming me?

405
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,420
I told you.

406
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,700
I don't like to read ancient books.

407
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,980
I also hate math.

408
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,620
You...

409
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,860
You forced me to

410
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,340
do these stupid books.

411
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,820
That's it?

412
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,980
I thought

413
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,180
I could stay with you longer.

414
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,700
Besides,

415
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,140
you're the Crown Princess now.

416
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,180
You'll be the Queen in the future.

417
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,180
You'll be the mother of the country.

418
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,780
I want you

419
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,660
to know more about our world.

420
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,660
It's not a bad thing.

421
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,340
I quit.

422
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,300
I won't be the Crown Princess anymore.

423
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,300
You can just be a high-ranking official.

424
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,140
What do you mean by that?

425
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,700
I'm so angry at you.

426
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,020
My wound is starting to hurt.

427
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,780
Boss.

428
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,300
Don't you care about me?

429
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,780
You keep躲ing.

430
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,780
Just going at it.

431
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,260
I have no choice.

432
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,240
Fine,

433
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,320
forget it then.

434
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,060
Let's talk in future.

435
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,660
Really.

436
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,340
Great.

437
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,180
Thank you, Your Highness.

438
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,460
I can go to sleep now.

439
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,460
Come back.

440
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,860
You really don't care about me?

441
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,580
I'm a patient now.

442
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,780
I really can't move.

443
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,340
Help me.

444
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,140
You're the only one who can pretend to be a patient.

445
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,100
You didn't fix the quilt.

446
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,500
Fix it for me.

447
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,740
The pillow doesn't feel good.

448
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,060
Help me adjust it.

449
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,940
I think you

450
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,020
think I used to bully you.

451
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,860
So you're trying to take revenge on me.

452
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,980
Can you stop pretending to be a girl

453
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,420
when you're with me?

454
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,660
So I can feel more real.

455
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,660
What do you mean?

456
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,140
I mean

457
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,140
we can experience the real life.

458
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,140
Look.

459
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,060
I always feel

460
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,460
the mechanism of the scene

461
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,900
has been broken.

462
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,780
The heroine in the play

463
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,580
has lived happily ever after.

464
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,020
I feel something is not real.

465
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,260
I'm the one

466
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,620
who should be the one to be rewarded.

467
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,460
If I didn't provide the information,

468
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,900
you're a cheater.

469
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,500
What do you think?

470
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,540
Okay.

471
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,740
I'm a cheater.

472
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,700
But

473
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,340
have you ever thought of one thing?

474
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,100
Maybe you're a cheater too.

475
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,460
Maybe the world you live in

476
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,900
is not real.

477
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,660
It's also a world

478
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,260
set in a picture book.

479
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,500
It makes sense.

480
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,460
Maybe

481
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,540
the modern world

482
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,380
is also a picture book.

483
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,460
Or maybe

484
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,660
the game world

485
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,220
is a dream world.

486
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,940
And the whole time

487
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,380
is a huge

488
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,660
Russian toy.

489
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,700
Do you understand?

490
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,460
No.

491
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,700
But it should be the dream

492
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,700
or the food

493
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,140
we talked about.

494
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,180
Yes.

495
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,460
Anyway, no matter where you are,

496
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,980
don't bother me.

497
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,740
Don't bother you?

498
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,340
I mean,

499
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,700
don't let me work.

500
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,980
Don't drive me away.

501
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,060
I don't have any pursuit.

502
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,220
My only life condition is

503
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,380
that life is in silence.

504
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,860
I can lie down

505
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,140
and never sit down.

506
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,100
I see.

507
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,340
Are you blaming me for making you learn things?

508
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,660
I'm thinking

509
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,380
to let you

510
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,660
get into my world sooner.

511
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,780
Why should I get into your world?

512
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,900
You can't get into mine.

513
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,300
I can get into yours.

514
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,340
But the premise is

515
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,540
you have to be as patient as I am

516
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,420
and teach me.

517
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,060
That's what you said.

518
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,540
Come on.

519
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,740
Get up.

520
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,020
Now?

521
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,940
Now?

522
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,460
What's this?

523
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,900
It's like

524
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,140
the short-cut technique.

525
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,620
You're good.

526
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,860
You're quite good

527
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,380
at math.

528
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,380
Last time,

529
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,580
I taught you chemistry.

530
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,540
Today, I'll teach you math.

531
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,700
Watch carefully.

532
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,060
This is the equation of math.

533
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,340
Read these Arabic numbers

534
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,540
with me.

535
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,140
Four.

536
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,100
Four.

537
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,340
This is 35.

538
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,340
35.

539
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,660
This is two.

540
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:44,980
Two.

541
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,020
94.

542
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,860
This symbol

543
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,940
represents...

544
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,700
12.

545
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,060
How did you know?

546
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,620
The same as the rabbit.

547
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,140
There are 35 heads on top

548
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,580
and 94 on the bottom.

549
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,140
The answer is

550
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,700
23, rabbit.

551
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,700
12.

552
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,460
The same as the rabbit.

553
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,020
How can you play like this?

554
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,620
Let me tell you what I'm thinking.

555
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,660
Okay, no.

556
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,620
Don't listen to me.

557
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,620
Listen to me.

558
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,860
I'm not good at math.

559
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,180
I'm good at English.

560
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,820
I'm good at English.

561
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,220
I don't believe it.

562
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,180
You can also do English.

563
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,100
English?

564
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,980
Is it the one you said last time?

565
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,860
Abanda.

566
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,580
Oh my god.

567

What does this mean?

573
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,580
This symbol

574
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,980

Who told you that?

610

752
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,580
Why didn't I find it before

753
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,580

754
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,580

00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,580
I don't know

762
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,580
I don't know

763
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,580
I don't know

764
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,580
The man's mansion

765
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,580
Isn't this the word used by the crown princess?

766
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,580
Your Highness

767
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,580
What is the man's mansion

768
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,580
You tell me

769
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,580
Your Highness

770
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,580
Your Highness

771
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,580
Hurry up

772
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,580
Hurry up

773
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,580
You're rich

774
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,580
You're rich

775
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,580
You're rich

776
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,580
Really

777
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,580
Master Chu

778
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,580
Master Chu

779
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,580
Master Chu

780
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,580
Master Chu

781
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,580
You are a god

782
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,580
Yes

783
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,580
How do you know behind the West Mountain

784
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,580
There is a human body field behind the West Mountain

785
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,580
It's all a thousand years old

786
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,580
Master Chu

787
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,580
I'll give you a tonic

788
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,580
But it's weird

789
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,580
I live here

790
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,580
I've never heard of it

791
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,580
The water soil here

792
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,580
Can grow human bodies

793
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,580
This is called the heaven's opportunity

794
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,580
Can't be leaked

795
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,580
Sometimes

796
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,580
God will let you meet a predestined person

797
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,580
Help you

798
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,580
Help you

799
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,580
Help you see the sun

800
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,580
Master Chu, thank you

801
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,580
Go

802
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,580
Your Majesty

803
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,580
Today, I gave my second daughter a lot of rewards

804
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,580
I thank you, Your Majesty

805
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,580
Are you satisfied with the thing?

806
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,580
Satisfied

807
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,580
What your Majesty gave must be the best

808
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,580
Just

809
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,580
I think there is a big feast in the reward

810
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,580
Now the old wife is married

811
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,580
It's time to consider

812
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,580
Rui'er's marriage

813
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,580
My body is not as good as before

814
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,580
Before I close my eyes

815
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:09,580
I always hope that both princes can get married

816
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,580
Your Majesty means

817
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:20,580
Want to give Ting and the eighteenth prince a marriage

818
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:24,580
Don't you always like to drink a bowl of water?

819
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,580
Now the eldest daughter is the crown princess

820
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,580
The wife in the family is always making trouble with you

821
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,580
I want to say

822
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,580
Why don't you let your two daughters get married in the palace?

823
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,580
We are close

824
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,580
Your Majesty, don't always make me happy

825
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,580
Besides, Ting is far away from Xiaomeng

826
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,580
I, the second daughter

827
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,580
Bad temper, short temper, and big idea

828
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,580
This this this she doesn't

829
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,580
She doesn't

830
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,580
I think it's pretty good

831
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,580
With the Lord of the Star Valley

832
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,580
Just to support Rui'er

833
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,580
Change this bad boy's unhappy happiness

834
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:11,580
No, Ting doesn't mean that to the eighteenth prince

835
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,580
I know she has someone she likes

836
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,580
Then His Majesty still sends the pinyin

837
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,580
Rui'er has that kind of interest in your second daughter

838
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,580
I see her

839
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,580
That's not what I like

840
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,580
No, I don't know

841
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,580
No, this this this

842
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,580
She can't marry the eighteenth prince if she likes him

843
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,580
She has to ask if she agrees

844
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,580
I have two daughters

845
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,580
Can't marry all of your families

846
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,580
Shouldn't it be like this?

847
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,580
Aren't you forcing it?

848
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,580
You are the prime minister

849
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,580
Shouldn't you share my worries?

850
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,580
And why are you staring at me?

851
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,580
And talk so loudly

852
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,580
You want to offend Tian Ze

853
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,580
I dare not

854
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,580
I'm wrong

855
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,580
You're scared to death

856
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,580
No regret

857
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,580
I won

858
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,580
Stinky

859
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,580
It tastes really good

860
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,580
Father

861
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,580
You are not going to give me a reasonable explanation

862
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,580
Yesterday you said you didn't want to go back to the capital after you woke up

863
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,580
I understand

864
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,580
But how can you be a god in this village

865
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,580
Mixing up by making a fool of yourself

866
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,580
Young people should be cautious

867
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,580
Don't be so impulsive

868
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,580
I ask you

869
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:53,580
Are the villagers digging people's bodies from the ground?

870
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,580
Is this body originally dug by the gods?

871
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,580
Is this body originally growing in the ground?

872
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,580
It's called lying to have no friends

873
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,580
Now I am a real

874
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,580
Helping the villagers to make a fortune

875
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,580
But how do you know there are people in the ground?

876
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,580
This is called

877
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,580
White hair and good

878
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,580
The quality is calculated

879
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,580
Loss of virtue

880
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,580
It's like a god

881
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,580
If you can really predict things like a god

882
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,580
How can we lose the battle of Pinyong?

883
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,580
I said

884
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,580
Don't always fight in the battle of Pinyong

885
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,580
It's been so long

886
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,580
You should put it down

887
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,580
Put down

888
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,580
Father, you have changed

889
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,580
In the past, you could not

890
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,580
Let go of the lives of 20,000 Qianyu brothers

891
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,580
I don't believe in these weird gods

892
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,580
Son

893
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,580
Have you ever heard

894
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,580
When people are dying

895
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,580
Will awaken some talents

896
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,580
For example, I

897
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,580
I awakened the ability of the immortal

898
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,580
If it wasn't for saving you

899
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,580
How can I come here in advance

900
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,580
Make good relations with the villagers

901
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:13,580
Help you resolve the crisis of the escape

902
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,580
Father knew it a long time ago

903
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,580
I have to go to the village

904
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,580
I have to go to the village

905
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,580
Father knew it a long time ago

906
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,580
I will escape to death

907
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,580
Correct

908
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,580
Not only that, I also know

909
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,580
You were married off by the Song family

910
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,580
Song Yimeng fell in love with Nan Heng

911
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,580
The emperor no longer believes you

912
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,580
Nan Rui also gave up on the fight

913
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,580
Now you are alone

914
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,580
I feel that no one in this world

915
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,580
Can feel your situation

916
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,580
right

917
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,580
Father really knows everything

918
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,580
You are always paying attention to me

919
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,580
Of course

920
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,580
You are my son

921
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,580
Now you and my father and son

922
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,580
You are no longer alone

923
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,580
I also asked the god doctor and old Zhao to save Nan Heng in advance

924
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,580
Let them avoid your crime

925
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,580
In addition, Ronghua and Nan Rui

926
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,580
I also went to the letter yesterday

927
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,580
In the future, you can be free

928
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,580
Father really knows this

929
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,580
It's my fault

930
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,580
I failed to bear the responsibility that my father entrusted to me

931
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,580
I failed to live up to your hard work

932
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,580
As long as you are willing to believe me

933
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,580
Nothing else matters

934
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,580
Hong, don't look at it

935
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,580
Now the emperor seems to have a heart with you

936
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,580
But once the emperor is in trouble

937
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,580
It's a good opportunity for you and me to go back to the east mountain

938
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,580
Emperor in trouble

939
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,580
Father, do you know anything?

940
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,580
The heaven cannot be revealed

941
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:54,580
No son, wait for the good news

942
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,580
Father

943
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,580
If the sky is clear

944
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,580
How to write the ending

945
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:27,580
Please stay still

946
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,580
Stay still

947
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:53,580
The past is like a wind that can't be blown away

948
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:58,580
It's not like the true pain of fate

949
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:01,580
Flowers and flowers have been in the heart

950
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:07,580
How can love and hate be hidden

951
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:11,580
The past is like a wind that can't be blown away

952
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:16,580
Why not be destined to be forgotten

953
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,580
If the sky is clear

954
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,580
How to write the ending

955
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:28,580
Please stay still
