1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,780
A human body...

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,040
I'll make difference.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,000
Wish...

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,900
I hope I win.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Just who am I?

6
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,200
The light of the world is the light of the world

7
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,200
The light of the world is the light of the world

8
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:13,200
The light of the world is the light of the world

9
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,200
The light of the world is the light of the world

10
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,200
The light of the world is the light of the world

11
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,200
The light of the world is the light of the world

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,200
For this piece of the story, I write with all my heart for the rest of my life

13
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:50,700
I light the high- pequeña spear and fly high to get a bad years

14
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,700
The Imperial Physician

15
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,700
Episode 18

16
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,700
The Imperial Physician

17
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,700
Episode 18

18
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,700
The Imperial Physician

19
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,700
Episode 18

20
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,700
The Imperial Physician

21
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,700
Episode 18

22
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,700
Your Highness,

23
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,700
you are so scared.

24
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,700
What are you talking about?

25
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,700
This gift is just a gift for Miss Song.

26
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,700
Your Highness said Miss Song knows how to read and do etiquette.

27
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,700
She must have been scared that day.

28
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,700
She is worried about it.

29
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,700
She asked me to take her to Fang Hua Palace to stay for a few days.

30
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,700
I don't know if Madam...

31
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,700
What? That's not good.

32
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,700
Now that there is no title,

33
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,700
and there is no order,

34
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,700
how can she just go?

35
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,700
Since the Imperial Consort has an order,

36
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,700
let Xiaomeng clean up.

37
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,700
Just go.

38
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,700
Master,

39
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,700
if she really goes,

40
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,700
then her marriage with His Highness is settled.

41
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,700
Don't you disagree?

42
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,700
You decide this family or I decide?

43
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,700
No...

44
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,700
Go and invite the girl to the palace.

45
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,700
Yes.

46
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,700
This...

47
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,700
This is a big battle.

48
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,700
This is not a rain.

49
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,700
Miss Song,

50
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,700
the Imperial Consort said that

51
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,700
you must have what others have.

52
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,700
You must have what others don't have.

53
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,700
Please.

54
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,700
I will go.

55
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,700
Yes.

56
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,700
Your Highness, Miss Song is here.

57
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,700
I am Song Yimeng.

58
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,700
Greetings, Your Highness.

59
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,700
Mo'er, come here.

60
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,700
You are so beautiful.

61
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,700
You are really popular.

62
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,700
Thank you for your compliment.

63
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,700
I was thinking,

64
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,700
if there is a girl who likes Heng,

65
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,700
no matter if she is beautiful or ugly,

66
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,700
no matter how she is, I must get her back.

67
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,700
But I didn't expect that

68
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,700
Heng has good taste.

69
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,700
The girl Mo'er likes

70
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,700
is a kind and lovely girl.

71
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,700
I can't hold it anymore.

72
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,700
I can trust you

73
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,700
to get her back.

74
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,700
Your Highness,

75
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,700
I'm afraid

76
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,700
I can't agree to it.

77
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,700
I have no feelings for Seventh Prince.

78
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,700
I never thought of marrying him.

79
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,700
I'll tell you the truth.

80
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,700
I came to the palace this time

81
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,700
to get the marriage cancelled by you.

82
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,700
Cancel the marriage?

83
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,700
What? You also believe the rumors?

84
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,700
You think Heng is a bad person?

85
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,700
No, no, no.

86
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,700
I didn't think so.

87
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,700
I... I did it because...

88
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,700
You...

89
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,700
I told you, you wouldn't believe it.

90
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,700
Anyway, I can't marry him.

91
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,700
I won't marry him.

92
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,700
Please forgive me.

93
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,700
Your marriage with Heng

94
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,700
is a serious matter.

95
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,700
We need to think about it.

96
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,700
Why didn't you move a bit?

97
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,700
You don't like it?

98
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,700
I don't want to move.

99
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,700
It looks like a wedding.

100
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,700
Look over there.

101
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,700
It looks like a porridge.

102
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,700
Your Highness,

103
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,700
you're so determined to marry me.

104
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
If I really eat and wear it,

105
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,700
I'll be a bad person.

106
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,700
I'm a soft person.

107
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,700
No.

108
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,700
I need to find a chance

109
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,700
to get this back.

110
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,700
I need to tell you

111
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,700
that you can't cancel the marriage.

112
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,700
You're so determined.

113
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,700
You've never seen anything good.

114
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,700
How can you cancel the marriage?

115
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,700
Your Highness, it's time to take your medicine.

116
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,700
You're going to run away with the game you're good at?

117
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,700
What's the use of staying up all day?

118
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,700
Your Highness,

119
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,700
I heard that Miss Song

120
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,700
is always in the room

121
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,700
sighing and feeling sad.

122
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,700
If you don't think of any other way,

123
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,700
I'm afraid the marriage

124
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,700
is really going to be canceled.

125
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,700
Tell me,

126
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,700
if I choose a few concubines for Heng,

127
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,700
will Meng be able to change her mind?

128
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,700
Your Highness,

129
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,700
are you helping her

130
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,700
or helping Dao?

131
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,700
I don't understand.

132
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,700
Meng has Chu Pei Hong

133
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,700
who is waiting for her.

134
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,700
He can't see the good side of Heng.

135
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,700
Everyone is fighting for the throne.

136
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,700
Your Highness is so smart.

137
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,700
Your Highness,

138
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,700
I made this tea for you.

139
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,700
Try it.

140
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,700
What is this?

141
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,700
Your Highness,

142
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,700
this is called pearl milk tea.

143
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,700
There are half sugar, whole sugar, and five sugar.

144
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,700
If you add ice, it will be cold.

145
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,700
If you add red tea, green tea, and oolong tea,

146
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,700
it will taste like osmanthus, rose, and sugar.

147
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,700
There are also nine-grain glutinous rice balls.

148
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,700
You can try it.

149
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,700
Pearl milk tea?

150
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,700
Yes.

151
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,700
Not bad.

152
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,700
Meng,

153
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,700
I happen to have something

154
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,700
to discuss with you today.

155
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,700
Your Highness.

156
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,700
Your Highness,

157
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,700
apart from Miss Song'er's unwell condition,

158
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,700
all the ladies and ladies have arrived.

159
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,700
It's okay.

160
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,700
Your Highness,

161
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,700
I happen to have brought you this pearl milk tea.

162
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,700
All ladies, please sit down

163
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,700
and try it together.

164
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,700
Thank you, Your Highness.

165
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,700
It has a sweet taste.

166
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,700
Look at this.

167
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,700
What is this?

168
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,700
Pearl milk tea?

169
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,700
What is pearl milk tea?

170
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,700
This is not bad.

171
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,700
I have invited you all here today

172
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,700
because I have something urgent

173
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,700
to discuss with you.

174
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,700
Your Highness,

175
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,700
you are really kind to us.

176
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
If you have anything,

177
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,700
just tell me.

178
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,700
That's right.

179
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
Heng is my only son.

180
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,700
He has been at the border for many years.

181
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,700
Now,

182
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,700
it's time to get married

183
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,700
and have a child.

184
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,700
Apart from Meng,

185
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,700
in the whole capital,

186
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,700
only your daughter

187
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,700
is virtuous and virtuous.

188
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,700
She is very important.

189
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
She is a good match.

190
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,700
What does this mean?

191
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,700
Your Highness,

192
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,700
hasn't the Seventh Prince already

193
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,700
appointed the Song family to find a woman as his consort?

194
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,700
According to the etiquette,

195
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,700
apart from one concubine,

196
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,700
two concubines can be selected.

197
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,700
Is Miss Jia married?

198
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,700
It's also my family's misfortune.

199
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,700
We are preparing to get married in a few days.

200
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
I heard that

201
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,700
your family is still looking at each other.

202
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,700
The beautiful women in the capital

203
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,700
have been looked up by your family.

204
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,700
Are you looking down on

205
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,700
the Seventh Prince

206
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,700
for his deliberate dissolution?

207
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,700
Mrs. Song,

208
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,700
your second daughter is in the capital.

209
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,700
Why don't you agree?

210
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,700
My eldest daughter

211
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,700
is already a concubine.

212
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,700
If my second daughter is a concubine,

213
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,700
it would be ridiculous.

214
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Even if I agree,

215
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,700
Her Highness doesn't agree.

216
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,700
I agree.

217
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,700
It's good for a woman to be a concubine.

218
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,700
By the way, Mrs. Liu,

219
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,700
I heard that

220
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,700
your daughter is also known as the Eight-Word Noble

221
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,700
and the Prince of the Imperial Family.

222
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,700
Why don't you

223
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,700
put the wealth of the world on your head?

224
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,700
My daughter is the Eight-Word Noble.

225
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,700
It's just that

226
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,700
her grandfather just left.

227
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,700
She is still in the same family.

228
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,700
How can I remember

229
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,700
that your father has been gone for more than ten years?

230
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Why do I think

231
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,700
you don't want to marry Heng?

232
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,700
Is there anything wrong with Heng?

233
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,700
No.

234
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,700
Your Highness misunderstood.

235
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,700
The Seventh Prince is a brilliant and powerful man.

236
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,700
It's not that my daughter

237
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,700
is not willing to marry the Seventh Prince as her concubine.

238
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,700
It's just that...

239
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,700
It's just that...

240
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,700
Isn't there a Song Yi Meng?

241
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,700
Yes, there is a Song Yi Meng.

242
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,700
Me?

243
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,700
Yes.

244
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,700
No one in the capital doesn't know about Miss Song.

245
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,700
She is usually very arrogant and violent.

246
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,700
If the girl from the Seventh Prince

247
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,700
is to marry you,

248
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,700
she will be tortured to death.

249
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,700
I...

250
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,700
Yes.

251
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,700
Song Yi Meng.

252
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,700
He is a wicked man, a drunkard, and a man of no respect.

253
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,700
Song... Song Yi Meng.

254
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,700
A man and a woman.

255
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,700
They are like a couple.

256
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,700
Song Yi Meng...

257
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,700
He kicks the widow and digs up the grave.

258
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,700
He plays blind and chases after the dog.

259
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,700
Yes, yes, yes.

260
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,700
Yes, yes, yes.

261
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,700
Yes.

262
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,700
I think I understand.

263
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,700
Everyone here is here to avoid the marriage between me and Nan Heng.

264
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,700
You think I'm just a piece of dust?

265
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,700
What dust?

266
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,700
Heng, why are you here?

267
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,700
Ladies, I'm talking about your marriage with Meng.

268
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,700
I just caught a few fugitives.

269
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,700
I punished them in prison for breaking the taboo.

270
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,700
I happened to pass by the Phoenix Hall and came to see you.

271
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,700
I heard that you all are not willing to marry your daughter to me

272
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,700
because of my wife.

273
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,700
That's good.

274
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,700
I'm here today.

275
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,700
If you really have a reason, come up and see.

276
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,700
If it's a good reason,

277
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,700
I'll divorce Song Yi Meng.

278
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Why don't you talk?

279
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,700
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,700
What do you want?

281
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,700
I'm here to pick up my sister.

282
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,700
What's your name?

283
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,700
My daughter, secretary,

284
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,700
Miss, the daughter of Qiao Yue, Qiao...

285
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,700
So it's a street.

286
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,700
It's useless.

287
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,700
I think it's better to drag it into the desert.

288
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,700
Mother, Mother,

289
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,700
Your Highness.

290
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,700
You.

291
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,700
I just heard Mrs. Song say

292
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,700
that you and my eight characters are the most compatible.

293
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,700
Which year are you born?

294
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,700
The year of the human.

295
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,700
The year of the human is the year of the tiger.

296
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,700
But if you are a tiger,

297
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,700
you are obviously a guest to me.

298
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,700
If you marry me,

299
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,700
do you want me to give you a guest?

300
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,700
Or do you want me to give you me?

301
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,700
I dare not.

302
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,700
Dare not?

303
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,700
If you dare not, that's lying, lying, and deceiving the noble consort.

304
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,700
If you are in the dark,

305
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,700
you have to dig your heart out and burn your body.

306
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,700
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

307
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
Please spare my life.

308
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Those are all lies.

309
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,700
Tell me.

310
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,700
I dare not lie to you.

311
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,700
Didn't you two laugh the most just now?

312
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,700
Let's not talk now.

313
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,700
Say it!

314
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,700
Your Highness, Your Highness, please forgive me.

315
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,700
You are always making up stories.

316
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,700
I think it's time to drag you two into jail

317
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,700
and cut your tongues off.

318
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,700
Your Highness, Your Highness, please save us.

319
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,700
Your Highness, Your Highness, please save us.

320
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
I will say it again today.

321
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,700
Song Yi Meng is the royal consort I've been looking for.

322
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,700
Her face is my face.

323
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,700
Those who offended me

324
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,700
are all dead under my blade.

325
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,700
Those who offended her,

326
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,700
you can all give it a try.

327
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,700
Your Highness, please forgive us.

328
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,700
Your Highness, please forgive us.

329
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,700
Your Highness, please forgive us.

330
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,700
Your Highness, please forgive us.

331
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,700
Your Highness, please forgive us.

332
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,700
Your Highness, what's wrong with you?

333
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,700
Your Highness, Your Highness.

334
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,700
Mother.

335
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,700
Mother, what's wrong?

336
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,700
Call for the doctor. Hurry up.

337
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,700
Yes.

338
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,700
There's milk in here.

339
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,700
Mother is tired and can't drink milk.

340
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,700
This is the tea I made for Your Highness.

341
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,700
I didn't know Your Highness can't drink milk.

342
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,700
Your Highness.

343
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,700
Your Highness.

344
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,700
I'll leave the medicine to the servants.

345
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,700
You're sick sitting on the windmill at midnight.

346
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
You want to give it to me?

347
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,700
Your Highness is sick because you drank the milk tea I made.

348
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
I have to do something.

349
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,700
I have to make it up.

350
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,700
I'm sorry.

351
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,700
I scared you today.

352
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,700
You usually don't mean to kill me.

353
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,700
You just want to kill me.

354
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,700
I'm used to it.

355
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,700
When can you be so weird?

356
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,700
What are we going to do?

357
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,700
This will be your last day in the palace.

358
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,700
There're people in the palace.

359
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
We have to be careful.

360
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
You don't have to kill someone,

361
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,700
but you have to keep theeda from killing him.

362
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,700
You've visited the palace very recently,

363
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,700
and you helped me towards prepare for the funeral.

364
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,700
This is a big mistake.

365
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,700
If anyone wants to kill you,

366
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,700
or if someone kills someone,

367
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,700
How can you say it so seriously?

368
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,700
What are you talking about?

369
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,100
Nothing.

370
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,500
I remember what you said.

371
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,500
Come on.

372
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,100
Your Highness.

373
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,100
This medicine

374
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,300
is made according to the instructions of the imperial doctor.

375
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,900
Now you know it.

376
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,300
If anything goes wrong,

377
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,700
it's your business.

378
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,700
The Imperial Hospital

379
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,900
Thank you.

380
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,500
I said thank you.

381
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,300
You're thanking me?

382
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,300
Are you out of your mind?

383
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,300
You're out of your mind.

384
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,500
Fine.

385
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,900
I'm out of my mind.

386
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,300
I'll thank you when I'm out of my mind.

387
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,300
Just take it as a scolding.

388
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,900
Anyway, you don't like

389
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,100
others thanking you.

390
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,100
There are many people who scold me.

391
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,100
You're not the only one.

392
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,100
You said so many scary words

393
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,700
in front of so many ladies.

394
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,100
Aren't you afraid that they'll take it seriously?

395
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,100
In their eyes,

396
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,500
Gu is just a murderer who does evil.

397
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,500
Then you can explain it to those who misunderstand you.

398
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,700
Explain it to them.

399
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
I'm sorry.

400
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,100
I'm sorry.

401
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,900
I'm sorry.

402
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,700
I'm sorry.

403
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,500
I'm sorry.

404
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,700
I told you to explain it to you.

405
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,500
Do you understand?

406
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,700
They say I'm a murderer.

407
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,300
Don't you think so?

408
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,700
People insult me and scold me.

409
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,700
Don't you do that?

410
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,100
I explain to you, but you don't believe me.

411
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,700
Why should I explain to others?

412
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Am I a little too much to you?

413
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,100
You are a little too much.

414
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,900
But it doesn't matter.

415
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,900
I'm sorry.

416
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,700
This flower was made by my girl.

417
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
Please hand it over to Mr. Li.

418
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,580
City office

419
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,940
How is that you?

420
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,620
I know you gezer

421
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,900
You didn't know me,

422
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,380
you did pick up a Chief come,

423
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,460
and contaminated me

424
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,860
I just wanna tell true story

425
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,660
Late in the transparent 그게

426
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,140
I know that

427
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:32,140
How could a hero like you be around such a high-class person?

428
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,140
Fine.

429
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,140
I'm unlucky to have met you. Is that okay?

430
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,140
A'Long, let's go.

431
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,140
You haven't finished your painting?

432
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,140
This...

433
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,140
This time, I'm the one who painted it.

434
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,140
The sword is a gift from the jade?

435
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,140
May I ask your name?

436
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,140
The 73rd House.

437
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,140
This month...

438
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,140
This month seems to be the third.

439
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,140
Miss Sang Er's hands are quite strong.

440
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,140
I like painting, I'm good at painting.

441
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,140
Can you handle it?

442
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,140
Don't go around with me.

443
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,140
Where is Hero Li?

444
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,140
I must see him today.

445
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,140
Boss, he's not here.

446
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,140
If he's not here now, it doesn't mean he's not here for a while.

447
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:37,140
A'Long, hurry up and take Miss Song Er to the top floor to rest.

448
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,140
The Chief will be here in a while.

449
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,140
Stop!

450
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,140
Boss, you're not doing the right thing.

451
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,140
While Boss is away, what are you going to do to his aunt?

452
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,140
A hooligan.

453
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,140
Am I that kind of person?

454
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,140
Really?

455
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,140
Yes.

456
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,140
No!

457
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,140
Look, three days, 73 paintings.

458
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,140
What kind of a mistake is this?

459
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,140
If he comes here for three days and two days,

460
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,140
he'll cause trouble for the Chief sooner or later.

461
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,140
If the Chief is not happy, can I be happy?

462
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:24,140
So, in the end, I'm the one who's causing trouble.

463
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,140
I have to solve it.

464
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,140
What are you going to do?

465
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,140
Break up? I'm a professional.

466
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,140
Miss, sit.

467
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,140
I'm sorry.

468
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,140
Miss, it's okay.

469
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,140
The things outside are dirty.

470
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,140
Miss, I'm sorry for the paint on the wall.

471
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,140
Don't misunderstand, Master Li.

472
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,140
I love to do things without any external factors.

473
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,140
I don't dislike it.

474
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,140
It's okay. I understand.

475
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,140
Miss Song'er is a person who knows gratitude and is generous.

476
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,140
I only helped her once.

477
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,140
In three days, she sent 73 paintings.

478
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,140
I'm very grateful for your kindness.

479
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,140
It's good that you like it.

480
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,140
But sometimes, too much affection can be a burden.

481
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,140
I'm sorry.

482
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,140
I'm sorry.

483
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,140
I'm sorry.

484
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,140
I'm sorry.

485
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,140
I'm sorry.

486
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,140
I'm sorry.

487
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,140
I'm sorry.

488
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,140
I'm sorry.

489
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,140
You've become a burden.

490
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,140
You are so elegant and elegant.

491
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,140
You are admired by thousands of people.

492
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,140
When you are in danger,

493
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,140
you will help anyone.

494
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,140
I'm really not good enough.

495
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,140
But if you want to thank me,

496
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,140
let's have a drink today.

497
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,140
We can be friends.

498
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,140
You don't have to be so polite in the future.

499
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,140
I'm sorry.

500
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,140
I was too old to dream.

501
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,140
I'm sorry to make you feel burdened.

502
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,140
I understand what you mean.

503
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,140
I won't send you paintings again.

504
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,140
Hero Li,

505
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,140
I sent you paintings not just to thank you.

506
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,140
You said that you sent 73 paintings in three days.

507
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,140
What kind of gratitude can I use this brush?

508
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,140
I'm happy for you.

509
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,140
But Miss Song'er is from a noble family.

510
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,140
She is talented and beautiful.

511
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,360
I'm a man of no

512
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,140
knowledge and I'm a man of no knowledge.

513
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,140
I'm just a man of no knowledge.

514
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,140
How can I be so disappointed

515
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,140
when I know you are so beautiful?

516
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:26,140
How about we drink this cup of tea

517
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,140
and look at the world from now on?

518
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,140
I understand.

519
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,140
Hero,

520
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,140
this is a toy.

521
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,140
Fallen flowers are in love with the flowing water.

522
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,140
The flowing water is not clear.

523
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,140
The lotus is in love with the falling flowers.

524
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,140
The love is not possible to be forced.

525
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:01,140
I win this cup.

526
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,140
I'm not a fake.

527
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,140
But you can be loved by me.

528
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,140
It's not like you are a mud on the ground.

529
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,140
I just have some differences.

530
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,140
A cool and unruly person like you

531
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:24,140
will also be taken care of by the family.

532
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,140
How can a girl live a hard life

533
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,140
when she is a girl?

534
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,140
A person in the world

535
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,140
is a person who has no moon and phoenix.

536
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,140
No house and no house.

537
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,140
Even the water cup of the moon is dirty.

538
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,140
But I usually live a life

539
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,140
that is full of wind and rain.

540
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,140
I drink this tea.

541
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,140
But you don't seem to drink it.

542
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,140
You don't seem to understand what I mean.

543
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,140
I understand.

544
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,140
You don't have a salary.

545
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,140
But I can support you with the money

546
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,140
from the Ministry of War.

547
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,140
The house is not under the picture.

548
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,140
There are 36 houses in the wide field.

549
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,140
There are houses all over Song family.

550
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,140
If you want to be a good person,

551
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,140
you can live in the house.

552
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,140
I understand.

553
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,140
I understand.

554
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,140
There are houses in the wide field.

555
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,140
If you want to be a good person,

556
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,140
as long as you follow me,

557
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,140
my house is your house.

558
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,140
No, how can I do that?

559
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,140
Then I should eat soft food.

560
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,140
Love and moon.

561
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,140
The most important thing is the moon.

562
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,140
As long as you can make me happy,

563
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,140
soft food and hard food are all the same.

564
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,140
What if I don't like you?

565
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,140
What if I don't like you?

566
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,140
Then I'll find a way to make you like me.

567
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,140
You just said

568
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,140
people like me

569
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,140
are all people.

570
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,140
But I'm not one of them.

571
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,140
Look at me.

572
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,140
I'm free and free.

573
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,140
I don't want to be with someone.

574
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,140
You run such a big club.

575
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,140
You're not very free.

576
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,140
You've got the point.

577
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,140
That's right.

578
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,140
I want to run such a big moon.

579
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,140
At this stage,

580
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,140
making a living is the most important thing for me.

581
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,140
The love of the zither

582
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,140
will only affect my business and my money.

583
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,140
There are 30 days a month.

584
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,140
I play the zither for five days,

585
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,140
read for five days,

586
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,140
and paint for five days.

587
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,140
I go out with my sisters for five days.

588
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,140
I go on a double-family trip with my parents for five days.

589
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,140
The time I need for you is only five days.

590
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,140
I'll pay you double the money

591
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,140
you earn in the club.

592
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,140
It won't delay your money.

593
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,140
You can run the club.

594
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,140
But I have to say this.

595
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,140
On the 30th day of the month,

596
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,140
I'll travel for five days,

597
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,140
play the zither for five days,

598
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,140
drink and drink for five days,

599
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,140
visit my old friends for five days,

600
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,140
and...

601
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,140
I won't tell you.

602
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,140
Anyway,

603
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,140
I'll be here for you

604
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,140
for five days.

605
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,140
How about that?

606
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,140
Isn't that how you make a living?

607
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,140
Money can solve everything?

608
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,140
Can you buy company and buy true feelings?

609
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,140
Money is an external object.

610
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,140
If money can solve the problem of feelings,

611
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,140
why not?

612
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,140
What I want is your person, your heart.

613
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,140
The feelings that are not burdened by money

614
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,140
are the purest feelings.

615
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,140
Let me think about it.

616
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,140
Let me think about it.

617
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,140
Master Li, think about it.

618
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,140
I'll wait for you here.

619
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,140
Wait for your answer.

620
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,140
Your Highness, you wanted to see me?

621
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,140
Mo'er, come here.

622
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,140
Your Highness, are you feeling better?

623
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,140
I made a few desserts for Heng'er.

624
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,140
But he left in a hurry.

625
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,140
He forgot to take them away.

626
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,140
Go and catch up with him.

627
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,140
I'll prepare a few more dishes for him.

628
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,140
Yes.

629
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,140
Your Highness,

630
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,140
I'll go and get Heng'er.

631
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,140
I'll be right back.

632
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,140
Your Highness,

633
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,140
I'll go and get Heng'er.

634
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,140
He left in a hurry.

635
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,140
Go and catch up with him.

636
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,140
I'll prepare some more desserts for him.

637
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,140
Shouldn't Master Yang do all these things?

638
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,140
But look at this.

639
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,140
Is there anyone else in this Phoenix Palace?

640
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,140
Your Highness,

641
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:19,140
you're being a little deliberate.

642
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,140
Good child,

643
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,140
since you know my feelings,

644
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,140
go and catch up with him.

645
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,140
But Your Highness,

646
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,140
me and His Highness...

647
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,140
We...

648
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:35,140
You drank that cup of milk tea yesterday.

649
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,140
Why are you still so unwell?

650
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,140
I'll go.

651
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,140
I'll be right back.

652
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:50,140
I heard that His Highness had a big fight at the Phoenix Palace yesterday.

653
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:54,140
He scared those ladies into their graves.

654
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,140
Song Yi Meng is my concubine.

655
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,140
How can I let him have a meeting with someone else?

656
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,140
I heard what you said.

657
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,140
The marriage with Song family

658
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,140
is already decided.

659
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,140
Why does Uncle care so much about this?

660
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,140
About the old case,

661
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:15,140
His Majesty obviously used the old case against you.

662
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,140
But 18th Prince went to Song family every day.

663
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:22,140
He's very kind to Miss Song.

664
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,140
He's very kind.

665
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,140
I have my own plans for the old case.

666
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,140
As for Nanrui,

667
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,140
although I don't know Song Yi Ting,

668
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,140
I don't think I can trust her.

669
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,140
Although Miss Song is not loyal,

670
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:41,140
her mother, Zhou Shi, obviously has fallen for her.

671
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,140
I still think

672
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,140
that instead of letting Miss Song be the one who helped her,

673
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,140
why don't you take the second daughter back to the mansion?

674
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,140
You can marry her and have a child.

675
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:58,140
You can completely take the power of Song family in your hands.

676
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,140
My answer

677
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,140
is still the same.

678
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,140
Ridiculous.

679
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,140
Very good.

680
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,140
Take the wife and the child.

681
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,140
Take the wife and the child.

682
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,140
Very good.

683
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,140
Nanrui!

684
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,140
Mother,

685
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,140
I'm sorry.

686
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,140
Why are you here?

687
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,140
If I hadn't followed her,

688
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:56,140
I wouldn't have known that you two are so mean.

689
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,140
Song Yi Ting,

690
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,140
he is your brother-in-law.

691
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,140
He was my brother-in-law before,

692
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,140
and now he is my husband.

693
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,140
I'll let you take the position of Consort Zheng,

694
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,140
but you'd better know

695
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,140
that the person he loves the most

696
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,140
is me.

697
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,140
You're talking nonsense.

698
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,140
You're talking nonsense!

699
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,140
What do I have to do? It's none of your business.

700
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,140
Get lost!

701
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,140
I understand.

702
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:45,240
That

703
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,240
is the end of the story.

704
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,240
The story of the Three Kingdoms is coming.

705
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,240
We've been waiting for this hour.

706
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,240
Hero Li hasn't figured it out yet.

707
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,340
Why don't we put down the knot and look ahead?

708
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,340
The world is vast,

709
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,340
and there are thousands of good men.

710
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:16,340
Our lady will meet better.

711
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,340
Oh no!

712
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,340
The lady's handkerchief seems to be left on the table.

713
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,340
Such a personal thing can't be lost.

714
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,340
Wait a minute, I'll go back and find it.

715
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,340
I'll go back and find it.

716
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,340
I'll go back and find it.

717
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,340
I'll go back and find it.

718
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,340
I'll go back and find it.

719
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,340
I'll go back and find it.

720
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,340
I'll go back and find it.

721
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,340
I'll go back and find it.

722
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,340
I'll go back and find it.

723
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,340
I'll go back and find it.

724
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,340
I'll go back and find it.

725
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,340
I'll go back and find it.

726
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,340
I'll go back and find it.

727
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,340
I'll go back and find it.

728
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,340
I'll go back and find it.

729
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,440
I'll go back and find it.

730
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,440
I'll go back and find it.

731
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,440
I'll go back and find it.

732
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,440
I'll go back and find it.

733
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,440
I'll go back and find it.

734
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,440
I'll go back and find it.

735
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,440
I'll go back and find it.

736
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,440
I'll go back and find it.

737
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,440
I'll go back and find it.

738
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,440
I'll go back and find it.

739
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,440
I'll go back and find it.

740
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,440
I'll go back and find it.

741
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,440
I'll go back and find it.

742
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,440
I'll go back and find it.

743
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,440
I'll go back and find it.

744
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,440
I'll go back and find it.

745
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,440
I'll go back and find it.

746
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,440
I'll go back and find it.

747
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
Qian Yu is very late.

748
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
She's mean.

749
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,740
To which hopeless ex poisoning

750
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:14,680
To whom hopeless ex imminent

751
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,560
Big brother, you don't have to be Movement No.1

752
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,600
Did Song Yiting leave?

753
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,740
Don't worry. I saw her escape herself

754
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,040
We were so busy.

755
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,780
You are still drinking here

756
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,640
During my job I fell in love with makange

757
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,040
What did you do?

758
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,440
to help you solve the problem of Song Yi Ting.

759
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,040
But it's okay.

760
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,840
My extraordinary appearance

761
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,040
and my personality

762
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,640
are given by God after all.

763
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,440
And I will be given everything in my life.

764
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,840
No way.

765
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,640
Miss Song likes the boss.

766
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,240
The boss wearing a mask has nothing to do with his face.

767
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,440
It has nothing to do with you.

768
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,040
The moon knife is missing.

769
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,040
There's a thief.

770
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,440
Who dares to steal things in the moon?

771
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,440
A'Long, let's go after him.

772
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,240
No need.

773
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,840
Tomorrow noon,

774
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,640
send a message to the garden.

775
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:38,440
The city is crowded with cold mist.

776
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:47,440
You and I are fated to be entangled in the world.

777
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,840
The wind blows gently in the ear.

778
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,440
The black night's prayer

779
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:02,640
The eyes are lost.

780
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,440
When will I return?

781
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,040
The wind blows gently in the ear.

782
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:16,040
The wind blows gently in the ear.

783
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,440
The wind blows gently in the ear.

784
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,240
How can love and hate hide?

785
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,840
The years are long, and the wind is strong.

786
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,840
The wind is strong, but it should not change its destiny.

787
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:38,440
If one day is not certain, how to write the ending?

788
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:46,240
Please stay still.

789
00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:01,640
The wind blows gently in the ear.

790
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,840
The wind blows gently in the ear.

791
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:13,640
The wind blows gently in the ear.

792
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:21,440
How can I write the ending?

793
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,440
The past is like a wind, the wind is like a shadow, it's hard to wake up

794
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,440
The life is like a dream, the life is like a dream, it's destined

795
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,440
If I meet you, how can I write the ending?

796
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:43,440
Please stay by my side
