Chu Guihong wrote you.

175
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
How would there be evidence in them?

176
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,200

This letter

was written five days
before the Pingrong Battle.

184

Nan Heng's every move

185

was being watched at that time.

186
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,790
How could he have
colluded with the traitor

187

without getting caught?

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,030
I'm going to the Ministry of Justice

189
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,960
to clear his name.

190
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,720
Yimeng,

191
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,840
a joint interrogation
isn't a small matter.

192
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,090
All the big names in court are there.

193
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,630
I once broke into an execution ground.

194
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,000
You think I'd be scared of this?

195
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,460
Chu Guihong clearly wants

196
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,910
Nan Heng to be sentenced
to death this time.

197
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,630
If I don't help him,

198
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,790
who else will believe he's innocent?

199
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,240
I'll go to Waning River Crescent for help.

200
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,030
No.

201
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,440
We can't involve the Nightwalkers.

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,120
What Nan Heng needs

203
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,240
is justice and truth.

204
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,030
Mr. Song,

205

206

for the Pingrong Battle?

In the 4th year of Xiyuan,

on November 2nd,

210
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,960
the Heyuan army took 100 civilians

211
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,200
from Xing City and Ji City hostage

212
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,000
and approached Pingrong City.

[Pingrong City, the Third Border City]

214
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,240
Lord Qianyu led 20,000 soldiers

215
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,820
and fought fiercely for six days,

216
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,620
but was trapped and outmatched.

217
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,310
Later, Junior General Chu Guihong

218
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,640
led an elite force on a night raid
of the enemy camp,

219
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,770
intending to kill their commander,
Fang Shiming.

220
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,390
Unexpectedly,

221
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,610
he walked into an ambush

222
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,760
and was captured.

223
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,870

They pushed all the way to Youcheng.

229
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,710
The Qianyu Army
was stationed along the border.

230
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,170
Other than Pingrong City,

231
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,720
why were the other two cities lost?

232
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,970
Is there any record?

233
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,440
The Qianyu Army had 40,000 soldiers

234
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,290
and couldn't defend
all cities at the same time.

235
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,510
Pingrong's terrain is open—

236
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,270
easy to attack, hard to defend.

237
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,670
So most of the troops
were stationed there.

238
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,810
That left Xing City
and Ji City under-defended,

239
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,730
and they were taken first.

240
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,040
That's why I believe

241
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,290
something doesn't add up.

242
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,440
What do you mean?

243
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,260
Military deployment was top secret,

244
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,910
yet the Heyuan forces

245
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,870
struck the weakest cities first

246
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,600
as if they knew exactly where to hit.

247
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,550
I believe

248
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,950
someone must have

249
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,510
leaked the deployment information

250
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,840
to Heyuan in advance.

251
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,200
My father ran the army
with strict discipline.

252
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,530
There were no traitors in the Qianyu Army!

253
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,630
But wasn't the traitor Lu Yi
whom you keep mentioning

254
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,480
a scout from the Qianyu Army?

255
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,010
Your Highness,

256
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,630
are you suggesting
Lu Yi was bribed by Heyuan?

257
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,330
That's what I thought at first.

258
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,360
But as a traitor,

259
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,570
he returned to the capital unnoticed,

260
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,910
got settled,

261
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,170
and walked away clean.

262
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,430
I don't think he had that kind of power.

263
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,000
So I believe

264
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,750
there must've been someone behind him.

not only leaked

and manipulated people behind the scenes.

fell for his schemes

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,800
It had to be him.

346
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,880
Yeah,

347
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,010
it must've been him!

348
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,100
Who's telling the truth here?

349
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,000
Chu Guihong,

350
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,120
do you dare swear you didn't write this?

351
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,770
Miss Song, may I ask—

352
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,060
when was this letter written?

353
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,550
Five days before the Pingrong Battle.

354
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,790
Before the battle,

355
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,400
I injured my right hand during training.

356
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,530
It didn't heal until the battle began.

357
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,350
Everyone

358
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,110
in the Qianyu Army knows this.

359
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,110
So how could I have written this letter?

360
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,830
You're beyond redemption.

361
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,880
Ministers,

362
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,570
if you don't believe me,

363
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,440
you can compare
the handwriting here and now.

364
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,000
If I'm lying,

365
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,310
I'll accept any punishment.

366
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,070
Enough!

367
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,550
To help Nan Heng,

368
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,280
you've actually gone this far.

369
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,720
The inspector my father
placed in Youcheng

370
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,830
on His Majesty's orders

371
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,030
was assassinated by Nan Heng

372
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,240
the moment he arrived.

373
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,510
That's how the Qianyu Army
lost contact with Youcheng.

374
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,620
So how could anyone
have been monitoring him?

375
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,660
Chu Guihong,

376
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,240
that's utter nonsense!

377
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,200
You're lying!

378
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,920
Everyone,

379
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,240
the letter is fake,

380
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,400
but Nan Heng's treacherous ambitions

381
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,150
have long been obvious.

382
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,790
He betrayed the country, let the enemy in,

383
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,310
and tried to use the Heyuan army

384
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,710
to wipe out the Qianyu Army
once and for all.

385
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,200

Go now.

389
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,180
Nan Heng,

390
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,750
the letter isn't forged.

391
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,750
Of course I know you didn't forge it.

392
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,440
How dare he lie

393
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,020
in front of everyone?

394
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,860
That letter just revealed
his true character.

395
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,200
For Yimeng,

396
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,060
it's not necessarily a bad thing.

397
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,150
Minister Yan,

398
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,590
the truth behind the Pingrong Battle
is clear now.

399
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,030
You're the presiding judge today.

Why haven't you issued a verdict?

also been threatened
by this sinister schemer?

404
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,700
If he were truly sinister,

405
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,060
you wouldn't be standing here today.

00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,440
didn't you always tell me

to judge things based on evidence?

427
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,920
Guihong has no real proof now.

428
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,580
How can you just decide
to punish Heng like that?

429
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,440
Weren't you the one who kept demanding

430
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,640
I deal with Heng?

Father,

434
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,480
this isn't the kind of help I want.

435
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,000
It's because you always play favorites

436
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,030
that the whole world mocks me,

437
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,160

blaming me?

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,270
I...

442
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,350
I'm blaming myself.

Father.

444
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,350
I know

445
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,390
I was too reckless before,

446
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,660
and I made things hard for you.

447
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,250
But now I've figured it out.

448
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,520
If Heng

449
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,000
really is guilty,

450
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,720
then we should
investigate it openly and fairly

451
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,180
and convict him properly.

452
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,660
If you force a charge on him,

453
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,240
sure, you might succeed
in stripping him of military command,

454
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,960
but while you gain the command token,

455
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,590
you'll lose the people's trust,

456

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,590
You got 20,000 of our soldiers
killed for nothing

684
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,520
and brought destruction
to the people on the border.

685
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,110
Do you regret it?

686
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,910
Your Highness, you truly are exceptional,

687
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
so you must already know the answer.

688
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,290
I regret nothing.

689
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,550
From the moment
Her Ladyship gave birth to you,

690
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,160
the Gao family was destined to walk

691
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,590
a path of bloodshed.

692
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,480
To rule means to kill.

693
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,210
Your hands are destined
to be stained with blood.

694
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,110
Just 20,000 people.

695
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,920
What's the big deal?

696
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,350
So in your eyes,

697
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,840
as long as you help me rise to the throne,

698
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,960
as long as the Gao family comes to power,

699
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,590
no matter how many people die,

700
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,720
it's all worth it?

701
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,950
Since you were young,
I've been telling you

702
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,070
that only by being emotionless

703
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,000
can you reach the peak of power.

704
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,830
But you were weak-willed then,

705
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,480
always afraid of displeasing His Majesty

706
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,790
and always treading carefully,

707
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,990
submissive and meek.

708
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,200
Even Chu Guihong
could've barked orders at you.

709
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,000
No wonder your own father

710
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,270
has been so cruel to you.

711
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,640
Uncle.

712
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,770
Was the Empress's death

713
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,820
your doing?

714
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,420
If I hadn't killed her,

715
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,960
the Gao family
would've never had a future.

716
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,000
But have you ever considered

717
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
what consequences all your actions

718
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,770
would bring upon the Gao family and me?

719
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,700
It was your weakness
and cowardice back then

720
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,500
that made His Majesty doubt you.

721
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,740
Your Highness,

722
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,240
I'm the only one who can help you now.

723
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,000
Rather than rely on others

724
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and beg for scraps,

725
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,830
why not rely on yourself

726
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,590
and carve out your own empire?

727
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,350
Your Highness.

728
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,320
Are you asking me to rise up?

729
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,440
I've gone to great lengths
to back you into a corner

730
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,960
just so you can
make up your mind to seize the throne.

731
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,560
Don't worry, Your Highness.

732
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,750
I was able to fake my death and escape

733
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,420
because I had men planted
in the Xuanjia Army.

734
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,630
And tonight, I could bring soldiers

735
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,590
into the capital prefecture's prison

736
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,590
because I also
have men in the Qianyu Army.

737
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,510
That's not all.

738
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,030
I have 3,000 private soldiers
stationed secretly outside the city.

739
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,230
Once you give the order,

740
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,320
they can attack from both inside and out,

741
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,510
surround the palace,

742
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:25,440
and imprison His Majesty
and the Eighteenth Prince.

743
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,889
Uncle, you've been using me

744
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,480
and my mother as your pawns.

745
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,540
You say it's all for the Gao family,

746
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:36,030
but are you not afraid

747
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,710
of ruining the Gao family's name forever?

748
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,590
If you steal money, you're a thief.

749
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,000
If you steal a nation, you're a king.

750
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,840
Your Highness, stop hesitating.

751
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,230
This is the last chance I can give you.

752
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,550
You're already a prisoner.

753
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,630
Besides rising up in rebellion,

754
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,690
do you think you have another choice?

755
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,030
So the traitor in Great Jing

756
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,280
is you, Gao Changyin.

757
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,960
What a great chancellor.

758
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,960
Murdering the Empress,

759
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,940
colluding with the enemy,

760
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,070
and now plotting to start a rebellion.

761
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,070
As the Emperor,

762
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:26,000
I've been so blind.

763
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,470
So this whole thing was a setup
by His Highness and Your Majesty.

764
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,800
[One day ago]

765
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,550
What are you here for?

766
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,640
Your Majesty,

767
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,550
after speaking with Rui,

768
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I confirmed that Gao Changyin isn't dead.

769
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,060
He's been plotting from the shadows.

770
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,290
So I want you

771
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,070
to put on a show with me

772
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,550
to lure him out.

773
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,150
Why should I trust you?

774
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,280
You don't have to.

775
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,350
Just consider it a gamble.

776
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,800
Absurd.

777
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,480
Is the state affair

778
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,970
a children's game to you?

779
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,890
I wouldn't dare,

780
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,210
but I'm willing to place my bet.

781
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,880
So you want to negotiate.

782
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,150
Then tell me,

783
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,740
what are you putting on the table?

784
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,320
If my plan

785
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,360
fails to lure Gao Changyin out,

786
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,190
I'll willingly hand over
the Xuanjia Army's command token,

787
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,590
withdraw from politics,

788
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,680
and never return to the capital.

789
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,860
Your Highness, so everything we've been
through together means nothing to you,

790
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,340
and you're determined to get me killed.

791
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,400
Uncle,

792
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,140
it's time to let go of your obsession.

793
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,890
It's all over now.

794
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,190
You've learned well.

795
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,230
I'm glad to see you finally find it in you

796
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,950
to turn on your own family.

797
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:14,840
Guards!

798
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,130
Arrest the traitor Gao Changyin.

799
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,800
He'll be executed later!

800
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,280
Stop!

801
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,070
Eunuch Liu.

802
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,790
I know His Majesty is inside.

803
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,120
-I want to see him.
-You're not allowed in!

804
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:41,760
Your Majesty.

805
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,320
A-Aren't you supposed to be in prison?

806
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,030
How…

807
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,090
Your Highness!

808
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,970
Your Highness!

809
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,030
Chancellor Gao has confessed.

810
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,490
It's all thanks to
your brilliant strategy.

811
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,800
Miss Song?

812
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,010
Chancellor Gao has confessed?

813
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,240
So,

814
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,910
you were never really in danger.

815
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,230
That was just a trap you set up.

816
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,510
Why didn't you...

817
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,320
Fine.

818
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,450
I'm so stupid.

819
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,050
[Jinyang Mutiny]

820
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,250
[Battle of Tancheng]

821
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,550
I kept it from you

822
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,430
because

823
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,320
my uncle was too powerful.

824
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,110
I feared you'd be in danger if involved,

825
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,640
so I didn't say a word to you.

826
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,180
Listen to me, listen to me.

827
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,840
When you suddenly appeared

828
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,000
at the joint interrogation today,

829
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,970
I was

830
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,480
quite surprised.

831
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,310
I didn't expect

832
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,230
you'd care for me

833
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,840
and trust me so much.

834
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,120
Who says I care for you?

835
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,610
Who says I trust you?

836
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,760
I'd be elated
if they sent you back to prison

837
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,490
and had you executed right now!

838
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,030
Let me tell you,

839
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,110
from now on,

840
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,840
you go your way,

841
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,080
and I'll go mine.

842
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,330
Don't come to me again.

843
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,070
Wait.

844
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:43,900
You…

845
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,640
Wherever you go, I'll go.

846
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,320
Whatever path you walk, I'll follow.

847
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,400
With you following me,

848
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,480
any path would lead

849
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,460
straight to hell.

850
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,540
Wait, Song Yimeng.

00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,230
I'll tell you one last time:

852
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,280
until I calm down,

853
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,620
don't let me see your face!

854
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:06,990
Song Yimeng!

855
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,250
When will you calm down?

856
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,320
Song Yimeng!

857
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,280
The Pingrong Battle

858
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,960
was a national tragedy.

859
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,000
Gao Changyin and his accomplices

860
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,510
[Gao Residence]

861
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,670
conspired against their own country.

862
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:26,920
[Gao Residence]

863
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,880
Because of them,
20,000 Qianyu soldiers were slaughtered.

864
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:31,800
[Sealed by the capital prefect Chu
following a royal command]

865
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,430
Their crimes are unforgivable.

866
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,710
Their property is confiscated,

867
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,480
and they're exiled
to the northern frontier.

868
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,880
All titles and ranks

869
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,710
are stripped.

870
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,510
Let this be a warning

871
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,590
to all officials.

872
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,500
Thank goodness
I sided with the Seventh Prince.
