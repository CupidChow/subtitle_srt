1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sword is heavy.

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the deep roots of the enemy.

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,800
It's not as good as the dust.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am a beast.

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
I am a beast.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
A heart is not a sword.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
The four seas are in harmony.

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
No need to wait.

10
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
No need to hate.

11
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Write a poem for myself.

12
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
For all that I have.

13
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,800
I will write a poem with my love.

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
The wind blows.

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
I am not good at fighting.

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
I don't regret my youth.

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,800
I will be a man of my word.

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,800
For this life and for all lives.

19
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
I will give my all.

20
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
The Legend of Chusen

21
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Episode 15

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
The Legend of Chusen

23
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
You are still alive.

24
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Why didn't you come to me?

25
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Say something.

26
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Say something.

27
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Say something.

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Cousin.

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Cousin.

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Cousin.

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Don't hit me.

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Who are you?

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
The six-man army of Qianyu.

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Lu Yi.

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
No.

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Let me think.

37
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
You...

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,800
You are the Chihou who sent the letter of the wish.

39
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
You are not dead.

40
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
The two armies fought.

41
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Your friends died.

42
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
You are the only one who survived.

43
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Lu Yi.

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
You fled.

45
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
You let everyone go.

46
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
You ran away.

47
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Young general.

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
I didn't.

49
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
I didn't.

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Do you know how they died

51
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,800
after living for tens of thousands of lives?

52
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
The Legend of Chusen

53
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
General.

54
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
Young general.

55
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Any news about the Xuan's army?

56
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
It's been two days and two nights.

57
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Lu Yi is not here.

58
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Xuan's army

59
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
is not coming.

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
You said that the Xuan's army would come to save us.

61
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Let us wait.

62
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Wait for two days.

63
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
What did you wait for?

64
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Say something.

65
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
It's Nan Keng.

66
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,800
He lost his life because of his own fault.

67
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Is it the general's fault?

68
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
If he didn't have hope for the killing of the people,

69
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
we could have changed our strategy.

70
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
We don't need to be attacked.

71
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Enough.

72
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
The war is coming.

73
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Why do you say such dirty words?

74
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
If the Yuan army comes,

75
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
we will fight with them.

76
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
If the Yuan army doesn't come,

77
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
we will fight till the last minute.

78
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
What's the difference?

79
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Father.

80
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
I have decided.

81
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Tonight I will take people to the enemy camp

82
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
and assassinate Fang Shi Ming.

83
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
If we succeed,

84
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
the Yuan army will be in trouble.

85
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Qian Yu army will take advantage of the opportunity

86
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
to turn the situation around.

87
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Good.

88
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Two thousand soldiers died.

89
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,800
They died with the reputation of the war.

90
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,800
They only wanted to get rid of the injustice.

91
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
All of these

92
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
were because of the battle of Ping Rong.

93
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Nan Keng didn't send troops to rescue Yuan.

94
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Lu Yi.

95
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
You are the one who killed him.

96
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,800
You are the one who killed him.

97
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
You are the one who killed him.

98
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
You are the one who killed him.

99
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
You are the one who killed him.

100
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
You are the one who killed him.

101
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Lu Yi.

102
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Tell me.

103
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Did you send the letter I gave you?

104
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Did you kill my father?

105
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
Did you kill my father?

106
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
You are dumb.

107
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Say something.

108
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Young general.

109
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
I am sorry.

110
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
I am sorry, old general.

111
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
I am sorry, old general.

112
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Nan Keng forced me to do all of this.

113
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
Nan Keng forced me to do all of this.

114
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
He received the letter.

115
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
He received the letter.

116
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
I knew

117
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
he was supposed to send troops.

118
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

119
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Where were you when the military service was being investigated?

120
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Where were you when Qian Yi Jun was in trouble?

121
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
I didn't.

122
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Nan Keng is a coward.

123
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
It's not that I don't want to tell you.

124
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
It's that I can't tell you.

125
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
That time,

126
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
when I arrived at Youcheng at night,

127
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
he had already planned it.

128
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,800
He wanted to kill those 20,000 people.

129
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Only in this way

130
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
could he

131
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
kill the military service alone.

132
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
What about the later?

133
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Since you were able to go to the capital,

134
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
you should have come to me with countless opportunities.

135
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Where did you get this yard?

136
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Where did you get this camp?

137
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
He was the one who betrayed you, right?

138
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
No!

139
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
I didn't.

140
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Nan Keng took away my wife and children.

141
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
I...

142
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
I really have no other choice.

143
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
I'm not like this.

144
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Please kill me.

145
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Qian Yi Jun.

146
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
How could there be a coward like you?

147
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Kill him!

148
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Kill him!

149
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Listen to me!

150
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
If he's telling the truth,

151
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
you should let him live.

152
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Let him be the judge.

153
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
If you still believe me,

154
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
give me four hours.

155
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
I'll take my family to the capital.

156
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
I'll take my family to the capital.

157
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Once I've settled down in my family,

158
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
I'll be willing to face the political crisis.

159
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
From now on,

160
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
I'll hand over Jiang Song Lin

161
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
to be the general.

162
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
This is all the files

163
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
of the battle with the military.

164
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Now we have the witness.

165
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
As long as we can get the testimony of Lu Yi,

166
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
we can convict Nan Heng.

167
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Cousin,

168
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
although my brain is a little slow,

169
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
I think about it again and again.

170
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Don't you think Lu Yi

171
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
appeared suddenly?

172
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Should we investigate him again?

173
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
At least we can figure out where he lived

174
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
after he came back from Pingrong.

175
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
What kind of person did he meet?

176
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
What if what he said today is not true?

177
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Qian Yi Jun never lies.

178
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
You don't know what I've been through

179
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
and you don't understand

180
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
what I'm doing right now.

181
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Cousin,

182
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
I know

183
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
it's more important for you

184
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
to clear up for Qian Yi Jun.

185
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
But...

186
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
You don't have to intervene.

187
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
When I ask my father

188
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
and Qian Yu to make a deal with Chen Yuan,

189
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
and kill Nan Heng,

190
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
you just wait to be a dragon.

191
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
But that's not...

192
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Your Highness.

193
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Your Highness.

194
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
General, it's about time.

195
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Cousin, I'll go too.

196
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Wait for me.

197
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Don't go so fast.

198
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
You see,

199
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
we've been waiting for an hour.

200
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Why is there no one?

201
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
Wait.

202
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Do you think

203
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
he'll regret it?

204
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Wait.

205
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
Wait for me.

206
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Who is this?

207
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Something's wrong. Let's go.

208
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Why are you here?

209
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
No, no, no.

210
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Why are you doing this?

211
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
Be careful.

212
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
Why did you kill Lu Yi?

213
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Brother,

214
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
I've said it many times.

215
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
We really don't know

216
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
what Lu Jia and Lu Yi are.

217
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
We just passed by.

218
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
When we passed by,

219
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
he was already dead.

220
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
You have ears

221
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
without eyes.

222
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Let me ask you one last time.

223
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
Did Nan Heng

224
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
order you to kill him and kill him?

225
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Don't be so agitated.

226
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
It's none of your business.

227
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
If you want to lie down,

228
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
do it now.

229
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
Don't pretend to be a big boss.

230
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Stop talking nonsense.

231
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
General,

232
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
these two people

233
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
are very close to Nan Heng.

234
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
They're still pretending to be confused.

235
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
I'm afraid they'll be

236
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
in the same boat with Shangguan He.

237
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
They'll be in the same boat with Shangguan He.

238
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
They're unwilling to testify for us.

239
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
Why don't you just kill them?

240
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
No.

241
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,800
We must keep them as witnesses.

242
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Behind the battle of Pingrong,

243
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
is the lives of 30% of the people

244
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
and 20,000 thousand soldiers.

245
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
This time,

246
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
I will not let Nan Heng go

247
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
easily like the south coast.

248
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
I'm not.

249
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
He wants us to

250
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
help you with false testimony, right?

251
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Are you dreaming?

252
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
20,000 thousand soldiers died.

253
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
You're the only one who can be a general.

254
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
You're really a bloodthirsty man.

255
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
What are you doing?

256
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
If you don't respect the soldiers,

257
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
you'll die.

258
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Let him go.

259
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
Let him go.

260
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
Use these people

261
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
to kill him with a good life.

262
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
I'll let them

263
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
explain everything

264
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
to Nan Heng

265
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
in the name of the Three Judicial Offices.

266
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
Cousin.

267
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Cousin.

268
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
What if A'Long and A'Hu didn't lie?

269
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
What if they really didn't know they were killed?

270
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
It doesn't matter who killed Lu Yi.

271
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
What matters is that I need a witness.

272
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Let His Majesty decide

273
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,800
that Nan Heng killed the descendant of the messenger

274
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
and planted this suspicious seed.

275
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
In this way,

276
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
His Majesty will believe

277
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
that all the crimes in the battle of Pingrong

278
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,800
were planned by Nan Heng.

279
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
So,

280
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
you have committed a cruel crime against them

281
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
and forced them to kill their wives.

282
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
The old case in Jiangnan three years ago

283
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
was instigated by a Shangguan He.

284
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
Now, A'Long and A'Hu are in my hands.

285
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
They are all in the same boat.

286
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,800
It's not impossible to instigate the old case in Pingrong.

287
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
Cousin.

288
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
You've changed.

289
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
You were not like this before.

290
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
You never

291
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
forced the public.

292
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
I was not a close relative

293
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
and was killed by Nan Heng

294
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
by my father and brother.

295
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Even so,

296
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
you can't become like Nan Heng.

297
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Let them stop first.

298
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
You've always been a person

299
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
who only knows to hide behind me

300
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
and only dare to say that you dare not to do it.

301
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
What right do you have to say that to me?

302
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
I...

303
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
I've prepared

304
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
the relevant documents for the battle of Pingrong.

305
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
I'll bring up the trial tomorrow.

306
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Cousin.

307
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Cousin.

308
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Now, Gao Xiang is dead.

309
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
Lu Yi is dead too.

310
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
The original letter of the old case

311
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
is even missing.

312
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
There are no evidence.

313
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
The criminal record is full of Nan Heng's people.

314
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Even if you re-examine it,

315
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
what difference can you make?

316
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
This requires Your Highness' help.

317
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,800
What do you need me to do?

318
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Your Highness only needs to tell the truth

319
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,800
after seeing Lu Yi.

320
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
His Majesty trusts Your Highness the most.

321
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
As long as you say it,

322
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
it's like having Lu Yi's signature.

323
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Plus the witness of A'long and A'hu

324
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,800
who killed Nan Heng.

325
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,800
It's enough to pay for the Pingrong case.

326
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
What?

327
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Your Highness doesn't want to?

328
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
I and the Qianyu Army

329
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
did everything

330
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
on the battlefield

331
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
or in the Jinzhao Prefecture

332
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
to pave the way for Your Highness.

333
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
I didn't expect you to be so cowardly

334
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
when the time comes.

335
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Cousin.

336
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
You're not right.

337
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
You killed on the battlefield

338
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
for the sake of the stability of our Jin.

339
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
You worked in the Jinzhao Prefecture

340
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
for the sake of the people's safety.

341
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
How can you say that it's all for me?

342
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Your Highness is different from the past.

343
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
You started to teach me

344
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
the world's good manners.

345
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Now you're here.

346
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
No.

347
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
You hate Nan Heng the most.

348
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Why did you do that

349
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
when you wanted to fight with him?

350
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
You're crazy.

351
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
No. I mean

352
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
you used Nan Heng's methods

353
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
to deal with Nan Heng.

354
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Then this victory...

355
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Did he really win?

356
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
When you take the throne in the future,

357
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
you'll know

358
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
how to win is not important.

359
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
In the Three Judicial Offices,

360
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
you came to deal with Nan Heng's fire.

361
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
You can continue to hide behind me

362
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
like you used to

363
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,800
and be a clean and pure prince.

364
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
But you're the only witness

365
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
who has ever seen Lu Yu.

366
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
You're the only hope I have.

367
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,800
If you don't want to testify for me,

368
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
then you don't need to

369
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,800
teach my cousin anymore.

370
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Cousin...

371
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
Let's go.

372
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Your Highness, please forgive me.

373
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
I'm sorry.

374
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
I'm sorry.

375
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Your Highness, please forgive me.

376
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Your Highness, please forgive me.

377
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Leave now.

378
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Yes.

379
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Oh my god.

380
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Ji Xiang.

381
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Do you think Cousin has changed?

382
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
He's become

383
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,800
very scary.

384
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
He wasn't like this before.

385
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
He's never been

386
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
so fierce to me since he was a child.

387
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
The most important thing is

388
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
he never

389
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
used violence without reason.

390
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
Why did he

391
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
become like this?

392
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Forget it.

393
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
You don't understand.

394
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
You all think

395
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,800
I'm a fool who doesn't know anything.

396
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,800
How could I understand

397
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
a case that my cousin doesn't understand?

398
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Your Highness,

399
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
you're the Prince,

400
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
not a fool.

401
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
Do whatever you want.

402
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,800
Ji Xiang,

403
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
thank you.

404
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
You're right.

405
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
I'm not like this.

406
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
I'm a man of the heavens.

407
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
I know.

408
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
He's my cousin.

409
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
I can't

410
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
see him jump into the fire pit.

411
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
He must be a man of the heavens.

412
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
I'm the son-in-law

413
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,800
of this man of the heavens.

414
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Let's go.

415
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
What are you doing?

416
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Hurry up.

417
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
It's your turn.

418
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Miss Song,

419
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
I promised you

420
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
too loudly.

421
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
You're the only lady

422
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,800
who can paint 73 paintings in three days.

423
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
I'm just a useless person.

424
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
I can't do anything.

425
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
I can't stand

426
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
the anger of six hours.

427
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
You know you're useless.

428
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Stop talking nonsense.

429
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
You're too old

430
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
to be a man of the heavens.

431
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
You're just a lazy man.

432
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Since you're in my mansion,

433
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
you should be careful.

434
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Hurry up.

435
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Ting,

436
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
I don't know...

437
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
Say it.

438
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Not everyone

439
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
has the willpower and determination

440
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
like you.

441
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
I don't care about others.

442
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
You have to.

443
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
I'm just a useless person.

444
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
I can't be a man of the heavens.

445
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
I'm practicing chess with you here.

446
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,800
What's the point?

447
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
What's the point?

448
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
It's meaningless now.

449
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
What about marriage in the future?

450
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
If a couple can't

451
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
stand against each other,

452
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,800
what's the point?

453
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Why are you thinking about this?

454
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
I'm a man of the heavens.

455
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Marriage is not...

456
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,800
Don't be too sure.

457
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
People will see each other

458
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
and get along with each other.

459
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
You've said it

460
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
when you met me.

461
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
Yin Zhu,

462
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
bring me my zither.

463
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Yes.

464
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,800
And the zither?

465
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Yes.

466
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Xiang Yan.

467
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
Xiang Yan.

468
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
Come here.

469
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Eat some melon.

470
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
Prime Minister,

471
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Lu Yi is dead.

472
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
The two of them

473
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
have been led to the scene

474
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,800
according to the plan.

475
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
Chu Gui Hong

476
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
is in the game now.

477
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,800
He will investigate it to the end.

478
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
But Prime Minister,

479
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
I don't think

480
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
you can kill the Crown Prince

481
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
with Chu Gui Hong's hand.

482
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Why don't you kill Song Jianyu

483
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
and let me kill him together?

484
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
He didn't talk much when he was a child.

485
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Every year,

486
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
when we were friends in the spring and summer,

487
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
I would always find an excuse

488
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
to take him back from the palace

489
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
and use the well water

490
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
to get him out of the palace.

491
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
But I don't think

492
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
I can do that.

493
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
I will use the well water

494
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
to make sweet melon for him.

495
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
He asked me a question.

496
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
He said,

497
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
if a man has a father,

498
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
he can have a mother.

499
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
If he has a son,

500
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
how can he have ten children?

501
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
He said,

502
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
if a man is old,

503
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
if he has a son,

504
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
he will have pity

505
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
for a sweet melon.

506
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
How can he have a son?

507
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
Sit.

508
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Yes.

509
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
Sit.

510
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
I understand now.

511
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,800
If you want him

512
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
to be the successor of the Jin State,

513
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
you need to get rid of Wen Tao and Wu Lue.

514
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,800
What's more important

515
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
is the heart.

516
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
The top of the spiritual cloud is lonely.

517
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,800
If there is no loyal and loyal person,

518
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,800
where can the lonely and lonely people be the ruler of the world?

519
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Everything I run

520
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
is for Heng'er.

521
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
It's also for Gao Jia.

522
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
It's also for the world.

523
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
Although I saved you,

524
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
but with our relationship,

525
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
at most,

526
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
we are just friends.

527
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
You said you knew A Ting

528
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
and came to me.

529
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
Is it not appropriate?

530
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
You are so strange.

531
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Have you seen

532
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
the chess game from dawn to dusk?

533
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Have you seen the hands

534
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
that are soaked in water

535
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
when playing the zither?

536
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
No matter how A Ting makes you suffer,

537
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
it's for your own good.

538
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
It's a side-by-side.

539
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
Besides,

540
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
she even pays you.

541
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
She pays for food, accommodation and study.

542
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Think about your big boy.

543
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
You are living a life

544
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
of living a life of food and accommodation.

545
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
You are living a life of living a life of living.

546
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Compare it.

547
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
You are content.

548
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,800
Content?

549
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Your sister is playing the zither

550
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
and not willing to work.

551
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Your boss is playing the zither and

552
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
fighting with the zither.

553
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Your sister is making 80 pieces of famous paintings a day.

554
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
She is even drawing a good brush.

555
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Your boss is reading

556
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
80 books at night.

557
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
He is even looking at the blind.

558
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
My boss is better than your sister.

559
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,800
He is the best in the world.

560
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
My sister is better than your boss.

561
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,800
Your boss is the best in the world.

562
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
It's a tie.

563
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
I am the best.

564
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
We just want to live a good life.

565
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
Why is it so hard?

566
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Who says it's not?

567
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
If I knew it,

568
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
I should have been a top student

569
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
in the fifth grade.

570
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
It's better than being in the hands of my sister today.

571
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
Then you should go.

572
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
You keep saying no.

573
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
But you keep staying in Song's Mansion.

574
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Don't tell me

575
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
you are doing this for my sister's salary.

576
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Do you think it's possible?

577
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
That's it.

578
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
You keep saying no.

579
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
But you never admit that you like her.

580
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
You are so interesting.

581
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Aunt,

582
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
it's all for you.

583
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
What do you mean?

584
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Look.

585
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
An assassination

586
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
has moved the entire Canjiang

587
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
to catch the assassin who came out of the Qing Dynasty.

588
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
The rich people are going to be bald.

589
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
The point is me.

590
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
I am a famous hero in the world.

591
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
I am a famous hero in the world.

592
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,800
I am a famous hero in the world.

593
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
Now I am a rich man.

594
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Now I am a rich man.

595
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,800
You mean

596
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Nan Heng asked you to come?

597
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
Of course.

598
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
Why is it always me

599
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
who is hurt by your love?

600
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Look.

601
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,800
You and I are both lazy.

602
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,800
We have no ambition.

603
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,800
What we want is a stable and free life.

604
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,800
But in this life,

605
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
if we can't meet

606
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
the people who are worth everything

607
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
and risk everything,

608
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,800
and we are just alive,

609
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
is that still alive?

610
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
But what if risk

611
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
will drag the family's life?

612
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,800
If I don't leave now,

613
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
then the next

614
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
is the three-man fight

615
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
on the wedding day.

616
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,800
Then I ask you.

617
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
Can you really

618
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
control your heart?

619
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
Nonsense.

620
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
The files recorded by the Ministry of War

621
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
are all in the case.

622
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
I can't let you go.

623
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
I can't let you go.

624
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
I can't let you go.

625
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,800
I can't let you go.

626
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
I can't let you go.

627
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
I can't let you go.

628
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,800
I can't let you go.

629
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
The files recorded by the Ministry of War

630
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
are all recorded by the doctor,

631
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
the deputy doctor and me.

632
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
Each of them is confirmed and recorded.

633
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
How can you change it

634
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
in three days and two nights?

635
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
What the security records

636
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
is just a one-sided word.

637
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Now I want to correct it.

638
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
Why can't I?

639
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
What you said

640
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
is to send letters after the marriage

641
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
and ask for help from the military.

642
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Except for you and your family,

643
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,800
no one can testify.

644
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Isn't this a one-sided word?

645
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,800
As a major official,

646
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
how can you make a public decision?

647
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
As a major official,

648
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
I have to give up

649
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
the position of the south-south

650
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
in the military?

651
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
You...

652
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
You are not related to Chu Xia.

653
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
You are not willing to

654
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
fight for my father

655
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,800
and my soul.

656
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,800
I only ask you

657
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,800
to give me all the files.

658
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,800
I will bear all the consequences.

659
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
You are talking nonsense.

660
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Stop.

661
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Stop it.

662
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Stop it.

663
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
Chu Gui Hou.

664
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
I told you to stop.

665
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,800
Didn't you hear me?

666
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,800
I...

667
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
Mu He.

668
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,800
You are going to help the south-south again.

669
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
I won't help anyone.

670
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
I just don't want to

671
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,800
let our Song family

672
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,800
get involved

673
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
in those stupid things.

674
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
I am not a good person.

675
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,800
But you have been

676
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
on his side for several times.

677
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Why are you against me?

678
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
Three months ago,

679
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,800
you encouraged me to revive.

680
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,800
You encouraged me to investigate the general's house.

681
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,800
You all supported me at that time.

682
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Why?

683
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Why do I just want to

684
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
reveal the truth

685
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
of the battle of Pinglong?

686
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,800
You want to kill

687
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
20,000 people in Nanheng.

688
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
You want to punish them.

689
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
But you don't want to help me.

690
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
What are you shouting for?

691
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,800
Chu Gui Hou.

692
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
20,000 soldiers have donated to the country.

693
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,800
It may be fate that killed them.

694
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
It may be war.

695
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,800
It may be that

696
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,800
you are the commander-in-chief.

697
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,800
But why is it only Nanheng?

698
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
You put all the blame

699
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,800
on him.

700
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,800
It's just because you want to escape responsibility.

701
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
It's not the truth you are talking about.

702
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Meng.

703
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
How can you say that?

704
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,800
What did I do wrong?

705
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,800
What did I do wrong?

706
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,800
Enough.

707
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
Meng.

708
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Don't argue with him.

709
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
No one can wake up

710
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
a person who pretends to sleep.

711
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Even the gods can't help him.

712
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
General Chu.

713
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,800
The Song family has no intention of fighting.

714
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
It's your turn to interfere

715
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
in the military affairs.

716
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
You go.

717
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
Go.

718
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,800
What do you mean?

719
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,800
Baili Cui.

720
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,800
This...

721
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
I'll send you off.

722
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,800
I have something to ask you.

723
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
Sit.

724
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
This...

725
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
That...

726
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Is it you who did the death of Gao Xiang?

727
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
Look at you.

728
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,800
You are always like this.

729
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,800
You are not.

730
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
Why do you answer me?

731
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,800
Is it that difficult?

732
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,800
The fire oil, thunder and fire bombs

733
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,800
are all common things in the army.

734
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
Such a despicable means

735
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,800
is like a burial for me.

736
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
You and Chu Guihong

737
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
are both people who investigate the case

738
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
and the person who burials.

739
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,800
I don't feel like talking to you.

740
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
What about Lu Yi?

741
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
Did you send someone to kill Lu Yi?

742
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
What Lu Yi?

743
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
That Lu Yi

744
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,800
that my cousin sent you

745
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,800
to send you the power.

746
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,800
How many times have I told you?

747
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,800
I've never received any letters of request.

748
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,800
That was all an excuse

749
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,800
that Chu Guihong found for his own failure.

750
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
How is that possible?

751
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
This is what Gao Xiang said to his cousin

752
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,800
before he died.

753
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
How can this be fake?

754
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
Aren't you two a team?

755
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,800
What did Gao Xiang say to Chu Guihong?

756
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
I didn't expect that you would

757
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
take the initiative to visit us

758
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
on such a day.

759
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,800
This is the fate of the world.

760
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
When we first met in the palace,

761
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
what kind of scenery

762
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
did you have in your hometown?

763
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
With the favor of His Majesty

764
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
to 18th Prince,

765
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
you are always in my way.

766
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,800
What a pity.

767
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,800
You are so ungrateful.

768
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
You tried so hard

769
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
to deal with our 7th Prince.

770
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
In the end,

771
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
the whole family was killed.

772
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
I've told you before.

773
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,800
The most important thing is to choose the right master.

774
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
With the favor of the past,

775
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,800
if you ask me now,

776
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,800
I might transfer you

777
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,800
to our mansion as a servant.

778
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,800
I'm sorry.

779
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,800
I'm sorry.

780
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,800
I'm sorry.

781
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,800
I'm sorry.

782
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,800
I'm sorry.

783
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
I'm sorry.

784
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
I'm sorry.

785
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,800
Are you talking to me?

786
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
I didn't say anything.

787
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
No, no, no.

788
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
Using my conflict with Chu Guihong,

789
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
we are in a tight relationship.

790
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,800
You really made a good move.

791
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,800
You mean

792
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,800
someone is scheming against you?

793
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,800
You came to my wedding today

794
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,800
just to ask these questions?

795
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Then I said,

796
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
you believed it?

797
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
I believed it.

798
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Actually, I came today

799
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
to ask you one more thing.

800
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
Go ahead.

801
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,800
Well...

802
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Well...

803
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
Can you

804
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
put aside

805
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
the crime of the battle of Pingrong?

806
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,800
I...

807
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,800
Don't scold me now.

808
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
I know it's rude to ask me.

809
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
But in order to get you out of trouble,

810
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
my cousin has already

811
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
gone too far.

812
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,800
He was played by

813
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,800
the person behind the scenes.

814
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
If it goes on like this,

815
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,800
something big will happen.

816
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
What does it have to do with me?

817
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
How can it be?

818
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Qi,

819
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,800
as long as you admit the crime,

820
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,800
don't let cousin be obsessed with it.

821
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,800
Now,

822
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,800
I'll

823
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
transfer the title to you right now.

824
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
What do you think?

825
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,280
Didn't she detest you

826
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,800
that you firm your loyalty to him?

827
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,800
She truly cares about him.

828
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,400
Of course.

829
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
I'm a man like that.

830
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,800
I should protect her.

831
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,040
Qi...

832
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,800
I can tell my struggles

833
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
in front of Fuhua.

834
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,800
I won't go back on my word.

835
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,800
Hey...

836
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,800
Qi, listen to me.

837
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,800
Listen.

838
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,300
In this way...

839
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,860
What kind of person you hurt in the battle of Pingrong

840
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,540
There won't be any consequences

841
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,620
Do you know what you are talking about

842
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,900
I know, I know

843
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,140
This old Jun

844
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,100
For the sake of us two

845
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,820
Just this once, okay

846
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,060
I beg you, can't I

847
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,620
Didn't you say you were just a brother

848
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,020
Nanrui

849
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,100
Do you know what it is

850
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,460
What is called a new book

851
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,060
I

852
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,020
I know I'm stupid

853
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,820
But now

854
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,660
He should know the fool

855
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,740
The emperor is an outsider

856
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,140
Brother is a reason

857
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,460
I know I can't get over you

858
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,060
But it doesn't matter if the emperor is gone

859
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,260
If my cousin is gone

860
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,460
Then I really have nothing

861
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,700
I think you need to wait in the office

862
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,540
TheDie

863
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,540
You've Benz

864
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,420
An eye for an eye

865
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,780
H time

866
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,980
Your person

867
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,140
An eye for a person

868
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,820
For Luaire

869
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:52,780
Sorry

870
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,700
It's gone.

871
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,500
Let's take 18th prince to her.

872
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,540
Seriously?

873
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,540
18th prince, way to go.

874
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,260
So the three- RED soldiers

875
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,980
will be in such a big battle.

876
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,340
Your Highness was the prince's son.

877
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,620
The battle of Pingrong

878
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,900
involved the death of 20,000 soldiers.

879
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,820
It must be handled by the Ministry of Justice,

880
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,660
the Court of Judicial Review and the Imperial Censorate.

881
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,940
It's a good chance to get a promotion.

882
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,220
The words of the Ministry of Justice

883
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,420
are from someone from Nanheng, right?

884
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,220
Not only that.

885
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,780
The Imperial Censorate and the Court of Judicial Review

886
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,620
have many officials.

887
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,180
And Gao Xiang has been controlling

888
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,780
the civil officials in the court for years.

889
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,940
I remember it now.

890
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,780
Yao Qian from the Imperial Censorate

891
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,580
is also from Nanheng.

892
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,380
Now that Gao Xiang is dead,

893
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,100
all these forces

894
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,540
will be in the hands of the Seventh Prince.

895
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,540
So Chu Guihong

896
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,740
will have to work hard on the war record.

897
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,100
It's a sizable zone.

898
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,340
At the same time,

899
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:31,500
there will be a unit that assesses 나쁜案

900
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,180
as well as comfort州

901
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,540
in the military police.

902
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,900
Now...

903
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,540
Father,

904
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,980
Miss Nanheng can take

905
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,540
all these things

906
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,180
into consideration, don't you think?

907
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,320
should our Four BEA continue to do so?

908
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,080
Now, Seventh Prince faced

909
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,960
what's called darkness

910
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,680
and the solution to所以呢.

911
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,740
I'm sorry.

912
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,740
I'm sorry.

913
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,740
I'm sorry.

914
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,740
I'm sorry.

915
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,740
I'm sorry.

916
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,740
I'm sorry.

917
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,740
I'm sorry.

918
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,740
I'm sorry.

919
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,740
I'm sorry.

920
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,740
I'm sorry.

921
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,740
I'm sorry.

922
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,740
I'm sorry.

923
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,740
I'm sorry.

924
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,740
I'm sorry.

925
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,740
I'm sorry.

926
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,740
I'm sorry.

927
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,740
I'm sorry.

928
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,740
I'm sorry.

929
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,740
I'm sorry.

930
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,740
I'm sorry.

931
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,740
I'm sorry.

932
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,740
I'm sorry.

933
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,740
I'm sorry.

934
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,740
I'm sorry.

935
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,740
I'm sorry.

936
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,740
I'm sorry.

937
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,740
I'm sorry.

938
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,740
I'm sorry.

939
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,740
I'm sorry.

940
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,740
I'm sorry.

941
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,740
I'm sorry.

942
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,740
I'm sorry.

943
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,740
I'm sorry.

944
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,740
I'm sorry.

945
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,740
I'm sorry.

946
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,740
I'm sorry.

947
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,740
I'm sorry.

948
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,740
I'm sorry.

949
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,740
I'm sorry.

950
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,740
