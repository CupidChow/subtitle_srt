1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sword is heavy.

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the deep roots of the enemy.

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,800
It's not as good as the dust.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am a beast.

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
I am a beast.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
I am a beast.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
I am a beast.

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
I am a beast.

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
I am a beast.

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
I am a beast.

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,800
I will be a hero forever.

13
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,580
The

14
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,580
The

15
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,580
The

16
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,580
The

17
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,580
The

18
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,580
The

19
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,580
The

20
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,580
The

21
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,580
The

22
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,580
The

23
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,580
The

24
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,580
The

25
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,580
The

26
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,320
The

27
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,320
The

28
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:15,320
The

29
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,320
The

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
The

31
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,580
Brothers, I'm going to drink the Meng Po Soup at the River of Pity.

32
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,580
What are you doing?

33
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,580
I'm tired of living!

34
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,580
Guys, have you forgotten the rules of Night God?

35
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,580
We drink the same wine and eat the same meat.

36
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,580
If you want to drink the Meng Po Soup, you have to invite your brothers.

37
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,580
That's right!

38
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,580
General Chu, you're not a good person.

39
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,580
Look carefully.

40
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,580
I have a group of brothers who are not afraid of death.

41
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,580
I'm afraid you can't handle it.

42
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,580
Lord Qianyu, listen to my order!

43
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,580
Night God dares to attack the execution ground.

44
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,580
Then I'll kill one of them!

45
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,580
Who dares to do that?

46
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,580
Xun's army, stop them!

47
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,580
Wait!

48
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,580
Meng, why are you here?

49
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,580
This is the execution ground, not where you should come.

50
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,580
If we don't come, we won't have a big ending today.

51
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,580
I haven't even opened my house and my gift.

52
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,580
Didn't Lord Chu say that Shangguan He is the thief of the Jiangnan theft case?

53
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,580
Then I dare to ask about the case three years ago.

54
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,580
Did Lord Chu investigate the case?

55
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,580
Do you know why Lord Bai He stole the money from the government?

56
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,580
I took over the case.

57
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,580
All the files that were stored in the central office were destroyed.

58
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,580
Only the record of the case that the Ministry of Justice set

59
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,580
is hard to track.

60
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,580
That means there's no investigation.

61
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,580
I didn't expect Lord Chu to be so upright.

62
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,580
He's actually a thief who has no conscience.

63
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,580
What nonsense are you talking about?

64
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,580
How can you be so low-key?

65
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,580
Low-key?

66
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,580
Last night, I went to find A'Long and A'Hu with Sister Zhang.

67
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:34,580
It took only one night to find out what Shangguan He was like three years ago.

68
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,580
There are thousands of ways to find out the truth in the Qianyu Army investigation.

69
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,580
But you only know how to make a crime and search for the truth.

70
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,580
How can you find the truth if you're so low-key?

71
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,580
How dare you!

72
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,580
What are you doing?

73
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,580
Do you want to do something to women in front of the people of the capital?

74
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,580
Shut up!

75
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,580
You're also talking like a good girl.

76
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,580
You're hiding the truth for your brothers and preventing them from doing something.

77
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,580
People like you, even if you're exempt from death,

78
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,580
you have to be beaten a hundred times.

79
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,580
Listen.

80
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,580
Lord Chu, please look carefully.

81
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,580
This is a letter of consent.

82
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,580
There are over 800 people signed on it.

83
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,580
They are the people of Jiangnan who were rescued by Shangguan He three years ago.

84
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,580
They are willing to go to the capital and turn the situation into a dark and white.

85
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,580
Don't let their benefactors die in the name of injustice.

86
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,580
What happened that year?

87
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:48,580
I'm afraid we need to ask Seventh Prince or Lord Gao about the details.

88
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,580
I'll definitely have him as my bodyguard.

89
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,580
That's also important, but I want the simple truth of this matter.

90
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,580
This is the last thing they'll have to tell me.

91
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,580
Okay.

92
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,580
peanuts

93
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,580
I'll talk to you later.

94
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,580
I don't know if there are any durian dishes.

95
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,580
Tabasco

96
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,700
to investigate the case of the corpse.

97
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,260
Seventh Prince was a man of the heart.

98
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,060
When he learned of this case,

99
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,180
he asked Shang Guan He to come back.

100
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,300
The hero who saw the dead father and the dead father

101
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,380
became a criminal.

102
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,060
The people pleaded for him.

103
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,580
But the governor

104
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,300
was accused by the court.

105
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,620
That's it.

106
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,940
Shang Guan He was put into the prison in Jiangnan.

107
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,780
This token

108
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,300
was found by Ye You Shen last night

109
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,420
in the governor's mansion.

110
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,500
There's a shadow on it.

111
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,580
The governor of Jiangnan

112
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,980
was a high-ranking official.

113
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,060
If the corruption and disaster relief

114
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,660
were also the high-ranking official's benefits,

115
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,620
then after releasing Shang Guan He,

116
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,860
it was the helpless action of Seventh Prince.

117
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,300
Nonsense.

118
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,180
Don't call me that.

119
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,380
Chu Gui Hong.

120
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,780
You should really investigate

121
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,420
the Gao family and the Gao family.

122
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,740
You shouldn't keep

123
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,260
hanging on to Shang Guan He and Ye You Shen.

124
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,740
You've been fighting with the Black Armor Army

125
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,900
for your own personal gain.

126
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,060
If you do this,

127
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,180
the whole court will be in chaos.

128
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,580
I personally investigated

129
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,540
the case in Jiangnan.

130
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,780
Today, I also personally executed the case.

131
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,140
If we don't investigate the various sources,

132
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,620
I'm afraid we can't explain it to the people.

133
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,740
But now,

134
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,380
if we continue to make trouble,

135
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,500
we can't stop it.

136
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,100
So, General Chu,

137
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,780
I suggest

138
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,780
we first arrest all the people who did this.

139
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,660
After reporting to His Majesty

140
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,860
and finding out the truth,

141
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,220
we can make a decision.

142
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,020
What do you think?

143
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,500
Let me explain, Song Yi Mo.

144
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,300
I'm not the one you should explain.

145
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,540
It's those Ye You Shen who trusted you.

146
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,820
Until the night before the execution,

147
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,700
they were still defending you.

148
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,740
Hu said

149
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,980
you must have your own difficulties.

150
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,580
He also said you once saved their lives.

151
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,340
You saved their lives.

152
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,020
You saved their lives.

153
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,580
You saved their lives.

154
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,100
You saved their lives.

155
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,860
You saved their lives.

156
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,580
He also said you once saved their lives.

157
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,580
No matter who you are,

158
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,620
you will always be their boss.

159
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,140
You treat others' sincerity as a grass.

160
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,980
You like

161
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,300
this kind of feeling, right?

162
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,940
I'm really sorry for them.

163
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,940
The old case three years ago,

164
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,540
Chu Gui Hong may not know it.

165
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,060
His Majesty may not know it.

166
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,180
But you?

167
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,580
Do you dare to say you don't know it?

168
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,020
I know it all.

169
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,420
I'd rather let Ye You Shen get into danger.

170
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,180
I've never thought about

171
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,940
bringing the High-Level Immortal to justice

172
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,980
or even hand him over to His Majesty.

173
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,340
Chu Gui Hong said you were wild and ambitious.

174
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,340
He said you were ready to be killed.

175
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,500
Did I say anything wrong?

176
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,060
You've made me believe you so many times.

177
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,580
What do I believe in?

178
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,380
Ye You Shen has many people

179
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,420
who are victims of Gao Chang Yin's crime.

180
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,300
And you

181
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,660
are the Seventh Prince

182
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,180
who hurt those innocent people

183
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,420
while making Li Shiliu

184
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,620
to make up for his mistakes.

185
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,060
Do you know

186
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,780
that's called hypocrisy?

187
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,460
I just don't want them to be left behind.

188
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,500
I can let them...

189
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,260
Stop talking.

190
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,540
Then

191
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,900
you can be the Seventh Prince

192
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,100
of your High-Level Immortal.

193
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,740
At least in my heart,

194
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,540
I want to remember

195
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,100
that righteous and kind Hero Li.

196
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,320
Not so

197
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,500
from those lurking vile people.

198
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
Get rid of those target-pe woolsewers

199
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,320
Take them all back to the prison of the capital

200
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,120
Yes

201
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,360
It was clearly the Seventh Prince

202
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,120
who asked the order to keep us under control

203
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,840
We should be in his hands

204
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,040
You are the elder brother

205
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,280
What are you talking about

206
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,040
Okay, okay

207
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,800
Listen to me

208
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,840
We are all familiar with each other

209
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
Don't be so arrogant

210
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,560
Otherwise

211
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,920
A dying man

212
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,560
Why are you standing here and talking

213
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,600
You think you can stop us

214
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,060
by standing here

215
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,260
There is no reason to do it

216
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,580
You should try

217
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,380
Wait

218
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,340
You go back with Rong Hua first

219
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,900
Go to Zhenzhao Mansion

220
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,340
Your Highness

221
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,100
What do you want to do

222
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,340
It's time to get everything back to normal

223
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,700
Song Yunmeng is right

224
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,380
I shouldn't treat other people's sincerity as grass

225
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,020
Ye You Shen

226
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,020
You are upright and upright

227
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,620
You should walk under the sun

228
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,340
I'm the one who got you involved

229
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,140
Why do you say that

230
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,220
What do you want to do

231
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,580
Go back and tell Chu Guihong

232
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,580
From the beginning to the end

233
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,100
He only wants to deal with Gu Yiren

234
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,100
If you want to fight with me

235
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,180
Then on the court

236
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,780
The real knife and real gun will be solved

237
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,780
Today my brothers go back with you

238
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,580
But if they drop a hair

239
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,820
I will make Chu Guihong

240
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,660
Double the reward

241
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,020
Yes, Your Highness

242
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,900
Take them away

243
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,220
Yes

244
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,060
Go

245
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,260
Your Highness

246
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,220
Chu Guihong has gone to the palace

247
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,940
He will definitely report to the imperial wall

248
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,300
Should we hurry up

249
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,700
Don't worry

250
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
You go and arrange something for me

251
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,640
He said

252
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,160
You must have your difficulties

253
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,760
Boss, I know

254
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,280
No matter who you are

255
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
You will always be their boss

256
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
Ye You Shen

257
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,760
Without a boss

258
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
Not a family

259
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,800
The same life and death

260
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,400
Is brotherhood

261
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,400
Ye You Shen is here

262
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Welcome back

263
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,380
Don't blame me, Your Highness

264
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,380
After drinking this wine

265
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,380
I will be atone for my sins

266
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,380
While sitting on the seven-star armor

267
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,380
To hurt those innocent people

268
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,380
While sitting on Li Shiliu

269
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,380
To make up for my mistakes

270
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,380
Do you know

271
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,380
You are called false

272
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,380
At least in my heart

273
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,380
I just want to remember that

274
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,380
Good and righteous Li Daxia

275
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,380
Not like you

276
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,360
Because of the villain

277
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,360
It's not a pity

278
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Su

279
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
Su

280
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,360
I heard

281
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Gao's family was investigated yesterday

282
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,360
Qianyu Jun

283
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,360
In the prime minister's mansion

284
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
In the middle of the night

285
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
This morning

286
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
The streets were all closed

287
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,360
You said this emperor

288
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,360
Is there any big movement

289
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Don't be so suspicious

290
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
What's the movement

291
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
You'll know when you go in

292
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
You are not natural

293
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
I am the minister of the Ministry of Justice

294
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,340
Back then

295
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,340
Jiangnan's theft case

296
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,340
It was my ministry of justice that changed the conclusion

297
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,340
The imperial government is going to start a fight

298
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,340
The first one to cut me

299
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,340
Lao Su

300
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,340
We are both in the same department

301
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,340
You have to help me

302
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,340
Your ministry of justice is back and forth to handle your case

303
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,340
You have nothing to do with Gao's family

304
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,340
If you love it, you love it

305
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,340
And

306
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,340
Much more in the same department

307
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,340
Not the same door

308
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,340
Not familiar

309
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,340
Don't disturb

310
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,340
Minister Wang

311
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,340
The problem is already involved

312
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,340
Lao Su

313
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,340
Lao Qi

314
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,340
Lao Qi

315
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,340
Do you want the officials of the whole court

316
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,340
Wait for him alone

317
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,340
I didn't expect

318
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,340
A case in Jiangnan

319
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,340
It's so involved

320
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,340
So many party members

321
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,340
Lao Qi set up a case

322
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,340
But it's not coming

323
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,340
I'm afraid it's clear

324
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,340
Father wants to ask for punishment

325
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,340
Flee for crime

326
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,340
So I beg you

327
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,340
Immediately order

328
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,340
Check the property of all officials in the Gao family

329
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,340
Let the cousin take them all to the prison in Jingzhao Prefecture

330
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,340
And the command of the Black Armor Army

331
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,340
Should be handed over immediately from Nan Heng

332
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,340
Song Yu De

333
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,340
What do you think of the Rui Er's proposal?

334
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,340
Reply to the emperor

335
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,340
This Black Armor Army

336
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,340
It was never handed over by the seventh prince

337
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,340
But I think

338
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,340
The world's military power

339
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,340
Should be in the hands of the emperor

340
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,340
But suddenly want to get out

341
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,340
There must be a fair and smooth turn

342
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,340
I said Song Da Ren

343
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,340
In a short time

344
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,340
The case of Jiangnan under Gao Xiang

345
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,340
I heard it all over the capital

346
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,340
Eighteenth Prince

347
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,340
Rumors spread in the room

348
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,340
About the rumor

349
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,340
Obtaining witness or false evidence

350
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,340
After the local institutions check clearly

351
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,340
Report to the main level

352
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,340
Three thoughts will be re-invented

353
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,340
To set the crime

354
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,340
Can be sentenced

355
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,340
The old case is restarted

356
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,340
In case of a mess

357
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,340
What if the seventh prince takes a step?

358
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,340
Your Majesty

359
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,340
Yesterday on the execution ground

360
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,340
Everything is clear

361
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,340
The seventh prince Nan Heng

362
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,340
Not only the head of the Gao family

363
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,340
Hold heavy troops

364
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,340
Even have the night travel god

365
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,340
The world's power

366
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,340
If you don't act

367
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,340
The army will be changed sooner or later

368
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,340
Yes

369
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,340
Can't we protect it?

370
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,340
Your Majesty

371
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,340
I agree with General Chu's words

372
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,340
I agree

373
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,340
I agree

374
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,340
I agree

375
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,340
I don't know

376
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,340
The whole court is civil and martial arts

377
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,340
How dare you be so scared of me

378
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,340
Your Majesty

379
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,340
No, you dare to come

380
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,340
This paper is outside the hall

381
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,340
Quickly take this unauthorized private

382
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,340
Take down the person who covered the high-ranking

383
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,340
Your Majesty

384
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,340
This paper

385
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,340
Recorded the witness of the old case in Jiangnan

386
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,340
The person who set the case was investigated by me

387
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,340
Other people

388
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,340
After the investigation of Minister Yan

389
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,340
You can be sentenced to arrest

390
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,340
Bring it up

391
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,340
The evidence of the old case in Jiangnan has been destroyed

392
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,340
Where did you get it?

393
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,340
Three years ago

394
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,340
It was my own trial

395
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,340
Naturally left to the family

396
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,340
So three batches of grain live

397
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,340
Day and night

398
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,340
Take it back in person

399
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,340
You

400
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,340
You are a guilty person

401
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,340
I didn't do anything in it

402
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,340
If General Chu has doubts

403
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,340
You can follow Minister Yan to investigate together

404
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,340
Instead of talking about injustice

405
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,340
A pain

406
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,340
I don't pay attention to this

407
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,340
You

408
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,340
Old seven

409
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,340
According to what you see

410
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,340
What Gao Changying did in this case

411
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,340
How to judge

412
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,340
Reply to the emperor

413
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,340
Gao Changying's corruption

414
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,340
2000 jin of the debt

415
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,340
The crime is true

416
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,340
Although the money was returned back

417
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,340
But according to the law of the Great Jin

418
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,340
Should disobey the order of his country

419
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,340
Leave a thousand miles

420
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,340
Don't let go

421
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,340
This seven-thousand-year-old personally sent Gao Xiang to the flow

422
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,340
Isn't that a knife and a piece of clothing?

423
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,340
Yes

424
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,340
Seven-thousand-year-old good means

425
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,340
Want to use a Gao Changying

426
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,340
To stop the people

427
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,340
General Chu is wrong

428
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,340
Your Majesty

429
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,340
If it weren't for my indulgence

430
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,340
Gao Changying wouldn't have committed today's mistake

431
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,340
So I came today

432
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,340
Not only to give Gao Changying a crime

433
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,340
I also have to confess to His Majesty in person

434
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,340
Only the crime of covering up Gao Changying

435
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,340
Nothing else

436
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,340
For example

437
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,340
Hiding Shang Guanhe and Ye Youshen

438
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,340
Shang Guanhe and Ye Youshen

439
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,340
Collude as concubines

440
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,340
Your Majesty

441
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,340
I saw the Cangjiang Yue personally

442
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,340
I am also the master of Cangjiang Yue

443
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,340
Li Shiliu

444
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,340
I'm not good at surveillance

445
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,340
Ten people are not clear

446
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,340
Should be punished by twenty

447
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,340
Change the people in the martial arts world to deceive the public

448
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,340
Add twenty

449
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:57,100
Zongrong

450
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,100
Don't want to be privileged

451
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,100
Not respected

452
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,100
Only use the power of the Black Armor Army

453
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,100
Protect the world

454
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,100
Long-lasting peace

455
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,100
Since then

456
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,100
What is the difference between the prince and the common people?

457
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,100
This is to completely withdraw from the battle of Chuwei

458
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,100
Gao Xiang is in trouble

459
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,100
The prince is self-conscious

460
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,100
This is a dead end

461
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,100
Your Majesty

462
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,100
Seven-thousand-year-old wants all the crimes to be taken alone

463
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,100
Your Majesty

464
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,100
I think the law should be done in secret

465
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,100
Not the heart

466
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,100
The old case in Jiangnan

467
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,100
The one who made the mistake was Gao Changyuan

468
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,100
Not the seven-thousand-year-old

469
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,100
Not to mention

470
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,100
The dead end that was killed yesterday

471
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,100
Also misjudged

472
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,100
If it's not the seven-thousand-year-old's benevolence

473
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,100
It won't keep him alive for three years

474
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,100
As for this Cangjiang Yue

475
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,100
Although independent from the court

476
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,100
But what has been going on for many years

477
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,100
It's all the people's action

478
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,100
Nothing wrong

479
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,100
Yuan Yi

480
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,100
According to the Qin Ministry's law

481
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,100
How should this be punished?

482
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,100
What do you think he did?

483
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
Tell me the truth

484
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,100
Your Majesty

485
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,100
As the paper says, it's all true

486
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,100
It's really according to what you said

487
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,100
Since the seven princes want to serve the country

488
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,100
To serve his uncle

489
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,100
To serve the people around him

490
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
Then I will help you

491
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,100
Go to the border of the great capital to travel sixty

492
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,100
Take your position of king

493
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,100
And half a line of blood

494
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,100
Thank you, Your Majesty

495
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:43,100
No

496
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,100
All the crimes he committed

497
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,100
are worth it

498
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,100
Just to get rid of those

499
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,100
who are hiding in the underworld

500
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,100
he committed suicide

501
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,100
I didn't expect

502
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,100
that Shen Wusheng was so cruel to him

503
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,100
A person who has been

504
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,100
climbing up the mountain since he was young

505
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,100
What kind of

506
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,100
heartless and heartless person is he?

507
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,100
What a pity

508
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,100
What a pity

509
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,100
Those tender and tender-hearted people

510
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,100
in the world

511
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,100
are just a chess piece

512
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
that can be used to plot with him

513
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,100
He is as childish as a child

514
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,100
and as shy as a moth

515
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,100
So I

516
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,100
beg you

517
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,100
to let Xiao Meng go

518
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,100
What I did before

519
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,100
was all for self-preservation

520
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,100
But in the future

521
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,100
I will let him go

522
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,100
and I want to be his

523
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,100
love-hate relationship

524
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,100
I promise you

525
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,100
I will use all my strength

526
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,100
to protect him

527
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,100
I am not good at monitoring

528
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,100
and I don't know people

529
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,100
I will let people in the underworld

530
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,100
to cheat and report

531
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,100
I will let people in the underworld

532
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,100
to cheat and report

533
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,100
I am willing to

534
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,100
put the throne on my body

535
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,100
extend my wings

536
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,100
beyond the boundaries

537
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:25,940
lay the

538
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,100
illustrations behind my back

539
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,700
reach at the top of my accessible

540
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,700
amosy

541
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:42,700
even if I didn't love you in the first place.

542
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,280
Xin Xiao?

543
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,880
YouDonald strongest.

544
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,560
Otherwise!

545
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,360
Old man.

546
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,440
If I am pale entenderithim what can I say about overlaying power

547
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,120
but rather saying continuously,

548
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,040
my wish

549
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:05,260
is to solve my enemies's real issues nasty dark night,

550
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,060
except for Solitude and unavoidable suffering the suffering of the world.

551
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,900
Lord Song,

552
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,300
it was Lord Song

553
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,060
who gave me a heads up

554
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,140
to investigate the case of Jiang Yue

555
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,340
and Ye You Shen.

556
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,300
Now it's clear.

557
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,660
Why are you

558
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,980
standing on Nan Heng's side?

559
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,820
Xian Zhi, you misunderstood.

560
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,460
What I said today

561
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,540
is just that I don't want a chaos.

562
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,300
I have no intention to be biased.

563
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,500
I've been close to Mo'er since childhood.

564
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,500
I have always regarded you as my father.

565
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,340
I don't understand

566
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,500
why you and Mo'er...

567
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,940
Why you and Mo'er have changed?

568
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,060
What did I do wrong?

569
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,780
Since we've come to this,

570
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,780
I want to ask you this.

571
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,220
You made a great effort

572
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,820
to investigate the case of the execution ground.

573
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,620
Have you ever thought about

574
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,460
involving Xiaomeng in it?

575
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,260
I know that you and Mo'er

576
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,740
will Bend over

577
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,100
if you are nac來說.

578
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,460
But Princess Qi

579
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,460
has Itís been one day

580
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,660
since she started investigating

581
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,340
the case in Jiangnan.

582
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,180
She also says

583
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,540
the crime of making cause an uproar

584
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,020
was done by herself.

585
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,420
She would be protecting Ye You Shen

586
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,100
when usaing CFB

587
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,860
to preserve the reputation

588
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,060
of my daughter's family.

589
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:33,900
They've committed such crimes

590
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,140
that they didn't help the figure to be revealed.

591
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,220
You know why?

592
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,080
I want to know

593
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,460
is it true that

594
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,640
their decoration

595
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,200
is different fromutil

596
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,000
bullion

597
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,600
here

598
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,200
in the first place

599
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,080
What and who

600
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,560
Duoluo

601
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,160
Why is ship

602
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,620
broken

603
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,160
I hear

604
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,400
Isteded

605
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,080
Lets go

606
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,100
I'm sorry.

607
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,180
I was careless today.

608
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,740
But as long as I take Nan Heng away,

609
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,500
I won't let anyone

610
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,500
harm Meng.

611
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,220
Then I'll marry her.

612
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,340
I'll get all her life back

613
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,740
for her.

614
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,060
Xian Zhi.

615
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,980
Love is not something you can force.

616
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,420
Xiaomeng has made her choice.

617
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,980
It's time for you to let go.

618
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,780
But she and Nan Heng have already retired.

619
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,180
Why can't I fight for it?

620
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,580
I understand

621
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,380
your helplessness.

622
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,900
But all of this

623
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,300
will be over

624
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,460
when you and Xiaomeng get married.

625
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,180
I beg you to let Xiaomeng go.

626
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,940
Let yourself go, too.

627
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,260
According to the script,

628
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,540
all the scenes will be played.

629
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,980
The three of them will be in the ring on the wedding day.

630
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,780
What should we do now?

631
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,460
It's not just a mistake.

632
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,140
I also want to make a mistake

633
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,420
and make the family suffer.

634
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,940
Jumping into the tower is the classic two-way thing.

635
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,380
In the cold air,

636
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,740
I'm made into a paper.

637
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,540
And the Song family is killed by Nan Heng.

638
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,380
Since I came to this world,

639
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,580
I've been doing

640
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,300
the right thing.

641
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,300
But what I saw and heard

642
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,140
must be the so-called truth.

643
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,220
You approached me

644
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,420
just for the sake of the Song family.

645
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,180
So you mean

646
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,420
I should let you die?

647
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,420
That's right.

648
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:21,900
Okay.

649
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,460
If there's a next time,

650
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,060
I'll let you die.

651
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,780
I'm the only one who made all the mistakes.

652
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,060
It has nothing to do with Miss Song.

653
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,820
Don't touch me, Your Highness!

654
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,100
You go to the water.

655
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,460
If you dare to wake me up again,

656
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,340
I'll kill you.

657
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,420
I'll say it again.

658
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,300
Song Yimeng

659
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,580
is the princess consort who I've been waiting for.

660
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,500
She's the one who offended him.

661
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,700
I'll let you die.

662
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,060
You can try it.

663
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:07,980
Paper.

664
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,500
And that...

665
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,820
A paper.

666
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,100
But I want to tell you.

667
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,980
I'm a man who's on fire.

668
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,460
I'll stand here.

669
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,340
I'll stand here.

670
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,540
You choose to die.

671
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,220
You believe

672
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,700
that you can't even break a paper?

673
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,460
That's right.

674
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,060
I don't believe you.

675
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,780
Not only this time,

676
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,180
from now on,

677
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,180
I won't be able to live with you.

678
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,380
I believe you.

679
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,180
I'm telling you, Ban Nuanhe.

680
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,980
I approached you from the beginning

681
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,780
just to kill you.

682
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,180
I found the knife to kill you.

683
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,780
I went to the temple to kill you.

684
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,580
I got engaged to kill you.

685
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,180
So many delicious dishes today.

686
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,980
Here comes the soup.

687
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,180
Okay.

688
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,180
The dishes are ready.

689
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,180
Let's eat.

690
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,980
Who's celebrating today?

691
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,980
Who said only those who celebrate can meet?

692
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,980
I just think

693
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,780
that from the moment I came here,

694
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,380
I've been waiting for you.

695
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,780
I've been waiting for you.

696
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,980
I've been waiting for you.

697
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,780
From the moment I came here,

698
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,780
I haven't had a good meal with you.

699
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,580
I used to think that my father

700
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,780
was an old man who shot a gun.

701
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,180
Ting

702
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,980
is a white lotus without dust.

703
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,180
As for my wife,

704
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,580
she's a bad person.

705
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,580
I said, Song Yimeng, don't go too far.

706
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,980
You little girl.

707
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,180
But after getting along with you,

708
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,180
I found out

709
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,780
what family means.

710
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,780
My father is busy with official affairs,

711
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,980
but he always secretly

712
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,580
prepared some life-saving cakes for me.

713
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,180
Ting is handsome and persistent.

714
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,380
He always protects me in front of outsiders.

715
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,980
My wife...

716
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,380
Although my wife and I are not that close,

717
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,180
but

718
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,180
if my mother were still alive,

719
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,180
she might miss me

720
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,180
just like you miss Ting.

721
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,580
All right, stop being so nosy.

722
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,980
Let's talk about these things

723
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,180
after the wedding.

724
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,980
Did you invite us here to eat

725
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,380
or to listen to your poem?

726
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,180
Yes, yes, yes.

727
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,580
Let's eat.

728
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,580
Let's eat.

729
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,580
Let's eat.

730
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,580
Come, father.

731
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,180
Come, father.

732
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,180
Braised pork.

733
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,780
This chicken leg is big.

734
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,380
Yimeng, this is for you.

735
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,180
Thank you, madam.

736
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,780
Let's have a drink.

737
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,980
Come, come, come.

738
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,580
Cheers.

739
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,780
Madam, I'll give you a bowl of soup.

740
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,180
Let's eat.

741
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,380
I just smelled this soup.

742
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,380
Come.

743
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,580
Good.

744
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,180
Good.

745
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,180
Come, Ting.

746
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,180
You try it too.

747
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,180
A bowl of soup.

748
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,180
It's not the time to wait.

749
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,580
All right, father.

750
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,980
Actually, it's okay to wait.

751
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,580
After all, my wife

752
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,380
has lost her brother Gao Changyin.

753
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,180
Whether it's literary skills or martial arts,

754
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,380
or the treatment in the court,

755
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,580
it's hard to match with my son.

756
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,980
You're talking nonsense again.

757
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,380
Your Highness, don't be satisfied.

758
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,580
This matter is serious.

759
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,180
It needs to be discussed.

760
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,580
Your Majesty,

761
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,980
the Black Armor Army has 20,000 soldiers at the border.

762
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,980
In addition, the masters of Ye Youshen,

763
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,180
the strength of Nan Heng and the other parties

764
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,380
cannot be underestimated.

765
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,980
If Your Majesty wants to prevent harm to Wei Ren,

766
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,980
you need to give him the military power.

767
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,380
The Gao family's strength

768
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,380
is at the bottom of the court.

769
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,180
Even if this time

770
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,780
Gao Changyin is eliminated,

771
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,780
the other students will still support Lao Qi.

772
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,980
You've all seen it in court.

773
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,780
There are many people

774
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,980
who favor him in the civil and military officials.

775
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,180
If he gives up his military power,

776
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,380
the court will definitely change.

777
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,180
I think

778
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,580
Song Yu De is right.

779
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,980
We need a reason to be fair and just.

780
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:19,980
Yes.

781
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,380
Father is right.

782
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,980
But Father,

783
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,580
Lao Qi is like a ghost.

784
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,180
If there is a case of corruption,

785
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,180
he will always cheat himself.

786
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,780
There is no reason to be fair.

787
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,580
If there is no one present,

788
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,380
then let's create one.

789
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,580
I heard that

790
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,980
Gao Xiang and Your Highness

791
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,380
have been close friends since childhood.

792
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,580
Isn't Nan Heng a filial son?

793
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,980
If he can start from the Noble Consort,

794
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,580
he will definitely have a concern.

795
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,180
Father is right.

796
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,180
If there is a chance in the future,

797
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,380
I plan to take a d evolution

798
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,780
not only from the Noble Consort,

799
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,780
but also find lesser of others.

800
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,180
hah why

801
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,180
Father,

802
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,580
you understand the situation.

803
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,380
I'll make sure to reassure you.

804
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:16,080
Don't side with

805
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,140
What are you doing?

806
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,780
I want to see the Seventh Prince.

807
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,500
You won't see him?

808
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,620
I will see him.

809
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,700
How many times have I told you?

810
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,460
What are you doing?

811
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,420
I'm bothering you?

812
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,580
If you don't want to see him, you won't see him.

813
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,180
Go!

814
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,420
Fu Kui.

815
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,420
I'm fine.

816
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,380
I'm fine.

817
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,300
Fu Kui.

818
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,420
Fu Kui.

819
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,180
Your Highness.

820
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,580
General.

821
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,620
You should rest for a while.

822
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,620
Why did you get up?

823
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,180
What happened outside?

824
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,660
It's Prime Minister.

825
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,380
He's in the imperial prison.

826
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,620
I have to see you.

827
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,740
I won't see him.

828
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,300
But he's my uncle.

829
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,700
Call me on the way to the prison.

830
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,700
Make sure everything is well arranged.

831
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,780
Yes.

832
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,500
Go get ready.

833
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,220
I'm going out.

834
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,180
Now?

835
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,140
But your wound...

836
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,740
Go.

837
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,700
Yes.
