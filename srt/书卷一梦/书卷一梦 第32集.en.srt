00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,090
bringing me here today?

5
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,710
I brought you here

6
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,110
to make a vow under the matchmaker tree.

7
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,910
Song Yimeng,

8
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,750
whatever troubles you

9
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,850
or frightens you in the future,

10
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,600
I will resolve them all for you.

11
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,310
And rest assured,

12
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,310
I will take good care of you and
the Song family,

13
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,840
and I will never let you down
in this lifetime.

14
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
Didn't you say

15
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,470
you never believed in deities?

16
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,210
Since you believe,

17
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,730
then I'll believe too.

18
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,560
What's the point of believing, anyway?

19
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,220
The fate written in the script

20
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,850
still can't be changed.

21
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,320
Can the script

really not be changed?

23
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,290
Think about it,

24
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,210
in that so-called script of yours,

25
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,380
I was supposed to be a God of Death.

26
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,620
But look at me now,

27
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,170
am I still that person?

You're right.

You stood up for the Nightwalker,

This proves

34
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,640
you've already changed.

35
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:34,910
But...

36
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,240
Not only have I changed,

37
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,800
others have changed too.

38
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,900
Nan Rui no longer fears me,

39
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,600
and even His Majesty

40
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,550
has passed the crown prince position
to me.

41
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,329
So you see,

42
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,770
if the people in the script can change,

43
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,329
why can't the ending of the story
change too?

The reason I brought you here today

45

is to make one last effort,

Rui is very close to his cousin,

00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,150
He also suggested

170
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,200
that I give Chu Guihong a new task

171

the reason I'm willing to treat

I failed to keep an eye on Chu Guihong.

685
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,750
How is he?

686
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,150
The Qianyu Army's physician, Dr. Zhao,

687
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,680
is treating his wounds now.

688
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,000
Dr. Zhao.

689
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,110
Yiting.

690
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,590
Please don't misunderstand.

691
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,980
He's not Guihong's accomplice,

692
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,380
he's someone I brought here.

693
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,510
Eighteenth Prince,

694
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,590
when the assassination happened yesterday,

695
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,150
why did you arrive here so quickly?

696
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,070
I...

697
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,280
Yes, Eighteenth Prince,

698
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,190
how did you know

699
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,760
the royal physicians couldn't save
His Highness,

700
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,510
and

701
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,360
even brought a doctor with you?

702
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,230
Doctor Zhao came to me yesterday.

703
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,770
I learned from him

704
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,260
that Heng was stabbed and
couldn't be saved.

705
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,020
But how could

706
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,650
Doctor Zhao know in advance?

707
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,440
Could it be just a coincidence?

708
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,090
[Happiness]

709
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,260
How is he doing?

710
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,610
The bleeding has stopped.

711
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:26,040
His Highness's life is considered safe.

712
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,230
As long as he doesn't develop a fever
tonight,

713
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,360
he will have survived this ordeal.

714
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,090
Thank you.

715
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,090
Your Highness,

716
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,590
don't forget our agreement.

717
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,030
Alright.

718
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,590
Doctor Zhao,

719
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,110
about the Crown Prince being stabbed,

720
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,630
how did you know about it?

721
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,440
Someone sent me a message.

722
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,660
Who?

723
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,590
I was brought by the Eighteenth Prince

724
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,500
to treat the Crown Prince.

725
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,950
I cannot answer questions from others.

726
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:58,840
Doctor Zhao,

727
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,110
I'm quite curious about that too.

728
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:03,590
Your Highness,

729
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,880
you will know soon enough.

730
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,400
Farewell.

731
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,290
This Chu Guihong is quite bold

732
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,710
to dare assassinating the crown prince.

733
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,420
Now that the crown prince is in a coma,

734
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,650
he vanished.

735
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,080
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

736
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,290
Father.

737
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,360
Take care of your health,

738
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,070
Father.

739
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,840
Don't be angry.

740
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,880
Does he know that

741
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,370
attempting to assassinate the crown prince

742
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:34,700
is an offence that condemns nine generations
of his family?

743
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,510
Even if the Empress and Lord Qianyu
were still alive,

744
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,310
they couldn't save his life.

745
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,480
Yes,

746
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,320
Father.

747
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,530
Now that Heng is out of danger,

748
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,480
and Song Yimeng has promised

749
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,070
not to pursue Guihong's crimes anymore.

750
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,480
Perhaps you could give him
a lighter punishment?

751
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,340
The law of the land must be upheld.

752
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,090
An attack on the crown prince

753
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,480
cannot be dismissed by Song Yimeng's

754
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,630
casual words of forgiveness.

755
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:56,770
Yes, yes, yes.

756
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,180
If Song Yimeng's word doesn't count,

757
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,240
what about Mother?

758
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,400
When Mother was alive,

759
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,780
she loved Guihong the most.

760
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,150
Father,

761
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,610
if you really execute him,

762
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,000
I fear Mother's spirit

763
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,800
will never rest in peace.

764
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,020
Rui, in that case,

765
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,130
send more Imperial Guards to look for him

766
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,530
and bring him back first.

767
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,510
As for the rest,

768
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,170
we'll discuss it later.

769
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,920
Yes,

770
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,320
I'll see to it right away.

771
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:30,970
[Clear Breeze and a Radiant Moon]

772
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,000
Is the Noble Consort's chamber

773
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,150
this way?

774
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,630
My Lady,

775
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,320
His Highness

776
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,590
is now out of danger

777
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,760
and Yimeng is taking care of him.

778
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,660
You need not worry too much.

779
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,690
You should take care of your health.

780
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,760
Heaven be praised.

781
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,040
Good child.

782
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,550
Thank you for thinking

783
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,430
to inform me.

784
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,810
Your name is

785
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,280
Song Yiting, right?

786
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,270
You're just as likable as your sister.

787
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,890
I find that

788
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,670
Song Yude's second daughter

789
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,070
is more sensible than Song Yimeng.

790
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,300
I, Song Yiting, pay my respects to
Your Majesty.

791
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,060
Careful.

792
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,960
Careful.

793
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,630
Your Majesty.

794
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,840
How old are you?

795
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,360
Your Majesty,

796
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,140
I've just turned 22.

797
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,230
Are you married?

798
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,820
I already have someone I fancy.

799
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,400
Though we haven't formally exchanged
our birth details,

800
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,000
I've already decided on him.

801
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,440
In my eyes,

802
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,830
there's no room for anyone else.

803
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,030
I only asked if you were married,

804
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,560
yet you've given me this
long-winded answer.

805
00:39:59,110 --> 00:39:59,920
Your Majesty,

806
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,360
please don't be angry.

807
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,190
Miss Song Yiting,

808
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,050
like her sister,

809
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,080
is straightforward person.

810
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,840
She speaks

811
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,040
whatever comes to mind without filter.

812
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,190
She meant no disrespect to Your Majesty.

813
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,590
I didn't say anything,

814
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,670
why are you so frightened

815
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,330
that you use the Crown Prince's wife
as a shield?

816
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,960
Well...

817
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,110
I came today

818
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,550
just to see how you are doing.

819
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,400
The Crown Prince is currently recovering.

820
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,860
You need to ease your mind,

821
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,280
and take good care of yourself,

822
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,960
so he won't have to worry about you.

823
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,440
Yes.
