00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,120
Nan Heng.

5
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,000
Nan Heng.

6
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,570
You don't have a fever.

7
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,910
Didn't the physician say

8
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,170
you'd be fine as long as there's no fever?

9
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,640
Why aren't you waking up?

10
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,710
What's gone wrong?

11
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,810
Why are you still bleeding?

12
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,120
Is the wound inflamed again?

13
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,870
Nan Heng!

14
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,590
-Your Highness.
-You're awake?

15
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,390
You're awake?

16
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,420
Let me check on you.

17
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,190
Can't you read the room?

18
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,000
Don't mind us.

19
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,710
Carry on.

20
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,470
What are you doing?

21
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,000
I need to serve His Highness.

22
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,730
-Go, go.
-Your Highness, it's me!

23
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,680
I'm Fugui!

24
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,630
Let me look after you,

25
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,030
Your Highness!

26
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,870
He doesn't need you,

27
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,980
you idiot!

28
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,560
Let go of me.

29
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,160
I may press on your wound.

30
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,580
You're finally awake!

31
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,970
Have you been awake for a while?

32
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,600
Why didn't you tell me

33
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,040
when you woke up?

34
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,810
Everyone was worried sick all night.

35
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,870
I didn't even dare

36
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,000
close my eyes once.

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,630
I was so scared
something might happen to you!

38
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,110
You know that?

39
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,310
Yet you

40
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,910
woke up and didn't say a word.

41
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,730
What's wrong with you?

42
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,750
Sorry.

43
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,290
Did I hurt you?

44
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,950
-You scared the hell out of me.
-I'm sorry.

45
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,750
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,840
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,860
You think "sorry" fixes everything?

48
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,409
You think that's enough?

49
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,480
Okay, okay.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,170
I made you worry.

51
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,190
Don't bite, don't bite.

52
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,330
If you ever lie to me again,

53
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,690
I'll bite you to death.

54
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,190
Fine.

55
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,270
I won't do it again.

56
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,870
You scared the hell out of me.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,070
Just now,

58
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,750
the two of them

59
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,190
were…

60
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,840
Enjoying their married life

61
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,910
as newlyweds.

62
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,240
So I didn't need to blame myself at all.

63
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,870
Look,

64
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,390
even though the wedding

65
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,190
got interrupted by an assassin,

66
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,920
nothing actually got delayed in the end.

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,330
His Highness really is something.

68
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,310
Wounded like that,

69
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,710
but still full of energy.

70
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,840
Fugui,

71
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,560
in the coming year,

72
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,120
we need to work hard

73
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,720
and try to get a raise,

74
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,240
but we still need
to be careful with spending.

75
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,100
Why?

76
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,530
My guess is,

77
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,750
by this time next year,

78
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,000
we'll be bringing a full-month gift

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,560
to His Highness's baby.

80
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,480
His Highness's baby?

81
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,010
His Highness really doesn't waste time.

82
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,570
Now that it's finally clicked for him,

83
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,260
he's like a late bloomer
making up for lost time.

84
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,160
Come.

85
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,720
Okay.

86
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,680
Mr. Wang, you're back.

87
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,310
Tie it tighter.

88
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,370
All right.

89
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,190
Father?

90
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,260
My good son,

91
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,730
you're finally awake!

92
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,240
Father.

93
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,990
Son.

94
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,030
Father.

95
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,480
Father!

96
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,070
Son,

97
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,950
you're strong.

98
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,750
Chop the firewood for me.

99
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,940
Your Highness,

100
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,610
you're finally up and about.

101
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,440
I've been bored out of my mind

102
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,680
these past few days.

103
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,310
You…

104
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,800
Slow down.

105
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,540
Careful.

106
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,450
It's fine.

107
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,330
You can't even lift your arm.

108
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,480
How are you supposed to eat?

109
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,050
Yeah,

110
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,560
how am I supposed to eat?

111
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:34,460
Fugui.

112
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,220
Feed His Highness.

113
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,010
Okay.

114
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,480
No, no, that's not necessary.

115
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,070
Well,

116
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,920
he's too clumsy.

117
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,230
Your Highness, don't tell me

118
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,590
you want me to feed you instead.

119
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,430
No need for that.

120
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,640
But if you're offering,

121
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,430
I wouldn't say no.

122
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,040
Alright.

123
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,120
I'll do it.

124
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,960
Thank you.

125
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,950
Here,

126
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,770
open your mouth.

127
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,460
Wait.

128
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
It's too hot.

129
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,740
You want me to blow on it for you?

130
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,510
Come on, you're like six-foot-three,

131
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,040
and you're acting all cutesy with me?

132
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,390
Oh, just blow on it already.

133
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,049
It's not a big deal. I'll do it!

134
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,320
If you blow on it,
how am I supposed to eat it?

135
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:37,909
But

136
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,960
isn't it hot?

137
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Still, I don't need you to blow on it.

138
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,330
Fine.

139
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,160
I'll do it. I'll do it.

140
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,410
I'll blow on it.

141
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,440
Happy now?

142
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,320
Wait a moment.

143
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,790
Go out.

144
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,670
You guys eat.

145
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,550
I want some pickled veggies.

146
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,770
Go buy some for me.

147
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,670
We already have so many pickled veggies.

148
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,800
You want more?

149
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,910
Well, I'm craving

150
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,200
the ones from that shop
in the south of the city—

151
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,460
Xu's Pickled Veggies.

152
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,790
You've never had them.

153
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,320
Let him go buy some so you can try too.

154
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,550
That's too far.

155
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,440
I'll have Zhong ride a horse over.

156
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,200
You go. Don't send someone else.

157
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,330
But, Your Highness,

158
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,000
I haven't seen you for so long.

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,200
We'll be seeing a lot of each other.

160
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,060
Can't you spare this one morning?

161
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,960
Go now!

162
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,840
Go!

163
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,290
Alright, Your Highness.

164
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,960
Can you finally have some porridge now?

165
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,560
Open your mouth.

166
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,890
Slow down.

167
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,620
Chief.

168
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,070
This is Waning River Crescent's
expense report for this month.

169
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,130
Please take a look.

170
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,590
Go fetch Song Yimeng.

171
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,480
Song Yimeng?

172
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,030
You…

173
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,130
You're putting me to work
right after we got married?

174
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,670
Aren't newlyweds

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,660
supposed to go on a honeymoon?

176
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,640
What's a honeymoon?

177
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,990
It's…

178
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,880
going on a trip together.

179
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,630
There'll be plenty of chances to travel.

180
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,270
But you're the crown princess now.

181
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,790
It's your duty to help the crown prince

182
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,920
with state affairs.

183
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,020
No one told me this was part of the deal.

184
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,630
I kinda regret it now.

185
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
My wound suddenly started hurting.

186
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,050
I'll read it.

187
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,670
I'll read it, okay?

188
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,360
It's just reading.

Your Highness,

I can't do this job.

215
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,780
I never got the hang of

216

semi-cursive script in school.

217

And anyway,

why do I have to read it?

219
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,910
I feel dizzy,

220
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,960
and my vision's blurry,

221
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,510
which means I can't read,

222
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,120
so you have to read it for me.

223
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,710
Why not let him read it?

224
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,240
Don't point at me.

The one who started the trouble
has to fix it.

W-Why am I dizzy?

227
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,150
Because I got injured.

228
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,910
Why did I get injured?

229
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,000
Because of you.

230
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,750
Because of me?

231
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,700
You're just being unreasonable.

232
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,910
It was the script rule
that made you take the hit for me.

233

and told Mr. Zhao to stop the bleeding,

237

Get out.

Looks like His Highness

274

cares less about us now.

275
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,910
Cares less?

276
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,230
He doesn't care for us at all.

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,440
Ever since he got married,

280
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,390
he's been head over heels in love

281

and has long forgotten about us.

282

you haven't had it easy
these past few years.

288

and always putting on airs.

291
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,900
But your loyalty is truly rare.

292
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,660
You're not so bad yourself.

293
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,360
Without your help these years,

294
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,720
His Highness wouldn't
have made a comeback

295
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,320
and become the crown prince.

296
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,990
I can't take credit for that.

297
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,960
I only did all those things

298
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,830
because Chief forced me to.

299
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,110
I just wanted to coast through life.

If I'd known we'd both end up
in the same boat,

I wouldn't have wasted time
butting heads with you.

302

You mean that?

303

In the past,

307
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,440
I was being petty.

308

I have to admit

309
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,620
you're quite capable.

But you

314

deserve to be called my friend.

Here's to you.

through hard times together.

327

Why don't we become sworn brothers?

Sworn brothers?

329

Sure.

From this day forward,

we'll call each other brothers.

I swear,

338
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,750
from now on,

339
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,690
your friends are my friends,

340
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,910
and your enemies

341
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:45,030
are my enemies.

342
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,960
I swear,

343

from this day forward,

344
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,450
Shangguan and I

345
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,750
will stay single forever

346
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,610
and dedicate our lives
to protecting His Highness.

347

What's wrong?

348
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,150
Why do we need to stay single forever?

349
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,150
What do you think?

350
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,440
Look at His Highness.

351
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,790
Ever since the wedding,

352
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,450
he's been ignoring both of us.

353
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,240
That's why the two of us

354
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,849
must never be the kind of men
who abandon friends for women.

355
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,569
Okay, fine, I get that.

356
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,810
But don't you think "stay single forever"

357
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,569
sounds a bit dramatic?

358
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,339
What do you mean, Shangguan?

359
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,599
Are you already in love with someone?

360
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,310
No!

361
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,829
No?

362
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,940
Is she

363
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,240
Miss Song Yiting?

364
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,790
No!

365
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,680
I knew it!

366
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
No wonder Yunlong and Shanhu call her

367
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,600
Mrs. Shangguan every time they see her.

368
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,510
So

369
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,400
you two are secretly engaged, aren't you?

370
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,510
No, no, no!

371
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,160
Fine.

372
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,310
You

373
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,640
and His Highness,

374
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,600
you two,

375
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,990
well done!

376
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,580
Have you ever considered my feelings?

377
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,270
Fine.

378
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,100
From this day forward,

379
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,680
I, Fugui, am sworn enemies
with the Songs!

380
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,060
Drink by yourself!

381
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,160
The magic of love spins and spins.

382
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,350
Thinking of you
makes me burst with joy day and night.

383
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,880
But I'm worried that

384
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,750
love only lasts a moment…

385
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,750
You're done washing?

386
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,680
Father.

387
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,960
Father.

388
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,720
There are so many things
I've wanted to ask you today.

389
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,480
Go ahead.

390
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,800
During the Pingrong Battle,

391
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,840
many soldiers
witnessed your death in battle.

392
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,270
How come you're still alive?

393
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,640
And if you were alive,

394
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,960
why didn't you come back for me?

395
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,050
Do you know that

396
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,720
I, Rong Hua,

397
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,720
and all the Qianyu soldiers
have been waiting for you?

398
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,160
I knew you'd ask me
these questions sooner or later.

399
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,550
But first,

400
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,810
you have to understand
the logic of my character

401
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,560
and how hard it's been for me.

402
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,000
Father,

403
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,280
what do you mean?

404
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,350
Who am I?

405
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,480
An invincible commander of Great Jing,

406
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,830
undefeated on battlefields for decades.

407
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,960
Everyone had high expectations of me.

408
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,820
But I personally caused

409
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,920
the tragedy at Pingrong.

410
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,200
When I woke up,

411
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,680
I truly wished I had died

412
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,540
rather than go on living in shame.

413
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,270
You understand how I felt, don't you?

414
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,100
I do, Father.

415
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,790
But the shame of defeat

416
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,050
weighs just as heavily
on all the Qianyu soldiers.

417
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,710
No matter what, you shouldn't

418
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,350
have abandoned
the Qianyu Army in the capital.

419
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,740
Do you have any idea

420
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,240
what kind of hell we've been through?

421
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,310
Of course I do.

422
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,350
The truth is…

423
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,440
I struggled with it

424
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,820
more than you can imagine.

425
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,060
But Guihong,

426
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,750
under the wings of Lord Qianyu,

427
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,820
you could never truly stand tall.

428
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,070
Only by stepping away

429
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,830
could I give you the space to grow.

430
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,690
Look at you now.

431
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,280
Aren't you doing just fine?

432
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,370
As your father,

433
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,680
I'm genuinely proud of you.

434
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,080
You truly mean that, Father?

435
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,000
Are you truly…

436
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,550
proud of me?

437
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,860
Creating you

438
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,680
is what I'm most proud of in my life.

439
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,260
In the past 20 years,

440
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,080
you've never acknowledged me like that.

441
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,010
It's different now.

442
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,000
If not for you,

443
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,640
I'd still be hesitating about coming.

444
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,250
One day,
the two of us, father and son,

445
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,680
will take back everything

446
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,880
Nan Heng took from us.

447
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,480
30 taels of this.

448
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,270
Eggs.

449
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,830
20 taels.

450
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,960
Eat something.

451
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,000
Sesame oil.

452
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,790
Eggs.

453
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,200
20…

454
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,260
Have some water.

455
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,940
Don't talk to me. Be quiet.

456
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,440
Sugar.

457
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,660
What was the amount again?

458
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,500
This is your fault!

459
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,000
I was doing just fine with the math.

460
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,550
Then you talked,

461
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,240
and I lost track of everything.

462
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,550
How is this my fault?

463
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,480
I've already told you

464
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,790
I don't like reading Archaic Chinese,

465
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,100
and I hate math.

466
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,920
But you still… you still forced me

467
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,780
to deal with your stupid ledgers.

468
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,810
You're getting impatient already?

469
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,070
I just wanted

470
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,600
to spend more time with you.

471
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,720
Besides,

472
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,050
you're the crown princess now.

473
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,240
Someday you'll be Empress,

474
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,440
Mother of the Nation.

475
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,880
I just wanted you

476
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,680
to learn more about my world.

477
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,880
It's not a bad thing.

478
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,400
I quit.

479
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,110
I don't want
to be the crown princess anymore.

480
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,310
Find someone else.

481
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,390
What do you mean
you don't want to be the crown princess?

482
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,880
You've made me so upset

483
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,740
that my wound is starting to hurt.

484
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,290
You're not worried at all?

485
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,480
Go on.

486
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Keep acting.

487
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,750
I'll just watch you act.

488
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,310
I really don’t know what to do with you.

489
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,880
Fine.

490
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,720
Let's call it a day

491
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,920
if you don't want to learn anymore.

492
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,380
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

493
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,350
Really?

494
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:58,960
Really.

495
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,750
That's great.

496
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,440
Thank you, Your Highness.

497
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,640
I'm going to bed.

498
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,590
Come back.

499
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,480
You're just leaving me like that?

500
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,790
I'm a patient now.

501
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,860
I really can't move.

502
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,550
Help me.

503
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,920
Look at you,

504
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,330
always acting.

505
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,590
The blanket is not on properly.

506
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,590
Pull it up for me.

507
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,830
The pillow isn't comfortable either.

508
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,110
Adjust it for me.

509
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,150
You're just

510
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,640
holding a grudge
because I used to bully you,

511
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,900
so now you're finding ways

512
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,060
to get back at me.

513
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,360
When we're alone together,

514
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,880
can we forget
you're a prince for a moment?

515
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,260
Maybe it can feel
more real to me that way.

516
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,040
What do you mean?

517
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,480
I mean,

518
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,480
I want this life to feel real.

519
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,590
Well,

520
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,600
you know,

521
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,970
the iconic scene in the script

522
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,270
didn't happen,

523
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,160
and the male and female leads

524
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,880
live happily ever after.

525
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,200
It feels a bit unreal to me.

526
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,860
It's because this prince here…

527
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,790
It's all thanks to me.

528
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,740
But if I hadn't given you intel,

529
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,200
how could you, a fictional figure,

530
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,600
have changed the ending?

531
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,730
Alright.

532
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,600
I'm just a fictional figure.

533
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,830
But

534
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,650
have you ever considered this:

535
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,570
maybe you're a fictional figure too.

536
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,650
What if the world you lived in

537
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,000
wasn't real either,

538
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,500
but just another

539
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,270
scripted story someone made up?

540
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,510
You have a point.

541
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,480
It's possible that

542
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,790
the modern world

543
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,690
is also just a world in a script.

544
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,620
Or maybe

545
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,640
a world in a game

546
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,270
or a dream.

547
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,460
And the whole universe

548
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,540
is just one giant

549
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,850
Russian nesting doll.

550
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,020
You get what I mean?

551
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,640
Not really.

552
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,260
But I think it's similar to the meaning of

553
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,080
Zhuangzi's butterfly dream

554
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,240
or the saying,

555
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,700
"Nothing really exists."

556
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,480
Anyway,

557
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,770
no matter where we are,

558
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,830
just don't drag me into any rat race.

559
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,310
Rat…

560
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,790
race?

561
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,240
I mean,

562
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,770
don't make me work,

563
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,230
and don't boss me around.

564
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,930
I don't have

565
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,160
great ambitions.

566
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,480
My only life philosophy is that

567
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,710
life is about staying still.

568
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,920
If I can lie down,

569
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,600
there's no way I'm sitting up.

570
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,260
I get it now.

571
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,400
You're complaining that
I'm making you learn things.

572
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,960
I just thought

573
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,090
it'd help you fit into my world sooner.

574
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,420
Why should I be the one
to fit into your world?

575
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,100
Why can't you fit into mine?

576
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,310
I can do that.

577
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,400
But only if

578
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,400
you teach me as patiently
as I've been teaching you.

579
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,110
You said it.

580
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,720
Come on.

581
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,830
Let's study!

582
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,070
Now?

583
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,030
What's this?

584
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,570
It looks kind of like

585
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,030
the method of weapon forging.

586
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,380
Not bad.

587
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,710
Math and science are all connected.

588
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,000
You've got a good eye.

589
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Last time,

590
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,200
I showed you chemistry.

591
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,280
Today I'm teaching you math.

592
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,410
Pay attention.

593
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,720
This

594
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,640
is a math equation.

595
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,920
Repeat after me.

596
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,530
These are Arabic numerals.

597
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,240
Four.

598
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,310
Four.

599
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,570
This is 35.

600
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,440
35.

601
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,590
This is two.

602
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,080
Two.

603
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
94.

604
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,960
And this symbol here

605
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,160
stands for…

606
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,880
12.

607
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,230
How did you know that?

608
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,530
Chickens and rabbits in the same cage—

609
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,270
35 heads above,

610
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,650
94 feet below.

611
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,000
The answer is

612
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,120
23 chickens

613
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,780
and 12 rabbits.

614
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,110
The classic chicken-rabbit problem?

615
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,910
That's how you understand this?

616
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,590
Let me tell you how I figured it out.

617
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,070
Enough.

618
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,830
No need.

619
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,680
I don't want to hear it.

620
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,940
Not interested at all.

621
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,130
Math is not my strength.

622
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,380
I'm good at English.

623
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,030
My English is amazing.

624
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,310
There's no way

625
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,070
you're good at English too.

626
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,200
English?

627
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,540
You mean the word you mentioned once—

628
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,030
"abandon"?

629
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,510
Oh my god.

630
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,000
How do you remember everything?

631
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,560
You're so clever.

632
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,050
Yeah.

633
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,240
Abandon.

634
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,400
Copy it down first.

635
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,170
What does this word mean?

636
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,400
This word?

637
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,890
It means "give up."

638
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,400
Give up?

639
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,920
So back then,

640
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,640
you were thinking about giving up on us?

641
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,030
What's your zodiac sign?

642
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,430
You really hold a grudge.

643
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,590
I don't wanna learn this.

644
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,990
Teach me something else.

645
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,510
Alright then.

646
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,090
You pick something.

647
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,860
I'll write it down for you.

648
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,230
I want to learn how to say

649
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,270
"everlasting love"

650
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,430
and "unwavering devotion."

651
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,240
Can you teach me?

652
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,670
"Everlasting love?"

653
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,360
"Unwavering devotion?"

654
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,070
Ever…

655
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:31,870
I remember now.

656
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,530
"Everlasting love…"

657
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,790
Bai…

658
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,680
is "white."

659
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,790
Shou…

660
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,160
is "head."

661
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,510
Tong…

662
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,110
is "same."

663
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,680
Xin…

664
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,680
I know that one.

665
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,590
It's "heart."

666
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,070
When you were in school,

667
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,660
you never
paid attention in class, did you?

668
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,230
Who told you that?

669
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,880
Didn't I just tell you

670
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,470
my English is amazing?

671
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,310
Repeat after me.

672
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,640
White.

673
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,510
White.

674
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:16,920
Head.

675
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,920
Head.

676
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,510
Same.

677
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,720
Same.

678
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,680
Heart.

679
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,000
Heart.

680
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,920
Heart.

681
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,720
Good!

682
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,500
Now I'll read it for you all together.

683
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,640
"White head same heart."

684
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,140
Smooth, right?

685
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,400
Why are you laughing?

686
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,080
This is the American accent.

687
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,120
Let's read it one last time.

688
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,270
White.

689
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:49,880
White.

690
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,510
Head.

691
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,000
Head.

692
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:54,880
Same.

693
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,590
Same.

694
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,290

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,030
that's not just a casual crush.

866
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,400
But…

867
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,510
But he…

868
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,960
he can't just like her and marry her!

869
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,440
I mean...

870
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,670
he's gotta ask if she agrees first.

871
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,030
I only have two daughters.

872
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,510
I can't marry them both into your family!

873
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,070
Isn't that how it should be?

874
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,800
That's forced marriage!

875
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,130
You're the Chancellor.

876
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,520
Shouldn't you help me with my concerns?

877
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,230
And also,

878
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,030
why are you glaring at me?

879
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,510
You also yelled at me.

880
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,930
Are you trying to offend your emperor?

881
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,360
I wouldn't dare.

882
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,110
I apologize.

883
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,560
You placed your piece there?

884
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,170
No take-backs.

885
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,120
I win.

886
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,360
You're terrible at this.

887
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,840
This tastes really good.

888
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:23,590
Father.

889
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,280
Don't you think you owe me

890
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,960
an explanation for what happened today?

891
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,670
Yesterday, you told me
why you didn't return to the capital,

892
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,400
and I understand that.

893
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,030
But how could you pretend
to have superpowers

894
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,090
and live off trickery in the village?

895
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,070
Watch your language, young man.

896
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,070
Don't be so judgy.

897
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,080
Let me ask you—

898
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,860
did the villagers dig up real ginseng?

899
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,760
And was that ginseng
already in the ground?

900
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,710
Lying about things that don't exist—

901
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,670
that's a scam.

902
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,510
But I'm seriously

903
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,400
helping the villagers get rich.

904
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:56,840
But

905
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,890
how did you know there was ginseng there?

906
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,350
With a feather fan in hand

907
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,590
and a quick divination,

908
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,870
I reveal the future…

909
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,010
with the power of prophecy.

910
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,230
If you really had the power of prophecy,

911
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,630
how would we have lost
the Pingrong Battle?

912
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,510
Hey,

913
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,800
do you have to keep bringing up
the Pingrong Battle?

914
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,110
It's been so long.

915
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,810
It's time you let it go.

916
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,480
Let it go?

917
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,030
Father,

918
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,380
you've changed.

919
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,030
The man you used to be
would never have let go of

920
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,800
the 20,000 Qianyu soldiers we lost,

921
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,730
nor would he believe in
such supernatural nonsense.

922
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,110
Son,

923
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,330
have you ever heard that

924
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,820
people can awaken certain gifts

925
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,290
on the brink of death?

926
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,230
Take me, for example.

927
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,800
I awakened the gift of prophecy.

928
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,280
If it hadn't been for saving you,

929
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,550
why would I have come here in advance,

930
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,880
befriended the villagers,

931
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,190
and helped you out during your escape?

932
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,890
So you knew in advance

933
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,480
that I'd flee here?

934
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,230
Yes.

935
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,590
Not just that. I also know

936
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,710
you were rejected by the Song family,

937
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,640
that Song Yimeng fell for Nan Heng,

938
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,230
that His Majesty no longer trusts you,

939
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,400
and that Nan Rui
has given up on the throne.

940
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,800
Now you're isolated,

941
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,190
and you feel like no one in this world

942
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,730
can understand what you're going through.

943
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:28,440
Am I right?

944
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,730
You really do know everything?

945
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:36,030
You've been watching over me
this whole time?

946
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,000
Of course I have.

947
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,920
You're my son.

948
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,150
Now that we've reunited,

949
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,440
you're not alone anymore.

950
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,590
As for the assassination,

951
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:46,440
I sent Physician Zhao
ahead of time to save Nan Heng

952
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,570
so they'd spare you from punishment.

953
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,590
Also,

954
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,490
I sent letters to Rong Hua

955
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,850
and Nan Rui yesterday.

956
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,070
From now on,

957
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,440
you'll have nothing to worry about.

958
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,920
Father, you've really done so much for me.

959
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,840
I'm sorry.

960
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,670
I failed to carry out

961
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:09,200
the responsibilities
you entrusted me with.

962
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,190
I've let you down.

963
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,960
As long as you trust me,

964
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,280
nothing else matters.

965
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,440
Guihong,

966
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,170
His Majesty seems
to have turned his back on you,

967
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,070
but once something happens to him,

968
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,300
that will be our chance

969
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,200
to make a comeback.

970
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,280
Something will happen to His Majesty?

971
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,070
Father,

972
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,130
do you know something?

973
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,730
Some secrets cannot be revealed.

974
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:38,630
Son,

975
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,700
just wait for the good news.
