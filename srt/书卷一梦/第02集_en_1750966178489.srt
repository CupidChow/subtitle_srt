1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
I don't think so.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,320
Forget it.

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,920
Don't worry.

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,160
Even if it is true,

5
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,680
I won't fight with you.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,120
I am not afraid.

7
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,280
If I don't win,

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,120
my life will be ruined.

9
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,380
You hurt me!

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,720
Since that day,

11
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,600
I have had multiple difficulties.

12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,100
I'll work hard on that.

13
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,080
You'reara'll definitely win.

14
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,240
I'm sure I can get the first eat all.

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,520
So sorry!

16
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,760
I finally got to do a variety show with you last month.

17
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
You're so good.

18
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,000
You didn't steal the camera or set up the camera.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,840
But you slept with me.

20
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:53,620
First

21
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,280
Girl wanna drink drinking water

22
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,800
Just order us

23
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,080
Why did you take the hand of this impulses

24
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,080
The body bone is broken.

25
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
The body bone is broken.

26
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,080
Who is the one who has a bad body bone?

27
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
You should help him sit for a while.

28
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,080
There will be a battle for the hard bank.

29
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
Hard bank?

30
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,080
What hard bank?

31
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,080
Miss, why are you different from before?

32
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,080
I'm in a hurry.

33
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
Finish the process quickly.

34
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
It's not easy to be completely calm.

35
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,080
This time, the bet is too strong.

36
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
You must break it.

37
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
Where is my coat?

38
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
Hurry up and bring it here.

39
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
Put it on.

40
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
Coat?

41
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
What coat?

42
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
Black coat.

43
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
You won't even say the fixed line this time?

44
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,080
Forget it.

45
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
Anyway, it's interesting to be a straight book.

46
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
You can wear anything.

47
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Let's go.

48
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
Hurry up and follow me.

49
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Miss.

50
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
Miss.

51
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Miss.

52
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
Miss.

53
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
You are really messing around.

54
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,080
How can you wear a coat in this cold weather?

55
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
Where is the firecracker?

56
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
Where is the red silk?

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Where are my fake clothes?

58
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
Is this...

59
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,080
Is this...

60
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
Is this Song's house?

61
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
Am I Song Yi Mo?

62
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
Miss, what's wrong with you?

63
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
Oh, right.

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
The winning team.

65
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
And Chu Bei Hong.

66
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,080
Ying Qiu, go get the doctor.

67
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
Miss.

68
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
Miss.

69
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,080
Since this time,

70
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,080
I successfully wore it half a year before our wedding,

71
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,080
then I have to enjoy it.

72
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
Miss.

73
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
The doctor said that

74
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,080
the girl was in a bad mood all day long.

75
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
That's why she got the disease.

76
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
Master and Madam paid the pocket money

77
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
to give the old lady a massage.

78
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
You...

79
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
You rich people

80
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
are so stingy.

81
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
You have to pay for it.

82
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,080
Come on.

83
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
Come on.

84
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
Come on.

85
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
Silly girl.

86
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
You are making my family background

87
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
a little more complicated.

88
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Let me practice my heart.

89
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
Yes.

90
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Miss, listen up.

91
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
The most luxurious city in the capital city,

92
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
is just outside the city gate.

93
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
It is not far from the Imperial Palace of Great Jin.

94
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
There are many transportation places and shops around.

95
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
It's like a ancient central city.

96
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
There are 100 maids and servants in the mansion.

97
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
There are 100 servants and servants.

98
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
There are 100 servants and servants.

99
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
There are 100 servants and servants.

100
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
There are 100 servants and servants.

101
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,080
Each servant will eat 100 maids

102
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
to serve our master's food and clothing.

103
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,080
Your Highness.

104
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,080
Please get up.

105
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
Be specific.

106
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
How can the rich people like me

107
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
have a good relationship with food and clothing?

108
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Your hands are of noble quality.

109
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,080
You shouldn't sell all the hard work.

110
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,080
Your mouth is of a noble mouth.

111
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,080
You deserve what you have.

112
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
You deserve what you have.

113
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,080
It's your reward.

114
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,520
I'm just a little girl

115
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,080
I live in a little house

116
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,200
Miss

117
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,360
Change one

118
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,280
Zuo An

119
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,320
Miss

120
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,120
This grape

121
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,120
How can it have seeds

122
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,440
Pass my message

123
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,880
From today

124
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,520
Grape of the Qing Dynasty

125
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,040
No one is allowed to grow seeds

126
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,800
From today

127
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,880
Grape of the Qing Dynasty

128
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,480
No one is allowed to grow seeds

129
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,920
From today

130
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,240
Grape of the Qing Dynasty

131
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,080
No one is allowed to grow seeds

132
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,800
From today

133
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,760
Grape of the Qing Dynasty

134
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,520
No one is allowed to grow seeds

135
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,920
It's not anÐ¼oooo dream

136
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,360
This is just

137
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,320
It's just a small pocket full of antique.

138
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,120
Come on.

139
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,280
Come on.

140
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,920
It's all done.

141
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,920
We gather here today

142
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,120
to celebrate my rebirth.

143
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,400
It's the start of my

144
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,720
life-changing life

145
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,040
that I have not aged.

146
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,920
I, Niu Hulu,

147
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,400
come back to you.

148
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,440
This is a goal.

149
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,680
That is

150
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,800
to love life and get away from the cold.

151
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,440
Cheers.

152
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,960
Miss,

153
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,360
how about finding a doctor for you?

154
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,720
What doctor?

155
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,360
A doctor can't cure my disease.

156
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,120
You need to change your destiny.

157
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,880
I want to ask you.

158
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,280
About the marriage between Chu Gui Hong and me,

159
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,320
what's the story?

160
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,080
That day,

161
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,360
he used his power

162
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,880
to fight against He Yuan's three-channel zombie.

163
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,400
Who did he hide first?

164
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,960
General Fang.

165
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,360
But I didn't expect that you are a coward like a rat.

166
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,360
You really have humiliated the state and the people.

167
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,360
Who created this chess game?

168
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,360
I know that General Fang led the army south.

169
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
It was a game of chess.

170
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,360
He played this game all night.

171
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,360
I will play this game until you break the game.

172
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
Play this game?

173
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
You want to bet your life on me?

174
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
That's right.

175
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,360
As long as you break the game in one game,

176
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,360
I will be able to control the state.

177
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
General Fang will not waste a single soldier

178
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,360
and be able to take the city of You.

179
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
I want to take the city of You.

180
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
I can lead 30,000 soldiers to attack.

181
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Why do I need to choose between you and Fang Cun?

182
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
If you want to attack,

183
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,360
I, the three thousand Xuan family,

184
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,360
will bet my life on you.

185
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,360
My life is worth 10 lives.

186
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
The first general of Great Jin, King Qian Yu,

187
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,360
died under my sword.

188
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,360
And his son, Chu Gui Hong,

189
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
who is also known as the first God of War,

190
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,360
was also taken over by me.

191
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,360
The four corners of Great Jin have lost three times.

192
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Even if you have the ability to control the sky,

193
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,360
it is difficult to keep the last ancient city.

194
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
The world is afraid that I will kill Cheng Xing.

195
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,360
The name of the God of War is like me.

196
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,360
Is General Fang also afraid?

197
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,360
If I win, you will die.

198
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,360
If I lose, what do you want?

199
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Give me Chu Gui Hong.

200
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Everyone knows that you and King Qian Yu are not on good terms.

201
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,360
Why do you want to save his son?

202
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,360
I'm not trying to save him.

203
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,360
I want to kill him myself.

204
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,360
You want to kill Chu Gui Hong?

205
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
That's right.

206
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
I have been in the palace for three years.

207
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
I have not made any achievements.

208
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,360
I was only able to be controlled by King Qian Yu.

209
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,360
I was trapped in this dark city.

210
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,360
The emperor of Great Jin sent you to guard the dark city.

211
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,360
And he asked King Qian Yu to strictly control you.

212
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,360
I'm afraid that you have other intentions.

213
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,360
Do you know what the dark city is?

214
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,360
It is the dark city of Jin.

215
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,360
You are quite honest.

216
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,360
This is a very interesting situation.

217
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,360
General Fang, you lost.

218
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360
Can you teach me now?

219
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
Wait a minute.

220
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
When I get the ink and paper,

221
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,360
I will write down the chess book of the boat.

222
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,360
No need to trouble yourself.

223
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Bai Yao Xuan Yu is a great chess piece.

224
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,360
I will teach you how to play it.

225
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
I will teach you how to play it.

226
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
I will teach you how to play it.

227
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,360
Bai Yao Xuan Yu is a great chess piece.

228
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,360
This is the gift I gave to General Fang.

229
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Your Highness, let's hurry up and go.

230
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Be careful. It's cold.

231
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
Don't worry. They dare not.

232
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,360
They dare not shoot you. They dare to shoot me.

233
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,360
I know that it hurts when I see you.

234
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,360
If I am shot to death, who will serve you?

235
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
I'm leaving first.

236
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,360
Go. Go.

237
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
Hurry up.

238
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
General, don't let his empty city machine

239
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
stop us.

240
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,360
Please give orders to attack the city.

241
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
General, please give orders to attack the city.

242
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
General, please give orders to attack the city.

243
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,360
Go.

244
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Immortal Guo, go.

245
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,360
The law of war is strong.

246
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
The law of war is strong.

247
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,360
I don't need to attack the city.

248
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,360
I just need to wait for the food and water to run out.

249
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Then, three days later,

250
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
we will fight to the death.

251
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,360
The dog emperor of Great Jin is waiting for you to die.

252
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,360
He won't send reinforcements to save you.

253
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,360
Go.

254
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,360
Nan He, you are so good at playing dead.

255
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
I'm so happy.

256
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
You're so happy.

257
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
General, he is scolding us.

258
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,360
Wait.

259
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,360
If I remember correctly,

260
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,360
we just discussed about my marriage, right?

261
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
Then, why did you say that

262
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
Nan He is a devil?

263
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,360
I got married.

264
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,360
It has something to do with him.

265
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,360
What?

266
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,360
Did I say that

267
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,360
the seven-prince of Great Jin is a devil?

268
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
What else?

269
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,360
Sister.

270
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
I...

271
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
But I just said that

272
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,360
General Chu is a devil.

273
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,360
Qiu, I...

274
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,360
Miss, you said that

275
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,360
Ying Qiu doesn't know what's wrong.

276
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,360
What's wrong with him?

277
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
I don't know.

278
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Enough.

279
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,360
You've said it.

280
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,360
But listen to me.

281
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
He is talking about human.

282
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
He is talking about human.

283
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
He is talking about human.

284
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
He thinks he is great.

285
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,360
He is talking about human.

286
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
He is talking about human.

287
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,360
What is that?

288
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
Human?

289
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Human?

290
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
Is it good?

291
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,360
I don't know. I haven't eaten it.

292
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,360
Okay. I understand.

293
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,360
Forced plot. Forced promotion.

294
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
Right?

295
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
But the most important thing now

296
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
is my marriage.

297
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
My grandma asked me.

298
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
Right. Marriage.

299
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,360
That day,

300
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,360
he won the most dangerous battle

301
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,360
in the Cong Rong's business.

302
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,360
In the middle of winter,

303
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
the Seventh Prince used the three-day period

304
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,360
to attack He Yuan's food with the way of the earth attack.

305
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
What are you doing?

306
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,360
If you want to get the prince,

307
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,360
do it now.

308
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
Stop.

309
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
The fire is like meat.

310
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,360
The food of He Yuan people is burned and destroyed.

311
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,360
The Black Armor is here.

312
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
Kill.

313
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
The Seventh Prince used the Black Armor

314
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
to attack He Yuan.

315
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,360
He ordered the Black Armor Army in He Yuan's palace

316
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,360
to kill He Yuan and teach him a lesson.

317
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
Fang Shimin was so proud.

318
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
He held the three-day period of cold moon

319
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,360
and fought with the Seventh Prince.

320
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
In the seventh emperor of the country,

321
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,360
Han Yue, the leader of the He Fang people,

322
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,360
killed him.

323
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
The Black Armor warriors

324
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,360
fought against the Seventh Prince

325
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,360
under the battle drums.

326
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
They fought against the 30,000 soldiers

327
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
for three days and three nights.

328
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,360
They fought with each other

329
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,360
and finally won the battle of Yongcheng.

330
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
We're awesome.

331
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
So awesome.

332
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Such an crazy attitude

333
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,360
is like no paradise at all,

334
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,360
and no newcomers at all.

335
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,360
It's strange.

336
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,360
How could a person their mind

337
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
that no one can interfere

338
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,360
make such a radical statement

339
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,360
about the seven-man army

340
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,360
about the so-called supreme number.

341
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
That's right.

342
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,360
It's the first time I heard

343
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,360
that the First Dryash Wasp around the dry area

344
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,360
was Meiriero Shaman.

345
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,080
the best killer in the world.

346
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,280
But

347
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,560
I can't help but

348
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,040
have a feeling of admiration.

349
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,840
It's like I want my mother-in-law to be under her feet.

350
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,680
What's wrong with me?

351
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,680
I think I understand.

352
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,160
In this world,

353
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,960
no one can escape from

354
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,000
the influence of his main character, Guanghuan.

355
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,080
You guys are just lying.

356
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,360
I'm like that too.

357
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,320
Miss, miss.

358
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,600
Give me another chance.

359
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,080
I'll make sure to tell you this time.

360
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,720
No need.

361
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,600
I've heard everything about the best killer.

362
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,960
Anyway,

363
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,600
he's the best killer

364
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,280
and he's a very good character.

365
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,960
He's very good.

366
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,920
You guys continue.

367
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,880
Continue talking.

368
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,760
I just want to hear it.

369
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,280
What else can I say?

370
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,920
Please.

371
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,080
That day,

372
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,680
he opened the door for himself

373
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,960
to return to the capital.

374
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Please protect theå¥½çë

378
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,040
still Zentong

379
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,560
Qin Yu

380
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,600
who wants to get rid of the original grandä¸»

381
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
Execute!

382
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,160
Qi Xiang.

383
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,040
His Highness has arrived.

384
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,760
Qi Xiang, no!

385
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,560
The horse is deaf.

386
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,800
They are going to command me.

387
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,320
Don't be afraid, Cousin.

388
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,160
I'm here.

389
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,920
No one will bully you again.

390
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
Qi, let them go.

391
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,840
What are you doing here?

392
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,920
What are you doing?

393
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,800
Stop!

394
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,200
What are you doing?

395
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,240
What are you doing?

396
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,800
Qi, I'm telling you.

397
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,480
His Majesty has ordered

398
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,080
to pardon all the crimes of my cousin.

399
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,880
If you lose them,

400
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
just let them go.

401
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,280
Where is the imperial edict?

402
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,400
Here?

403
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,160
Where is the edict?

404
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,960
It was written by the central secretary.

405
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,360
He was sent by the central secretary.

406
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,520
He was on his way here

407
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,440
on horseback.

408
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,560
So, it's not here.

409
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,080
Kill them!

410
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,000
Guards!

411
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,120
Guards!

412
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,000
Guards!

413
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,320
Your Highness, it's me.

414
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,680
Guards!

415
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,280
Isn't this

416
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,400
Minister Song of the Ministry of War

417
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,000
and Minister Song of the Ministry of War?

418
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,880
Why are you late?

419
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm so worried.

420
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,680
No, Minister Song.

421
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,720
Why are you in this state?

422
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,600
Are you a thief

423
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,960
on the road?

424
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,120
No.

425
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,280
I'm dressed like this

426
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,840
to visit people

427
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,280
and investigate people's feelings.

428
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,400
The guard who came back last night

429
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,200
is a beggar with a bad look

430
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,160
and he's hiding in the restaurant in the west of the city.

431
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,200
Could it be

432
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,320
Minister Song?

433
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,280
So, you've been here long time ago.

434
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,600
I was wrong.

435
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,080
No, no.

436
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,280
Minister Song,

437
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,000
you came here last night.

438
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,200
Why did you show up at this moment?

439
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,400
Well,

440
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,320
I caught a cold last night.

441
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,600
I've been in a coma for a day.

442
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,880
I'm still a little bit sleepy.

443
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,560
Brother 18th,

444
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,040
don't you understand?

445
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,920
Minister Song is hiding in the dark

446
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,080
waiting for you to help Chu Guihong.

447
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,920
Minister Song,

448
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,160
are you trying to

449
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,800
see me show up in public?

450
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,520
Actually,

451
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,440
Minister Song

452
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,240
wants to see the brotherly love

453
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,160
and then

454
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,040
take advantage of the power of the fish.

455
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,400
I didn't.

456
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,320
What are you doing?

457
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,040
His Majesty's order.

458
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,320
Let's read the poem for the court.

459
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,500
Song Zhengyi

460
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,400
How dare you!

461
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,560
You're alive and well.

462
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Obey the order of Sitting Down.

463
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,680
Start the case of his Mt. Your Majesty.

464
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,880
Now,

465
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,440
thousands of people

466
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,200
will beÃºtÃ­ce werden,

467
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,520
killed

468
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,400
in public.

469
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,520
Ten thousands of people

470
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,720
were killed

471
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,720
I'm sorry for not following your order.

472
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,040
I...

473
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,960
Your Highness,

474
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,640
are you trying to disobey the imperial decree?

475
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
The general is out,

476
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,760
and the soldiers are at risk.

477
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,520
His Majesty is always worried

478
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,560
about the general being out.

479
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,320
I can share your worries.

480
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,760
How?

481
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,160
As long as His Majesty can send me back to the capital,

482
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,560
I'm willing to take my own soldiers

483
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,200
to take the general back to the capital.

484
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,080
Oh no.

485
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,240
My father is involved in this too?

486
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,000
You're His Majesty's young man.

487
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,840
You're the most important person in His Majesty's life.

488
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,080
Since the late Empress passed away,

489
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,200
His Majesty has been very concerned.

490
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,880
He rarely goes out except for the court meeting.

491
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,720
He's the only one who deserves to be trusted.

492
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,160
Isn't it good to be a rich man?

493
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,600
It has to be about the court meeting.

494
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,560
I want to escape,

495
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,760
but my team can't.

496
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,200
From now on,

497
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,440
there's only one rule.

498
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,960
That is to clear the boundary with all the men of the south.

499
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,160
If you don't want to die in Nan Heng's hands,

500
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,280
you have to stop him.

501
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,160
That's the first rule.

502
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,040
Run!

503
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,640
Run!

504
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,400
Run!

505
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,120
Run!

506
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
Run!

507
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,040
Run!

508
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,040
Run!

509
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
Run!

510
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,760
The leader of the Black Armor Army,

511
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,600
Prince Qi, returned to Nan Heng's capital.

512
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,360
The court was in a state of panic.

513
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,640
In the capital,

514
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,360
His Majesty favored the son of the late Empress,

515
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,560
Prince Teng Nanrui.

516
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,400
However, Nan Heng and his mother's family are of high status.

517
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,880
His Majesty is afraid.

518
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,520
The matter is that

519
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,720
since the time the cavalry entered the city gate,

520
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,680
a stormy storm is about to come.

521
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,400
Mother, I'm going to die.

522
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,200
Don't say that.

523
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,800
Zhao Yu is ahead.

524
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,640
Bring him out.

525
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,960
Your Highness, we took him away.

526
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,880
General Chu.

527
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,080
You suffered.

528
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,120
General Chu.

529
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,760
General Chu.

530
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,480
General Chu.

531
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,280
General Chu.

532
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:42,880
General Chu.

533
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,520
General Chu.

534
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,120
General Chu.

535
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,680
General Chu.

536
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,560
General Chu.

537
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,160
Everyone, get up.

538
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,280
Don't make a big deal.

539
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,560
General Chu has fought for the country for many years.

540
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,360
Now he was killed by someone.

541
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,720
He's been broken into pieces.

542
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,160
This is a great injustice.

543
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,160
General Chu, we are innocent.

544
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,680
General Chu, we are innocent.

545
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,320
Shut up.

546
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,800
Where did these scoundrels come from?

547
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,800
The hero who took back the army of He Yuan people

548
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,120
is the Seventh Prince, who is no one can beat.

549
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,000
If it weren't for the great plan of Seventh Prince,

550
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,760
Chu Guihong would have died under the sword of He Yuan people.

551
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,000
He wouldn't let you guys take the blame for him.

552
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,120
You are talking nonsense.

553
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,240
I...

554
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,840
Your Highness, I can understand what you mean.

555
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,920
What does it mean to save the dog and the cat?

556
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,840
Your Highness, be careful.

557
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,200
I know it's a bad luck.

558
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,600
No one will be heartbroken.

559
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,240
Stop.

560
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,440
Stop.

561
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,120
You won't be on your peak again.

562
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,560
NÃ£o folder,

563
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,440
We only have the dial Trident commemorator

564
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,600
Mo moment,

565
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,520
Another matter will be received by

566
00:26:44,600 --> 00:27:01,540
The limit called by the

567
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,640
Yuan Yi explode

568
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,760
How can you be so capable,

569
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,960
King of Wei?

570
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,940
How can you be that Kundenkaie

571
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,260
who calls for iron?

572
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,760
ÏÎ¬c words

573
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,000
Re Ð½ÐµÐ³Ð¾ cruel

574
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Your Majesty, I'm glad that you are well.

575
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Rui,

576
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
there is a rumor in the capital recently.

577
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Have you heard about it?

578
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I don't know. I'm willing to hear about it.

579
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Everyone said that the murderer

580
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
was a man of great virtue.

581
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But I don't know.

582
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I don't know what he's thinking.

583
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Everyone said that the murderer

584
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
was a man of great virtue.

585
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
He was a traitor.

586
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
He used the murder as a way

587
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
to kill the King of Qianyu.

588
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
He also gathered the four cities around the border.

589
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
If this is true,

590
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
what should he be punished for?

591
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
A traitor is a sin.

592
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
He deserves to be killed.

593
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
He deserves to be killed.

594
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Your Majesty,

595
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
if I really know the traitor,

596
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
how can I kill the first general of He Yuan

597
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
in front of thousands of people?

598
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Fang Shiming.

599
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yes, father.

600
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
He killed Fang Shiming

601
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and stole Fang Shiming's Han Yue knife.

602
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I saw that knife with my own eyes.

603
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It's a rare report.

604
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Han Yue knife is real.

605
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Fang Shiming is a substitute, right?

606
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Otherwise, the first general of He Yuan

607
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
would be so ungrateful.

608
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Then,

609
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
a traitor is a sin.

610
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
He deserves to be killed.

611
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
He deserves to be killed.

612
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Your Majesty,

613
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
if I really know the traitor,

614
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
how can I take 300 soldiers

615
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
to return to the capital?

616
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Yes, father.

617
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
He only has such little soldiers.

618
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
He wants to kill me.

619
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
How can I let you do that?

620
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
A tiger can't eat its own son.

621
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Moreover,

622
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
his Black Armor is still at the border.

623
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
The only one who can fight against the Black Armor

624
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
is Qian Yujun.

625
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
But he died in the battle of Pingrong.

626
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
He hasn't recovered yet.

627
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Then...

628
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It's impossible to kill a brave soldier.

629
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
He deserves to be killed.

630
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
He deserves to be killed.

631
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Your Majesty,

632
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
my Black Armor is at the border

633
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
to prevent He Yuan from invading again.

634
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Now,

635
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
who did His Majesty promise?

636
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
The emperor, Wu Xiyan.

637
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

638
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
The emperor, Wu Xiyan.

639
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Since you have promised him,

640
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
how can you just go back on your word?

641
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
He has already come to the gate.

642
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You're still speaking for him.

643
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I...

644
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Isn't he always kneeling here?

645
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Is this also called coming to the gate?

646
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Can't you see?

647
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Although he is kneeling,

648
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
he is higher than you standing.

649
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
How is that possible?

650
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Father, about this kind of thing,

651
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
we both have our own reasons.

652
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Although he has long legs,

653
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I have long legs.

654
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Father, please look at this.

655
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Father, please look at this.

656
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
We both kneel and stand on one side.

657
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
No, I'm a little more fierce than him.

658
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
You fool.

659
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It's not good to stand on one side.

660
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's not good to stand on one side.

661
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Ren'er, don't kneel.

662
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Get up.

663
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Find a place for him outside the city.

664
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Tell him not to enter the palace at all times.

665
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

666
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Father, please wait.

667
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You...

668
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You haven't finished drawing the tiger and the mouse.

669
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Father, look.

670
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
By the way,

671
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
my drawing

672
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
is just a sword that can't be opened.

673
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Since you are so capable,

674
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
how about you make it up to me?

675
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Father, actually, this kind of little thing,

676
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I can also draw.

677
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
The book is full of love, but also has a loss.

678
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I'm going to let Song Yu De teach you to read history books

679
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
and learn the way to govern the country of the previous generations.

680
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Okay, I will definitely work hard.

681
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,860
I'm happy to teach you both

682
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:37,000
this kind of thinking when both of you ÐÐ± stukÐ¸Ð²

683
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,500
the fire is tents in the gather

684
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,560
the remains scald in the comments

685
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,120
whose fault

686
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And.

687
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,720
Your Highness.

688
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,720
Even if 18th Prince

689
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,200
has the help of Song Yu De and Chu Gui Hong

690
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,320
he can't compare with you

691
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,280
Think about that year

692
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,760
When I was 16, I went to the battlefield alone

693
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,760
and became famous

694
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,120
When I was 17, I pacified the war in the capital

695
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,800
When I was 18, I conquered the border of the seven states

696
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,400
When I was 19, I took the first general of the East Shu

697
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,200
I dare to ask the princes of the whole dynasty

698
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,040
who has such a great power

699
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,600
Moreover, the prime minister of the day

700
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,000
is your uncle

701
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,440
He is going to the two sides of the disaster with your help

702
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,840
Yu Ning's reputation is definitely

703
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,520
Enough

704
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,840
How much do you know about Song Yu De?

705
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,880
I don't know much about him

706
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,560
I only know that he is the head of the six departments

707
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
He is very important to His Majesty

708
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,560
I also heard that

709
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,800
Lord Song is a man of Chu family

710
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,840
He is good at meeting other lords

711
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,400
This old fox

712
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,640
He is determined to help Chu Gui Hong

713
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,840
but he is a coward

714
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,840
He only knows to be kind and generous

715
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,000
And all these years

716
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,440
He has never had any connection with 18

717
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,400
Your Highness, do you want to drag him down?

718
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,920
I want him to take the initiative

719
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,120
It's not that easy to bring him back

720
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,840
But

721
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,920
He has two daughters

722
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,840
Your Highness, you mean

723
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,080
Gao Zhou

724
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,440
I also heard that Lord Song loves women like his life

725
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,040
This big one is weak and sick

726
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,120
He has a motherly nature

727
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:03,760
He is soft and

728
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,200
He is soft and

729
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,160
He dares not to go against

730
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,080
But this little one

731
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,880
Although he was born in the Ji family

732
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,120
But he is also talented

733
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,520
And he is very beautiful

734
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,680
If he is going to enter the Wang family in the future

735
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,120
Even for his precious daughter

736
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,160
This old man

737
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,520
He won't be able to turn his back on others, right?

738
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,280
Wrong

739
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,920
What?

740
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,080
I want the eldest daughter of the Song family

741
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,720
Think about it

742
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,120
A lonely girl who has been lost since childhood

743
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,000
She is living under the hand of the Ji family

744
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,360
I don't know how many times she died

745
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,960
But now

746
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,600
Not only is she alive

747
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,800
She is also raised to be a soft and mischievous

748
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,360
And she is always crying

749
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,040
Why do you say this?

750
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,080
The eldest daughter of the Song family is very skillful

751
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,360
Wrong again

752
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,840
Just a weak girl

753
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,280
How can you fight those

754
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:16,280
High-ranking

755
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,200
I know that you love girls like your life

756
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,480
But I don't know

757
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,960
These five fingers are still long and short

758
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,840
It's still the crown prince

759
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,880
No one can be as good as the common people

760
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,720
Tomorrow is Mother's Day

761
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,240
You arrange it

762
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,800
Be sure to bring the eldest daughter of the Song family

763
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,120
Bring it to me

764
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,640
Yes

765
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,440
The girl said the opposite

766
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,680
Finally done

767
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,720
rides

768
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,440
Man bonge

769
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,720
Up

770
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,760
Up

771
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,000
Miss

772
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,480
You have been writing the starch candy for a day

773
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,240
What are these?

774
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,440
It's a plot.

775
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,720
There are Yao Qin, Yu Qin, Qi Xian Qin in our mansion.

776
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,720
What is this plot?

777
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,680
It's a plot.

778
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,480
I made it for the PPT.

779
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,080
It's a life-saving thing.

780
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,680
Miss.

781
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,920
You've been talking about weird things lately.

782
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,480
You've been doing something mysterious.

783
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,840
We don't know what you're doing.

784
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,160
Could it be that the previous doctor hasn't recovered yet?

785
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,720
Or should I ask the doctor to give me some sedatives?

786
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,600
Don't be so hard on me, Yingqiu.

787
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,160
I'm much stronger than you.

788
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,960
For the tragedy and fate in the original script,

789
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,960
I've finally broken my heart.

790
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,720
I didn't think I'd work so hard when I was in the college entrance exam.

791
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,360
Miss.

792
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,640
I forgot about this.

793
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,800
This is the invitation sent by Noble Consort Gao from the palace.

794
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,080
She invites you and Miss to go to the imperial garden tomorrow to attend the flower banquet.

795
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,200
Stop.

796
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
Don't.

797
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,480
This is the flower banquet.

798
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,680
It's the trap that made Song Yimeng fall into the devil's trap.

799
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,960
Take it away.

800
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,520
Tell her I'm sick.

801
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,480
Tell her I'm very ill.

802
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,880
I'm dying.

803
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,560
Go.

804
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,520
Go.

805
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,240
Miss.

806
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,520
What are you doing?

807
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,840
Miss, don't listen to him.

808
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,840
I'm not listening to him.

809
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,000
Don't scare me.

810
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,760
I'm not scared.

811
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,160
Are you listening to me?

812
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,320
I'm asking you, are you listening to me?

813
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,240
I'm not a woman.

814
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,040
I'm not a woman.

815
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,320
I can only be a tool, right?

816
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,200
Miss, don't be so mean.

817
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,320
Don't be so mean.

818
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,280
I'm not a woman.

819
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,240
I'm not a woman.

820
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,240
Let me go.

821
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,240
Go.

822
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,240
Go.

823
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,240
Go.

824
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,240
Go.

825
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,240
Go.

826
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,240
Go.

827
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,960
Brother, you're so annoying.

828
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,800
Brother, you're a woman.

829
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
I said you're the only one.

830
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,640
You don't even have a name.

831
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,480
You don't have to be so patient.

832
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,360
Brother, you're so annoying.

833
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,120
You're a woman.

834
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,120
Go away.

835
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,120
Go away.

836
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,600
Brother, I'm just an ordinary person.

837
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,000
I just want to live my life.

838
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm not a woman.

839
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,840
Hurry up.

840
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,840
Hurry up.

841
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Hurry up.

842
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,840
Hurry up.

843
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,840
Hurry up.

844
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,840
Hurry up.

845
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,440
Help.

846
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,840
Your Highness, the matter has been settled.

847
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,240
Elder Song's daughter, Yi Qinggong.

848
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,840
Bring her in.

849
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,560
Yes.

850
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,840
What's going on?

851
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,840
What's going on?

852
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,440
Xiang,

853
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,440
you must protect me later.

854
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,040
I haven't shown up in public for a long time.

855
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,440
I'm afraid that the ladies in the capital are too excited.

856
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,840
They're so excited that they're trying to frame me.

857
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,440
If something goes wrong,

858
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,440
I'm afraid it's not good.

859
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,440
Come on, over there.

860
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,840
This is so weird.

861
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,240
Ji Xiang, did you see that?

862
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,240
I didn't see that.

863
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,440
These two girls are so smart.

864
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,840
They know that I'm always low-key.

865
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,840
They don't like to show off.

866
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,440
Not bad.

867
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,240
Yes, I came here today

868
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,240
for the two girls of the Song family.

869
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,240
If I put on some pretty flowers,

870
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,240
it won't be beautiful.

871
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,440
By the way, Ji Xiang,

872
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,440
have you seen the girls of the Song family?

873
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,440
Where are they?

874
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,240
It's Miss Song.

875
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,240
Miss Song, who is famous in the capital,

876
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,840
is really famous in the capital.

877
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,840
The family is like a fish,

878
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,640
it's so familiar.

879
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,840
Xiang,

880
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,840
it's time to give her

881
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,040
a chance to get close to me.

882
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
His Highness ordered that

883
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,040
the girls should go over there to talk.

884
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,240
His Highness ordered that

885
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,240
the girls must be invited to him today.

886
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,840
Brothers, it's like this.

887
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,440
I'm hungry today.

888
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,240
I'll go to His Highness later.

889
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,240
I'll go to him later.

890
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
I'm sorry.

891
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,240
I'm sorry.

892
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,240
I made a mistake.

893
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,240
Isn't it bad?

894
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,240
I'm sorry.

895
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,640
I'll go to His Highness.

896
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,640
His Highness ordered that

897
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,640
we dare not disobey.

898
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,240
Miss, please.

899
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,840
Miss Song,

900
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,240
Xiao Ke is young and beautiful.

901
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,440
She is good at writing poems.

902
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,840
Xiao Ke is a middle-class woman.

903
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,440
She has thousands of family members.

904
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,440
What's the family?

905
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,640
My parents passed away last year.

906
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,040
If you are willing to marry,

907
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,440
there will be no dispute about your marriage.

908
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,840
The water is clear and the flowers are not a good match.

909
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,640
Xiang,

910
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,840
you have to listen to me

911
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,640
about love.

912
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,840
The more competitors there are,

913
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,840
the more I am a man of great talent.

914
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,240
I have great ability.

915
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,440
Isn't this the daughter of

916
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,440
Minister Song of the Ministry of War,

917
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,240
Minister Song of the Ministry of War,

918
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,240
Song Yiting of the Ministry of War?

919
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,840
She is a commoner,

920
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,240
but not a commoner.

921
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,840
I really admire her.

922
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,640
Greetings, Your Highness.

923
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

924
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,240
I am a commoner.

925
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,840
My name is Xiang Rui.

926
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,440
I am a man.

927
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,840
I am the man of the Rui family.

928
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,840
When I was born,

929
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,840
the sky was full of clouds.

930
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,240
My name is Xiang Rui.

931
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,640
My name is Nan Rui.

932
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,840
I'm wondering if I can

933
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,640
invite Miss Song to your marriage.

934
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,440
Your Highness,

935
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,440
I don't like to say things.

936
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,200
Is it okay?

937
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,200
Still want to play?

938
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,920
Sorry, I got it wrong.

939
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,400
I have other colors.

940
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,880
Your Highness.

941
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,680
The chrysanthemum is chrysanthemum.

942
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,640
I don't like any color.

943
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,440
I like the hero boy

944
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,360
who is the best in the world.

945
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,120
Not the son of a noble prince.

946
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,560
Goodbye.

947
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,200
I...

948
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,240
No.

949
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,640
You are such a person.

950
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,880
You should be in touch.

951
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,800
Look at the posture.

952
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,760
It's like dragging me to the plot.

953
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,520
No, no.

954
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,760
I have to die here

955
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,840
after seeing Nan Heng.

956
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,640
It's only been a few days.

957
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,000
My good life has just started.

958
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,920
Isn't this Liu Meishi?

959
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,280
The actor's information shows that he plays Jia Ruoruo.

960
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,000
But he always looks down on Song Yimeng.

961
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,920
Only with magic can he defeat the magic.

962
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,720
Now everyone is pushing the plot.

963
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,320
Jia Ruoruo is a traitor.

964
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,080
Using the traitor

965
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,440
can definitely stop the plot.

966
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,520
Why am I so unlucky?

967
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,680
I met such a bad person

968
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,280
as soon as I went out.

969
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,640
Song Yimeng.

970
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,880
What's wrong with you recently?

971
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,240
You usually cry

972
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,640
when you meet someone.

973
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,520
Why are you talking like that today?

974
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,960
Xuan Jiajun?

975
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,760
The man of Seventh Prince?

976
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,360
I told you clearly.

977
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,120
Today, Seventh Prince

978
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,400
invited me to go there.

979
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,520
Are you crazy?

980
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,440
Seventh Prince dares to talk about it?

981
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,520
What should I do?

982
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,400
In the past,

983
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,160
it was Chu Gui Hong who wanted to marry me.

984
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,200
Now,

985
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,960
it's Seventh Prince who wants to marry me.

986
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,320
Why am I

987
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,080
so lucky?

988
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,000
Lucky?

989
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,760
I think it's hard to protect your life.

990
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,600
Why did you close the door and open the door?

991
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,520
Shouldn't you fight with me?

992
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,360
Jia Ruoruo.

993
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,880
Aren't you angry?

994
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,840
Don't you want to drag me to your little dark room

995
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,960
and fight with me?

996
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,760
What?

997
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,920
You must be confused.

998
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,680
You're thinking about it.

999
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,960
This is in the palace.

1000
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,120
Watch out for the board.

1001
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,280
I haven't finished yet.

1002
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,240
Jia Ruoruo.

1003
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,200
You really don't consider

1004
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,840
locking me up in a little dark room?

1005
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,840
Then let's fight.

1006
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,480
What's going on?

1007
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,880
Why isn't it moving?

1008
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,880
Help!

1009
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,480
Someone is killed!
