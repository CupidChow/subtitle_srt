rarely enters the palace,

6
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,350
and there's no sign that

7
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,410
she pays attention to or inquires about
Your Highness.

8
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,360
What she said today

9
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,470
is probably true.

Yet a reclusive lady, who rarely steps
outside her chambers,

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,680

the alliance with Miss Song...

27

coming back to court.

No wonder Father also suspected that Heng
colluded with the enemy and betrayed us.

Why do you think
a villain is called a villain?

209

Because they resort to killing
at the slightest disagreement.

Then tell the good guy.

Unless

344
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,390
you can tell me

345
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,240
what exactly is explained

346
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,510
in the method of weapon forging.

347
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,960
As long as you can tell me that,

348
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
I'll believe you.

349
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,910
Yimeng.

350
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,360
I've been completely open with you.

351
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,670
But this one thing,

352
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,560
I'm afraid I can't share.

353
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,300
Nan Heng.

354
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,080
Nan Heng...

355
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,000
If you have anything to settle,
take it out on me.

356
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,260
Leave Yimeng out of it!

357
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,480
Chu Guihong.

358
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,480
Escaping prison illegally

359
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,630
is already a capital offense.

360
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,240
You can barely protect yourself,

361
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,840
and yet you're trying to protect
someone else?

362
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,520
You escaped prison to see me?

363
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,510
Why?

364
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,230
Because the guards in the
imperial prison said...

365
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,890
It was you.

366
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,010
I can't believe how dumb you are.

367
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,990
It only took a few words to get you

368
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,950
riled up to break out.

369
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,020
I thought you'd be clueless forever.

370
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,980
Chu Guihong.

371
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,250
He must have tricked you to escape prison

372
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,590
so that he could convict you.

373
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,030
Don't fall into his trap.

374
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,940
Miss Song, you're indeed smart.

375
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,630
But escaping prison

376
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,620
is already a capital offense.

377
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,000
Chu Guihong!

378
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,030
You escaped prison illegally,

379
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,240
abducted the daughter of
the Minister of War,

380
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,700
and acted with ill intent.

381
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,240
Execute him!

382
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,110
Run!

383
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,920
Did you see that?

384
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,800
His Highness swooshed over in a blink.

385
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,859
What's going on?

386
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,790
Nan Heng wanted to kill me,

387
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,069
but he changed his mind halfway?

388
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,829
Song Yimeng.

389
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,089
What on earth did you do to me?

390
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,510
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

391
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,400
I didn't do anything.

392
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
I didn't move at all, Your Highness.

393
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,790
This woman is peculiar. If I
don't kill her,

394
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,550
she'll be a big trouble in the future.

395
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,849
I'm dying!

396
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,190
Help!

397
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,050
Help!

398
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,790
Yimeng!

399
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,460
Yimeng, are you alright?

400
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,830
Song Yimeng.

401
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,070
Come here.

402
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,150
The illustrious Seventh Prince

403
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,830
actually went so far as to
ruthlessly kill a woman.

404
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,720
Nan Heng.

405
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,460
Do you really want to go all out
and fight to the death today?

406
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,410
So what if I do?

407
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,270
All of you, stop it!

408
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,640
Your Highness.

409
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,070
Taking Song Yimeng down today amid

410
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,160
all this disorder today seems improbable,

411
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,590
especially with your injuries.

412
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,720
Don't be impulsive.

413
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,510
Guihong!

414
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,440
Guihong.

415
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,200
Guihong.

416
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,580
Your Highness.

417
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,440
Guihong, are you alright?

418
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,750
I rushed here as soon as I received

419
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,000
news about your jailbreak.

420
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,680
I'm okay.

421
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,780
It's just I fell into his trap

422
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,020
and escaped prison first.

423
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,880
Are you hurt?

424
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,440
If he dares to hurt you, I...

425
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,720
Heng.

426
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,910
Even if my cousin, Guihong,
escaped prison,

427
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,720
it should be the business of
the Ministry of Justice

428
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,070
and the Court of Judicial Review.

429
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,400
What are you trying to do here,

430
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,240
bringing so many Xuanjia soldiers

431
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,920
to hunt him down without due process?

432
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,450
Aren't you worried that Father
will find out?

433
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,030
You misunderstood, Rui.

434
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,350
I came here today

435
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,700
at Miss Song's invitation.

436
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,900
Miss Song,

437
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,720
am I right?

438
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,240
I...

439
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,680
You're lying.

440
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,640
It was you who gave the order
to have me ambushed just now

441
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,040
and even tried to kill Yimeng
with an arrow.

442
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,680
Chu Guihong.

443
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,550
You escaped prison illegally

444
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:40,350
and had private contact with
the Minister's daughter here.

445
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,750
It won't be good for anyone
if this gets out.

446
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,440
Why don't we

447
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,230
just drop it today?

448
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,480
Let's forget

449
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,880
this ever happened.

450
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,960
Miss Song.

451
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,370
The deal between us

452
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,510
is still valid.

453
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,920
It's better to have one more ally
than enemy.

454
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,440
I can actually help you get it.

455
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,200
Miss Song, I'll count on you

456
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,110
to help me more in the future.

457
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,240
The script didn't write about

458
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,980
Chu Guihong's jailbreak.

459
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,400
It seems this is also a change

460
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,620
I brought about by coming here.

461
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,000
If Chu Guihong and I

462
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,550
end up in trouble too soon by accident,

463
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,150
wouldn't that be more trouble
than it's worth?

464
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,410
We can't just let this slide!

465
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,680
Stop it.

466
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,440
Guihong.

467
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,110
The imperial prison is in chaos now,

468
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,200
and the imperial edict to release you

469
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,440
will be issued in no time.

470
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,750
You mustn't act recklessly at
a time like this.

471
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,740
Come back with me.

472
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,700
Your Highnesses, both of you are right.

473
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,160
This was merely a misunderstanding.

474
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,460
Chu Guihong didn't escape prison,

475
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,350
and the Seventh Prince

476
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,440
didn't try to kill me.

477
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,720
This was all just a joke.

478
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,230
Just a joke.

479
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,880
General Chu, you should leave now.

480
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,400
Go.

481
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,000
Yimeng.

482
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,960
Don't worry.

483
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,920
I will be fine.

484
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,160
My father knows I'm here.

485
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,640
His Highness is so smart.

486
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,880
I'm sure he won't let anything
happen to me,

487
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,550
right?

488
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,370
Yimeng.

489
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,070
You...

490
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,840
You...

491
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,240
Heng, listen.

492
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,400
You... Look how seriously injured you are.

493
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,750
Go back now and recuperate.

494
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,390
Let's go, Guihong.

495
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,020
Yimeng.

496
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:00,680
Yimeng.

497
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,500
Hurry up.

498
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,010
Yimeng!

499
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,600
Let's go.

500
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,610
Hurry up!

501
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,740
What are you looking at?

502
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,720
I...

503
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,270
If you didn't look at me,

504
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,400
how would you know I was looking at you?

505
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,040
If it weren't for certain people
being ruthless,

506
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,210
forming alliances on the surface while

507
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,780
plotting to silence us behind our backs,

508
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,020
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

509
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,690
Your blood!

510
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,420
Now you're scared?

511
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,830
You were pretty bold just now

512
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,430
when you were lying to me, weren't you?

513
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,000
What did I lie to you about,
Your Highness?

514
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,550
I've told you,

515
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,200
your injury has nothing to do with me.

516
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,220
Why won't you trust me?

517
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,180
Don't think I don't know

518
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,650
what you said to Chu Guihong just now.

519
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,540
Don't mind what I told him.

520
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,100
As long as Your Highness cooperates
with me properly,

521
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,640
I'll definitely fulfill all the promises
I made to you.

522
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,550
But if you don't cooperate
with me properly

523
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,960
like just now

524
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,020
and insist on toughing it out with me,

525
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,420
I'll...

526
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,000
What are you doing?

527
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,350
So what if

528
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,000
I'll tough it out with you?

529
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,590
Y-Your Highness, you...

530
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,440
Are you trying to take advantage of me?

531
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,470
Let me tell you.

532
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,000
Everyone saw it just now.

533
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,350
I was last seen with you.

534
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,920
If I don't return safely to the
Song family,

535
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,680
m-my father and...

536
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,550
Chu Guihong won't let you go.

537
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,640
I don't care about them at all.

538
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,190
Besides, don't forget that

539
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,680
I have evidence of Chu Guihong's

540
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,790
jailbreak in my hands.

541
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,180
I advise you

542
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,860
to behave yourself.

543
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,190
Be good.

544
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,170
Your Highness, it's time to go.

545
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,000
Shall we escort Miss Song back
to her residence first?

546
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,960
Sure, please do.

547
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,170
She's not going back home.

548
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,550
She's coming to my residence.

549
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,790
When did I ever say that?

550
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,740
Shut up!

551
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,160
Let's go!

552
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,270
Bye-bye, you.

553
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,850
I-I'll go in myself.

554
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,150
Please don't bother.

555
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,070
[Seventh Prince's Mansion]

556
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,310
Seventh... Prince's... Mansion.

557
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,160
[Seventh Prince's Mansion]

558
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,770
This plaque...

559
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
Seriously?

560
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,720
When His Majesty granted

561
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,880
the Seventh Prince this mansion,

562
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,960
this plaque was already here.

563
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,090
What's the problem?

564
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,410
Go in!

565
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,520
Seven Prince's Mansion.

566
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,060
[Imperial Prison]

567
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,710
Chu Guihong, Lieutenant General
of the Qianyu Army,

568
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,830
recently suffered a defeat in battle,
causing much uproar among the ranks.

569
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,720
However, I, mindful of your years of
loyal service to the nation

570
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,120
and your dedicated duty,

571
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,350
hereby pardon you and order your
immediate release to return home.

572
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,110
General!

573
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,680
-General!
-General!

574
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,110
Guihong.

575
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,820
[Imperial Prison]

576
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,000
You're finally released.

577
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,350
Come on.

578
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,070
Don't move.

579
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,270
Here.

580
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,640
Put this on.

581
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,780
Your Highness.

582
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,270
I don't think this kind of
supernatural thing

583
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,470
is necessary.

584
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,280
Don't you talk nonsense.

585
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,720
Pardon us. Pardon us.

586
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,050
Please take no offense.

587
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,000
You have no idea.

588
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,640
This is a protective talisman

589
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,640
specially against petty troublemakers
that I obtained

590
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,510
from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

591
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,350
Father

592
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,750
forcibly overruled Chancellor Gao

593
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,830
and had the Secretariat issue a decree
to release you,

594
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,720
so that you could return to the court.

595
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,350
Now that

596
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,480
you've got out of the imperial prison,

597
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,030
you must get rid of the bad luck.

598
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,690
Your good days are yet to come.

599
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
Come on. Put it on.

600
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,790
Alright. Alright.

601
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,640
I'll take it.

602
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,480
Okay.

603
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,160
General.

604
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,470
-General.
-General.

605
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,240
How did she do that?

606
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,990
She's used sorcery several times.

607
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,660
She must be up to something.

608
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,850
What exactly is he trying to do?

609
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,270
One moment he wants to cooperate,

610
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,270
the next he wants to kill me,

611
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,780
then he wants to cooperate again.

612
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,440
Could he have a split personality
or something?

613
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,060
Well, Your Highness.

614
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,520
If I'm guilty,

615
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,350
just give me a swift verdict.

616
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,590
Although your eyes can't kill,

617
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,240
you...

618
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,930
The way you keep staring at me,

619
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,530
it's seriously creeping me out.

620
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,550
Don't worry.

621
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,680
I'll definitely give you a swift verdict

622
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,480
within today.

623
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,300
Don't make it today then.

624
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,440
I'm actually

625
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,670
not in such a hurry.

626
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,160
But I am.

627
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,780
Your Highness.

628
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,830
Everything is ready.

629
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,240
Miss Song.

630
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,690
Please.

631
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,680
Nan Heng.

632
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,440
How can you do this to me?

633
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,350
Is this how you do things?

634
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,350
Some ally you are!

635
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,550
R-Release me already!

636
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,620
Do you hear me?

637
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,100
I'm exhausted.

638
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,800
Your Highness.

639
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,070
I've cleared out all the idle people
in the mansion.

640
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,820
Nothing from today

641
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,510
will get out.

642
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,720
Good.

643
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,390
I think

644
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,910
it's the weapon that's the issue.

645
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,720
As long as I don't use a bow,
it should work.

646
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,510
Okay.

647
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,370
How about this?

648
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,420
It's extremely lethal.

649
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,160
Your Highness!

650
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,120
Your Highness, stop!

651
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,600
You're serious?

652
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,190
One shot to death.

653
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,510
One shot to death?

654
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,210
She's just a defenseless woman.

655
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,520
Must we go this far?

656
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,560
So you want to torture her, Your Highness?

657
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,660
Use this.

658
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,920
She'll bleed to death

659
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
in seven days.

660
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,240
This is so scary.

661
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,040
She has to suffer for seven days.

662
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,920
If you think it's too long,

663
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,040
what about this?

664
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,440
Three days.

665
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,800
It only takes three days.

666
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,600
Enough. I'll choose for myself.

667
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,750
This is even worse.

668
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,160
This will do.

669
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,050
What is this?

670
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,030
Y-Your Highness.

671
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,550
Let's talk nicely.

672
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,880
Please, calm down.

673
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,110
Good for you, huh, Nan Heng?

674
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,330
A monster in human skin.

675
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,280
So heartless and ruthless.

676
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,590
What should I do?

677
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,270
Am I really going to die here?

678
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,220
Oh my god.

679
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,200
Oh my.

680
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,010
Oh my.

681
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,160
I was almost scared to death.

682
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,510
Your Highness.

683
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,900
Your Highness.

684
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,000
