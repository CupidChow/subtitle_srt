172
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,630
and Chancellor Gao's followers,

173
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,480
instead of going after Shangguan He

174
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,830
and the Nightwalkers.

175
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,760
You've been fighting Xuanjia Army

176
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,610
for personal vendettas.

177
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,750
What you're doing

178
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,550
will only destabilize
the Great Jing government.

179
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,480
The theft in Jiangnan Province

180
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,330
was handled by me in person.

181
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,540
Today, I'm overseeing
the execution in person too.

182
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,680
People will still have doubts

183
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,370
until we find out the truth of the case.

184
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,400
However, at this point,

185
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,090
if this strife continues,

186
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,210
the problem will never go away.

187
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,890
Therefore, General Chu,

188
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,190
I suggest

189
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,240
holding all these people

190
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,550
under detention now.

191
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,390
When the Emperor is informed,
and the truth is out,

192
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,190
there will be a final judgement.

193
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
What do you think?

194
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,440
Please hear me out, Song Yimeng.

195
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,370
You shouldn't be explaining to me,

196
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,570
but to the Nightwalkers who trust you.

197
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,950
On the eve before this action,

198
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,830
they were still defending you.

199
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,710
Shanhu said

200
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,210
you must have your own reason,

201
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,860
and that you would always be their chief,

202
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,280
no matter who you are,

203
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,440
since you had saved their lives.

204
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,100
Treating others' care for you as nothing

205
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,920
is what you enjoy doing,

206
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,080
isn't it?

207
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,720
I did betray their trust...

208
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,920
The truth of the theft three years ago

209
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,480
is perhaps unknown to

210
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,040
Chu Guihong and the Emperor.

211
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,100
But what about you?

212
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,930
Can you deny knowing the truth?

213
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,030
I do know it.

214
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,740
You'd rather endanger the Nightwalkers

215
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,270
than explore the option

216
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,360
of bringing Gao Changyin to justice

217
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,560
or presenting the truth to the Emperor.

218
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,730
Chu Guihong says
you have a wicked soul

219
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,440
and diabolical ambitions.

220
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,960
Is he really wrong?

221
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,540
You've asked many times for my trust.

222
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,200
But what should I trust about you?

223
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,820
Many of the Nightwalkers

224
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,900
are victims of Gao Changyin's crimes.

225
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,480
And you...

226
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,170
On one hand, you're the Seventh Prince,

227
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,810
harming innocent people.

228
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
On the other hand, you're Li Shiliu,

229
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,650
making amends for your mistakes.

230
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,720
You know what?

231
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,680
This is called hypocrisy.

232
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,270
I just want them to have a home.

233
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,200
I can even let them...

234
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,960
Stop it.

235
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,240
Nan Heng,

236
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,600
don't even bother.

237
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,240
Just be the high and mighty
Seventh Prince.

238
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,440
I can't speak for others,

239
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,370
but I just want to remember
the kind and righteous Mr. Li,

240
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,930
instead of you,

241
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,670
an unscrupulous person.

242
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,560
Take all those who attempted
to rescue the criminal

243
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,320
to the capital prefecture's prison!

244
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,050
-Yes!
-Yes!

245
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,360
It was the Seventh Prince

246
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,030
who ordered to hold us in detention.

247
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,790
We should be brought to his place.

248
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,030
Who are you to make decisions?

249
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,290
What kind of gibberish...

250
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,140
Enough, guys.

251
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,870
Listen,

252
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,900
we're all familiar with each other.

253
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,120
It's unnecessary to create tension.

254
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,480
Otherwise...

255
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,870
You're on death row.

256
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,480
Who are you to tell me what to do?

257
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,390
Do you think

258
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,000
you can stop all of us?

259
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,240
I was looking for a reason to fight.

260
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,480
Come at me, I dare you!

261
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,270
Hold on.

262
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,270
You guys go with Rong Hua

263
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,000
to the capital prefecture's office.

264
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,790
Chief...

265
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,370
Your Highness.

266
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,370
What are you trying to do?

267
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,260
It's time to set things right.

268
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,220
What Song Yimeng said is correct.

269
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,480
I shouldn't treat others' care
for me as nothing.

270
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,240
All the Nightwalkers'

271
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,150
doings are morally

272
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,960
justifiable.

273
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,660
You shouldn't be lurking in the dark.

274
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,960
I'm sorry to have
reduced you to this situation.

275
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,270
Where is this coming from?

276
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,350
What exactly is your plan?

277
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,630
Go and tell Chu Guihong

278
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,030
that the target he has been after

279
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,120
is me alone.

280
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,200
If he wants a fight,

281
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,200
then bring it on

282
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,840
in the imperial court.

283
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,020
I'll let my people go with you today.

284
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,870
But if they ever get hurt,

285
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,870
I'll have Chu Guihong

286
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,570
pay a steep price.

287
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,790
Yes,

288
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,380
Your Highness.

289
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,090
Take them away!

290
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,200
[Yongde Gate]

291
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,270
-Yes!
-Yes!

292
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,030
Come with us.

293
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,410
Your Highness,

294
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,530
Chu Guihong has set out for the palace.

295
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,150
He'll complain about you to the Emperor.

296
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,470
Shall we set off too?

297
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,730
No need to rush.

298
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,630
I have a task for you.

00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,880
the Waning River Crescent

510
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,680
was indeed

511
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,310
founded by me.

512
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
I'm also the chief of it,

513
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Li Shiliu.

514
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,210
The Seventh Prince is Li Shiliu?

515
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,720
For

516
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,050
failing my supervisory duties

517
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,480
and trusting the wrong person,

518
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,790
I deserve 20 lashes.

519
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,960
For sponsoring people
from the martial arts world

520
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,350
and withholding the truth,

521
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,750
I deserve 20 more lashes.

522
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,000
For indulging outlaws in

523
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,400
storming the execution ground,

524
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,860
I deserve extra 20 lashes.

525
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,270
Now,

526
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,060
I forfeit my royal title to make amends.

527
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,830
From now on,

528
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,700
I will no longer be
a prince of Great Jing.

529
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,350
I will enjoy no privilege

530
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,730
or honor.

531
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,610
I only wish to lead Xuanjia Army

532
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,480
to sustain the peace of Great Jing.

533
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,070
His Highness will

534
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,240
be no different than a commoner, right?

535
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,070
His Highness is withdrawing
from the succession struggle.

536
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,640
Chancellor Gao is in trouble.

537
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,480
The Seventh Prince is
asking for a demotion.

538
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,010
Is His Highness trying
to get himself killed?

539
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,870
Your Majesty,

540
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,680
the Seventh Prince is attempting

541
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,880
to take all the blame.

542
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,400
I implore...

543
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,200
Your Majesty!

544
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,720
Between

545
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,770
the law and the will of a person,

546
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,140
we should follow the former,

547
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,740
not the latter.

548
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,400
It was Gao Changyin

549
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,840
who made missteps in this old case,

550
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,650
not the Seventh Prince.

551
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,930
Moreover,

552
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,170
the prisoner who was supposed
to be executed yesterday

553
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,970
had been wrongfully convicted.

554
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,190
He was kept alive for three years

555
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,520
because of the Seventh Prince's mercy.

556
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,500
As for the Waning River Crescent,

557
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,990
although it is independent from the court,

558
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,900
it has done nothing but

559
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,220
benefit the people over these years.

560
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,210
It hasn't done anything wrong.

561
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,000
Yan Yi,

562
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,330
how should the Seventh Prince be punished

563
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,010
according to the law
of the Ministry of Justice?

564
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,550
Why are you looking at him?

565
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,760
Just give me a candid answer.

566
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,830
Your Majesty,

567
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,600
if everything in the scroll is correct,

568
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,680
then the Seventh Prince
should be punished as he said.

569
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,500
Given the Seventh Prince's
unwavering devotion

570
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,070
to the country, to his uncle,

571
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,640
and to everyone around him,

572
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,400
I hereby grant his wish.

573
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,680
On behalf of Great Jing, I order him to be

574
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,680
lashed 60 times and
stripped of his noble title.

575
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,990
Thank you, Your Majesty.

I earnestly

implore Your Highness

609
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,360
to spare Yimeng.

610
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,200
Everything I did before

611
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,460
was to protect myself.

612
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,080
But in the future,

613
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,640
I want to clear the misunderstandings between her and me

614
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,770
and even become her lifelong partner.

615
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,240
I also promise you

616
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,590
that I will do everything I can

617
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,990
to keep her safe for life.

618

Mr. Song, wait.

637
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,160
Mr. Song.

638
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,080
That day, in the Song Residence,

639
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,580
you gave me tips about investigating

640
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,030
the Waning River Crescent's Nightwalkers.

641
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,890
Now, the truth has been revealed.

642
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,030
Why did you

643
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,350
defend Nan Heng today?

644
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,340
Don't take it wrong, Guihong.

645
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,870
I said those words today

646
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:33,110
only to maintain the peace of the nation.

647
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,750
I was not partial to him.

648
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,190
Yimeng and I got engaged
when we were little.

649
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,790
You've been a father figure
to me for a long time.

650
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,190
I just don't understand.

651
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,820
Why are you and Yimeng...

652
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,800
Why are the both of you different now?

653
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,480
What have I done wrong?

654
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,560
Now that we're speaking our minds,

655
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,460
a question of mine begs your answer.

656
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,950
Today, you insisted on
probing to the bottom

657
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,240
of the incident on the execution ground.

658
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,140
Did it occur to you
that Yimeng could be implicated?

659
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,750
I know

660
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,730
you must've been so swamped

661
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,010
that you neglected it.

662
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,070
But the Seventh Prince sorted out

663
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,720
that old case within one day.

664
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,110
He didn't have much free time either.

665
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,770
He also declared

666
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,940
to be solely responsible
for disrupting the execution.

667
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,600
While he proved Chancellor Gao guilty,

668
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,320
he managed to protect the Nightwalkers

669
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,140
and preserve the reputation
of my two daughters.

670
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:33,950
He made zero slip

671
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,100
in the course.

672
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,360
Do you know why he could make it?

673
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,510
Are you implying

674
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,170

00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,000
Dad,

844
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,220
braised pork for you.

845
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,710
A big drumstick.

846
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,400
Yimeng,

847
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,400
this is for you.

848
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,060
Thank you, Madam.

849
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,630
Shall we have drinks?

850
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,110
Sure.

851
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,960
Let's drink.

852
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,710
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

853
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,800
Madam, let me get you some soup.

854
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,280
Come on.

855
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,960
Try the dishes.

856
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,000
I was attracted by the smell just now.

857
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,630
How lovely.

858
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,490
Come on, Dad.

859
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,230
Okay.

860
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,000
Thanks.

861
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,960
Here, Yiting.

862
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,930
You try it too.

863
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,940
Have some soup.

864
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,280
Now is not the right time.

865
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,250
Just keep waiting.

866
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,780
Okay, Father.

867
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,840
Actually,

868
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,040
I don't mind waiting.

869
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,550
After all, Heng

870
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,360
has lost Gao Changyin's aid now.

871
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,000
In terms of cultural administration,

872
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,320
martial prowess
and support from officials,

873
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,510
he is no match for me.

874
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,240
You're talking nonsense again.

875
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,630
It isn't time to feel complacent.

876
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,920
We're discussing a major issue.

877
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,720
It needs further deliberation.

878
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,760
Your Majesty,

879
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,280
there are 2,000 Xuanjia
soldiers at the borders.

880
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,280
Plus those formidable Nightwalkers,

881
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,800
Nan Heng's strength
can't be underestimated.

882
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,280
To prevent trouble, Your Majesty

883
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,340
must strip him of his military power.

884
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,840
The Gao family has an intricate web
of connections in the court.

885
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,230
Though

886
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,140
Gao Changyin has been ousted,

887
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:53,180
his remaining proteges
will still support Heng.

888
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,210
You saw what happened in the court.

889
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,960
Heng is still favored by

890
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,400
many civil and military officials.

891
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,670
If he is deprived of his military
power without a solid reason,

892
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,580
there will be chaos in the court.

893
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,280
I think...

894
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,980
That sly old man Song Yude
did have a point.

895
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,770
We need to come up

896
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,390
with a legitimate reason.

897
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,090
Yes.

898
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,410
You're right, Father.

899
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,840
But you see,

900
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,840
Heng is very cunning.

901
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,430
That embezzlement case
could've nailed him,

902
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,480
but he put on an act
and helped himself out.

903
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,810
What legitimate reason is left for us now?

904
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,590
If there isn't one,

905
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,300
then we can invent one.

906
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,560
I've heard about

907
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,980
the close kinship between
Chancellor Gao and the Noble Consort.

908
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,230
Nan Heng cares a lot
about his family, doesn't he?

909
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,000
We can bring him to heel

910
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,820
by attacking the Noble Consort.

911
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,000
Your Majesty,

912
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,230
the court is like a battlefield.

913
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,670
Every opportunity is precious.

914
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,800
Missing out on one will cost us dearly.

915
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,240
Your Majesty, please don't hesitate.

916
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,060
[Memorial]

917
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,690
What are you doing?

918
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,920
Chancellor Gao is asking

919
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,360
for a meeting with the Seventh Prince.

920
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,320
No way.

921
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,360
It's just a meeting.

922
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,520
How many times have I told you?

923
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,190
What are you doing?

924
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,110
What's wrong with you?

925
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,050
I already said no!

926
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:30,910
Get out of here!

927
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,190
Fugui.

928
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,290
Fugui!

929
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,280
Your Highness...

930
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,840
No.

931
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,480
General,

932
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,510
you only rested for a moment.

933
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,710
Why are you up so soon?

934
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,640
What's happening outside?

935
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,110
It's about Chancellor Gao.

936
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,280
He's asking in the imperial prison

937
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,560
for a meeting with you.

938
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,870
I'd rather not.

939
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,190
But he is my uncle after all.

940
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,710
Just ensure he'll suffer less

941
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,710
when he is exiled.

942
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,070
Make proper arrangements for him.

943
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:21,590
Got it.

944
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,480
Go get prepared.

945
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,300
I'm heading out.

946
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,230
Now?

947
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,070
But your injuries...

948
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:29,730
Do as I said.

949
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,670
Yes.
