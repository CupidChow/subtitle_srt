[Episode 23]

3
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,060
So you plan to frame me.

4
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,400
How clever.

5
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,900
You flatter me.

6
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,040
I've just been dealing with
Your Highness too long

7
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,240
and picked up a few tricks.

8
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,500
I'm just fighting fire

9
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,750
with fire.

10
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,150
Mr. Chu, since you understand that,

11
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,910
do you also know

12
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,190
I could

13
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,520
make a clean getaway?

14
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
Nightwalkers,

15
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,290
leave Waning River Crescent now.

[Big Fortune]

17
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,710
Nan Heng,

18
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,870
I will find proof

19
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,470
that you're colluding
with the Nightwalkers.

20
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,960
General Chu, you must be joking.

21
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,750
I'm here today because you invited me.

22
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,910
What does that have to do
with Waning River Crescent?

23
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,960
Or are you saying

24
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,280
you brought me here on purpose

25
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,590
just so you could frame me
for helping from the inside

26
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,790
and using the chaos
to bust someone out?

27
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,470
Right after you entered
the celestial prison,

28
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,070
there was a prison break.

29
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,470
Was that just a coincidence?

30
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm puzzled about that too.

31
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,030
How did the thugs know I'd be here?

32
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,480
Besides,

33
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,520
I was injured here, wasn't I?

34
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,560
Could it be that

35
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,600
there's a mole in your Qianyu Army
or in the office

36
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,640
of the capital prefecture?

37
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,040
Nan Heng,

38
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,240
that's slander!

39
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,280
You spoke out of turn

40
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,360
and framed a prince.

41
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,620
That's unforgivable!

42
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,560
You even set trap after trap

43
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,350
to take down both
Waning River Crescent and me.

44
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,030
Your crimes are really numerous.

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,710
However,

46
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,150
you still don't know me well enough.

47
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,920
You call me the God of Death,

48
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,800
so why would someone like that

49
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,700
hesitate to take a life?

50
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,870
If Shangguan He really worked for me,

51
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,960
why would I have let him live?

52
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,310
Why didn't I kill him

53
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,590
during the chaos just now?

54
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,180
Why would I bother

55
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,910
having people disguised as thugs

56
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,120
to rescue him?

57
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,170
Shangguan He's sentencing
is still days away.

58
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,430
I don't believe
his accomplices will sit still

59
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,480
and just watch.

60
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,370
If they make a move,

61
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,630
they're bound to slip up.

62
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,140
If you ask me,
the one who can't sit still here

63
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,070
is you, General Chu.

64
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,600
Yimeng.

65
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,270
Father.

66
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,510
How is she?

67
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,270
The physician said it's nothing serious.

68
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,070
She just needs a few days of rest.

69
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,870
Don't worry.

70
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,560
Father,

71
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
where is Nan Heng?

72
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,909
Is he still in Yiting's room?

73
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,720
He's already left.

74
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,190
I'll go check on her.

75
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,120
Not right now.

76
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,340
Yiting said

77
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,560
she doesn't want
to see anyone at the moment.

78
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Why not?

79
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,940
She wants to see Nan Heng

80
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,470
but not us?

81
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,750
That Seventh Prince is so manipulative,

82
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,610
making your sister fall so deeply for him.

83
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,950
Don't worry, Father.

84
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,040
I'll never let Nan Heng

85
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,440
hurt Song Yiting again.

86
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,800
His Majesty has arrived!

87
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,750
Greetings, Mr. Song.

Eunuch Liu.

89
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,000
I didn't know His Majesty was coming.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,680
Forgive me for not receiving him properly.

91
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,330
No need for such formalities, Mr. Song.

92
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,040
His Majesty is visiting

93
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,480
in disguise.

94
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,280
He's not here for state affairs.

95
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,000
Then may I ask what matter

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,659
has brought His Majesty here?

97
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,770
Mr. Song, no need to pretend.

98
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,510
The Eighteenth Prince
has gone to His Majesty

99
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,170
and reported
the Seventh Prince's misconduct.

100
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,720
Then I should go see His Majesty at once.

101
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,920
Don't rush, Mr. Song.

102
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,510
The person His Majesty wishes to see

103
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,630
is not you.

104
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,310
Not me?

105
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,870
Then who is it?

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,800
Me?

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Your Majesty,

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,270
Song Yimeng is here.

109
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,870
I'm Song Yimeng.

110
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,409
Greetings, Your Majesty.

[Seventh Prince's Mansion]

Your Highness,

115
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,510
all Nightwalkers are gone.

116
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,180
The Qianyu Army got there
and found nothing.

117
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,000
Good.

118
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,750
I was worried about that on my way here.

119
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,390
What's wrong?

120
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,720
Your Highness,

121
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,909
something terrible has happened.

122
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:39,480
The Eighteenth Prince
went to see His Majesty

123
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,430
and reported you

124
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,760
because of Song Yiting.

125
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,159
What did His Majesty say?

126
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,310
His Majesty was furious.

127
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,970
He kept scolding Song Yimeng.

128
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,070
Why was he scolding Song Yimeng?

129
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,040
H-He said

130
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,550
Song Yimeng shouldn't
have brought you, a terriblâ€¦

131
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,750
a terribly wise man,

132
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,430
into the Song Residence.

133
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,360
That's what caused all this mess.

134
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,190
He also said she acts improperly

135
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,390
and lacks feminine virtues.

136
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,000
Song Yiting followed her example

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,720
and became the wild,
unruly girl she is now.

138
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,240
His Majesty scolded Song Yimeng,

139
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,390
but the one he resents is me.

140
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,480
Your Highness,

141
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,480
His Majesty is really angry this time.

142
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,720
He couldn't even wait
to summon Song Yimeng to court

143
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,190
and personally went to the Song Residence

144
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,880
to teach her a lesson.

145
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,680
Eunuch Liu.

146
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,720
Why did His Majesty

147
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,680
summon me today?

148
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,480
His Majesty condescended
to visit the Song Residence.

149
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,909
What do you think it's for?

150
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,140
The Emperor has always despised Nan Heng.

151
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,330
Could it be that he plans
to use the Zijin Pavilion incident

152
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,790
to charge him with a crime?

153
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,240
If I tell him everything

154
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,070
about Nan Heng secretly seeking
the method of weapon forging,

155
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,410
maybe I can stop

156
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,270
what's about to happen.

157
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,600
The Song family wouldn't be wiped out,

158
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,360
Yiting wouldn't be deceived,

159
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,040
and I wouldn't be mutilated.

160
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,200
Should I

161
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,750
expose him?

162
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,050
If I explained it to you,

163
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,750
would you believe me?

164
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,640
People call me the God of Death.

165
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,780
Isn't that what you think too?

166
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,840
The world insults and curses me.

167
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,300
Haven't you done the same?

168
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,910
It's true that I don't trust anyone.

169
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,550
That's because no one's ever trusted me.

170
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,040
Not even you!

171
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,000
You need to understandâ€”

172
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,030
things in this world

173
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,120
aren't always

174
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
what they seem.

175
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,750
If I didn't fight to survive,

176
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,880
then I'd be the one forced to a dead end.

177
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,240
Your Majesty.

178
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,360
I've already heard about

179
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,850
what happened last night.

180
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,990
Song Yimeng,

181
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,880
if you testify

182
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,010
that Heng seduced your sister

183
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,890
and has poor moral conductâ€¦

184
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,760
Your Majesty,

185
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,320
I don't want

186
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,520
to testify against the Seventh Prince.

187
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,180
I just want an imperial edict.

188
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,650
You just want me to back you up

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,400
to secure your position
as the principal consort, don't you?

190
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,960
Fine then.

191
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,150
On the ninth day of next month,

192
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,610
you'll marry Heng.

193
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,600
The next day,

194
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,700
Song Yiting will join
the household as a concubine.

195
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,480
Your Majestyâ€¦

196
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,550
I'm not finished.

197
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,720
The scandal between you Song sisters

198
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,790
and Heng

199
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,150
has already stirred up

200
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,240
quite a storm.

201
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,030
Song Yude's reputation
has taken a huge hit.

202
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,600
He likely won't be able to stay
in the capital anymore.

203
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,480
I'll advise him to resign and retire

204
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,750
and serve as a retainer under Heng,

205
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,030
following him to his fief.

206
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,280
Your Majesty,

207
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,520
that's not the edict

208
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,720
I want to ask for.

209
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,480
You wouldn't testify

210
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,890
or get married.

211
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,670
What more do you want?

212
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,130
Do you really think
I'd hesitate to kill you?

213
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,320
Your Majesty,

214
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,510
what I'm asking for

215
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,150
is an imperial edict to call off
my engagement to the Seventh Prince.

216
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,240
Neither I,

217
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,840
nor my sister,

218
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,700
nor the entire Song family

219
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,320
wishes to have anything to do
with the Seventh Prince.

220
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,290
Song Yimeng,

221
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,230
a prince's marriage

222
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,200
is both a family matter

223
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,260
and a state affair.

224
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,320
It's not a children's game

225
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,670
where you can change

226
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,240
your mind at will.

227
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,250
If you

228
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,320
can't give

229
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,240
a legitimate reasonâ€¦

230
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,360
Your Majesty,

231
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,480
if the engagement is canceled,

232
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,390
the Seventh Prince can never

233
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,710
pull the Ministry of War to his side.

234
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,320
That'll

235
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,240
buy you enough time

236
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,150
to plan the path forward

237
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,040
for the future crown prince.

238
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,060
Whether to marry the Song sisters

239
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,670
to the Seventh Prince

240
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,770
or cancel the engagementâ€”

241
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,550
the pros and cons

242
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,900
are worth your careful thought.

243
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,420
I really did

244
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,750
underestimate you.

245
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,720
But I must warn you,

246
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,240
Heng

247
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,150
has worked hard to secure this marriage.

248
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,810
If you turn your back on him now,

249
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,720
he'll never let you

250
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,210
or the Song family off the hook.

251
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,580
I've been looking for you.

252
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,450
I knew you'd come.

253
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,870
What is it?

254
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,580
This is the imperial edict

255
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,450
calling off our engagement.

256
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,680
Calling off the engagement?

257
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,590
Song Yimeng.

258
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,600
I told you

259
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,480
I'd explain to you

260
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,340
what happened at Zijin Pavilion.

261
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,510
Why won't you trust me?

262
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,960
Not even once?

263
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,950
What do you expect me to believe?

264
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,720
That you didn't

265
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,180
approach me from the start

266
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,230
for the sake of the Song family's power?

267
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,240
Or that you're not someone

268
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,550
who schemes,

269
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,900
plays political games,

270
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,960
and never repents?

271
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,990
So,

272
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,120
in your eyes,

273
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,920
everything between your sister and me

274
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,360
was just a calculated move
to win over the Song family.

275
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,860
â™ª I leave the book aside,
though I haven't finished reading it â™ª

276
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,720
Every time you were in danger

277
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,000
and I helped you,

278
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,480
I was pretending to care.

279
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,680
Everything I did for you

280
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:21,040
â™ª I know one day I can have
a glimpse of the ending â™ª

281

wasâ€¦

282
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,800
was meaningless,

283
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,240
and you see no value in it.

284
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,850
Is that it?

285
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,190
â™ª Life is unpredictable â™ª

286
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,770
Why?

287
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,000
â™ª Who can get rid of perplexity â™ª

288
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,890
Why do you think you know me so well?

289
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,570
â™ª And find the answer he yearns for? â™ª

290
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,420
Because I already knew you

291
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,230
before I even met you!

292
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,860
â™ª Let the wind flip through
the past chapters of my life â™ª

293
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,720
I see.

â™ª Let brush and ink

fate can shape my life â™ª

right?

00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,880
But let me tell you something.

â™ª Let moonlight shine on

â™ª Let me bang my head

I'm standing right here,

but you choose to look away

307
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,270
and believe some absurd script!

308
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:14,720
â™ª If this is my destiny,
I'll accept it â™ª

That's right.

310

I don't trust you.

I'll never trust you again.

314
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,200
Let me tell you something, Nan Heng.

315
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,670
From the very start,

316
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,930

00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,510
is enough to get rid of us?

509
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,530
No way.

510
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,400
Right, guys?

511
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,030
That's right.

512
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,350
You promised to find me a wife.

513
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,460
Until you do, I'm not going anywhere!

514
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,270
Yeah!

515
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,640
And my mom's houseâ€”

516
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,480
you haven't bought it for me yet!

517
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,000
Exactly!

518
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,400
You promised.

519
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,070
Shut up!

520
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,080
Right now the Qianyu Army

521
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,350
is hunting down every Nightwalker.

522
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,430
If you stay in the capital,
you'll be in danger everywhere you go.

523
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,270
Do as I sayâ€”

524
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,000
leave, now.

525
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,960
Chief,

526
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,790
I know

527
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,110
you want to risk everything alone

528
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,350
and push us all far away,

529
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,030
right?

530
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,500
Dream on.

531
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,720
We Nightwalkers

532
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,130
are not afraid of death.

533
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,440
If we live, we live together.

534
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,900
If we die, we die together.

535
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,790
Chief,

536
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,030
back when we joined you,

537
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,070
didn't we say

538
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,090
the Nightwalkers live and die as one?

539
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,400
Yeah, we live and die as one!

540
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:32,920
That's right.

541
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,800
We live and die as one!

542
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,790
The Nightwalkers

543
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
aren't a family

544
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,680
without you, Chief.

545
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,620
We live and die as one.

546
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,480
That's what makes us brothers.

547
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,400
We live and die as one?

548
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,610
You're just street ratsâ€”

549
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,070
nobodies from the martial arts world.

550
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,730
You think you deserve
to live and die with me?

551
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,410
Seventh Prince?

552
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,430
Let me be honest with you.

553
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,500
Waning River Crescent

554
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,160
is nothing more than

555
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,750
a chess piece I placed in the capital.

556
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,970
And you?

557
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,790
You're all just pawns.

558
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,980
Now that Shangguan He's identity
has been exposed,

559
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,790
all of you have become stains on my name.

560
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,980
Have I made it clear enough?

561
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,310
100 taels.

562
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,550
It's more than enough
to last you for a lifetime.

563
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,540
Did you hear me?

564
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,280
Take the money and get lost.

565
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,270
Chiefâ€¦

566
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:14,960
Shut up!

567
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,390
Who are you to call me your brother?

568
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,530
And you,

569
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,150
a good-for-nothing
who can't even speak properly.

570
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,550
What use do I have for you?

571
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,350
And the rest of you rabble,

572
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
listen up.

573
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,880
If one day

574
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,880
you wreck my plans,

575
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,660
none of you will walk away alive.

576
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,240
Did you hear me?

577
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:06,970
Chief.

578
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,510
Let's drink our fill tonight.

579
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,510
Yeah.

580
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:13,960
Come on.

581
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,680
Bottoms up!

582
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,790
Fill it up.

583
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,510
Come on.

584
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,270
Fill it up.

585
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:17,920
Good.

586
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,450
Here's your wine. Drink up!

587
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,110
Cheers.

588
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,110
You must finish it all.

589
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:22,570
Come on.

590
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,310
Here.

591
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,250
Here's to you.

592
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,480
Come on.

593
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,000
Chief,

594
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,120
here's to you.

595
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,030
Drink.

596
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,660
Drink up, drink up.

597
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,580
Come on.

598
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,710
Second Master.

599
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,740
Second Master.

600
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,670
Second Master.

601
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,690
Second Master.

602
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,640
Come on, drink.

603
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,000
You two, come here.

604
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,160
Drink up.

605
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,110
Drink up.

606
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,220
Chief,

607
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,950
do you remember a year ago

608
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,480
when you told me

609
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,460
to run Waning River Crescent for you?

610
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,070
We agreed then that

611
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,270
you'd be the cold-hearted Chief,

612
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,550
and I'd be the cold-hearted Second Master,

613
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,680
doing all the dirty work you couldn't.

614
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,480
So why is it now

615
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,610
I'm out there giving disaster relief,

616
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,930
fighting floods,

617
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,240
handing alms to the weak,

618
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,170
and even looking for missing cats?

619
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,700
I sent you to do a few good deeds

620
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,640
so you, a sinner, could earn yourself

621
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,800
some good karma.

622
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,120
Get it?

623
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,550
A few good deeds?

624
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,880
It's been a few hundred already.

625
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,640
Chief,

626
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,440
open your eyes and look at us.

627
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,920
You're a viper,

628
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,160
not a Bodhisattva.

629
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,400
And I'm a notorious thief,

630
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,680
not a walking saint.

631
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,360
Look at meâ€”

632
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,790
do I look like a saint to you?

633
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,510
Do I?

634
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,750
If you don't do it,

635
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,830
do you expect me to do it myself?

636
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,720
If you want me to do it,

637
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,550
then I'm charging more

638
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,610
for the extra work.

639
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,800
I'm famous, after all.

640
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,310
I committed over ten major thefts

641
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,960
in half a month,

642
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,310
and now I'm here helping people

643
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,710
look for their lost pets.

644
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,260
What's with that look?

645
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,480
Fine.

646
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,400
Two years.

647
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,830
You'll be free

648
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,070
in two years.

649
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,090
You'll let me go?

650
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,160
Like hell I believe you.

651
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:28,720
No offense,

652
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,030
but the capital prefecture's office

653
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,240
collects a fair bit
of tax money from the capital.

654
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,770
Where did all that money go?

655
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,440
Why is the food here so terrible?

656
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,520
If you tell me every last thing

657
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,400
you know about Nan Heng,

658
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,160
forget about pig knucklesâ€”

659
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,940
you could have
a whole roast pig to yourself.

660
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,030
We both know

661
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,270
Nan Heng's been
supporting the Nightwalkers

662
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,600
with ulterior motives.

663
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,830
The fact that he left you in this cell

664
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,640
means he's already abandoned you.

665
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,490
Yet you'd still risk your life
to protect him.

666
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,290
Why?

667
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
General Chu,

668
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,830
I'd like to make a deal with you.

669
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,480
What deal?

670
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,550
If you list out all the bad things

671
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,540
Waning River Crescent has done,

672
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,270
I'll tell you everything
about Nan Heng's collusion

673
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,010
with the Nightwalkers.

674
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,300
What do you say?

675
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,880
You can't come up with anything?

676
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,680
What's wrong?

677
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,270
Aren't both Waning River Crescent

678
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,260
and the Nightwalkers utterly
wicked in your eyes?

679
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,270
It shouldn't be hard

680
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,530
for you to list hundreds of their crimes.

681
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,510
The Waning River Crescent case

682
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,770
involves a lot of people.

683
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,440
I need time to investigate.

684
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:47,960
No problem.

685
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,270
Take your time.

686
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,770
If you can find even one crime,

687
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,370
I'll cut off a finger myself.

688
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,980
You ended up here because of Nan Heng,

689
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,490
yet you still can't tell right from wrong.

690
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,570
It was because of Nan Heng?

691
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,760
Nan Heng didn't throw me
in this celestial prison.

692
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,440
Mr. Chu,

693
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,900
I ended up eating pig knuckles
down here because of you.

694
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,590
We both know

695
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:28,310
there's no good end
for anyone who trusts Nan Heng.

696
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,239
I trusted him twice,

697
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,960
and I lost my aunt and my father.

698
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,590
This time,

699
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,670
it's your turn.

700
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,760
Have you looked into

701
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,139
the Empress's death and the truth

702
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,230
behind the Pingrong Battle?

703
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,880
The late Empress
died during the autumn hunt.

704
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,590
That day,

705
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,880
it was Nan Heng who led my aunt

706
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,630
to where the assassins were hiding.

707
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,000
During the Pingrong Battle,

708
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,710
I sent a letter asking the Xuanjia Army

709
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,150
stationed in Youcheng for reinforcements.

710
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,630
But even after the city gates
were breached

711
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,430
and all 20,000 Qianyu soldiers
were slaughtered,

712
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,730
Nan Heng still didn't show up.

713
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,020
Have you ever asked him

714
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,920
about these things?

715
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,550
What killer

716
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,920
ever admits to murder?

717
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,920
But there are many truths

718
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,280
that remain hidden.

719
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,150
What you believe to be true

720
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,750
might not be the truth at all.

721
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,770
There's no kindness without reason,

722
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,740
nor evil without cause.

723
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,070
Fine.

724
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,050
Then in your view,

725
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,840
why did Nan Heng
run Waning River Crescent?

726
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,590
Why did he take in

727
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,670
fugitives like us
from the martial arts world?

728
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,270
To secretly expand
his influence, obviously.

729
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,360
He went to so much trouble
for bigger influence,

730
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,360
but he gave away all the club's income

731
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,110
for disaster relief.

732
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,250
He even had us outlaws

733
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,440
set up businesses in the west of the city

734
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,700
so more displaced folks could find jobs.

735
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,840
What's even more ridiculous is

736
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,510
that a bunch of nobodies like us

737
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,920
were forced to patrol

738
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,590
the streets every night

739
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,280
to keep the people safe in their sleep.

740
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,840
Tell me,

741
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,120
does this make any sense?

742
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,960
Stop avoiding the real issues.

743
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,840
Nan Heng did all that

744
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,790
in order to seize the throne.

745
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,320
As far as I know,

746
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,480
after the Pingrong Battle was lost,

747
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,000
you and that cousin prince of yours

748
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,960
were no longer a match for Nan Heng.

749
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,290
Nan Heng

750
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,280
is just someone who's never been trusted

751
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,670
by anyone.

752
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,930
Maybe what he really wants

753
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,260
is just a group of friends,

754
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,670
a home,

755
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,320
and the feeling that

756
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,840
he's truly trusted.

757
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,200
If I knew Nan Hengâ€”

758
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,510
I mean if I did,

759
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,070
he absolutely wouldn't
be the kind of person you believe

760
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,050
to have plotted
the late Empress's death at nine.

761
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,710
And he definitely wouldn't be the type

762
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,050
to sacrifice the Qianyu Army

763
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,920
and lose our land to the enemy

764
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,830
just to steal military merit.

765
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,000
So,

766
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,510
stop interrogating me already.

767
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,480
I'm willing to die for my crime.

768
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,550
Your crime?

769
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,280
So you admit guilt?

770
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,890
My crime

771
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,450
is having failed to live it up

772
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,030
as the cold-hearted Second Master.

773
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,920
â™ª No words can cage
a heart full of wounds â™ª

774
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,170
â™ª I shake the heavens and plains
through the storm â™ª

775
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:34,720
[Three years ago]

776
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,630
You went to all that trouble

777
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,320
to get me off death row.

778
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,270
â™ª A promise is made,
and I don't fear death anymore â™ª

779
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,600
Tell me, Your Highness,

780
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,270
what use am I to you?

781
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,780
â™ª Even dreams are pleasant â™ª

782
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,670
I looked into you.

783
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,480
You're

784
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,670
a thief

785
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,190
and a lazy bum.

786
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,260
You're also kind of a playboy.

787
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,360
Did you save me just to humiliate me?

788
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,430
â™ª Beyond my control, powerless to resist â™ª

789
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,920
But you're great at management.

790
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,920
â™ª Yet still I dig deep, questioning fate â™ª

791
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,110
So,

792
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,950
I plan to build

793
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,120
â™ª That is the meaning
behind my defiance â™ª

794
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:59,280
a club here called Waning River Crescent,

795
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,800
and I want you to run it for me.

796
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,410
The club is just a cover.

797
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,720
What I really need you to do
is gather intel in the capital,

798
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:06,320
â™ª Even doomed for eternity,
I still have the courage â™ª

799
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,440
dig up secrets from officials,

800
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:09,650
â™ª For you, I'd step into the uncertainty â™ª

801
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:08,960
and build a force

802
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,670
called the Nightwalkers for me.

803
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:14,130
â™ª If you believe in fate â™ª

804
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,320
Understand?

805
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,500
â™ª No words can cage
a heart full of wounds â™ª

806
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,350
That's truly dirty work.

807
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,710
No problem.

808
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,990
â™ª I shake the heavens and plains
through the storm â™ª

809
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,960
But if you want me to do
all those dangerous things for you,

810
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,260
â™ª A promise is made,
and I don't fear death anymore â™ª

811
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,390
you'll have to pay extra.

812
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,180
You want to haggle?

813
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,810
â™ª Even dreams are pleasant â™ª

814
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,070
Let me tell you,

815
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,320
â™ª Is it obsession, or chosen pain? â™ª

816
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,350
working for me

817
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,560
is the only way you stay alive now.

818
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:37,530
â™ª Is it pride, with no shame? â™ª

819
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,400
And if I say no?

820
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:41,800
â™ª To give you a love
etched into the bones â™ª

821
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,560
â™ª Then it's not something to grieve overâ™ª

822
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,450
Then I'm sure

823
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,270
someone will be here tomorrow
to collect your corpse.

824
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,920
â™ª If tears are proof that I once loved â™ª

825
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,680
What if my identity is exposed?

826
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:57,760
â™ª If what's gone leaves behind
a trace of being â™ª

827
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,880
Take your own life.

828
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,500
â™ª Then let the tears fall â™ª

829
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,040
â™ª Let me love you â™ª

830
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:10,460
â™ª And fade away with one last dream â™ª

831
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,480
That makes sense.

832
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,010
Why didn't I think of that?

833
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:10,920
You're always the clever one,

834
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,550
Chief,

835
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,010
thinking of her right away.

836
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,800
You'll also get to spend more time
with her

837
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:16,280
â™ª No words can cage
a heart full of wounds â™ª

838
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,840
while decoding those symbols.

839
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,950
It's killing two birds with one stone.

840
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,460
â™ª I shake the heavens and plains
through the storm â™ª

841
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,360
Please spare Song Yimeng,

842
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,150
and spare me too!

843
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,510
â™ª A promise is made,
and I don't fear death anymore â™ª

844
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,150
Why am I so unlucky?

845
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,140
â™ª Even dreams are pleasant â™ª

846
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,590
What are you looking at?

847
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:30,510
â™ª Is it obsession, or chosen pain? â™ª

848
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:35,430
â™ª Is it pride, with no shame? â™ª

849
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:39,770
â™ª To give you a love
etched into the bones â™ª

850
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,600
â™ª Then it's not something to grieve overâ™ª

851
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,840
Whenever the female lead is in danger,

852
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,150
the male lead has to save her.
