00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,030
[Episode 27]

3
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,030
Why are you staring at me?

4
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,800
What are you scheming now?

5
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,530
I've been thinking.

6
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,340
Song Yimeng,

7
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,710
I like you.

8
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,970
What did you say?

9
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,190
I said I like you.

10
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,560
So,

11
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,400
I want your forgiveness,

12
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,190
and then marry you.

13
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,840
You...

14
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,260
You...

15
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,090
You must be out of your mind!

16
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,680
In your dreams.

17
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,510
Why don't you fly to the moon
while you're at it?

18
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Just let me finish what I have to say.

19
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,990
At first,

20
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,680
I was indeed wary of you.

21
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,120
I even...

22
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,760
I even thought about killing you.

23
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,620
But after spending time with you,

24
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,520
everything has changed.

25
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,990
What change are you talking about?

26
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,560
Let me remind you,

27
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,870
you didn't kill me

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,510
because you couldn't.

29
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,870
Yes,

30
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,329
I might not be able to kill you,

31
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,240
but...

32
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,910
But because of that time
at the Lantern Festival,

33
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,380
I fell for you.

34
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,200
Since then,

35
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,780
I never thought about killing you again.

36
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,840
I've been anxious and uneasy

37
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,230
while deceiving you these days.

38
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,410
But there are things

39
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,350
that confuse me.

40
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,130
Why is it that when I'm Nan Heng,

41
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,070
you avoid me,

42
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,240
you're cautious,

43
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,150
you ingratiate yourself,

44
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,210
and act insincere,

45
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,540
but when I put on Li Shiliu's mask,

46
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,470
you treat me with sincerity

47
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,310
and honesty?

48
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,400
No matter which version of me,

49
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,800
I'm sincere with you.

50
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,600
But why does the real Song Yimeng

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,710
only appear before Li Shiliu?

52
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,280
So?

53
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,890
Is this your excuse for deceiving me?

54
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,510
I did deceive you.

55
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,190
But that's because I was afraid.

56
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,080
I was afraid that once
the lie was exposed,

57
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
I would never see the real you again.

58
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,870
And...

59
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,950
And I was selfish,

60
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,360
because I cherished the feeling of
being trusted by you.

61
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,630
I didn't want to wake up from this dream.

62
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,510
But...

63
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,300
you eventually wake up from dreams.

64
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,870
Lies

65
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,280
will also

66
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,200
be exposed eventually.

67
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,240
That's right.

68
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,380
So now I want to honestly tell you

69
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,390
that the real Nan Heng

70
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,000
isn't the God of Death others speak of,

71
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,600
nor is he a carefree hero
of the martial arts world.

72
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,390
He's just

73
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,140
a cowardly,

74
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,720
selfish man.

75
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,780
Would you accept

76
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,520
this version of me as your husband?

77
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,920
His Highness,

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,450
where are you?

79
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,310
I hope you're not in any danger.

80
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,170
Please stay safe, Your Highness.

81
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,240
Mr. Fugui!

82
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,820
There's a body in there!

83
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:08,950
Sir.

84
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,750
It's in there.

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,660
This...

86
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,380
Miss Song's cloak?

87
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,270
Mr. Fugui.

88
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,680
Mr. Fugui.

89
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,480
I found signs of struggle

90
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,090
at the edge of the cliff.

91
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,580
Let's go.

92
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:37,210
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,050
I can't accept your proposal.

94
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,240
What are you really worried about?

95
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,120
Nan Heng,

96
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,750
let me ask you something.

97
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,870
When you left the cold palace

98
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,750
and went to the border,

99
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,930
what was going through your mind?

100
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,010
I just didn't want to die
in the cold palace.

101
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,600
I wanted to fight for my survival.

102
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,960
That's right.

103
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
You succeeded.

104
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,400
You earned military merits

105
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,750
and gradually

106
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,870
built your own power base.

107
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,180
But when you returned to the capital,

108
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,770
you suddenly realized

109
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,130
that your years of fighting at the border

110
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,000
had become completely worthless.

111
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,050
No matter how many
achievements you earned,

112
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,030
the position of crown prince

113
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,720
would only belong to Nan Rui.

114
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,560
And your fate?

115
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,610
To return to the depths of the palace

116
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,450
and never be free again.

117
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,100
So at that moment,

118
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,490
what were you thinking?

119
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,990
If you had ever experienced
trying with all your might

120
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,390
to reach the peak

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,980
but never being able to get there,

122
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,150
then you should understand

123
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,880
that enjoying the view from the bottom

124
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,210
isn't so bad after all.

125
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,180
You're trying to say

126
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,670
that no matter how hard one tries,

127
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,330
some things can't be changed.

128
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,390
But I don't believe that.

129
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,590
Why should my fate be
in someone else's hands?

130
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,400
I will obtain

131
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,510
what I want through my own efforts.

132
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,789
But the day you get what you want

133
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,560
will be the day

134
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,610
tragedy befalls the Song family.

135
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,430
When I was little,

136
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,630
there was a terrible fire.

137
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,000
My parents

138
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,170
left this world forever

139
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,270
because they saved me.

140
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,370
So

141
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,360
I will never allow such a tragedy

142
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,570
happen again.

143
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,480
What do you mean your parents left?

144
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,270
Isn't Mr. Song perfectly fine?

145
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,120
I don't understand what you're saying.

146
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,050
It's nothing.

147
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,210
You wouldn't understand.

148
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,120
Nan Heng,

149
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,990
there will

150
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,310
never be a happy ending for us.

151
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,160
Since there can't be a happy ending,

152
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,870
it's better

153
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,070
if we never begin at all.

154
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,480
So

155
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,090
this is your reason for rejecting me?

156
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,870
But Song Yimeng,

157
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,320
have you even tried?

158
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,390
Nothing has even begun,

159
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,050
so why say it's doomed to fail?

160
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,720
If I'm the problem, I can change.

161
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,450
I can promise you

162
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,390
to show you my true self from now on,

163
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,200
and I'll look after the Song family too.

164
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
But why are you using

165
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,150
a made-up excuse

166
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,390
to reject me?

167
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,800
Your Highness doesn't need to understand.

168
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,990
This world

169
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,360
is just one giant storybook.

170
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,080
And I

171
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,420
am just an ordinary person.

172
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,320
I only want

173
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,620
to protect my family,

174
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,610
to keep them alive and well.

175
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,320
The only thing I can control

176
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,120
is my own heart.

177
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,100
So, Your Highness,

178
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,080
the Song Yimeng standing before you

179
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,520
will never

180
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,280
and cannot fall in love with you.

181
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,540
Then let me ask you.

182
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,680
If you're so afraid of death

183
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,790
and pain,

184
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,760
why did you risk everything
to save me last night?

185
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,560
Song Yimeng,

186
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,320
can you really

187
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,690
control your heart?

188
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,120
General.

189
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,330
[Song Residence]

190
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,870
You actually snuck out

191
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,810
without telling me last night?

192
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,550
They tried killing you
and you fell off a cliff.

193
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,510
All of this

194
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,130
happened in one short night.

195
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,870
Mr. Song.

196
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,510
I...

197
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,610
Miss Song Yiting,

198
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,740
last night the two of us

199
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,410
were pursued by nearly 100 assassins.

200
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,750
We had nowhere to retreat

201
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,140
and were forced to the edge of a cliff.

202
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,910
In the end, we barely managed to survive

203
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,770
by choosing to jump off the cliff.

204
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,730
Look,

205
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,610
I even suffered a knife wound.

206
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,080
You were still in the capital

207
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,910
and people dared to be so brazen.

208
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,430
Shut up.

209
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,440
They even dared to
hurt the Seventh Prince.

210
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,240
Thankfully the Seventh Prince
arrived in time,

211
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
otherwise Yimeng

212
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,070
might have already...

213
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,080
It wasn't that serious.

214
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,630
Father,

215
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,560
wasn't serious.

216
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,640
How can you say it wasn't serious
when all this happened?

217
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,200
Mr. Song is right.

218
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,240
Those assassins

219
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,480
were all highly skilled fighters

220
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,630
with ruthless techniques.

221
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,800
Even I,

222
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,150
a veteran of many battles, nearly died,

223
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,550
let alone her.

224
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,240
Nan Heng.

225
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,800
are you done?

226
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,830
Stop exaggerating everything.

227
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,960
What do you mean?

228
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,150
Father,

229
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,390
don't listen to him.

230
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,960
It wasn't nearly as bad as he claims.

231
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,200
If it were really that serious,

232
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,510
how would I still be alive to return?

233
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,120
Think about it.

234
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,790
Even so,

235
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,270
it must have been extremely dangerous.

236
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,150
Otherwise, with how skilled the
Seventh Prince is,

237
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,440
how could he get hurt?

238
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,000
Yiting makes a good point.

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,670
Well...

240
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,960
You are not allowed to go south anymore.

241
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,620
Stay put in the capital.

242
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,320
Father, don't believe everything you hear.

243
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,870
Mr. Song, your thinking is prudent,

244
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,870
but since these villains failed this time,

245
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,550
they will surely seek
another opportunity to strike.

246
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,670
I just wonder

247
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,130
what method they'll use.

248
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,410
Strangulation,

249
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,600
an ambush,

250
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,440
or perhaps poison?

251
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,150
Enough!

252
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,790
Yimeng.

253
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,910
To be safe,

254
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,270
from today on,

255
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,390
you must stay in the Song Residence

256
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,690
and not leave at all.

257
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,080
Father,

258
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,370
this is unnecessary.

259
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,370
Father is right.

260
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,120
We cannot take this lightly.

261
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,120
Just staying indoors isn't enough.

262
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,440
Think about it, Mr. Song.

263
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,830
If they could bribe your stable hand,

264
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,510
then it's possible

265
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,710
they have spies within your household.

266
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,000
Quick,

267
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,750
guards!

268
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,390
Add more guards to the residence

269
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,870
and watch Laiyi House around the clock.

270
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,670
Yes, sir.

271
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,080
Yimeng,

272
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,390
starting today,

273
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,990
you must stay in your room

274
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,950
and not take a single step outside.

275
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,630
Father,

276
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,200
how can I not leave my room?

277
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,320
It's really not that serious.

278
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,440
Don't listen to him.

279
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:17,910
This is truly unnecessary.

280
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,000
Your Highness,

281
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,320
please find the real culprit quickly

282
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,380
so our household can return to peace.

283
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,000
Of course.

284
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,310
I'll do my best.

285
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,510
However, Miss Song Yiting

286
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,470
and Mr. Song,

287
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,960
you both need to be

288
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,750
careful when going out from now on too.

289
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,200
Yes, of course.

290
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,240
Is this his house

291
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,320
or mine?

292
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,060
Why do you all believe him?

293
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,120
Be a good girl.

294
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,480
Making a big show,

295
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,510
blowing things out of proportion.

296
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,360
I know you're up to no good.

297
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,240
Song Yimeng.

298
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,310
Stop following me.

299
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,970
You're going the wrong way.

300
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,240
I...

301
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,840
Don't think I don't know

302
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,150
what you were trying to do

303
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,630
by saying those things to my family.

304
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,360
You may have trapped me for now,

305
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,140
but you can't trap me forever.

306
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,390
Isn't everything I've done
for your own good?

307
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,210
Your enemy hasn't revealed themselves yet.

308
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,360
We absolutely can't let our guard down.

309
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,200
Enemy?

310
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,390
What enemy are you talking about?

311
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,440
That was just an iconic scene

312
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,370
from the script that had to happen.

313
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,790
Besides,

314
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,750
apart from you, what enemies

315
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,580
can I possibly have?

316
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,930
Move.

317
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,000
Your Highness!

318
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,480
Song Yimeng.

319
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,200
Your Highness,

320
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,080
something terrible has happened!

321
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,280
Something terrible!

322
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,720
What happened?

323
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,810
Where on earth has the General gone?

324
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,840
Indeed,

325
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,550
something this serious
has happened to the Chancellor,

326
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,000
yet the General isn't even
at his residence.

327
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,800
What do you...

328
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,440
General.

329
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:40,970
General.

330
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,670
General,

331
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,150
you're finally back.

332
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,440
General,

333
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,510
regarding the Chancellor's matter,

334
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,170
we need you to make a decision.

335
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,030
Yan Yi.

336
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,140
What is

337
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,200
the Ministry of Justice's judgment?

338
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,000
General,

339
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,120
Chancellor Gao's body was

340
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,750
immediately taken to the capital
prefecture's office by Mr. Chu last night.

341
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,630
Early this morning,

342
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,670
Mr. Chu went to the palace
to report to His Majesty.

343
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,440
During this time, the Ministry of Justice
had no chance

344
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,040
to intervene in this matter.

345
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,480
Yao Qian,

346
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,150
didn't I order you to keep constant watch

347
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,510
on the Qianyu Army's movements?

348
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,840
Why did you let Chu Guihong
get ahead of us?

349
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,860
Your Highness.

350
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,150
I mean,

351
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,510
General.

352
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,290
I followed your orders diligently,

353
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,550
working conscientiously

354
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,750
and with utmost care.

355
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,800
Get to the point.

356
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,550
However,

357
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,910
what was unexpected was that

358
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,870
last night, General Chu and Rong Hua

359
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,270
suddenly went to
bid farewell to Chancellor Gao.

360
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,620
As they were parting ways,

361
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,000
something unexpected happened,

362
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,700
and several people lost their lives.

363
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,150
He told you to get to the point.
Are you deaf?

364
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,200
By the time I heard the news,

365
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,790
we had already lost our advantage,

366
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,360
and the case had fallen
into the capital prefect's hands.

367
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,840
I made the quick decision

368
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,120
to return and report to you.

369
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,920
But Your High—

370
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,000
General, your whereabouts were
unknown at that time.

371
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,630
As they say,

372
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,240
losing the commander
during battle is disastrous.

373
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,100
That's enough.

374
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,720
Go now

375
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,420
to find the Gao family.

376
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,160
Tell them to go to the
capital prefecture's office

377
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,440
as next of kin

378
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,480
to claim Chancellor Gao's body.

379
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,270
Yes, sir.

380
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,260
General,

381
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,349
Chu Guihong's behavior in this matter
is quite suspicious.

382
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,640
He bid farewell to the Chancellor,

383
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,349
then requested an audience
with His Majesty.

384
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,109
I fear he may be plotting something

385
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,310
that could harm you.

386
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,430
General,

387
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,430
why don't we

388
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,750
strike first

389
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,550
and use the Chancellor's death

390
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,960
to deal a heavy blow to Chu Guihong?

391
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,000
Yes, General.

392
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,270
Since General Chu met with
the Chancellor last night,

393
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,640
we could use this opportunity

394
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,480
to accuse him of failing to save a life,

395
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,680
deliberately allowing those villains

396
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,000
to assassinate a high-level official

397
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,680
right under the Emperor's nose.

398
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,110
If we can use this to
charge the Qianyu Army

399
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,440
with negligence in their duties,

400
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,480
then the Chancellor's death

401
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,070
actually works in our favor.

402
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,240
That makes sense.

403
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,280
Exactly.

404
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,720
General,

405
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,640
Chancellor Gao's death is irreversible.

406
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,550
Please accept our condolences.

407
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,200
But right now, maintaining

408
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,070
the political balance that Chancellor Gao
worked so hard to establish

409
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,500
is of paramount importance.

410
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,640
No matter what,

411
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,170
you still have us.

412
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:12,790
Yes,

413
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,510
-Yes.
-Yes.

414
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,200
Enough.

415
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,440
I'll make my own judgment on this matter.

416
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,640
You may all leave now.

417
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,510
Yes.

418
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,550
-Yes.
-Yes.

419
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,930
How quickly loyalties change.

420
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,200
When Chancellor Gao was alive,

421
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,750
these people were falling over themselves

422
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,850
to follow his every command.

423
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:34,570
And now?

424
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,110
He's passed away less than 24 hours ago,

425
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,840
and they've completely changed their tune.

426
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,200
A matter of life and death

427
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,800
shouldn't be used as
a pawn in power struggles.

428
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,260
This is all too common.

429
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,050
In power struggles,

430
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,240
how much sincerity can you expect?

431
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,510
By the way,

432
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,960
what's the progress on investigating
those men in black?

433
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,590
And who set up those traps in the cave?

434
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,950
Any leads?

435
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,830
Well, we're still investigating about

436
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,890
those men in black,

437
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,720
but those weapons
and rope traps in the cave

438
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,580
were placed there on your orders.

439
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,510
I ordered it?

440
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,910
What do you mean I ordered it?

441
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,240
I just found out myself.

442
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,790
Two years ago,

443
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,310
when Waning River Crescent
was at risk of being exposed,

444
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,510
you used Li Shiliu's identity

445
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,680
to order Yunlong and Shanhu

446
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,990
to move the weapons hidden in the hall.

447
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,070
They didn't know your real identity then.

448
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,750
Yunlong

449
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,060
found that cave in Huyang Forest

450
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,480
and stored everything there.

451
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,110
And Shanhu

452
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,380
copied the Xuanjia Army's techniques

453
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,030
to set up those rope traps

454
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,420
to throw off suspicion.

455
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,290
They planned that
if it were ever discovered,

456
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,620
they would pin it on you.

457
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,400
Why pin it on me?

458
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,270
Well, you're known as
the God of Death.

459
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:38,920
I...

460
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,190
So just because I'm the God of Death,
I deserve this?

461
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,000
Enough.

462
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,810
Stop investigating the men in black too.

463
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,000
Right now,

464
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,510
go immediately to
the capital prefecture's office

465
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,910
and pressure Chu Guihong

466
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,300
to release Shangguan He and the others.

467
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,960
Yes.

468
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,680
Won't let me investigate the assassins.

469
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,720
All he cares about is
Shangguan the Useless.

470
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Such favoritism.

471
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,260
Are you saying

472
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,080
Heng killed Gao Changyin?

473
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,000
Yes.

474
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,070
I suspect that

475
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,250
the Seventh Prince had a conflict

476
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,350
with Chancellor Gao over
the Jiangnan case

477
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,750
and feared that someday,

478
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,680
Chancellor Gao would
expose his misconduct

479
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,830
during the Pingrong Battle

480
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,920
to the world,

481
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,650
so he simply silenced him permanently.

482
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,240
I humbly request Your Majesty

483
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,440
to reinvestigate the Pingrong Battle.

484
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,550
This is a matter of great importance.

485
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,820
Gao Changyin's dying words alone

486
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,460
are not sufficient evidence.

487
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,400
To reopen and review
the entire Pingrong incident

488
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,970
requires concrete proof.

489
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,920
For now,

490
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,480
you should first investigate

491
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,110
who killed Gao Changyin.

492
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,790
If it was indeed Heng's doing,

493
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,070
I will make my own judgment.

494
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,510
I will thoroughly investigate

495
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,920
both cases to the end.

496
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,770
Once I find compelling evidence
about the Pingrong Battle,

497
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,400
I will vindicate my father

498
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,880
and the Qianyu Army.

499
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,150
At that time,

500
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,290
Your Majesty can take this opportunity

501
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,690
to completely eliminate

502
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,690
Nan Heng's influence in court.

503
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,750
Ten!

504
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,240
Fifteen!

505
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,590
Ten!

506
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,350
Fifteen!

507
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,160
Ten, ten!

508
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,720
Fifteen!

509
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,590
Twenty!

510
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,920
That doesn't count!

511
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Let's start over.

512
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,640
Again! Let's go!

513
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,400
Ten!

514
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,110
Twenty!

515
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,640
-Twenty!
-Nothing!

516
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,240
Nothing!

517
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,030
Open!

518
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,440
I won again!

519
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,000

533
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,540
of this, General?

Nan Heng orchestrated
the Pingrong Battle conspiracy,

535
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,300
but all records in the Qianyu Army

This must be

539
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,890
because his men who
infiltrated the Qianyu Army

540
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,310
tampered with the evidence,

541
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,930
and then pretended to have died in battle

542

to escape.

543
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,350
General, are you suggesting

544
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,930
that these fugitives

545
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,000
might be hiding
within the Waning River Crescent?

546
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,830
If they're not hiding among

547
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,880
these mysterious Nightwalkers,

548
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,800
where else would they be?

549
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,160

00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,960
Why have you come to see us personally?

552
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,550
Nan Heng traded 60 lashes

553
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,460
to save the Waning River Crescent.

554

You're free to go now.

555

This way, please.

556
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,770

557
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,070
take my advice to heart.

The last death row meal

561
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,510
didn't quite satisfy you.

Whenever you're ready
to come over to our side,

to welcome you.

And then,

565
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,780
I'll invite you

566
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,400
to enjoy a few more pig trotters.

567
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,240
I'll pass on that death row meal.

But since we're a man and a woman,

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,060
you don't need to be so enthusiastic.

670
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,520
After all this,

671
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
were you really

672
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,180
just toying with me,

673
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,680
or do you actually

674
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,270
intend to marry me?

675
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,590
Marry?

676
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,540
So you suspect Chancellor Gao is behind
the attempt to kill Song Yimeng?

677
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,870
But didn't Chancellor Gao die last night?

678
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,970
Could he still be alive?

679
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,510
You're just now figuring this out?

680
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
Fair point.

681
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,260
In the entire capital,

682
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,790
the only person willing
to go to such lengths

683
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,070
to kill Song Yimeng

684
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,470
would be Chancellor Gao.

685
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,480
Now because of the Jiangnan case,

686
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,670
he was convinced that Song Yimeng
made you fall in love

687
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,830
and lose interest in
the crown prince title,

688
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,330
so he wanted to eliminate her quickly.

689
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,290
So,

690
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,000
if he simultaneously targeted
Song Yimeng last night

691
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,270
while staging his own death,

692
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,270
then everything

693
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,310
would make sense.

694
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,670
So Chancellor Gao's power

695
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,790
is far greater than we imagined.

696
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,630
He not only manages
a group of assassins,

697
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,290
but even within the Xuanjia Army,

698
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,790
he has planted people

699
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,400
to help him fake his death and escape.

700
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,590
We must investigate this.

701
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,680
At the very least, we need to find out

702
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,720
how many more hidden forces

703
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,310
Gao Changyin has at his disposal.

704
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,240
If we let this situation
develop unchecked,

705
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,480
I fear that one day,

706
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,590
it might be possible for him to

707
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,920
overthrow the emperor.

708
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,880
Regarding the Xuanjia Army,

709
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,140
I've already sent Fugui to investigate.

710
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,040
But to find Chancellor Gao,

711
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,730
we'll need to employ the Nightwalkers.

712
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,370
But with his people in the Xuanjia Army,

713
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,460
we might alert him to our actions.

714
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,310
How about this?

715
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,710
I'll have Yunlong and Shanhu investigate.

716
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,690
What about you?

717
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,000
Me?

718
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,400
Th-This task isn't really suitable for me.

719
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,310
You know my health isn't good.

720
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,030
I'd fall over in a light breeze.

721
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,110
I'd likely just hold you back

722
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,640
during the investigation.

723
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
If I cause any delay,

724
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,880
that would ruin your grand plan.

725
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,040
You have a point.

726
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,030
Indeed.

727
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,160
So,

728
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,310
I'm assigning you to do something else.

729

[Grace & Elegance]

730
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,310
You've only met the Seventh Prince

731
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,920
and now you want to
discuss our marriage at my home?

732
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,720
What,

733
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,920

your father or something?

735
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,240
We're all cultured people here.

736
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,900
Such talk is improper.

737
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,270
Marriage is a serious matter

738
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,200
that shouldn't be rushed.

739
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,270
Let's set that aside for now.

740
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,350
However, the Zijin Pavilion incident

741
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,080
was indeed my fault.

742
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,160
I should personally visit

743
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,760

744
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,480
I see it's getting late.

745
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,240
Why don't we

746
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,300
go now?

747
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,750
Did His Highness

748
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,200
send you to my home

749
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,680
with some task?

00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,080
Don't tell me

751
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,150
he sent you to spy on Yimeng?

752
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,330
Truly the capital's most talented lady.

753
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,590
Everyone says Miss Song Yiting
is brilliantly clever.

00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,830
with this small favor?

and is lazy too.

I never thought you were
this type of person.

You've misunderstood me.

Fine,

I can bring you to the Song family.

I'll add in a guest room
with windows on both sides.

773
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,620
That's too generous.

And two maids,

if the Seventh Prince

Although the capital prefecture's office

circulating in the capital,

The cause of Chancellor Gao's death

was petroleum and thunder bombs.

The prison cart
transporting Chancellor Gao

00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:56,290
Now that Chancellor Gao is dead,

862
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,280
the various factions at court

863
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,340
will certainly make a big issue of it.

864
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,230
If it's proven in the end

865
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,460
that the Seventh Prince
killed Chancellor Gao,

866
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,790
I'm afraid Great Jing will face upheaval.

867
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,440
Mrs. Li's strike was

868
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,270
precise and deadly,

869
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,530
killing with one blow.

870
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,180
Did you notice anything suspicious?

871
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,820
The bones show multiple fractures

872
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,020
that have been reset,

873
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,110
and the muscles are strong.

874
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:28,920
This person

875
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,590
must be a deliberately trained assassin.

876
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,270
What is it now?

877
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,970
I recognize this mark.

878
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,230
General,

879
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,070
here's all the information on
the Nightwalkers.

880
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,000
We haven't found anyone connected

881
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,060
to the Qianyu Army.

882
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,130
Their backgrounds might be fabricated.

883
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,360
Take some men

884
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,020
and investigate their hometowns again.

885
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,710
Yes, sir.

886
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:10,600
Guihong.

887
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,480
Look what I've brought you.

888
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,800
This belonged to my mother when...

889
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,660
Your Highness.

890
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,350
How did this happen?

891
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,230
Come here.

892
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,510
What a shame.

893
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,170
What are you looking at?

894
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,030
It's the same.

895
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,080
It's the same fabric.

896
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,860
So what?

897
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,510
Guihong,

898
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,230
it's just an ordinary piece of fabric.

899
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,030
Why are you so worked up about it?

900
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,610
This was the fabric of the Qianyu Army's

901
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,920
winter uniform when we were at the border.

902
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,800
Its owner

903
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,850
might be an old friend of the Qianyu Army.

904
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,440
Aren't you overthinking this?

905
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:14,950
In recent years,

906
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,280
there's been a lot of trade between
the capital and the border.

907
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,190
Similar clothing

908
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,190
can be purchased in the capital too.

909
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,210
This is fabric for military uniforms.

910
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,330
The border is cold

911
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,530
and during war,

912
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,070
clothes often get damaged.

913
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,530
Father specifically chose
a local coarse hemp

914
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,990
to make winter uniforms
for the Qianyu Army.

915
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,500
Are you saying

916
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,440
these clothes

917
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,970
can't be bought with money?

918
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,080
Your Highness,

919
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,370
where did you buy

920
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,130
that basket of red tangerines?

921
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,510
Trespassing the Kou Gang's territory,

922
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,300
you two must be tired of living.

923
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,460
Who exactly are you people?

924
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,550
Businessmen.

925
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,820
We have a big job right now.

926
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,600
Are you interested?

927
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,480
I've never been one to turn down money.

928
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,280
May I ask what kind

929
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,640
of business you gentlemen have in mind?

930
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,550
Murder.

931
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,050
We need to speak with your boss.

932
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,640
If you want to meet our boss,

933
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,490
this level of sincerity

934
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,760
isn't quite enough.

935
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:13,460
How about this much sincerity?

936
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,920
I believe you can all tell

937
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,710
that these are things
circulated among the nobility.

938
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,800
If you're smart,

939
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
stop wasting time

940
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,620
and make the introduction now.

941
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,960
Tonight at midnight,

942
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,890
I'll bring my boss

943
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,430
to meet you at Jiangsong Forest.

944
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,590
Take a look!

945
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,030
Come take a look!

946
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,000
Fresh vegetables!

947
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,340
Freshly picked!

948
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,620
Come, come!

949
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,800
Step right up!

950
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:47,670
They're very fresh.

951
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,320
They're just harvested.

952
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,070
See how fresh they are.

953
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,960
They're still moist with dew.

954
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,020
Why would you come to
such a place to buy red tangerines?

955
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,590
Well, every winter,

956
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,830
Mother loved these
Dongting red tangerines.

957
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:59,090
Since they're not common in the capital,

958
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,110
I had people search around for them.

959
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,230
But I don't see anyone
selling red tangerines.

960
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,800
Jixiang said he bought them
at the South City market.

961
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,930
I don't really know.

962
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,440
Guihong,

963
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,230
see?

964
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,110
How much are these red tangerines?

965
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:16,920
Try one.

966
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,130
[The 4th day of the Pingrong Battle]

967
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,280
Lu Yi.

968
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:27,700
[Lu Yi,
Scout of the Six Camps of Qianyu Army]

969
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,230
Four hundred li southeast of here

970
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,030
is Youcheng,
where the Xuanjia Army is stationed.

971
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,590
You must deliver this letter,

972
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,440
understand?

973
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,050
But Junior General,

974
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,900
if Seventh Prince were willing
to send troops,

975
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,860
he would have done so already.

976
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,920
Why would things be like this now?

977
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,120
Consider this letter

978
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,110
as my last attempt.

979
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,710
Where are you going, Guihong?

980
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,510
Wait for me!

981
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,340
You're clearly still alive.

982
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,840
Why haven't you come to see me?
