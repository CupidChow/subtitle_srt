Why does His Majesty
play favorites like this?

336
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,160
Could it be because of

Today,

345
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,790
I'll break down the art
of political intrigue for you.

346
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,960
The Lantern Festival should have been

347
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,960
a surefire play for Chu Guihong
to seize command of all palace forces,

348
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,890
inside and out,
and keep the Seventh Prince in check.

349
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,570
If nothing had gone wrong,

350
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,810
His Majesty would've
cleared the path for him

351
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,210
so he could assist
the future crown prince:

352
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,590
Nan Rui.

353
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,360
But now,

354
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,640
who has benefited the most from all this?

355
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,380
Nan Heng.

356
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,120
[Nan Heng, Nan Rui]

357
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,210
Exactly!

358
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,640
Then think about this.

359
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,170
Last night,

360
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,380
[Nan Heng, Nan Rui]

361
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,290
Nan Rui set the fire.

362
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,080
Why would
the Eighteenth Prince set a fire?

363
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,240
Because he…

364
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,740
Because he was drunk.

365
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,590
And why was he drunk?

366
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,590
Because…

367
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,920
Because he got scolded.

368
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,700
Who scolded him?

369
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,710
The Seventh Prince did.

370
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,960
And why did the Seventh Prince scold him?

371
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,940
Because you showed up on the tower.

372
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,430
Yeah.

373
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,640
Why did you go up there last night?

374
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,640
Is that really the point, Father?

375
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,550
Weren't you supposed

376
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,160
to break down
the political intrigue for me?

377
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,160
Keep going.

378
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,180
Right, right.

379
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,780
Let's get back to it.

380
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,350
To sum it all up,

381
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,700
Nan Rui setting the fire

382
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,730
must've been part of

383
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,380
the Seventh Prince's scheme.

384
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,170
[Nan Heng, Nan Rui]

385
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,720
That was a scheme?

386
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,790
He might nail the timing and place,

387
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,590
but could he really
have foreseen Nan Rui starting a fire?

388
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,350
You...

389
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,510
If you keep thinking so simply,

390
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,640
how can I ever stop worrying about you?

391
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,160
You can't afford
to see people as innocent.

392
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:55,980
Father,

393
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,450
by your logic,

394
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,560
So Nan Heng arranged

395
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,780
the attack on himself, too?

396
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,790
Yeah.

397
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,880
Nan Heng staged
an assassination attempt on himself.

398
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,550
That's a solid theory.

399
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,040
Stop, stop, stop.

400
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,620
Father, that's enough.

401
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,170
Maybe you'd better
steer clear of politics.

402
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,510
I'm starting to worry your hairline

403
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,840
is going to
bail on you early over all this.

404
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,720
What does that mean?

405
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,160
Does His Majesty see

406
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,290
the Eighteenth Prince as his only son?

407
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,240
The Eighteenth Prince set the fire.

408
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,480
He got away unpunished,

409
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,510
and when we offered to clean up the mess,

410
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,240
His Majesty wanted
Chu Guihong to take care of it instead.

411
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,250
Why?

412
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,270
Last night's chaos at the Lantern Festival

413
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,200
was an accident.

414
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,400
I thought the matter was over,

415
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,920
but somehow Nan Rui

416
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,510
still managed to stir things up.

417
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
So in the end, Song Yimeng's warning

418
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,350
about the chaos last night
actually came true.

419
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,680
Don't you think that's a bit suspicious?

420
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,210
So Song Yimeng is the one
pulling the strings?

421
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,510
She's your real enemy
hiding in the shadows?

422
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,440
No way.

423
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,200
You got proof?

424
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
I don't need any.

425
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
I know her.

426
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,310
She'd never risk innocent lives

427
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,480
to set a trap.

428
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,550
Song Yimeng

429
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,270
can control you with sorcery

430
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,600
and predict the future.

431
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,160
That woman's full of secrets.

432
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,150
If you ask me,

433
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,000
we'd better find out
what she's really up to.

434
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,200
Your Highness,

435
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,620
Miss Song Yimeng is here to see you.

436
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,680
Oh no, oh no.

437
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,830
Where are His Highness's mask, hat,

438
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,640
and mechanical arm?

439
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,440
This is the prince's residence.

440
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,710
She's here to see the Seventh Prince.

441
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,770
Then why aren't you heading out?

442
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,350
I heard you went to the palace today.

443
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,160
So?

444
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,660
His Majesty didn't punish you, did he?

445
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,120
That sounded sarcastic,

446
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,080
like I came just to laugh at him.

447
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,440
No, I need a different approach.

448
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,670
Your Highness,

449
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,600
you were a victim

450
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,040
in yesterday's assassination attempt.

451
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,030
Are you hurt anywhere?

452
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,070
Let me take a look.

453
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,250
Seeing you like this

454
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,790
really breaks

455
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:25,860
my heart.

456
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,990
Way too pretentious.

457
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,210
Your Highness,

458
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,130
I heard you're in charge of investigating

459
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,890
yesterday's assassination attempt.

460
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,570
Isn't it possible

461
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,740
that it was just a misunderstanding?

462
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,790
No, no.

463
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,270
Too obvious.

464
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,470
That'll just make him more suspicious.

465
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,030
If all else fails,

466
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,230
I'll have to use my ultimate move.

467
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,550
Your Highness.

468
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,310
What's the matter?

469
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,880
I...

470
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,480
Your...

471
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,680
I haven't gone to find you,

472
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,410
and you've come to me yourself.

473
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:04,550
You…

474
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,750
Are you disappointed

475
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,700
to see that I'm still alive?

476
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,880
I...

477
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,550
Let me do it.

478
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,200
Let me.

479
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:28,620
Your Highness.

480
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,200
I did something stupid last night.

481
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,730
I acted without thinking.

482
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,470
Can you forgive me?

483
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,640
I almost died last night.

484
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,450
How can I forgive you?

485
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,600
You used to
want to kill me too, didn't you?

486
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,390
And you tried more than once.

487
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,550
So let's just…

488
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,920
call it even.

489
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,000
Your Highness.

490
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,680
Your Highness.

491
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,590
Let go.

492
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
I know

493
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,030
you went to the palace today

494
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,220
and got chewed out pretty badly.

495
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,550
You must be very frustrated.

496
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,130
But Your Highness,

497
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,050
you're magnanimous, right?

498
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,720
So please just let it slide.

499
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,350
Enough, drop the act.

500
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,690
I know what kind of person you are.

501
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,400
Spill it,

502
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,880
what do you really want?

503
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,590
Sorry!

504
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,370
Your Highness.

505
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,480
I'm really sorry.

506
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,440
I planned the assassination.

507
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
The Eighteenth Prince set the fire.

508
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,880
You did nothing,

509
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,320
yet you took all the heat.

510
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,360
So I came today

511
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,480
to apologize to you.

512
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,130
Weren't you trying
to kill me only last night?

513
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,990
Why come here to apologize today?

514
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,640
Because...

515
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,550
because you're human.

516
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,570
You can feel wronged as well.

517
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,480
When the grievances pile up,

518
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,720
you grow indignant

519
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,190
and go to extremes.

520
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,030
In the past, the outside world

521
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,290
was beyond my control,

522
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,040
but now, inside my own script,

523
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,630
I can't let anyone

524
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,050
be wrongfully accused.

525
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,160
Alright,

526
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,260
I'll think about it.

527
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,510
But

528
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,230
it depends on how sincere you are.

529
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,920
I knew it.

530
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,110
Your Highness,

531
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,240
you're both wise

532
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,350
and magnanimous.

533
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,940
So, Your Highness,

534
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,850
how about Li Shiliu?

535
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,250
Could you let him go too?

536
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,400
You groveled and poured on the flattery

537
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,570
just for that martial-world ruffian?

538
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,050
You really care about him, huh?

539
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,940
But what if I

540
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,660
just refuse to spare him?

541
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,890
No way!

542
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,280
He's my man.

543
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,240
Hurt him, and you hurt me.

544
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,510
Your man?

545
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,170
Yep!

546
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,720
You lay a finger on him,

547
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,310
and you're crossing the Song family.

548
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,030
My family and I
are not to be underestimated.

549
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,090
Don't mess with me!

550
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,160
Fine.

551
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,180
You can go now.

552
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,400
Your Highness, you…

553
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,930
What do you mean by that?

554
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,350
Are you saying you'll spare him?

555
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,890
Keep talking,

556
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,920
and I'll have troops
raid Waning River Crescent

557
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,510
and kill that Li Shiliu.

558
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,740
Many thanks, Your Highness.

559
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,470
Many thanks, Your Highness.

560
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,160
Thank you, Your Highness.

561
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,620
Thank you, Your Highness.

562
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,290
But what if I

563
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,460
just refuse to spare him?

564
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,770
He's my man.

565
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,310
You lay a finger on him,
and you're crossing the Song family.

566
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,160
My family and I
are not to be underestimated.

567
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,220
Don't mess with me!

568
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,180
[Peace and Serenity]

569
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,640
Fugui.

570
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,850
We're colleagues, after all.

571
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,750
Don't be so mean, okay?

572
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,510
Stop.

573
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,590
I grew up with His Highness.

574
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,270
Back when I was his page,

575
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,870
you were nowhere to be found.

576
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,350
You sneak in
through the back door now and then,

577
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,230
but I come and go through the front door.

578
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,440
Don't think that strutting around

579
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,750
with that stupid earring
that marks you as the Second Master

580
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,070
of Waning River Crescent

581
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,110
makes you my equal.

582
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,640
Why are you shaking your head?

583
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,570
What do you mean?

584
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,240
Make it clear!

585
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,960
Fugui,

586
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,740
subordinates
who can't read the boss's mind

587
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,920
get fired.

588
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,270
Do I need to read minds?

589
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,270
Whatever His Highness thinks…

590
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,760
You...

591
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,720
Where are you?

592
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,880
Come back!

593
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,720
What is it?

594
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,170
Your Highness.

595
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,110
You look troubled.

596
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,720
I've made something delicious.

597
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,790
How about we…

598
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,310
No need.

599
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,590
Should the Court of Judicial Review

600
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,830
assist in the assassination case?

601
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,590
No need.

602
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,070
No for this, no for that—

603
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,160
what do you want?

604
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,280
Here's the plan:

605
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,750
Go find three death-row convicts.

606
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,160
Then dress them up like Li Shiliu,

607
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,720
Yunlong, and Shanhu.

608
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,700
We'll say they impersonated men
from Waning River Crescent

609
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,500
to carry out the assassination.

610
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,830
I got it.

611
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,640
You want to clear
Waning River Crescent's name.

612
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,830
What about Chu Guihong?

613
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,000
Should we say he's the mastermind

614
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,350
behind this and take him down?

615
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,200
No need.

616
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,170
I'm afraid if we keep digging,

617
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,960
we'll end up dragging in
Waning River Crescent

618
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
and Song Yi…

619
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,660
I got it again.

620
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,240
You not only

621
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,550
want to clear
Waning River Crescent's name

622
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:37,010
but also to protect
Miss Song and her family.

623
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,030
Anything else?

624
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,230
If not, you may leave.

625
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,410
Your Highness,

626
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,700
that was a gift from Miss Song, wasn't it?

627
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,070
I know all there is to know

628
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,600
about Miss Song.

629
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,750
I was just

630
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,750
reading up

631
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,480
on her life story.

632
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,370
Maybe Your Highness and I
could go over it together.

633
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,830
You?

634
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,830
Yes!

635
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,240
If you've got questions,

636
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,160
just ask.

637
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,740
Then let me ask you.

638
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,880
What is a script?

639
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,240
It's…

640
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,160
Of course I know that.

641
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,770
It means

642
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,650
to scrape up some capital.

643
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,070
Your Highness, are you opening a shop?

644
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,160
We gather some money first

645
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,680
and then go downtown

646
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,480
to rent a storefront.

647
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,400
Next question:

648
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,320
What's a lead role,

649
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,900
and what's a supporting role?

650
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,310
Oh no.

651
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,810
I know finger rolls, egg rolls,

652
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,070
and even sushi rolls.

653
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,150
But what is a supporting roll?

654
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,790
What is a supporting roll?

655
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,130
Your Highness.

656
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,660
Your Highness, why are you leaving?

657
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,610
Your Highness.

658
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,880
Give me another chance, Your Highness.

659
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,550
Mr. Li,

660
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,940
you want to take part
in the reconstruction?

661
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,050
The chaos in the South City

662
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,030
left many people homeless.

663
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,310
People know me

664
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,830
only as the head of Waning River Crescent

665
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,630
and as a martial-world ruffian.

666
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,960
They don't know

667
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,450
that I also aspire to help people.

668
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,320
Mr. Li,

669
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:29,210
you truly are kind and gentle,

670
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,510
devoted to helping others.

671
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,240
But this reconstruction

672
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,640
is a government project.

673
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,880
Nan Heng is a sinister man.

674
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,160
If he finds out
you're still in the capital,

675
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,560
you could get in trouble.

676
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,430
The assassination matter is over.

677
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,350
I don't know who helped clear

678
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,080
Waning River Crescent's name,

679
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,840
but since the court has closed the case,

680
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,550
I'm in the clear now.

681
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,440
I can't live my whole life in fear

682
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,830
just because of one setback.

683
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,240
But...

684
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,970
Don't worry.

685
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,300
I've lived in the capital for years.

686
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,950
I know how to protect myself.

687
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,900
Though Nan Heng…

688
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,280
is a sinister,

689
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,440
ruthless man

690
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,610
who's also powerful,

691
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,920
meticulous,

692

I...

695
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,409
Anyway,

696
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,880
since I already promised

697
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,739
to work with you against Nan Heng,

698
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:32,750
I won't just sit back and watch.

699
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,670
So,

700
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,150
I'll see the reconstruction

701
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,710
through to the end.

702
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,510
Mr. Li,

703
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,900
you're such a good person.

704
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,949
You're a true hero—

705
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,480
selfless and caring.

706
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,280
Tomorrow, I'll go with you.

707
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,660
I'll join you

708
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,770

709
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,070
Okay.

710
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,760
Sinister and ruthless?

711
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,200
You're acting weird.

712
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,000
I said things I didn't mean
just to gain her trust.

713
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,400
What's weird about that?

714
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,400
Still,

715
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,590

716

717
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,670
Pretty thrilling, huh?

718
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,920
The past is the past.

719
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,910
Now I'm Li Shiliu.

720
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,760
Is there a problem with that?

721
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,550
No problem.

722
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,750
It's just that

723
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,480
you went all out

724
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,590
to kill her in the past.

725
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,880
But now, you're going all out

726

to help her.

727
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,710
Li Shiliu, you're such a selfless man—

728
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,710
fixing up homes all on your own.

729
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,280
If I were a woman,

730
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,210
I would've fallen for you ages ago.

731
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,590
First of all,

732
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,760
I'm not like you—

734
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,960
Second,

735
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,760
I meant what I said about
rebuilding the homes,

736
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,220
and I'm not doing it alone.

737
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,330
The whole
Waning River Crescent will be helping.

738
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,340
That includes you.

739
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,950
Including me?

740
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,280
I'm so debonair.

741
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,320
Am I really fit for reconstruction work?

742
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,510
Since you're so debonair,

743
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,630
I have to send you out

744
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,740
and draw some attention.

745
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,680
Attention is one thing I never lack.

746
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:22,750
Your Highness.

747
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,400
If the useless Shangguan won't go,

someone else is ready to step up.

749
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,590
Perfect.

750
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,110

751

I know quite a bit
about reconstruction.

755

Your Highness, if you're willing…

756
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,770
I'm not willing.

Listen.

what on earth are you worried about?

00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,510
Yimeng,

802
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,510
reconstruction is a matter of the court.

803
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,480
Li Shiliu is just a martial-world ruffian,

What is court business?

813

858
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,070
D-Don't talk nonsense!

859
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,510
When have I ever

860
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,240
had an affair with your master?

861
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,460
In the royal garden,

862
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,320
you two kissed.

863
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,670
In the prince's private garden,

864
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,870
you two kissed again.

865
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,230
All you two ever did was kiss.

866
00:40:59,230 --> 00:40:59,880
Stop.

867
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,440
Well,

868
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,150
every superstar has a shady past,

869
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,840
right?

870
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,550
I understand.

871
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,590
It's not easy being a paparazzo.

872
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,090
You just want

873
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,480
to make some money.

874
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,230
Hush money.

875
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,880
Forget all those kisses,

876
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,950
okay?

877
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:23,840
Mr. Fugui,

878
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,550
take it.

879
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,320
If anything like this comes up again,

880
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,480
I won't forget you.

881
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,030
Now that I've paid…

882
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,670
Answer me!

883
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:29,980
What's a superstar?

884
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,970
What's a paparazzo?
