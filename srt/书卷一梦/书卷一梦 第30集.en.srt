Such unpardonable crimes

When I was little,

174
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,400
I used to set lanterns on the river.

175
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,440
Back then,

176
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,690
I prayed to my dead mother,

177
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,800
hoping that I could win Nan Heng once.

178
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,510
But my prayers were never answered.

179
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,730
I was so frustrated at those times.

180
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,740
Now that I think of it,

181
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,730
I actually feel quite grateful.

182
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:56,760
[To my mother]

183
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,690
[To my mother in heaven:
May Great Jing be in peace forever]

184
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,730
Heng is better suited
to be the crown prince.

185
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,050
Well, I know I've let you guys down.

186
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,630
But forcing me into this role

187
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,000
won't bring good to Great Jing,

188
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,790
will it?

189
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,630
Jixiang,

190
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,420
I'm telling you,

191
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,720
I'll also get paid
for just being a prince.

192
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,200
I promise

193
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,360
you'll get your monthly salary

194
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,790
in full or even more.

195
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,360
If Heng

196
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,550
h-has the guts to deny me

197
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,240
that money,

198
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,150
I-I'll beg him

199
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,200
or yell at him. I...

200
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,630
H-He has to give me money.

201
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,840
He... Anyway...

202
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,560
If you can't be promoted

203
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,640
to the position of chief steward,

204
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,960
will you still work for me?

205
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,220
Your Highness,

206
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,070
that position is usually

207
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,200
filled by an eunuch.

208
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,060
I'm not an eunuch.

209
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,440
Jixiang.

210
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,530
Jixiang,

211
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:09,990
just listen,

212
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:10,890
t-t-this...

213
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
Anyway, I mean...

214
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,280
Let's go.

215
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:14,920
Put the lanterns

216
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,650
on the river.

217
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:23,210
[To my mother in heaven:
May Great Jing be in peace forever]

218
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,230
How many lanterns

219
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,390
do you want to release?

220
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,080
I'll do it with you.

221
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,630
10?

222
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,030
We can make it 15 if you want.

223
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,000
50 is also fine if necessary!

224
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,200
No need.

225
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,670
I have no family.

226
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,100
But to honor Qianyu soldiers,

227
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,200
we should at least release
100 lanterns, right?

228
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,440
No need for that either.

229
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,770
I don't know any of them.

230
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,810
Why do you have to be a buzzkill?

231
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,800
I have an idea.

232
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,340
You can set one on the river for me.

233
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,240
Right?

234
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,440
Write something from your heart.

235
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,000
I mean things you feel too embarrassed

236
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
to put in a letter or express to me.

237
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,270
Write them on a lantern then!

238
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,080
Don't go away.

239
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,240
We're not finished here!

240
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,870
Jixiang!

241
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,270
Oh, you.

242
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,840
Why are you so shy?

243
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,140
Slow down. Wait up!

244
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,000
Look at you,

245
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,200
acting like a stubborn donkey now.

246
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,920

247
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,780
[Gentle Breeze, Pleasant Weather]

248
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,210
Enough.

249
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,120
You can't even handle

250
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,440
your own love life.

251
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,790
Stop giving me lectures.

252
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,550
Instead of nagging here,

253
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,000
you should go to Yiting's place

254
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,600
and draw paintings with her.

255
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,870
I'm not giving you lectures.

256
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,080
I'm doing this for my own good.

257
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,400
Which of these two

258
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,750
looks prettier on me?

259
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,870
Think about it.

260
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,910
Chief is leaving,

261
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,080
and I've lost my

262
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,240
hard-earned job.

263
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,670
Knock it off.

264
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,750
You're a huge slacker.

265
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,240
Would you happily take on a job?

266
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,910
Besides,

267
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,440
losing that job is just perfect.

268
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,500
Yiting is waiting for you, isn't she?

269
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,750
The Song family is wealthy.

270
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,240
Being her husband,

271
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,350
my friend,

272
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,440
will at least

273
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,870
save you 20 years of hard work.

274
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,550
Sponging off a woman

275
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,630
is not as satisfying as
earning my own bread.

276
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,870
As the saying goes,

277
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,750
"Getting in one's way to
wealth is committing murder."

278
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,550
Look,

279
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,600
Miss Song,

280
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,840
you've saved my life once.

281
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,600
It's only a virtuous act to do it again.

282
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,790
Don't worry, Shangguan.

283
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,100
Your chief won't be able to leave.

284
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,840
The plots are set.

285
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,210
No characters can escape their fate.

286
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,870
What's more,

287
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,080
I don't respond well to those

288
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,120
who fish for sympathy.

289
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,440
So drop the act.

290
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,870
Which dress looks better on me?

291
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,030
The blue one.

292
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,760
It makes your skin look fairer.

293
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,060
[Quietly Observe]

294
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,670
Your Majesty,

295
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,490
the registered Xuanjia soldiers

296
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,080
amount to 23,600.

297
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,430
The registry has been handed
over to the Ministry of War.

298
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,890
This is the command token.

299
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,000
Please take it back, Your Majesty.

300
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,880
Rise, and we'll talk.

301
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,130
The late Empress's death

302
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,640
was not your fault.

303
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,680
It was not.

304
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,550
You didn't purposefully

305
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,270
lead her to that path.

306
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,110
I didn't.

307
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,400
Why did you never

308
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,340
explain it in all these years?

309
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,050
I did once.

310
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,240
When I was little...

311
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,200
I'm sorry.

312
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,850
Forget it.

313
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,750
I know you've always resented me.

314
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,440
I dare not.

315
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,170
You keep the command token.

316
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,870
When we

317
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,030
planned for a setup to trap Gao Changyin,

318
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,790
you promised to return your military power

319
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,320
to me if our efforts failed.

320
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,270
Now, we have succeeded.

321
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,520
Gao Changyin has been executed as well.

322
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,880
I give you my word

323
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,720
that the whole thing

324
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,200
is over now.

325
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,900
I won't pursue it further.

326
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,680
Many thanks, Your Majesty.

327
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:26,970
In fact, I'm not

328
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,820
afraid of being held accountable.

329
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,410
I've come to understand one thing.

330
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,210
What is it?

331
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,550
My uncle

332
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,750
caused innumerable deaths

333
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,040
and committed severe crimes

334
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,880
out of

335
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,720
his greed for power.

336
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,790
I was involved.

337
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,940
My hands are no cleaner than his.

338
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,070
Therefore,

339
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,240
I'm no longer qualified to

340
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,350
compete for what doesn't belong to me.

341
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,100
Do you mean you want to

342
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,270
retire from the army

343
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,110
and quit your job?

344
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,330
Condemn yourself

345
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,750
all you want in your own mansion.

346
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,680
But don't you ever

347
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,880
think of resigning.

348
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,480
To tell you the truth,

349
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,640
I will

350
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,070
not only make you stay,

351
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,730
but also give you

352
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,790
this.

353
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Open your eyes and look carefully!

354
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,360
[The Seventh Prince Nan Heng
is qualified to be the crown prince]

355
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,260
[Imperial Edict]

356
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,070
Crown prince?

357
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,680
Your Majesty...

358
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,240
I met with Rui last night.

359
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,250
He said

360
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,240
he was inferior to you in all areas

361
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,550
pertaining to

362
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,290
managing the country.

363
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,530
He also said

364
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,830
that he always had

365
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,030
my attention when he was upset.

366
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,550
Meanwhile,

367
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,400
nobody cared for you

368
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,370
when you were unfairly treated.

369
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,830
You were demoted to be a commoner

370
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,830
for the theft in Jiangnan Province.

371
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,270
Today,

372
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,160
it is time I promoted you
to be the crown prince.

373
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,000
Your Majesty.

374
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,440
A criminal as I am doesn't deserve

375
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,400
this position.

376
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,750
Rui is

377
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,590
pure of heart.

378
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,660
He will make a benevolent ruler.

379
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,790
A benevolent ruler?

380
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,400
With that thick head of his,

381
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,800
can he shoulder a ruler's responsibility?

382
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,750
If you are to compensate
for the Gao family's doings,

383
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,750
you shouldn't give up your military power.

384
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,590
I'm not the one

385
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,880
you should compensate.

386
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,480
Correct your wrongs

387
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,680
for Great Jing and the people instead.

388
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,200
Get up.

389
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,610
Take these things,

390
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,880
and leave.

391
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,200
Goodbye, then.

392
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,110
You like Song Yimeng, don't you?

393
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,440
Your Majesty,

394
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,200
I do like Song Yimeng.

395
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,200
I see.

396
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,040
You may go now.

397
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:46,630
Yes.

398
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,210
[Quietly Observe]

399
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,460
Are you waiting for me?

400
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,720
Not really...

401
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,900
Since you've said it out loud,

402
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,610
I might as well

403
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,070
a-a-admit

404
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,200
I'm waiting for you.

405
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,330
What's the matter?

406
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,640
I...

407
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,880
I...

408
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,270
Heng,

409
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,010
I owe you an apology.

410
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,770
I was wrong about you

411
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,310
in all these years.

412
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,750
I shouldn't have mistaken you
for the killer of my mother,

413
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,590
or treated you

414
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,830
with hostility.

415
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,940
If you're still mad at me,

416
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,440
I can let you have

417
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,570
my mansion,

418
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,240
the jade kylin and the luminous pearl

419
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,240
Father gave me.

420
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,300
I don't need those.

421
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,440
Are...

422
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,630
Are they not enough?

423
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,350
Or is it Jixiang what you want?

424
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,270
Don't take him away.

425
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:45,510
Look,

426
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,440
I can give you anything,

427
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,720
except for Jixiang.

428
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,400
I mean,

429
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,330
you don't need to give me anything.

430
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,880
Your mother

431
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,540
did die because of the Gao family.

432
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,850
You had every reason

433
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,270
to be mad at me.

434
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,120
I knew I was right.

435
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,620
You're most suited to be

436
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,440
the crown prince.

437
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,280
Come here.

438
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,440
I have a question.

439
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,270
Why did you generously
let me me have that position?

440
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,400
You see,

441
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,000
you are pure of heart.

442
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,700
I believe you'll treat the people right.

443
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,110
Pure of heart?

444
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,130
Doesn't it take more to make

445
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,170
a good emperor?

446
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,030
Do you think

447
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
I'm smart enough?

448
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,550
Heng,

449
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,010
to be honest,

450
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,000
although I'm the chosen one

451
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,310
and an amazing person,

452
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,400
I'm really not

453
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,720
cut out to be the crown prince.

454
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,530
The crown prince

455
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,610
should not only be compassionate,

456
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,880
but also be intelligent enough
to fight the evil

457
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,350
and to protect the people of Great Jing.

458
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,610
Am I qualified in that respect?

459
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,920
Apparently not.

460
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,410
Right?

461
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,410
But you're different.

462
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,750
In these years,

463
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:11,740
Father,

464
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,720
Guihong

465
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,680
and I

466
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,040
all needed an outlet to vent

467
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,870
our anger at Mother's death.

468
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,070
You

469
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,680
were the only outlet.

470
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,580
We hated you

471
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,610
and picked on you.

472
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,130
But you still managed to
eliminate the evil chancellor

473
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,060
and restore justice to the people.

474
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,580
A man like you

475
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,260
is truly the best candidate

476
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,460
for the throne.

477
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,440
Alright.

478
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,220
Sometimes, I really don't know

479
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,110
what smart guys

480
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,230
like you are thinking.

481
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,510
You keep mulling

482
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,830
and mulling over a tiny issue

483
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,590
like this.

484
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,200
In the end, it is we little fools

485
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,060
who sort it out.

486
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,550
You're no fool.

487
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,880
You're a prince of Great Jing.

488
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,380
If anyone

489
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,050
dares to call you a fool,

490
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,690
I'll make him regret it.

491
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,590
H...

492
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,720
Heng,

493
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,510
well,

494
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,920
can I ask you something?

495
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,630
Ask away.

496
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,830
I was deeply moved just now.

497
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,480
But...

498
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,540
Can I address you

499
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,440
in a more respectful way after some time?

500
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,400
Doing it now will make me feel guilty

501
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,440
about Guihong.

502
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
Of course you can.

503
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,270
Really?

504
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,920
You've agreed to it?

505
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,030
That's great!

506
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,300
Alright.

507
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,810
Here, Heng.

508
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,880
Come on.

509
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,440
Drink up!

510
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,510
Guihong, what you said

511
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,610
has reassured me.

512
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,680
The two of us will

513
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,920
stand in unity to achieve our goals.

514
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,200
Even if there were 10 or 100

515
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,070
more Nan Hengs,

516
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,920
they wouldn't be our match.

517
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:22,920
Right?

518
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,070
Stand in unity...

519
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,220

It means to be the second
most esteemed person in the country.

00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,280
thanks to you,

693
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,030
they didn't find out my secret.

694
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,030
You did a great job.

695
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,250
After working for me for so long,

696
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,440
you've really smartened up.

697
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,230
You'd hate to let out your secret.

698
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,070
Of course I would help you cover it up.

699
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:15,670
My Lady!

700
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,760
My Lady!

701
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,550
Bad news.

702
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,630
The Waning River Crescent...

703
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,430
There's shocking news about it.

704
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,070
Since the Seventh Prince
is the crown prince now,

705
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,400
he is determined to
disband the Nightwalkers

706
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,880
and sell the premises
of the Waning River Crescent.

707
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,400
My Lady,

708
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
please go and see what is happening.

709
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,960
I have to check it out.

710
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,150
Hold on, My Lady.

711
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,400
My Lady,

712
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,510
Mr. Shangguan tried to
persuade you not long ago.

713
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,670
Now, the Seventh Prince plans
to disband the Nightwalkers.

714
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,400
It all sounds fishy too me.

715
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,760
Could there be a trap?

716
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,080
Speak your mind.

717
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,530
What kind of trap?

718
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,210
Think about it, My Lady.

719
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,550
It's a typical plot in storybooks

720
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,050
that when the romance
between a woman and a man is challenged,

721
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,250
their loyal servants would offer help.

722
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,440
Given the way that the people

723
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,480
of the Seventh Prince work, could they be

724
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,740
luring you to the Waning River Crescent?

725
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,260
You have a point.

726
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,150
Well...

727
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,860
Since when have you become so clever?

728
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,670
My Lady,

729
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,650
you speak of the script all the time.

730
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,230
Even a knucklehead such as myself

731
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,670
has learned something.

732
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,480
Shall we go to
the Waning River Crescent or not?

733
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,760
I'm begging you.

734
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,630
If you lend me 800 taels,

735
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,290
I'll do anything you ask me to,

736
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,310
including marrying you.

737
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,800
You shun me

738
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,230
when you don't need favors.

739
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,480
But when you do,

740
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,760
you humbly beg me.

741
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:41,960
Why?

742
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,800
Do I look like a pushover to you?

743
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,810
I-I wouldn't think of you that way.

744
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,900
Then in your heart,

745
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,060
am I a girl you can't communicate with?

746
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,940
It seems like

747
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:59,010
the Waning River Crescent
really is in trouble.

748
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,440
Yiting,

749
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,560
during all this time,

750
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,140
I've never mentioned how much I love you,

751
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,720
but the unsaid words are deeply

752
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,030
buried in my heart.

753
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:13,950
If I am to marry you,

754
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,160
I'd better have a decent job first.

755
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,440
Otherwise, how can I face your parents?

756
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,010
If the Waning River Crescent is disbanded,

757
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,630
I will go on to be

758
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,360
a homeless nobody
from the martial arts world.

759
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,070
I'm fine with

760
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,240
such a hard life,

761
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,690
but I can't let you suffer with me.

762
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,100
Say your lines!

763
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,260
I know

764
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,330
I've always given you the cold shoulder.

765
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,480
But if I didn't love you,

766
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,840
why would I, a useless man,

767
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,780
have put up with such tedious practice

768
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,310
of the four arts for so long?

769
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,990
It is true that the Waning River Crescent
is in trouble.

770
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,470
It is also true that I want

771
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,290
to be with you.

772
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,280
Call we a coward or a wimp

773
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,050
as you please.

774
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,540
Now that I've poured my heart out...

775
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,350
Move.

776
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,550
Didn't you say it was just an act?

777
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,320
Why did you

778
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,510
add a kissing scene?

779
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,500
Anything wrong with it?

780
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,550
You don't get to

781
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,880
decide the entire act.

782
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,280
For plucking my heartstrings
with those words,

783
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,670
you had to pay a price.

784
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,890
I didn't play at full strength,

785
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,840
yet you were already overwhelmed.

786
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,000
Mr. Shangguan,

787
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,930
you're just a glorified hero.

788
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:01,520
Wait...

789
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,540
Hurry! She's here!

790
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,230
What can we do now?

791
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,400
Chief doesn't want us anymore.

792
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,630
Can somebody help us?

793
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,150
Chief is abandoning us.

794
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,760
Where can we go?

795
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,510
Can somebody help us?

796
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,130
We're left in the lurch!

797
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,230
Shanhu.

798
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,330
Mrs. Li!

799
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,070
Mrs. Li, you finally came.

800
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,880
Please help us!

801
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,320
Chief is chasing us away.

802
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,550
But where else

803
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,030
can we go?

804
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,280
Right, guys?

805
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,880
Yes!

806
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:49,880
Where is he?

807
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,760
Over there.

808
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,920
-Over there.
-Over there.
