Li Shiliu?

[Big Fortune]

173
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,590
Why are there two Chiefs?

174
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,190
Which one is real?

175
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,660
This one.

176
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,480
This one?

177
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,300
That one.

178
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,510
That one?

179
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,990
Which one? I can't tell them apart.

180
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,080
Shanhu!

181
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,800
W-Which one is the real Li Shiliu?

182
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,140
We can't tell either.

183
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,290
Good heavens!

184
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,730
H-How am I supposed to tell them apart?

185
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,510
W-Which one is the real...

186
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,670
Isn't it obvious?

187
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,360
The better fighter, of course.

188
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,370
Who's the better fighter?

189
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,020
[Clear Clouds & Autumn Moon]

190
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,210
This is bad. Really bad.

191
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,490
What if they realize
one of them is Guihong?

192
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,060
Junior General is
an extraordinary fighter.

193
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,320
Don't worry about him.

194
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,290
What a mess.

195
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,340
Chu Guihong?

196
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,920
"Extraordinary fighter"?

197
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,510
H-He's the general of Qianyu Army!

198
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,910
He came here in
the disguise of Chief Master.

199
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,170
I bet he is up to no good!

200
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,980
General Chu, catch the sword.

201
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,430
Stop!

202
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,790
Yimeng,

203
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,860
are you okay?

204
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,780
I'm perfectly fine.

205
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,390
No matter how this happened,

206
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,650
I can't let them turn against each other.

207
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,360
May I have your attention?

208
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,150
I think

209
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,600
this is just a misunderstanding.

210
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,030
General Chu Guihong

211
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,910
might have been tricked by rumors

212
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,630
and mistaken the Nightwalkers

213
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,120
for a group of

214
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,460
mobsters hiding in the capital.

215
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,900
That's why he disguised
as Mr. Li and came here

216
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,630
What are "mobsters"?

217
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,890
for an investigation.

218
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,030
"Mop holders" for short, I suppose.

219
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,130
This is where we stand now.

220
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,540
M-Miss Song,

221
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,480
this rude guy accused our chief

222
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,840
of stealing Qianyu Army's weapons.

223
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,150
Who are you talking about?

224
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,360
Despicable schemer.

225
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,790
Indeed!

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,440
Watch your tongue!

227
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,600
How come I don't know about the theft

228
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,750
of weapons?

229
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,630
I completely understand.

230
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,590
I've got the gist.

231
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,150
Just now, General Chu told me

232
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,030
the whole story.

233
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,680
The theft of weapons is

234
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,510
also a misunderstanding.

235
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,030
Miss Song,

236
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,840
I saw everything.

237

He didn't utter a word at all.

238
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,790
Shut up!

239
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,630
We're ventriloquists.

What do you know?

241
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,360
Alright.

242
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,590
We've made things clear.

243
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,540
Why not turn hostility into hospitality?

244
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,480
Shake hands and

245
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,930
make friends, will you?

and make friends!

Why are you still standing
here like a cutout?

Make a friendly gesture now

to end this mess

252
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
and defuse the tension.

253
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,750
Just get it over with.

Mr. Li,

00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,600
how about

257
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,150
you take the initiative?

258
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,910
Okay?

259
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,080
Please make nice

260
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,330
so I can wrap this up.

261
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,240
Look, everyone is staring at me.

262
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,550
I'm so embarrassed.

263
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,720
What a day.

264
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,490
I'm mortally embarrassed.

265
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,750
Please.

266
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,680
Make a friendly gesture, will you?

267
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,400
This is infuriating.

00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,440
How annoying!

272
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,080
The three of us are about to team up

273
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,510
against Nan Heng.

274
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,550
Why are you so hostile to each other?

275
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,480
I didn't agree to partner with him.

276
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,600
A vulgar ruffian.

277
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,850
How self-conceited.

278
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,270
You disturbed
the Nightwalkers without cause.

279
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,800
Don't you owe me an apology?

280
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,430
At least I should know who

281
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
I'll apologize to, don't you think?

282
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,270
Why should I tell you who I am?

283
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,320
Alright.

284
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,630
Mr. Li,

285
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,030
please take off your mask
and show him your face

286
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,430
as a gesture of good will.

287
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,440
I got a scar on the face in childhood.

288
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,970
I'd rather keep it covered.

289
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,720
Did you hear that?

290
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,250
He has a solid reason for...

291
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,260
Nan Heng is in the hall as well.

292
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,220
If you agree to go meet him with me...

293
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,550
Today you caused a scene here

294
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,960
just to prove that I have a
connection with Nan Heng?

295
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,600
Mr. Li can't be working for Nan Heng.

296
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,320
He just cursed him with me the other day.

297
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,390
Then, Mr. Li, I'm cordially

298
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,910
inviting you to meet Nan Heng with me,

299
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,120
so you can prove your innocence.

300
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,250
Why should I do that?

301
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,600
Plus,

302
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,390
Nan Heng is a prince.

303
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,450
Offending a prince can lead
to serious consequences.

304
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,840
That makes sense.

305
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,030
Wise civilians know not
to irritate the authorities.

306
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,260
Don't force him, alright?

307
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,720
You keep declining to
prove your innocence.

308
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,000
How about I take you

309
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,240
back to the capital prefecture's office

310
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,080
for an interrogation?

311
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,840
This is enough.

312
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,770
Stop it, you two.

313
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,240
No more bickering, okay?

314
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,710
Let me reiterate this again.

315
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,240
We're gathered here today

316
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,480
to fight against Nan Heng,

317
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,320
not to argue, gentlemen.

318
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,380
You see,

319
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,000
Mr. Li chose not to hold you accountable

320
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,670
for messing up this place.

321
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,840
Why are you still scowling?

322
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,390
I...

323
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,320
So what if you command Qianyu Army?

324
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,050
And you, Mr. Li,

325
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,870
do you think the world
of yourself just because

326
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,960
you rule the Waning River Crescent

327
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,220
and the Nightwalkers?

328
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,670
Fine.

329
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,240
Since you two consider
yourselves no ordinary men,

330
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,360
why not go mess with Nan Heng

331
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,030
who's also here today?

332
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,370
What's the point of fighting each other?

333
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,750
Answer me.

334
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,440
Can we

335
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,390
form an alliance today?

336
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:01,940
Fine.

337
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,860
You both refuse to join me, right?

338
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,840
I'll do it myself then.

339
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,550
Yimeng!

340
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,570
If you believe him,

341
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,290
then I'll believe him.

342
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,150
Among all the crap Mr. Li has said today,

343
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,550
one thing is correct.

344
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,810
I'm an incompetent man who doesn't

345
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,530
deserve Yimeng's trust and affection.

346
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,440
She has done so much for me.

347
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,460
I must repay her with all my heart.

348
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,790
Nan Heng will stay here till nighttime.

349
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,990
I'll go and stall him.

350
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,980
It means

351
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,130
we're allies now, right?

352
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,000
Chief Master!

353
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,880
Chief Master.

354
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,210
A guest is asking to meet you now.

355
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,540
Please go see him.

356
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,000
Miss Song,

357
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,030
I need to go now.

358
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,030
Make yourself at home.

359
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,960
You go ahead, Mr. Li.

360
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,119
See you later.

361
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,000
Terrific!

362
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,680
Hurry up. Chu Guihong has set off.

363
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,960
I'm working on it.

364
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,589
I...

365
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,960
Easy! Easy!

366
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,110
Why so grumpy?

367
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,750
You're not the only one with a temper.

368
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,550
Hurry.

369
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,850
When this is over,

370
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,960
you should take a break.

371
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,750
Not after

372
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,000
I pick a bone with you.

373
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,800
I'm showing care for you, but...

374
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,440
Please quickly remove me from the position

375
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,070
of Second Master.

376
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,480
I've been wanting to quit.

377
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,310
Stop nagging,

378
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,770
or I'll make you the chief.

379
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,250
Hurry. Go get me my clothes.

380
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,920
Guihong,

381
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,270
you'll partner with Li Shiliu?

382
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,070
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

383
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,160
I didn't.

384
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,680
I still think Li Shiliu is
colluding with Nan Heng.

385
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,820
Then why did you grant
Song Yimeng's request?

386
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,780
This is a setup.

387
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,830
It's like drawing a snake out of its hole.

388
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,560
Drawing a snake out of its hole?

389
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,960
Who's the snake?

390
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,030
Song Yimeng?

391
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,760
A beautiful snake?

392
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,030
Please stop asking, Your Highness.

393
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,830
Wait. Why can't I ask questions?

394
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,970
Given Your Highness's performance today...

395
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,320
The less Your Highness know,

396
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,690
the safer we will be.

397
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,240
Here come the guests.

398
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,900
General Chu, you've put yourself

399
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,300
through so much trouble.

400
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,780
Are you here to

401
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,860
show support for Rui?

402
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,030
The Eighteenth Prince has a gentle soul.

403
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,550
Blessings befall His Highness.

404
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,210
He needs no extra assistance.

405
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,150
How shameless of you
for making that silly remark.

406
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,880
You're pretty cheeky,

407
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,500
General Chu.

408
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,440
Nan Heng!

409
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,130
Gentlemen,

410
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,490
a feast is served. Please enjoy.

411
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,080
[Excellence and Distinction]

412
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,270
Have a seat.

413
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,240
Why not dine with me?

414
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,010
If you're scared of me,

415
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,480
then just leave.

416
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,720
Don't spoil my mood.

417
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,400
I...

418
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,960
What a surprise.

419
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,110
The food here actually tastes

420
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,480
better than that in the palace.

421
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,140
Gentlemen,

422
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,110
how did you like the meal?

423
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,160
There are desserts

424
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,310
and fruit prepared

425
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,510
for you.

426
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,300
They're being presented now.

427
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,910
General Chu,

428
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,270
you're already seated.

429
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,660
Why don't you eat anything?

430
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,130
With a vile person around,

431
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,780
my appetite has been

432
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,050
completely ruined.

433
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,310
I feel the same,

434
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,050
when dining with a vile person.

435
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,450
General Chu, you cleverly

436
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,120
impersonated Li Shiliu

437
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,970
only to find out if I have

438
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,480
any connection with him, right?

439
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,000
So what if I say yes?

440
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,640
I am a royal prince.

441
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,310
How could I possibly be in collusion

442
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,710
with that lowly ruffian?

443
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,470
Don't push me too far.

444
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:04,960
Sorry. I'm sorry.

445
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,720
You klutz, what's wrong with you?

446
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,590
Get out of here!

447
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,350
Yes.

448
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,310
Gentlemen,

449
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,110
please don't be mad.

450
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,590
I'll bring you a new plate.

451
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,400
No need.

452
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,100
It's a waste of time talking to

453
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,390
those I don't see eye to eye with.

454
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,680
Goodbye.

455
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,300
Did you make it?

456
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,480
Yes. I replaced

457
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,280
that fake knife with a real one.

458
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,320
Hold on.

459
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,070
Don't forget

460
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,960
that someone is waiting for you.

461
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,680
Hurry up! Run!

462
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,200
The whole place was in chaos today.

463
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,260
Whose fault was it?

464
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,280
Mine, I suppose.

465
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,310
It's stuck again.

466
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,110
Let me do it.

467
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,070
I can do it.

468
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,590
Dinner?

469
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,240
I happen to be hungry now.

470
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,020
Oh, right, Mr. Shangguan,

471
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,290
where is your chief?

472
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,640
Why isn't he here yet?

473
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,110
Chief Master,

474
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,320
Miss Song is eager to see you.

475
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,240
Playing the flute, aren't you?

476
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
It's just dinner.

477
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,350
Why a fuss?

478
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,200
It's for the best effect.

479
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,670
Alright. All of you, get out.

480
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,720
Mr. Li,

481
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,920
these friends of yours

482
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,200
are so much fun.

483
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,790
They just like

484
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,920
horsing around. I hope you don't mind.

485
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,090
Oh, right.

486
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,350
You haven't opened my gift yet.

487
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,200
Come on. Open it. Take a look.

488
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,200
What...

489
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,730
What bizarre thing is this?

490
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,590
What do you think?

491
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,200
It's cute, isn't it?

492
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,160
I made it myself.

493
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,120
Look,

494
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,900
whether you'll get
involved in politics or not,

495
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,400
I just want to thank you

496
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,270
for saving my life last time.

497
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,930
You're welcome.

498
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,000
Yimeng!

499
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,670
What are you doing here?

500
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,600
Shouldn't you be with Nan Heng now?

501
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,920
He left.

502
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,480
Yimeng,

503
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,400
it's getting late.

504
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,530
Let me take you home.

505
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,110
Dinner was just served.

506
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,110
I haven't eaten it yet.

507
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,510
Your father is waiting for you at home.

508
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,240
Let's go.

509
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,960
But...

510
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,640
Mr. Li,

511
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,720
talk to you later!

512
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,850
I have to go home now.

513
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,960
Wait!

514
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,380
Have you seen the Seventh Prince?

515
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,790
Fugui,

516
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,880
seriously,

517
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,740
aren't you embarrassed to
play with mud at this age?

518
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,720
I wasn't playing with mud.

519
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,240
Someone dropped

520
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,960
a flower pot on my head.

521
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,620
Did you see the prince or not?

522
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,210
I shouldn't have asked you.

523
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,130
Your Highness?

524
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,060
Your Highness!

525
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,660
[Seventh Prince's Mansion]

526
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,340
[Humbly requested by
Yao Qian, Zhang Han, et al]

527
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,520
[One hour ago]

528
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,570
What did you say?

529
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,960
The Lantern Festival.

530
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,210
Your Highness,

531
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,060
the Emperor, along with
the Eighteenth Prince,

532
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,170
has planned to appoint
Chu Guihong to manage

533
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,690
all affairs related to
the Lantern Festival

534
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,950
in tomorrow's morning meeting.

535
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,490
It means the Emperor
is intending to let Chu

536
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,820
shoulder the responsibility

537
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,020
of guarding the capital and the palace.

538
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,050
It's really the Lantern Festival.

539
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,860
I can't sleep at night.
I've been working around the clock.

540
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,560
After a thorough study,

541
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:40,800
I've come up with a plan.

542
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,070
Your Highness, please allow me

543
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,860
to appeal to all censors to file

544
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,910
a joint petition in
tomorrow's meeting to urge

545
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,960
the Emperor to withdraw
the intended appointment.

546
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,440
We will turn the tables

547
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,790
and attack Chu and his minions

548
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,790
till they're completely defeated.

549
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,370
Your Highness.

550
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,160
Your Highness!

551
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,880
If the Lantern Festival proceeds smoothly,

552
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,550
Chu Guihong will receive more

553
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,410
fame and support from the people.

554
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,160
The Emperor might promote him and give him

555
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,550
a chance to lead an army to fight battles

556
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,940
and achieve more.

557
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,400
Then he'll be a strong aide

558
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,720
to the Eighteenth Prince.

559
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,160
They'll probably rise to the top.

560
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,480
If that happens,

561
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,750
it'll be nearly impossible

562
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,350
for Your Highness to achieve

563
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,720
your ambitions...

564
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,830
Enough. I get it.

565
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,400
I...

566
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,730
Without my permission,

567
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,780
no one

568
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,380
can take action.

569
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,000
Yes.

570
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,350
Look,

571
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,270
whether you'll get
involved in politics or not,

572
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,270
I just want to thank you

573
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,800
for saving my life last time.

574
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,350
Officers, if there is no objection,

575
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,830
I hereby affirm that the capital
prefect will be responsible

576
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,830
for managing the Lantern Festival.

577
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,350
Your Majesty, I object to it!

578
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,180
Uncle, why didn't you tell me about this?

579
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,250
Alas!

580
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,950
The Lantern Festival is about

581
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,590
celebration and praying
for the nation's wellbeing.

582
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,260
However, the new
capital prefect, Chu Guihong,

583
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,750
though exonerated, is by no means

584
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,270
a proper candidate for the job.

585
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,810
Now,

586
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,230
the dead warriors haven't rested in peace,

587
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,400
and the borders are still
troubled by refugees.

588
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,830
If such an important job is given to Chu,

589
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,770
there will be serious consequences!

590
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,260
I implore Your Majesty
to withdraw the edict.

591
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,430
We implore Your Majesty
to withdraw the edict!

592
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,030
We implore Your Majesty
to withdraw the edict!

593
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,530
Silence, all of you!

594
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,870
[Calm, Respectful, and Sincere]

595
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,640
Calm, Your Majesty!

596
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,640
The empire...

597
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,720
is not solely owned by me.

598
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,620
But as long as I still hold the throne,

599
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:09,150
I will not tolerate nonsense in the court!

600
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,680
This is my decision.

601
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,400
The capital prefect,
Chu Guihong, will oversee

602
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,930
all affairs related to
the Lantern Festival.

603
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,310
Censor Yao Qian

604
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,480
distorted the truth with malicious intent.

605
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,240
He will be

606
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,100
caned 20 times and demoted

607
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,430
to be an invocator of
the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.

608
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,270
A demotion?

609
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,860
Doesn't Yao Qian

610
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,350
work for Nan Heng?

611
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,290
This is not part of the script, is it?

612
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,790
Is the male lead's power
really being weakened?

613
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,240
Has the story started to change?

614
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,790
Will the ending be different?

615
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:56,900
The Emperor

616
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,020
is determined to weaken
Nan Heng's power in the capital.

617
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,880
Nan Heng has had enough good days.

618
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,460
It's time for his collapse.

619
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,910
Before long,

620
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,680
the Eighteenth Prince will rightfully

621
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,190
become the crown prince.

622
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,030
Yimeng,

623
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,120
I've been busy with
military affairs these years,

624
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,380
so I've neglected you.

625
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,930
I didn't realize until yesterday

626
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,230
that you care so much about me.

627
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,120
You like the south, don't you?

628
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,680
When the whole thing is over,

629
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,100
shall we move there?

630
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,100
If...

631
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,020
If you are

632
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,760
given a chance to extricate
yourself from politics,

633
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,830
will you drop everything and leave?

634
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,310
Yimeng,

635
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,280
you know me well.

636
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,550
Qianyu Army...

637
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,640
You told me

638
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,810
you'd hate to see anyone
around you get hurt.

639
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,340
But that's bound to happen

640
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,600
unless you're relieved from your post.

641
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,440
Why are you bringing this up?

642
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,750
Yesterday, Mr. Li asked me

643
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,250
about my view of Nan Heng.

644
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,320
This is what I've been thinking.

645
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,740
It's true that Nan Heng

646
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,480
is a ruthless man

647
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,360
with a mind full of conspiracies.

648
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,920
But maybe...

649
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,550
There's a chance to turn things around.

650
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,070
My Lady! My Lady!

651
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,880
Mr. Chu.

652
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,510
Bad news!

653
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,240
Bear with it.

654
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,270
Alright, it's done.

655
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,210
Rong Hua.

656
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,400
You...

657
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,510
Shouldn't you be catching bandits?

658
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,570
Who did this to you?

659
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,670
General Chu,

660
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,300
the bandits

661
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,190
lured us to an abandoned mine

662
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,880
situated ten miles outside the city.

663
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,280
Before we could see them,

664
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,110
they detonated explosives,

665
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,560
which injured our people.

666
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:23,960
Which mine?

667
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,980
The one in the western suburbs.

668
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,750
Where Yao Qian was ditched?

669
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,030
Yes.

670
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,920
Nan Heng is trying to intimidate me.

671
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,290
Easy, easy.

672
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,440
Yimeng,

673
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,520
do you still think there is

674
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:40,620
a chance to turn things around?

675
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,120
This time,

676
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:43,880
we must think of a new way

677
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:44,830
to stop him.

678
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,480
Please don't hurt me, sir!

679
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,320
I'm just a lowly eunuch.

680
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,920
I really don't know anything!

681
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,380
An officer of the Censorate
was caned today.

682
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,520
You executed the punishment, right?

683
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,250
Someone instructed you to aim for

684
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,960
the most fragile body parts.

685
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,230
You would receive

686
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,070
handsome rewards if you could maim him

687
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,550
with those 20 times of caning.

688
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,360
Is it correct?

689
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,110
I...

690
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,110
I...

691
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:13,960
Confess!

692
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,150
Who instructed you?

693
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,410
What proof do you have?

694
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,030
Bad news.

695
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,140
Miss Song is here.

696
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,710
Is your chief around?

697
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,440
This way, Miss Song.

698
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,150
Yunlong, clean up this place.

699
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,880
Shanhu, destroy the evidence.

700
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,740
The rest of you,

701
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,920
stall the enemy.

702
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,800
-Yes!
-Yes!

703
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,070
This way.

704
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,410
Are you alright?

705
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,670
Miss Song,

706
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,360
take that path.

707
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,510
Okay. Let's go.

708
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,800
"I see a well by the river."

709
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,150
"A dark mouth I discover."

710
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,880
-Brilliant!
-Nice verses!

711
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,790
I'm so flattered.

712
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,800
Mr. Li.

713
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,880
Miss Song,

714
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,160
you came just in time.

715
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,880
Chief is composing poems
and playing chess with us

716
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,190
to nurture our minds.

717
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,550
Mr. Shangguan,

718
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,670
pardon me for the intrusion.

719
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,470
I need a word with your chief now.

720
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,850
What's so serious

721
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,020
that you have to talk to me in private?

722
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,110
It's a matter of life or death.

723
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,190
If anything slips,

724
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,960
best case—we lose some blood;

725
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,310
worst case—
our families get executed.

726
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,020
That serious?

727
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,160
Spill it then.

728
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,710
Mr. Li,

729
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,150
do you dare to…

730
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,100
C-Could you bend over?

731
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,920
Second Master,

732
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,320
are they kissing?

733
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,480
What are they talking about?

734
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,630
What can a man and a woman talk about?

735
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,230
They must be flirting

736
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,440
and giggling.

737
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,730
You think they're planning a murder?

738
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,130
Killing Nan Heng?

739
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,390
Me?

740
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,230
No way!

741
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,660
I haven't agreed to fight him yet,

742
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,070
let alone kill him.

743
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,070
That's why I'm asking you

744
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,710
what I can do to have your consent.

745
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,170
I will never consent to it!

746
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,230
If you have a death wish,

747
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:44,920
go and indulge yourself.

748
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,980
Don't drag me down.

749
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,280
Mr. Li, wait!

750
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,710
Though he denies he likes Miss Song,

751
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,280
he did stop when she told him to.

752
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,070
Mr. Li,

753
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,120
didn't you ask me why I chose

754
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,670
to believe Chu Guihong

755
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,840
and not Nan Heng?

756
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,400
Mr. Li, you know what?

757
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,920
Nan Heng had his people blow up a mine

758
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,190
and ambush Qianyu Army.

759
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,360
Any misstep in the process

760
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,600
could kill or injure
many innocent civilians.

761
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,890
We have to stop him now,

762
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,760
or there will be more disasters.

763
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,000
Blowing up a mine?

764
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,960
Rong Hua saw it himself.

765
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,150
Many Qianyu soldiers were injured.

766
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,440
Have you done a fact check?

767
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,190
Motive.

768
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,190
Method.

769
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,150
Eyewitnesses...

770
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,150
It all checks out.

771
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,760
What else do I need?

772
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,480
I see.

773
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,750
I understand now.

774
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Every

775
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,000
bad deed

776
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,510
must be done by Nan Heng.

777
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,360
If a wench

778
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,130
in the east loses an egg,

779
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,830
it must be stolen by Nan Heng.

780
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,840
If a widower

781
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,930
in the west gets drunk and fights,

782
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,230
it must be related to Nan Heng.

783
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,030
Is that right?

784
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,450
Who knows if he's innocent or not?

785
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,760
His house is not far from

786
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,210
the west of the city.

787
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,760
As for the east...

788
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,510
Maybe he takes a stroll there

789
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,960
every now and then.

790
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,880
Who knows what

791
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,340
sneaky stuff or severe crimes

792
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,840
he does every day?

793
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,070
Mr. Li,

794
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,660
actually...

795
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,840
Just like you, I used

796
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,360
to think none of

797
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,190
these things

798
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,030
could be true,

799
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,800
and that all I had to do was stop Nan Heng

800
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,480
and protect myself.

801
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,690
But my mind changed on the night

802
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,190
when that dancer

803
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,120
nearly lost her life because of me.

804
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,000
That wasn't your fault.

805
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,710
But her life was

806
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,520
endangered because of me.

807
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,590
I ignorantly thought

808
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,920
I could change the story

809
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,480
and the world.

810
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,800
That dancer, Rong Hua and some others

811
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,400
got hurt for the same reason.

812
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,350
If I hadn't

813
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,880
interfered with the storyline,

814
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,800
maybe none of those

815
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,170
could have happened, right?

816
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,840
That said,

817
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,590
I've set off on this path already.

818
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,150
I can't give up halfway.

819
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,280
Mr. Li,

820
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,230
maybe some of my words

821
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,070
have bewildered you,

822
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,000
but I'm just trying to get

823
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,110
my meaning across.

824
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,480
I understand all your concerns.

825
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,480
Indeed,

826
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,960
I'm selfishly attempting

827
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,000
to use you

828
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,920
to eliminate Nan Heng.

829
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,570
If...

830
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,580
If

831
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,990
you really hate to do that...

832
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:43,960
I'm not entirely...

833
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,960
I'll report you to the authorities.

834
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,590
I'll hand over the evidence

835
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,880
of you committing human trafficking

836
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,280
to my father and Chu Guihong.

837
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,920
Then all your hard work in these years

838
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,400
will go down the drain.

839
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,670
But that was an accident!

840
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,670
I don't care.

841
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,760
It happened in

842
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,400
the Waning River Crescent's Hall.

843
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,860
You'll all be held liable.

844
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,720
Oh, you...

845
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,920
You're such a fickle woman.
