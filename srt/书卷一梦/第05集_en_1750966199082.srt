00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:16,660
已溫topic

00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,660
The fire of Yang Xi

4
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,660
A heart that never burns

5
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,660
The four seas are always close

6
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,660
No need to wait, no need to hate

7
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,660
Write a script

8
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,660
For all the broken

9
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,660
Heart and soul forever, I will write a poem

10
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,660
The fire of Yang Xi

11
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,660
I am not afraid of the force

12
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,660
I don't regret my youth

13
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,660
The people are like a big star

14
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,660
For this life, and for all life

15
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,660
Forever and ever

16
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,660
The fire of Yang Xi

17
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,660
I am not afraid of the force

18
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,660
I don't regret my youth

19
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,660
The fire of Yang Xi

20
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,660
I am not afraid of the force

21
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,660
I don't regret my youth

22
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,660
Your Highness, you have been sitting here

23
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,660
That person has left

24
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,660
We are following him secretly, nothing will happen

25
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,660
Your Highness, do you want to change clothes in the house?

26
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,660
Today's matter

27
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,660
Do not reveal to the outside

28
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,660
Yes

29
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,660
But this kid doesn't understand

30
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,660
What the Highness did today, why is that?

31
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,660
I also want to clear up the original

32
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,660
I want to see this Song Yi Meng

33
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,660
What does it have to do with the ancient

34
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,660
Then the Highness wants to kill or not today

35
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,660
Always at the last minute

36
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,660
Saving that Song Yi Meng is not out of his own will

37
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,660
He has countless

38
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,660
Then I just treated him

39
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,660
No, no, I have to go to Longhu Mountain

40
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,660
Find a few angels

41
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,660
Enough, I'm like this, don't piss me off

42
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,660
Okay, okay, okay

43
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,660
That day in the imperial garden

44
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,660
I feel a little strange

45
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,660
Recently in the forest

46
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,660
I wanted to kill him

47
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,660
Then give the fire to the turtle

48
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,660
Who knows the dog is like this

49
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,660
But now it seems

50
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,660
This Song Yi Meng

51
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,660
No matter where you are in any danger

52
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,660
Alone in the river

53
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,660
The body will not be controlled to save him

54
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,660
According to what the Highness said

55
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,660
We can't deal with him

56
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,660
And also beware of others using him to deal with us

57
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,660
If this is to let the Eighteen Highness and Chu Guihong know

58
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,660
Then we

59
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,660
So this matter must be kept secret

60
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,660
Yes

61
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,660
And I have to catch him quickly to break the law

62
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,660
But Song Yi Meng is Chu Guihong's fiancée after all

63
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,660
In case they have no mutual understanding, then we

64
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,660
We

65
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,660
That's right

66
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,660
This Chu Guihong stays in the capital

67
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,660
It's a threat in the end

68
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,660
So you go to the supervisor to ask for money

69
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,660
Call me

70
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,660
Yes

71
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,660
Stop

72
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,660
Go in

73
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,660
People wear books

74
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,660
Flower market is a good place

75
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,660
I wear books

76
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,660
Flower market is bitter

77
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,660
Why am i so miserable

78
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,660
Manager Yancha Chu Ruo

79
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,660
What did you pull me just now

80
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,660
How many times have I told you

81
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,660
The one who guards the gate

82
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,660
The one with bright eyes

83
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,660
The one behind that woman just now

84
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,660
Don't you know

85
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,660
That's the school guard of the Black Armor Army

86
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,660
The one of the West Prince

87
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,660
You mean the one who just passed

88
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,660
Is Song Yi Meng

89
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,660
This seems to be from the prince's mansion

90
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,660
It's so late

91
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,660
They are together

92
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,660
This relationship is not simple

93
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,660
I don't know

94
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,660
I don't know

95
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,660
This relationship is not simple

96
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,660
Brother Yan, go back tonight

97
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,660
You soak a hot bath

98
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,660
Solve the punishment

99
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,660
If you have any discomfort

100
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,660
You tell me

101
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,660
Okay

102
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,660
So i'll go back to you

103
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,660
Moer

104
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,660
Chu Guihong

105
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,660
Moer

106
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,660
You are

107
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,660
I'm fine

108
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,660
Nothing

109
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,660
You

110
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,660
You went out

111
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,660
This time it's really the right way

112
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,660
Right and right

113
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,660
That's fine

114
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,660
Nan Hong, that big devil

115
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,660
I didn't make it difficult for you

116
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,660
rest assured

117
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,660
But you

118
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,660
I just met you in the daytime

119
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,660
He took you away

120
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,660
I'm worried

121
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,660
Let me tell you

122
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,660
He didn't bully you

123
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,660
I'm fine

124
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,660
Nothing

125
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,660
General, you must

126
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,660
Moer

127
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,660
Moer

128
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,660
When did you and I become so close?

129
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,660
Then

130
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,660
Then

131
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,660
Ah Hong

132
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,660
Ah Hong

133
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,660
Nan Hong is cruel

134
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,660
Not so easy to deal with

135
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,660
You finally got released today

136
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,660
In the future in court

137
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,660
Don't fight him, okay?

138
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,660
Moer

139
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,660
Tell me the truth

140
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,660
He bullied you today, right?

141
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,660
Sure enough

142
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,660
Men are all left to the audience

143
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,660
Like

144
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,660
Still good for men

145
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,660
Isn't this the one?

146
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,660
This jixiang jade

147
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,660
When I was born

148
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,660
My aunt was bestowed by the late queen

149
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,660
From the battle station to the sand

150
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,660
He has blessed me many times

151
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,660
Now we are going to get married

152
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,660
I give it to you

153
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,660
I hope he will be able to protect my beloved

154
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,660
Even Nan Hong

155
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,660
See what my aunt is

156
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,660
I dare not act rashly

157
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,660
But you gave it to me

158
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,660
What about you?

159
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,660
I have the sachet you gave me

160
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
Those dark days in the rain

161
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,660
I made it by him

162
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,660
But yours is so expensive

163
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,660
My sachet

164
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,660
He doesn't know what to do

165
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,660
Then you can embroider one more

166
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,660
Let me put this and this

167
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,660
All off

168
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,660
Where will I go in the future?

169
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,660
Where is the place of the secret?

170
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,660
So that everyone knows

171
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,660
It's your person coming

172
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,660
Okay

173
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,660
You finally thought it over

174
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,660
I'm sorry

175
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,660
You finally thought it over

176
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,660
Really beautiful

177
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,660
Our general has met Miss Song

178
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,660
That person

179
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,660
Like a peacemaker

180
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,660
Miss Song

181
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,660
Greetings, Your Highness

182
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,660
You and my cousin have been in love since childhood

183
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,660
It is said that marriage is a good thing

184
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,660
It's not life and death

185
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,660
But now my cousin is trying to be a member

186
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,660
You and Lao Qi's matter

187
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,660
And make a lot of trouble

188
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,660
Then this marriage

189
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,660
Is it still a deal?

190
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,660
Your Highness

191
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,660
That's between me and Mo'er

192
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,660
I'm your cousin

193
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,660
That's also an outsider

194
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,660
Cousin

195
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,660
Your Highness

196
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,660
In this world

197
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,660
The person I can't have a relationship with

198
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,660
Is Nan Hong

199
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,660
Don't say it's a relationship between men and women

200
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,660
Ordinary friends can't

201
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,660
Because no one is clearer than me

202
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,660
What kind of a person is he

203
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,660
A coward with a human face

204
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,660
So don't worry, Your Highness

205
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,660
As long as it's Ah Hong

206
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,660
He doesn't abandon me

207
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,660
I can't let him down

208
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,660
I didn't expect Miss Song to be so stupid

209
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,660
Good

210
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,660
It's hard

211
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,660
It's all nonsense

212
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,660
If you like it

213
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,660
I can say more

214
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,660
Good

215
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,660
You don't have to touch

216
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,660
I'll tell you

217
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,660
Tian San, Yifan

218
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,660
Let's go

219
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,660
See you next time, Your Highness

220
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,660
I'm leaving

221
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,660
Wolf才女猫

222
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,660
Good

223
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,660
Be careful

224
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,660
Be careful

225
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,660
It hurts

226
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,660
Girl, you said you were so angry

227
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,660
Run out

228
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,660
Come back and make yourself like this

229
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,660
From childhood to old age

230
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,660
I'm not wronged like this

231
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,660
Good days

232
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,660
I had to be with that Sand God

233
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,660
I tell you

234
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,660
My life

235
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,660
It won't take long

236
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,660
I'm going to die

237
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,660
Don't talk

238
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,660
It hurts

239
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,660
It hurts

240
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,660
It hurts

241
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,660
It's me who's hurt

242
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,660
What are you yelling for

243
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,660
It hurts you

244
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,660
But it hurts my heart

245
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,660
From childhood to old age

246
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,660
How did you suffer like this

247
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,660
Almost done

248
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,660
It hurts

249
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,660
It hurts

250
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,660
According to the plot

251
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,660
The plot of the plan of Nan Heng's head

252
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,660
It's all for the position of Chu Jun

253
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,660
In the dream, Lin Xiaoshan Chu Huihong

254
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,660
It's for the place of Duan Shiba

255
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,660
It's for the mouth of the wind

256
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,660
I know all of these

257
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,660
What does this mean today?

258
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,660
It hurts

259
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,660
Is it the plot again?

260
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,660
So even in the script

261
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,660
Under the circumstances not written

262
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,660
The heroine is in danger

263
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,660
The heroine must save the girl

264
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,660
Can also be established

265
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,660
So

266
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,660
Let's go

267
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,660
If you say so

268
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,660
Nan Heng will not be able to kill me

269
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,660
You're wearing it

270
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,660
You are so generous

271
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,660
I thank you

272
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,660
You finally did one thing

273
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,660
Thank you thank you thank you

274
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,660
Who are you?

275
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,320
In the script,

276
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,860
Chu Guihong was targeted by Nan Heng everywhere.

277
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,120
He was hurt,

278
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,160
defeated,

279
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
and framed.

280
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,660
Eventually, after Nan Heng ascended the throne,

281
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,160
he led Qian Yujuan's remains to rush into the palace.

282
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
But he was ambushed by Nan Heng.

283
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,660
piles up

284
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,780
Chu Guihong,

285
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,920
Your men have been killed by us.

286
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,660
Only few soldiers are left.

287
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,660
Why are you fighting against the Black armour gladiator?

288
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,740
can only be found in One Amendment.

289
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,940
Mulan Nan Heng,

290
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:17,600
you betrayed our

291
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,000
land and there was not a fair duel hormones,

292
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,140
I will punish your for circus

293
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,260
Now,

294
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,260
Hahaha

295
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,260
You lead the army to attack

296
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,260
In the eyes of the world

297
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,260
This is a rebellion, a joke

298
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,260
I kill you

299
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,260
Rightly and smoothly

300
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,260
Chu Guihong

301
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,260
Your woman entered my harem

302
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,260
Your brother was killed by me

303
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,260
Now your secret

304
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,260
I have to keep it

305
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,140
The

306
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,140
Now blame

307
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,140
Blame you

308
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,140
At the beginning

309
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,140
I chose the wrong side

310
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,140
Girl, according to your instructions

311
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,140
It's time to recuperate

312
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,140
You scared me to death

313
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,140
Smile

314
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,140
You are really good to me

315
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,140
But

316
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,140
Such a supplement

317
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,020
No, it will be the Spring Festival in a few days

318
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,020
Old people often say

319
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,020
Eat ginseng in the Spring Festival

320
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,020
I promise you will be in good shape

321
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,020
What did you say just now?

322
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,020
Spring Festival

323
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,140
Sleep

324
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,140
The evening wind blows

325
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,140
The master's shadow is deep

326
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,140
Your Highness is not suitable for the case

327
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,140
At night

328
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,140
The chicken does not come, the dog does not fly

329
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,140
I do not know why you suddenly called me

330
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,140
What's the matter

331
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,140
Get in

332
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,140
I arranged you at the imperial examination station

333
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,140
Just let you watch the palace

334
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,140
You should know

335
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,140
I do not like useless people

336
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,140
I deserve to die

337
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,140
I deserve to die

338
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,140
Please give me another chance

339
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,140
I will be worried

340
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,140
Like you, I will not be distracted by the night

341
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,140
I will collect the crimes of the bandits

342
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,140
Full of it, okay?

343
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,140
Okay

344
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,140
Give you a chance

345
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,140
Then you should know tomorrow morning

346
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,140
What to do

347
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,140
I know

348
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,140
I'll do it

349
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,140
The emperor is here

350
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,140
Long live the emperor

351
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,140
Long live

352
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,140
Get up

353
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,140
Thank you, your Majesty

354
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,140
emperor

355
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,540
Rui, do you have something to report?

356
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:56,740
Father, I think that although the Qianyu Army has a good chance,

357
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,940
Chu Guihong has been a great military man for many years,

358
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,940
he is a great general. How can he be so idle?

359
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,540
Therefore, I beg you, Father,

360
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,740
to be ordered by Chu Guihong

361
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,740
to re-establish the Qianyu Army and make more mistakes.

362
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,740
Re-establish the Qianyu Army?

363
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,540
Other than General Chu, who else can be the governor?

364
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,940
Isn't that the new governor?

365
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,740
Yes, that's right.

366
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,340
How can he be so idle?

367
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,140
Miss.

368
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,140
How is it?

369
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,340
I handed the pouch I gave you to

370
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,740
the man next to General Chu, Ronghua.

371
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,740
The tall and strong man with a strong face.

372
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,740
But from the front, he looks a bit like...

373
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,140
Who asked you about Ronghua? He's not important.

374
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,140
I asked you if Chu Guihong saw it.

375
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,740
He saw it. It's a coincidence.

376
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,140
General Chu just finished looking at the pouch.

377
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,940
Someone came from the rear to summon him to the palace to meet the emperor.

378
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,540
Miss, what's written in the pouch?

379
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,140
General Chu looks strange after reading it.

380
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,140
It's good that you saw it.

381
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,940
I'm glad I remembered this story.

382
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,340
Otherwise...

383
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,340
Old Qi, what do you mean?

384
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,740
I'm a loser. You just find a reason to be a loser.

385
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,940
You didn't kill my cousin.

386
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,740
You can't even stop me?

387
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,940
Old Qi, since you think the official position of Rui'er is not good,

388
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:28,140
then what position should I give to Chu Guihong?

389
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,740
Your Majesty, I think the court's affairs

390
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,940
should be limited to the world.

391
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,940
If you're trying to get the position for Chu Guihong,

392
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,740
that's a waste of time.

393
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:48,940
If you're using your talent, that's a waste of time.

394
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,940
Is it because the court only has the high-ranking officials left?

395
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,540
Is that why the world is the first?

396
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,340
Your Majesty, you're joking.

397
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,740
The state has made a lot of efforts to make the world a better place.

398
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,940
To help you gain the world's wealth

399
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,340
is our life's wish.

400
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,940
Your Majesty, Chu Guihong was famous in the folk world.

401
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,340
But after the battle of Pingrong,

402
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,940
he destroyed thousands of soldiers in the whole of Jin.

403
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,340
He made 30% of the people in the border lose their lives.

404
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,740
Now, the popularity of the people is not good.

405
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,540
I'm afraid this will make the people sad.

406
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,140
Your Majesty!

407
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,540
Greetings, Your Majesty.

408
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,540
Get out.

409
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

410
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,540
I wonder if you're saying that my popularity is not good.

411
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,140
Of course, the censorate has found out.

412
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,540
Your Majesty, I beg you to summon the censorate

413
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,540
to impeach Chu Guihong and bring him to the court.

414
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,140
I want to know the details.

415
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,340
Why are you like this? Do you have a back?

416
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,740
Summon.

417
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,740
This...

418
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,340
This...

419
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,340
This...

420
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,340
This...

421
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,340
This...

422
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,340
This...

423
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,340
This...

424
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,940
Your Highness Qi,

425
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,940
How long will it take to deliver my memorial to Tanhe?

426
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,540
Yes, Old Qi.

427
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,340
It's almost noon.

428
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,740
You're not sending someone to write a memorial, are you?

429
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,140
Your Highness,

430
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,740
there's something strange today.

431
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,540
Master.

432
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,940
Wait a minute.

433
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,940
I...

434
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,340
It seems that I'm really hungry.

435
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,140
This is the medicine for the use of the country's food.

436
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,740
Father's body is more important.

437
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,140
If we wait any longer,

438
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,540
I'm afraid that this lunch will become dinner.

439
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,740
Okay.

440
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,740
Since we have summoned Chu Guihong,

441
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,940
we have no objection.

442
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,740
We also recognize Chu Guihong as the leader of the army of Jing Zhao Ying.

443
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,140
He will lead the army and guard the capital.

444
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,540
If he is in a hurry, he can handle it.

445
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,740
He can be equipped with a sword and enter the palace to face the emperor.

446
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,740
Congratulations, General Chu.

447
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,740
No,

448
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,740
now it should be changed to

449
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,140
General of the Army of Jing Zhao Ying.

450
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,340
I'm here to deliver my memorial.

451
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,940
I hope that everyone will be more careful in the future.

452
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,940
Just now, Lord Yao was beaten by someone.

453
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,140
He was thrown into a waste mine in the western suburb.

454
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,540
When we arrived, the scene was already cleaned up.

455
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,740
I'll see you lateriger.

456
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:29,540
system

457
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:38,020
You've always been welliesta

458
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,620
There is a reason to Rs.

459
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,540
I told you we were from the Lai family.

460
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,540
You'll pay for it announcily.

461
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,140
Yes.

462
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,180
Mr. Song.

463
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,740
Come on, have a seat.

464
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,860
I remember you came to the Song Mansion when you were a child.

465
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,100
Your favorite is this crystal cake.

466
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,020
Have a taste.

467
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,460
Yes.

468
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,340
Meng also likes crystal cakes.

469
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,900
When he was a child,

470
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,980
he liked to steal my food.

471
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,980
I'm sorry.

472
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,220
Please forgive me.

473
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,100
No need.

474
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,940
I've been friends with you for many years.

475
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,100
You and Meng have been engaged since childhood.

476
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,260
I think you should be more careful with your own children.

477
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,780
Don't be afraid.

478
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,780
I think your knife...

479
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,500
Sir.

480
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,060
It's not polished.

481
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:58,820
Yes.

482
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,980
I'll go back to find it today.

483
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:08,700
Your Highness.

484
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,420
Chu Guihong is coming.

485
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,140
Chu Guihong

486
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,820
Miss.

487
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,540
Aren't you afraid of the Seventh Prince the most?

488
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,780
He has killed him now.

489
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,300
Aren't you worried at all?

490
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,700
When I sent the message to Chu Guihong this morning,

491
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,460
I knew that Nan Heng would definitely come back.

492
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,780
Don't worry.

493
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,300
He can't kill me now.

494
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,620
I'm not afraid of him.

495
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,620
Seventh Prince.

496
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,700
How can I drink such a low-class tea

497
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,340
for the noble Seventh Prince?

498
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,340
Yingqiu.

499
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,300
Bring me the high-class ginseng tea.

500
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:03,820
Yes.

501
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,380
Zhixia.

502
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,460
High-class.

503
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,140
You can't miss it.

504
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:07,860
Go.

505
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,100
Bring it to Seventh Prince.

506
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,060
Go.

507
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,420
Seventh Prince.

508
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,020
Please wait a little longer.

509
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,540
The tea is coming.

510
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,700
Oh my god.

511
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,940
Your ears are red.

512
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,700
You're rich.

513
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,900
I'm not talking about you.

514
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,460
You have to practice the work of serving people.

515
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,380
It's cold.

516
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,180
You didn't even prepare a pendant for your master.

517
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,420
You're too sensitive.

518
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,900
Come on, Your Highness.

519
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,740
Let's talk.

520
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,260
It's hard.

521
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,740
Go.

522
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,660
Fugui.

523
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,700
Get out.

524
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:54,860
Get out.

525
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,700
Get out.

526
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,820
I'm asking you.

527
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,700
Did you meet Chu Guihong?

528
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,540
Yes.

529
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,500
I'm married to Chu Guihong.

530
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,700
I have to meet him in person.

531
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,580
What?

532
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,340
I can't even meet him in person

533
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,380
when I work for you?

534
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,060
You're talking to me like a ghost.

535
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,620
Aren't you afraid of being in pain?

536
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,820
No.

537
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,460
I'm so scared.

538
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,180
I'm so scared.

539
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,540
Your Highness.

540
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,220
The knife is right here.

541
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,540
Come and kill me.

542
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,220
Oh my god, I forgot.

543
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,220
Your Highness can't kill me.

544
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,140
No matter how hard you try,

545
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,860
the only one who will hurt him in the end

546
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,220
is you, Ji Zhiying.

547
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,820
By the way, Your Highness.

548
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:33,000
The three intensified Moi眾

549
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:33,340
is strong.

550
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,620
It sounds like a martial artist.

551
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,300
That's right.

552
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,580
I heard

553
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,580
He was a martial artist.

554
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,900
Three years ago, he was recruited by a mysterious man.

555
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,060
His armor was made.

556
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,420
He has become a fine man.

557
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,380
The hand of the God of Night is quite skilled.

558
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,260
He secretly formed the God of Night in the gang.

559
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,340
Outside the gang, he was assigned to the Cangjiang Yue Club.

560
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,380
He was in charge of the accommodation, gambling, the restaurant and other things.

561
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,540
He could do everything he couldn't do outside.

562
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,260
He could do everything in the Cangjiang Yue.

563
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:15,520
And his

564
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,300
contacts with the cumbersome authority and everyone.

565
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,300
They're like sets of t Cute jazz of H festive world.

566
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:33,600
If someone most го还是

567
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,300
such a supporter of his

568
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,720
Rites of the Sun God is

569
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:45,120
You have to learn to listen and serve in the court

570
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,160
Listening and serving is not serving

571
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Thank you for your advice

572
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,120
I didn't say anything

573
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,120
Yes, yes, yes

574
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,720
You didn't say anything today

575
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,520
I suddenly thought of something

576
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,320
If Xiao Chi can find out the identity of this leader

577
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,120
And the motivation of the night god

578
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,720
It's a great achievement

579
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,720
With 18th prince entering the east palace

580
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,720
Xiao Chi's future must be great

581
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,520
I said why are you not afraid of crying

582
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,320
It turns out that you have figured out this point

583
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,720
That cup

584
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,320
But the two just now

585
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,520
One is called Yingqiu and the other is called Zhixia

586
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,720
I heard that the three of you grew up together

587
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,120
Like sisters

588
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,520
I can't kill you

589
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,720
But I want to kill them

590
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,120
The bad guys are bad guys

591
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,120
Always like to threaten others with other people's soft tears

592
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,120
Zhixia and Yingqiu didn't offend you, did they?

593
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,320
Get them involved

594
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,520
Your conscience

595
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,320
Won't it hurt?

596
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,720
What do you mean

597
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,120
You didn't see it, did you?

598
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,920
These are all the sharpest swords

599
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,520
What you want is her own

600
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,120
What are you doing

601
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,920
What do i want

602
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,120
I want you to take off your clothes

603
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,120
Just kneel down and call Jiafen

604
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,520
Jiafen father

605
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,520
You want to die

606
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,320
What father

607
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,120
What father

608
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
Jinzhu father

609
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,320
What father

610
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,720
Take it off

611
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,320
Not willing to

612
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,520
I am a prince

613
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,320
Only kneel down to the heaven and earth

614
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,120
Won't kneel down to others

615
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,920
Change one

616
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,120
That's fine

617
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,720
Then a simpler one

618
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,520
Take off your clothes and call the boss

619
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,920
This ten thousand swords

620
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,520
Even if it's a noble prince

621
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
Will you still die?

622
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
I

623
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
I

624
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,720
I take off

625
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,520
Take off your clothes, you are silent

626
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,720
What about your belt

627
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,520
All of them are gone

628
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,720
You say you are princes

629
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,120
You wear so many clothes every day

630
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,920
Three layers of clothes

631
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,120
Are you tired?

632
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,520
Don't look at me

633
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,720
I tell you, new man

634
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,920
I'm not taking advantage of you

635
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,120
I'm teaching you to be a person

636
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,920
I'm kindly teaching you what it means to respect others

637
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,720
Don't think you can do whatever you want as a protagonist

638
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
You

639
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,920
What did you call me just now

640
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,920
Name is Nan

641
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,720
Otherwise

642
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,520
Do you still want to follow my surname Song?

643
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,320
I warn you

644
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,320
Don't be too kind to me

645
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,920
Just now that arrogant and domineering strength

646
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,120
what

647
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,520
Didn't you ask me to take off my clothes?

648
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,120
Let me kneel down for you

649
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,120
it is good

650
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,520
Then I take off too

651
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,120
Now you know you're scared

652
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,920
Even if you take off your clothes now

653
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,120
I will definitely

654
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,920
So

655
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,920
What are you not learning, Your Highness

656
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
You say

657
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,920
Say it, Your Highness

658
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
No, you are a girl

659
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
Where did you get these things

660
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,120
To deal with you, such a big devil

661
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,720
Of course I have to prepare more

662
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,320
Han Zhaomei, serious

663
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,920
As long as I am so light

664
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,920
Gu Tong will be in your way

665
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,320
Then you are not afraid of going against Gu Tong

666
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,520
You stop talking nonsense

667
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,520
I'm not afraid of you

668
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,720
You stop talking nonsense

669
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,120
Promise me one condition

670
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
Otherwise

671
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,720
I will give you a painful experience now

672
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,920
What condition

673
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,120
Let me marry Chu Guihong

674
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,720
impossible

675
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Shut up

676
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,720
I didn't say anything

677
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,320
I can't say anything good

678
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,520
Our girl said

679
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,720
Seventh Prince is not a good person

680
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,520
You are by her side

681
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,920
It must not be a good thing

682
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,320
No, Seventh Prince is a person

683
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,720
How did I become a thing

684
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,320
Yingqiu, Zhixia, Mo'er is inside

685
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,920
Nan Heng is here too

686
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,720
No

687
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,920
Not here, impossible

688
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,520
Chu Guiheng

689
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,920
You say

690
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,320
Your fiance is out there

691
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,720
You said he saw me dressed like this with you

692
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,520
You

693
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,720
What will he think

694
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,120
What do you want

695
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,120
You say

696
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,520
No no

697
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,720
Get up

698
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,120
Don't move, don't move

699
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,520
I won't let you go out

700
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,920
Song Yimeng, get up

701
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,120
I won't

702
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,720
Don't move, don't move

703
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,520
Song Yimeng

704
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,120
Chu Guiheng

705
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,120
I told you not to talk

706
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,320
You can't hear me

707
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,120
Chu Guiheng

708
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,520
I let you go

709
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,720
I can't kill you

710
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,920
I won't make fun of you anymore

711
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,920
The critical moment is indeed critical

712
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,920
what to do

713
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,120
Aren't they both stopping you?

714
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,520
let go

715
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,920
Tell your master

716
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,920
What's the matter in the court?

717
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,120
Stay away from Meng Wei

718
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,920
A Hong, why are you here?

719
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,320
Meng Er

720
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,920
A Hong, let's go to the garden to see the flowers

721
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,320
Go

722
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,120
Hey, Meng Er

723
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:22,920
Hurry up

724
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,720
Meng Er

725
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,720
Meng Er

726
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,520
Meng Er

727
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,920
Third time

728
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,120
What's the third time

729
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,920
What's the third time

730
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
Qi Lianxia, you can't be

731
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,120
Every day at home

732
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,720
I'm thinking about these things

733
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,320
It's true

734
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,520
Once in the garden

735
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,920
A fox in the house

736
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,120
Isn't this the third time?

737
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,720
It doesn't matter

738
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
Men

739
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,920
Want to be open

740
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,320
It's not like kissing anyone

741
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,720
At least I have to do it

742
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,520
Shut up

743
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,920
Qi Lianxia

744
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,520
What kind of mouth you are talking about

745
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
OK

746
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,520
You don't have any advantage to stand on, okay?

747
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,520
Why are you so fierce?

748
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,520
Stop counting

749
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
I tell you

750
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,720
In three days

751
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,320
Give me what I want

752
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,720
I'll let you get married right away

753
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,320
Otherwise

754
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,520
The thing about the cotton forest

755
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,120
I can do it like a thousand times

756
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
I can't hurt you

757
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,520
But I have a way to make Chu Weihong

758
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,920
It's better to die than to live

759
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,720
But

760
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,320
Three days is too short

761
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,520
Let's discuss it again

762
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:23,920
Five days

763
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,520
Two days

764
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,320
It's boring for you to talk like this

765
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,320
One day

766
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,720
Two days

767
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,520
Just two days

768
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,520
But your Highness

769
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,520
I want to ask you

770
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,920
When you go out later

771
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,920
Can you go out early?

772
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,520
there

773
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,520
Your Highness

774
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,120
Didn't we come to deal with Song Yimeng?

775
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,920
Isn't it too much for him to walk like this?

776
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,520
And let you go back the window

777
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,320
Your Highness

778
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:57,920
You

779
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,720
You are

780
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,120
Chu Guihong was sent by Song Yude

781
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,720
Correct

782
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,320
I talked a lot in the study

783
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,520
It seems that this Song family

784
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,920
Is going to participate in the battle of Chuwei

785
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,320
If Song Yimeng doesn't get rid of this variable

786
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,520
It will be a big trouble in the future

787
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,320
Your Highness

788
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,920
Song Yimeng has many tricks

789
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,320
Now you are subject to him

790
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:27,920
This

791
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,920
I can kill him

792
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,120
But it doesn't mean I have no other way

793
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,320
Tell Cang Jiangyue

794
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,120
It's time for me to see their value

795
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,720
I'm afraid I can't go out

796
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,320

797
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,520
