1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sword is heavy.

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the deep roots of the enemy.

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,200
It's better to be a man than to be a man.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am willing to be a beast.

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
I am willing to be a beast.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
A heart is not a sword.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
The four seas are in harmony.

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
No need to wait. No need to hate.

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Write a poem for myself.

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
For all that I have.

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,600
I will write a poem with my love.

13
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
I will write a poem with my love.

14
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,400
Forget the past and go back to the youth.

15
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,600
I will be a man for the rest of my life.

16
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,200
I will be a man for this life and for all lives.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,800
I will be a man for the rest of my life.

18
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,800
The Book and The Sword

19
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Episode 16

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,800
Li Shiliu, the King of Zhao is handling a case.

21
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
How can you stop him?

22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
So what if he is the King of Zhao?

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
If I don't turn myself in today,

24
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
you can't take anyone away.

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
What if I must take him away today?

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
You can try.

27
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Li Shiliu,

28
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
I am here to see you.

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
I am here to see you.

30
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Li Shiliu,

31
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,800
you took him back to investigate the case.

32
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
If he is not Shangguan Baihe,

33
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
I will let him go.

34
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
But if he is...

35
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
I am sorry.

36
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Next time,

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I will ask the entire Cangjiang Yue

38
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
to protect the criminal.

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
I will take the responsibility.

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Calm down, everyone.

41
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
It's okay, Chief.

42
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
A man who is innocent will be innocent.

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Since he is innocent,

44
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
why not take a move with him?

45
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Song,

46
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
I will leave it to you.

47
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Let's go.

48
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
The jade garden fell into the water.

49
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
The lantern festival hero saved the beauty.

50
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
The wild-mongering family fell into the abyss.

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
All these have happened.

52
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,800
If the famous scenes in the script

53
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
can't be skipped,

54
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
then the next...

55
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
What's wrong, Qian Feng?

56
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Hanion just came back from her Valor match.

57
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,300
Big Miss!

58
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Mingzhu?

59
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,300
What's the matter?

60
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,300
Something happened to our Little Miss.

61
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,800
What happened to A-Tian?

62
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,400
A woman invited them to visit her

63
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,800
to arrange a marriage with you.

64
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,660
She just easily admitted to do so.

65
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,160
And all of a sudden,

66
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,800
you were going to fight about it.

67
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,600
But you said

68
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,760
to compete for the title.

69
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,240
He wants to cook rice and cook it.

70
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,080
He wants to make Madam forget about it.

71
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,840
He wants to elope.

72
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,960
General.

73
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,480
Whether it's Shangguan Baihe or not,

74
00:04:47,800 --> 00:05:00,180
we'll give the

75
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,360
title.

76
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,800
I brought your stuff,

77
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,440
where's the knife?

78
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,720
Is this what you wanted to talk to me

79
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,800
for last?

80
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,560
On the way here,

81
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,840
I was thinking

82
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,960
if you would like to see me for the last time.

83
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,080
It looks like

84
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,440
I power my own feelings.

85
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,720
I've done too much.

86
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,480
You taught him

87
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,840
what Nanrui said.

88
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,640
Every word

89
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,240
is what you see me as.

90
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,720
But I want you to tell me

91
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,720
what you think

92
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,160
of me.

93
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,120
We met for the last time.

94
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,440
We met in the middle of the night.

95
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,800
I can give you the knife.

96
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,080
But I want to hear you tell me the truth.

97
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
What's going on?

98
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,200
Shangguan He,

99
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,680
Song Yitian has been killed.

100
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,760
Where is Hero Li?

101
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,600
Take me to Hero Li.

102
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,600
Tian has gone to meet Nan Hong.

103
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,680
He's in danger.

104
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,880
Take Shangguan He back to the Jinzhao Valley.

105
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,080
This Purple Golden Pavilion

106
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,160
is where I came with my father when I was young.

107
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,360
This is where my father and I lived together.

108
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,560
This is where I lived together.

109
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,280
This is where I lived together.

110
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,640
This is where I lived together.

111
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,920
This is where I lived together.

112
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,960
This is where the мы years past

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,520
and the responsibilities of Zhang Lingying

114
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,800
on that day disappeared.

115
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,160
This is where father

116
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,440
and Sister Zhang's motherpie loved each other.

117
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,640
The other day

118
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,600
the snow was intense.

119
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,940
I didn't wait for you

120
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,360
at the corridor,

121
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,240
but stealthily sneaked into the hall.

122
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,900
I didn't expect

123
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,600
to see father crying.

124
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,400
Since I've known it,

125
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,160
mother told me

126
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,240
What kind of love is it

127
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,240
that can make a man who is a military minister

128
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
cry so hard in this shabby room

129
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,240
holding Wang Qi's memorial tablet?

130
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
I understand what you're saying.

131
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,240
You want to find a man like your father.

132
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
But Miss Song,

133
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,240
can we talk about this another day?

134
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,240
If you don't know your friend, you can just go to the mortal world alone.

135
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
I understand.

136
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
But after meeting you,

137
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,240
I think if I can spend time with you,

138
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
it's also fine in the mortal world.

139
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
Hero Li,

140
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,240
I don't know what I like about you.

141
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,240
And maybe I don't want to marry a man I don't like.

142
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Although that person is my brother's match,

143
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,240
he is just my match.

144
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,240
Since I've seen the true feelings of the mortal world,

145
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,240
how can I be willing to save him?

146
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Hero Li,

147
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,240
will you be the one I should wait for?

148
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,240
Miss Song,

149
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
I can't answer you today.

150
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
How about this?

151
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Wait a few more days.

152
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
I believe you will have an answer.

153
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
What if I don't want to wait?

154
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Shi Xiang.

156
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Miss Song.

157
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Miss Song.

158
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Miss Song.

160
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
Calm down.

161
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Calm down.

162
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Miss Song.

163
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,240
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Miss Song.

166
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
It's too snowy.

167
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,240
Mo'er, go back first.

168
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
I know that place.

169
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
I'll go there.

170
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
No.

171
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Since I've come to this world,

172
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
I must stop him from doing stupid things.

173
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
Otherwise,

174
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
I will regret it for the rest of my life.

175
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,240
Miss Song.

176
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
Miss Song.

177
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
There are many ways to stop him from marrying Nanrui.

178
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
There's no need to go this way.

179
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
There's no need to destroy your reputation.

180
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
If it weren't for Nanrui's mother,

181
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,240
she wouldn't have let me marry someone else.

182
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
I want to let everyone know

183
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,240
that I'm a woman who doesn't obey the law.

184
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
If I do this, the world will be in chaos.

185
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,240
No one can control me.

186
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,240
No, no, no.

188
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
No.

189
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
Didn't you say that Rong Rong likes me?

190
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,240
If she likes me,

191
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,240
I won't have any respect for her.

192
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
How can she like me?

193
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
I really can't do anything.

194
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,240
I'm sorry.

195
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
Your Highness.

196
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,240
Why is it you?

197
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
No.

198
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
It's not what you think.

199
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
My sister is here right now.

200
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,240
Hurry.

201
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
Song Yi Mo.

202
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,240
Song Yi Mo.

203
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
Song Yi Mo.

204
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Song Yi Mo.

205
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,240
Song Yi Mo.

206
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,240
Song Yi Mo.

207
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
Song Yi Mo.

208
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
Song Yi Mo.

209
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Song Yi Mo.

210
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
Song Yi Mo.

211
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
Song Yi Mo.

212
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
Song Yi Mo.

213
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
Song Yi Mo.

214
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
Song Yi Mo.

215
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
Song Yi Mo.

216
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,240
Song Yi Mo.

217
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,240
Song Yi Mo.

218
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,240
Please do it.

219
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,440
If you can let Miss Song Yi Mo

220
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,240
stop leading Li Shi Liu Huan

221
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,820
Get out of here!

222
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,340
In my life,

223
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,080
the only thing I hope is to see Ting marry into a rich family.

224
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,400
Then this Seventh Highness

225
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,040
will ruin my reputation!

226
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,840
My Lord.

227
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,080
Please don't just sit around!

228
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,720
Madam

229
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,720
We can't stand around and make a mess

230
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,840
This is a strange case

231
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,800
The seven-princess has a low water level

232
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,200
We have to wait for A-Ting to wake up

233
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,120
Ask clearly before making a decision

234
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,320
What are you waiting for

235
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,760
When A-Ting tells you personally

236
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,240
How did he do that seven-princess

237
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,480
With the mean of despicable flow

238
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
Did you cheat

239
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,280
Song Yu De, listen to me

240
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,600
I will give you a low life in this life

241
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,200
I will admit whatever suffering

242
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,400
But I am alive now

243
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,480
I won't do anything else

244
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,680
Just for this daughter

245
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,040
If you dare to let A-Ting

246
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,320
Marry that seven-princess

247
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,960
I

248
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,960
I will give you a low life

249
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,360
When did I say

250
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,000
Let A-Ting marry the seven-princess

251
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,800
Let A-Ting be Xiaomeng's little mother

252
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,000
You

253
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,040
You are so

254
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,840
You are so ridiculous

255
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,680
Master, madam

256
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,080
The seven-princess's black-and-white army

257
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,360
Came into the house

258
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,960
what

259
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,800
Stop

260
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,120
Greetings to Mr. Song and Mrs. Song

261
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,680
You Tang'er Huang Zhi

262
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,200
What do you want to do in my house?

263
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,720
No, the crown prince said

264
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,280
Today, Miss Song and Miss Song

265
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,840
I met a man who was scared by a man on the mountain

266
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,600
I was a little scared

267
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,480
Miss Song's matter is about the safety of the Song family

268
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,440
The crown prince ordered me to bring some soldiers

269
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,720
Come to protect the safety of the Song family

270
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,640
A bunch of nonsense

271
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,440
What kind of man

272
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,000
This is clearly the seven-princess

273
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,280
Where is the seven-princess?

274
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,280
I want to see her

275
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,280
No

276
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,120
I'm not going to see her

277
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,080
I'm not going to see her

278
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
I'm not going to see her

279
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,760
No

280
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,200
The crown prince said

281
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,760
All arrangements tonight

282
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,280
I will give an order tomorrow

283
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,680
And I will give it to Miss Song

284
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,840
An explanation to the Song family

285
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,520
There are some things that are delayed

286
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,760
There are many eyes in the capital and many mouths

287
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,760
The crown prince did this

288
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,480
It's also for the reputation of the second girl

289
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,320
you

290
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,280
You are threatening me

291
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,680
I dare not

292
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,800
go

293
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,120
You are

294
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,400
Master

295
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,720
You

296
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,000
I also can't help you

297
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,880
You said

298
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,680
You are a trick

299
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:50,920
I'm just saying

300
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,560
Hurry up

301
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,240
Go

302
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,560
Just put you in a good place

303
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,840
I'm listening

304
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,560
I'm talking to you

305
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,400
Didn't you learn it?

306
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,900
I said you were Action

307
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:08,900
Hold on

308
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,060
Hold on

309
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,160
Yes

310
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,260
Undo thepper

311
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,820
Put it here

312
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,920
I'm sorry.

313
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,520
I...

314
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,760
Sorry?

315
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,320
Nan Hao,

316
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
don't you think you're very hypocritical?

317
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,920
The way of cutting the knife,

318
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,760
the position of the Crown Prince,

319
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,600
the mechanism of the script,

320
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
what else do you want to know?

321
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,880
I can tell you everything.

322
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,240
But what did Song Yun Ting do wrong?

323
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,560
Why did you hurt an innocent person?

324
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,320
I didn't want to hurt her.

325
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,760
And all I did now

326
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,080
was to make up for it.

327
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,680
Make up for it?

328
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,400
How do you want to make up for it?

329
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,880
How do you want to make up for it?

330
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,280
Let you, the Black Armor Army,

331
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,120
take all the people of our Song family

332
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,640
and lock them up?

333
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,440
It's not what you think.

334
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,760
Can't you trust me just once?

335
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,040
Can't you do it just once?

336
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,640
I'm telling the truth.

337
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,040
What else do you want me to believe?

338
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,600
Why are you everywhere?

339
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,120
You lie to me again and again.

340
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,920
How can I let people believe that you will treat her well?

341
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,840
From now on,

342
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,000
I will never stand by and do nothing.

343
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,440
I will never let Mu Er marry you.

344
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,280
This is between me and Song Yi Meng.

345
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,920
Why are you an outsider?

346
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,640
Outsider?

347
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,600
What about the thing that my aunt was killed?

348
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,640
It has nothing to do with me.

349
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,120
I regretted it 19 years ago.

350
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,240
Today,

351
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,880
I will never let you hurt the person I love again.

352
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,120
I will get back Mu Er's marriage.

353
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,080
You will pay for it.

354
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,120
You can slander me for killing the empress.

355
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,320
You can also slander me for trying to frame Song Yun Ting.

356
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,840
But I'm telling you,

357
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,080
you can't get Song Yi Meng's marriage back.

358
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:50,720
You...

359
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,280
Enough.

360
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
Stop talking.

361
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,280
Nan Heng,

362
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,240
you are trying to get the Song family to be together.

363
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,600
Isn't it just to expand your power?

364
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,720
Why are you still sitting here?

365
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,440
General Chu,

366
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,840
you go back first.

367
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,080
You don't have to interfere with the Song family.

368
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,040
Mu Er.

369
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,120
I told you to go back.

370
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,880
Mu Er.

371
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,920
What's the matter?

372
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,360
I am not selling the paper.

373
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,440
Tianyin...

374
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,920
Please wake up tomorrow.

375
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,920
If your Xuanjiajun starts lying in Song Mansion,

376
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,500
Don't blame me if I mistreat you.

377
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
B Dziękuję you

378
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,980
I will not過록

379
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Coming

380
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,900
I have never known

381
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,240
that this issue

382
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,080
will take care of

383
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,120
Wait.

384
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,160
Congratulations.

385
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,040
writings

386
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,080
and courts

387
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,720
Ali Qu

388
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:47,120
is

389
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,680
Give me the painting

390
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,360
West Valley

391
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,120
Seventh Prince Yuandong

392
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,360
was ordered

393
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,360
to kidnap someass

394
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,200
refused by the variousposts

395
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,640
The legislation

396
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,480
is urgent

397
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,840
seven days later

398
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,960
The above is from the Ministry of Punishments.

399
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,720
I'm curious about

400
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,520
the prison where the soldiers guard.

401
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,080
How did Hero Bai He escape?

402
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,840
The man who saved you

403
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,560
was the Seventh Prince, Nan Heng.

404
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,920
After you escaped,

405
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,840
you appeared in the Cangjiang Moon.

406
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,960
You and Li Shiliu are from Nan Heng?

407
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,720
Nan Heng is working hard to conquer the Cangjiang Moon.

408
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,120
Is it for the sake of the enemy?

409
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,200
Yes.

410
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,280
Yes, but not completely.

411
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,080
What do you mean?

412
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,320
He's working hard for the sake of the enemy,

413
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,240
but not for himself.

414
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,920
He's working for

415
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,240
the Eighteenth Prince.

416
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,840
The man behind the Cangjiang Moon

417
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,320
is the Eighteenth Prince, Nan Rui.

418
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,840
How dare you!

419
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,800
It's a grave crime

420
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,280
to frame the current prince.

421
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,200
I'm telling the truth.

422
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,560
What frame?

423
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
I see.

424
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,600
You and the Seventh Prince are always in disagreement.

425
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,240
The Qianyu Army

426
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,560
is also the leader of the Eighteenth Prince.

427
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,960
Do you want to use me as a pawn

428
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,960
to frame the Seventh Prince?

429
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,760
You should have said so earlier.

430
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,680
If you agree to let me go,

431
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,440
I'll go to the emperor with you

432
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,320
to bite Nan Heng's mouth.

433
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,800
What do you think?

434
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,320
What my general wants is the truth.

435
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,240
You're talking nonsense.

436
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,200
Believe it or not, I'll beat you to death.

437
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,840
It's not that I want to cooperate with you.

438
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,600
It's not that I don't want to cooperate with you either,

439
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,480
Mr. Chu.

440
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,960
What do you want?

441
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
Let me tell you.

442
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,320
The Seventh Prince

443
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,840
will be investigated by the Three Judicial Offices.

444
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,480
I have to testify in front of His Majesty.

445
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,080
If I suddenly change my mind

446
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,640
and say that you, Chu Hui Hong,

447
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,960
have accused me of being a cheat

448
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,480
and wronged the Seventh Prince,

449
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,880
what will happen to you and your Qian Yu Army?

450
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,240
Keep an eye on the general.

451
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,480
When His Majesty orders,

452
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,560
kill him with your own hands.

453
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,920
General.

454
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,360
General,

455
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,800
they won't do anything to you.

456
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,720
General.

457
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,560
Can they just let him die?

458
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,520
Should I find another person who is sane

459
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,880
and......

460
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,760
No need,

461
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,880
Shang Guan He is already dead.

462
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,840
The death of a man

463
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,440
is a set up of a joint-circuit to deal with Nan Heng.

464
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,560
Joint-circuit?

465
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,600
What do you mean?

466
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,840
Shang Guan, Bai He, Luo Bao

467
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,920
have committed the crime of not doing his job well.

468
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,840
After we find out the full record of the case

469
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,760
and find out what the executioner was like that day,

470
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,280
we can find out

471
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,120
which part of the case was tampered with.

472
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,720
What if Nan Heng

473
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,800
did it without any reason?

474
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
Then we can give him the hot-handed

475
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,520
and let him investigate it himself.

476
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,160
He can prove himself innocent.

477
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,880
If he protects Shang Guan He,

478
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,960
he can be punished for the crime of tampering with the melon.

479
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
If he wants to break the pen and beg for life,

480
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,520
then we can cut off his left arm and right arm.

481
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,880
If Shang Guan He really is a man of Nan Heng,

482
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,760
then all the people in Cang Jiang Yue

483
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,240
including Li Shiliu, who was a skilled man,

484
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,480
are all his party members.

485
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,520
I'm afraid we won't be able to save him

486
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,800
by using Cang Jiang Yue's way.

487
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,920
Then we can turn that dead flag into a bait

488
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,920
and lure Cang Jiang Yue to commit suicide.

489
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,640
We can completely eradicate Nan Heng's party

490
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,880
and force Nan Heng to become a poor man in the public's eyes.

491
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,160
Miss, there's still no noise inside.

492
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,480
You haven't slept all night.

493
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,560
Let's go back to the room and wait.

494
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,400
Madam, are you happy now?

495
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,200
You...

496
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,160
Stop being so happy.

497
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,720
If it weren't for you not repairing the imperial jade

498
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,520
and having an affair with Seventh Highness,

499
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,880
would our Song family

500
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,480
end up like this?

501
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,280
Your sister

502
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,880
will be ruined by you all her life.

503
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,160
Madam, don't worry.

504
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,680
I will definitely think of a way

505
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,240
to deal with Tian.

506
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,240
Think of a way?

507
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,040
What way, Aunt Song?

508
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,320
I've never treated you well since you were a child.

509
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,520
Where did you come from?

510
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,040
You want to kill the whole family

511
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,040
and then you dare to give up?

512
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,520
Madam, how can you say that?

513
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,360
My daughter is so sincere to Second Miss.

514
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,000
How could she be so kind to Second Miss?

515
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,560
Besides...

516
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,680
Did I say something wrong?

517
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,320
Look at the soldiers in the yard.

518
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,840
Think about your father's blood for you.

519
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,280
Aunt Song, if one day

520
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,800
the Song family is in a mess because of you,

521
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,320
I won't let you off even if I die.

522
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,960
What exactly are you going to do?

523
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,080
S shaping the swords today.

524
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,880
summon

525
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,900
呃

526
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,700
呃

527
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:17,840
呃

528
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,080
What the hell are you looking for

529
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,480
Cutting knife

530
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,480
What?

531
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,160
How is it?

532
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,000
Madam, Miss.

533
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,320
Miss, she...

534
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,640
She only wants to see Seventh Prince.

535
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
Stop.

536
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,440
Nanhang, I...

537
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,160
Are you a man?

538
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,720
I have no time to talk to you.

539
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,800
Nanhang, how can you...

540
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
18th Prince,

541
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,600
this is on the street.

542
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,000
For Miss, please calm down.

543
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,480
I... I'm calm?

544
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,480
I...

545
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,000
Nanhang, you and Li Shiliu

546
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,440
are not good people.

547
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,800
I will avenge Tingting.

548
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,200
Wait for me for half a year.

549
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,080
If you want to know who Li Shiliu is,

550
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,400
protect him and wake up first.

551
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,400
Seventh Prince, good idea.

552
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,960
Is Tingting inside?

553
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,320
What happened?

554
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,060
He...

555
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,080
He...

556
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,040
He...

557
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,520
Come.

558
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,320
Ah Ting.

559
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,120
Your Highness,

560
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,240
what happened?

561
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,800
You...

562
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,560
What's wrong with you?

563
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,040
Nothing.

564
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,680
I was poisoned with the secret medicine.

565
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,920
Go and pack the food.

566
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,880
Take all the food.

567
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
The news of the blockade

568
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,840
is that the soldiers are encircling Song's Mansion.

569
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,920
The news of the blockade is that the soldiers are encircling Song's Mansion.

570
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,440
And they even put the note in my clothes.

571
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,440
You put so much effort into it.

572
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,320
What do you want?

573
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,320
And

574
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,640
who is Li Shiliu?

575
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,280
Actually,

576
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,800
since you were challenged by the Axe Gang in Cangjiang Yue,

577
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,120
the Li Shiliu you saw

578
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,480
is Shang Guanhe.

579
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,040
Shang Guanhe?

580
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,640
That's impossible.

581
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,440
He is just a disciple.

582
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,040
How could he be Hero Li?

583
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,400
Miss Song,

584
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,840
Li Shiliu is my other identity.

585
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,040
Shang Guanhe used this identity

586
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
to save you by coincidence.

587
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,080
I didn't want to interfere in your business.

588
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,320
He asked me to return the painting

589
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,080
to you

590
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,480
in the Forbidden Pavilion yesterday.

591
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,440
But I didn't expect

592
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,240
the following thing to happen.

593
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,880
Yes.

594
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,480
Your identity can't be exposed.

595
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,680
So you transferred the Black Armor Army to Song's Mansion

596
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,480
to take the first step to become my official.

597
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,880
Yes.

598
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,320
You are so scheming.

599
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,120
But the one who came to talk to me today

600
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,240
shouldn't be you.

601
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,440
Where is Shang Guanhe?

602
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,040
Don't you have the courage to talk to me?

603
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,800
He is in the prison

604
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,640
of the Jinzhao Mansion now.

605
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,600
Step aside.

606
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,800
No, no, no.

607
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,880
Miss Song, calm down.

608
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,560
Get out of the way.

609
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,840
His Highness did this for a reason.

610
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,240
He will definitely give you an explanation.

611
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,960
What explanation?

612
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,160
Did he marry our A'ting?

613
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,040
He is so wild

614
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,640
that he caused A'ting to fall into a pit.

615
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,400
How can you say that?

616
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,760
Your second daughter didn't poison the incense.

617
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,040
How could he do that?

618
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,080
Nonsense.

619
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,760
How could A'ting do that?

620
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,960
It's clearly that boy.

621
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,160
Your second daughter wanted to harm you.

622
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,800
If you don't believe me,

623
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,920
the Black Armor Army has brought back

624
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,280
the incense of the Forbidden Pavilion.

625
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,440
I'll take you to see it now.

626
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,440
Shut up.

627
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,240
His Highness wants to make a big deal out of a small thing.

628
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,520
You are talking about life and death.

629
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,360
Why?

630
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,760
You shameless man.

631
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,040
You dare to catch a thief again?

632
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,720
Fine.

633
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,640
I'll beat you up today.

634
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,920
Feng Gui, you dare to come back again?

635
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,320
I didn't come back.

636
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,600
His Highness has been treated for this.

637
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,280
He can't fight back.

638
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,200
I dare not.

639
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,720
You...

640
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,880
Let's go, Feng Gui.

641
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,680
The women of Song's Mansion are all so powerful.

642
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,520
His Highness still came to provoke them.

643
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,200
Isn't it self-sufficiency?

644
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,280
You two

645
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,000
played me so well.

646
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
Now you want me to help you hide the truth?

647
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,280
Your Highness,

648
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,880
why do you think I'll agree?

649
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,920
Shang Guan He told me

650
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,920
that most of the women in Song's Mansion

651
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,520
are more knowledgeable than the rest.

652
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,800
Since you are a history scholar,

653
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,640
you should know the sword.

654
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,480
You should know the art of chess.

655
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,520
Your Highness, you are just

656
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,320
reminding me of these things.

657
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,080
I will only make this matter bigger

658
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,880
if I reveal your identity.

659
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,080
I will be famous for seducing my brother-in-law.

660
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,680
Sister Zhang will also be ridiculed.

661
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,160
It's no good for me and the Song family.

662
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,760
As long as Miss Song knows this,

663
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,120
I will send her away immediately.

664
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,200
And you can rest assured.

665
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
I have sealed the news last night.

666
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,240
No one will know about it.

667
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,520
I will try my best to help

668
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,280
your marriage in the future.

669
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,480
I will make it up to you.

670
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,600
Why do you think

671
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,440
it's enough?

672
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,760
What else do you want?

673
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,600
I want Shang Guan He to be safe.

674
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,640
Sister Zhang said

675
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
you are cruel and ruthless.

676
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,200
Now Shang Guan He is in the Eastern Window.

677
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,080
If you don't stand up to plead guilty,

678
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,680
it's not a good thing.

679
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,100
But you won't expose the

680
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,800
miserable Jiang Yue and give up your power.

681
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,680
Are you going to give up your power

682
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,600
and wipe yourself clean?

683
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,040
Miss Song is really smart.

684
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,920
But I won't

685
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,040
bother you with these things.

686
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,120
It's okay to be smart and stupid.

687
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,080
We are just mortals.

688
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,040
We should have a sense of propriety.

689
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,920
I admit

690
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,720
every word you said before was right.

691
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,560
I know that

692
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,120
you are powerful and powerful.

693
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,960
But I don't want to accept you.

694
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,640
I just want to apologize to my sister

695
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,200
after Shang Guan He comes out.

696
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,920
And in this life,

697
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,560
you are not allowed to marry a woman other than him.

698
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,080
If you can't do these two things at once,

699
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,160
don't blame me for telling your identity.

700
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,840
You dare to threaten me.

701
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,600
Aren't you afraid that I...

702
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,560
If I die,

703
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,240
Zhang Jian will not forgive you.

704
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,040
I bet you dare not.

705
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,280
Okay.

706
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,480
It's a deal.

707
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,040
It's a deal.

708
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,560
Jingzhao's case has an important case.

709
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,680
Please go to the government office.

710
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,760
What important case?

711
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,520
Jingzhao has the right to interrogate and control.

712
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,000
If there is a violation,

713
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,880
it's a serious crime.

714
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,760
Who dares to disrespect the crown prince?

715
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,240
It's okay.

716
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,240
I haven't been to Jingzhao's mansion since I came back.

717
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,840
I'll go with you today.

718
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,320
Who is he?

719
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,080
Have you forgotten?

720
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,880
His name is Shang Guan He.

721
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,880
You've seen him in the Cangjiang Courtyard.

722
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,080
According to the case,

723
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,680
Cao Meng's case has nothing to do with you.

724
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,080
But three years ago,

725
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
his name was Shang Guan Bai He.

726
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,280
He was the one you brought to the case

727
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,280
of the theft of the three southern provinces.

728
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,880
The cases I've handled over the years are countless.

729
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,080
How can I remember

730
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,280
a mere prisoner?

731
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,880
According to the criminal records,

732
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,880
Shang Guan Bai He was killed overnight.

733
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,680
As the official in charge of the case,

734
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,080
aren't you curious

735
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,280
how a man who should have died for three years

736
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,480
survived?

737
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,480
So you mean

738
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,880
I should keep an eye on a prisoner

739
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,880
and watch him

740
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,280
until he's killed?

741
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,880
You have a reason to deny it.

742
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,280
But

743
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,680
I went to the central office yesterday

744
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,280
to check the old case files.

745
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,080
Guess what happened?

746
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,280
The old case files are all

747
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,880
in the library.

748
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,880
The records of the library and the fire

749
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,480
were all copied.

750
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,680
Your Highness,

751
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
if it were you,

752
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,280
would you suspect that

753
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,480
someone is behind this case?

754
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,880
You're really incompetent.

755
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,880
You would blame me for it.

756
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,480
But it's still the case.

757
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,680
It's okay if you don't admit it.

758
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,680
You're a good at forcing others to confess.

759
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,280
Why don't you ask

760
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,080
how Shang Guan Bai He

761
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,680
survived?

762
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,880
I forgot to tell you.

763
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,480
The case is in the library.

764
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,880
What I'm doing today

765
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,680
is giving you a chance

766
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,880
to create a fake file

767
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
for colluding with the court.

768
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,880
Catch them!

769
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,280
Your Highness, are you okay?

770
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,080
Your army is useless.

771
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,680
Even a prisoner can't see it.

772
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,480
Is there any place

773
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,080
where the world is peaceful?

774
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,880
Fugui, go back and lead the troops

775
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,280
to capture the man in black.

776
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,080
Yes.

777
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,480
Seventh Prince is a killing god.

778
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,880
How could he be hurt by a man in black?

779
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,480
Did he get hurt in Yang Zhuang

780
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,080
or by someone else?

781
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,480
He was behind the bars

782
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,680
and was covering up the prison.

783
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,680
Even if he was a killer,

784
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,080
he would have done something wrong.

785
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,480
Really?

786
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,280
It's a pity that

787
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,280
Your Highness

788
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,680
saved the wrong person.

789
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,880
Put him down!

790
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,080
Go!

791
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,280
Don't go to the coffin!

792
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,280
Stop!

793
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,880
Take them all down!

794
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,880
This is the real Shang Guan He.

795
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,680
The prisoner

796
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,880
was probably

797
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,680
Cang Jiang Yue, Ye Ying, and his wife.

798
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,680
I'm afraid it's Cang Jiang Yue and Ye You Shen.

799
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,080
It's a pity.

800
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,880
I'm afraid Rong Hua has surrounded them.

801
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,280
After Rong Hua has captured them,

802
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,680
Your Highness,

803
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,080
tell me.

804
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,680
I know they are prisoners.

805
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,280
What about expelling them?

806
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,280
It's good to do that.

807
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
But General Chu,

808
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,680
why do you think

809
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,880
Ye You Shen must be the prisoner?

810
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,880
I'm not Cang Jiang Yue.

811
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,680
Someone gave me 500 taels of silver

812
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,280
and asked me to take him to the prison.

813
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,680
After the execution,

814
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,480
he gave me 500 taels of silver again.

815
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,080
That person

816
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,880
is Ye You Shen, right?

817
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,280
He didn't show up.

818
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,480
He's a beggar.

819
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,080
He gave me the money and the letter.

820
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,280
You are the prisoner?

821
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,280
General Chu, you must be joking.

822
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,880
I'm not Shang Guan He's accomplice.

823
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,880
Why do you have to make such a big deal?

824
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,680
I'm just saying this

825
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,480
to remind you that

826
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,480
you should not be too careful.

827
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,680
It doesn't matter.

828
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,880
Whoever comes,

829
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,480
they will only be Cang Jiang Yue and Ye You Shen.

830
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,880
You are joking.

831
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,480
How could the beggar be Ye You Shen?

832
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,280
If so,

833
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,880
I'll tell you the truth.

834
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,480
If there's no evidence,

835
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,080
I'll make a false one.

836
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,880
Today, Cang Jiang Yue is sealed.

837
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,080
Brothers,

838
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,080
follow me to Cang Jiang Yue.

839
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,880
Yes.

840
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,880
The crime is indeed clever.

841
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,480
Ye You Shen,

842
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,280
you've been dealing with the Seventh Prince for too long.

843
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,680
You are just like a wooden man.

844
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,080
You only know how to use the pen to return the body.

845
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,680
Since you know this,

846
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,080
do you know what is

847
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,280
the golden cicada's nest?

848
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,680
The golden cicada's nest

849
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,280
is the golden cicada's nest.

850
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,880
