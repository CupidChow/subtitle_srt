I'm right, aren't I?

57
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,280
That's because I've experienced

58
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,910
all of today's events twice.

59

It does exist.

Things started all over after she died.

108
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,190
In our words, it is called

109
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,250
"stuck with a bug."

110
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,650
Things started again after she died?

Back then,

112
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,830

114

But the story disallowed it,

115

00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,460
Have I determined this is your doing yet?

177
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,840
Chu Guihong,

178
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,400
how did you find out about this?

179
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,940
I just received a report.

180
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,240
The red tangerine vendor was seen

181
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,550
to put poison in his fruit

182
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,030
and then sell some
to the Eighteenth Prince.

183
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,130
I think

184
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,920
someone is plotting

185
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,270
against Your Majesty

186
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,580
and the Eighteenth Prince.

187
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,040
What?

188
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:22,570
Who

189
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,840
would do this to us?

190
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,790
The late Empress's death anniversary
is approaching.

191
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,790
Red tangerines...

192
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,910
The late Empress's death anniversary
is approaching.

193
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,960
Red tangerines were

194
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Her Majesty's favorite.

195
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,120
Were Her Majesty's favorite.

196
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,240
At this time every year,

197
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,200
the Eighteenth Prince

198
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
and Your Majesty would eat
red tangerines together

199
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,320
in memory of the late Empress.

200
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,480
How come I feel Heng has said it here too?

201
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,600
Not many people in the palace
know about this.

202
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,910
My guess is

203
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,840
that the plotter

204
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,550
must be

205
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,080
very close to Your Majesty

206
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,610
and the Eighteenth Prince.

207
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,910
Chu Guihong,

208
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,100
what are you implying?

209
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,850
How dare you!

210
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,080
You're hurling

211
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,360
a baseless accusation at the crown prince!

212
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,870
Yeah.

213
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,480
Guihong,

214
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,120
Heng is the crown prince now.

215
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,320
He has no reason to poison Father...

216
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,270
So what?

217
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,150
He has diabolical ambitions.

218
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,510
Out of fear of being replaced

219
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,480
if His Majesty changes his mind,

220
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,810
the crown prince might take a precaution.

221
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,670
Your Majesty,

222
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,010
this could be a rebellion.

223
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,030
To avoid further turmoil,

224
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,860
Your Majesty had better stay
in the bed chamber.

225
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,440
I'll bring Qianyu Army

226
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,960
into the palace to safeguard Your Majesty.

227
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,760
Chu Guihong,

228
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,700
are you trying to confine me here?

229
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,120
Protecting the sovereign

230
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,590
is my duty as an officer.

231
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:17,900
[Huanning Hall]

232
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,150
We're late.

233
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,360
The Emperor has ordered

234
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,550
to relieve the Imperial Guards.

235
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,180
Have this place guarded now.

236
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,720
Without my permission,

237
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,780
no one can be admitted to the chamber.

238
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,150
If there are violators,

239
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,750
kill them.

240
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,270
Got it.

241
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,550
Remember,

242
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,880
do whatever it takes to make him write

243
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,560
an imperial edict to eradicate Nan Heng.

244
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,870
Rest assured, General.

245
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,470
I'll get the imperial edict.

246
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,910
Last time,

247
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,510
he took action ahead of time.

248
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,430
Why is he doing it again now?

249
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,660
Qianyu Army

250
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,130
has quickly taken control of the palace.

251
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Is the Emperor...

252
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,270
We must find out a way

253
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,530
to rescue the Emperor.

254
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,240
H-Heng...

255
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,040
Heng!

256
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,910
Heng!

257
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,240
I...

258
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,840
Why are you here?

259
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,440
When Father attracted their attention,

260
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,970
I snuck out of the hall
through a hole for dogs.

261
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,320
That's the whole story.

262
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,100
He must've gone crazy!

263
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,070
He boldly confined the Emperor?

264
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,870
This is bad.

265
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,650
We must rescue Father now.

266
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,870
Heng,

267
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,670
listen,

268
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,750
before I escaped,

269
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,030
Father reminded me

270
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,750
to warn you

271
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,550
not to act rashly.

272
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,120
He will

273
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,270
try stalling for time.

274
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,480
Father also said,

275
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,480
my cousin...

276
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,670
Chu Guihong

277
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,670
is eager to get
an imperial edict to attack you.

278
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,670
Going out there now

279
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,670
is handing yourself over, isn't it?

280
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,960
He's right.

281
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,720
The first time the Emperor got in danger,

282
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
many people in the palace witnessed

283
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,790
Nan Rui

284
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,790
feeding him poisonous tangerines.

285
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,870
But things are different this time.

286
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,050
A street vendor's testimony alone

287
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,960
can hardly convince everyone.

288
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,600
What?

289
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,030
It...

290
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,320
When did I ever poison my father?

291
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,720
It was done by Chu Guihong.

292
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,780
He just framed you.

293
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,330
Chu Guihong put poison in the tangerines?

294
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,000
That's impossible.

295
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,360
H-H-He...

296
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,760
How could he have done it?

297
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,270
It was he who stopped Father
from eating the tangerines.

298
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,080
Right.

299
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,600
What made Chu Guihong
change his plan this time?

300
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,550
He has

301
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,910
either predicted our action,

302
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,960
or...

303
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,240
Is he also part of the unlimited flow now?

304
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,270
Does he have any memories

305
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,510
of the last two rounds of reincarnation?

306
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,440
Definitely not.

307
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,640
Then he must have

308
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,150
got some information in advance,

309
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,390
which made him change his mind.

310
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,320
But his ultimate goal remains.

311
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,030
What "unlimited flow"?

312
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,490
It is to kill you in person.

313
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,120
Wait.

314
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,720
Why is this all so befuddling?

315
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,550
What do you mean

316
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,480
by "unlimited flow"?

317
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,790
What... I...

318
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,440
I know each word,

319
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,200
but I'm puzzled

320
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,120
when they combine.

321
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,600
We'll explain it to you later.

322
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,200
Now, I'll ask Fugui to send

323
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,630
you and my mother

324
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,090
to Waning River Crescent.

325
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:56,980
Okay.

326
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,630
We lost in the previous two rounds

327
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,690
due to the lack of military strength.

328
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,000
This time,

329
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,470
I'm going to meet someone first.

330
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,470
[Righteousness]

331
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,640
Stop!

332
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,720
You've secretly transferred
Qianyu Army to the capital.

333
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,600
Why do you still need the command token?

334
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,480
As I told you,

335
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,030
I must change my fate.

336
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,480
What don't you understand?

337
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,670
After finishing all the iconic scenes,

338
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,910
I'll write a new ending

339
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,720
to your satisfaction!

340
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,850
No need to go the extra length, Father.

341
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,510
If I become the next emperor,

342
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,760
you'll be the Imperial Father.

343
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,630
The cold palace
where Nan Heng used to be confined

344
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,150
must be familiar to you.

345
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,000
Would you like to

346
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,440
spend the rest of your life there?

347
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,530
Chu Guihong!

348
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,150
You promised to let me
go back to the modern times!

349
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,610
-You...
-If you do go back,

350
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,030
my fate will fall in the palm
of your hand again, won't it?

351
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,670
You...

352
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,030
From now on,

353
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,600
only I can decide my fate.

354
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,020
If you don't want
to live in the cold palace--

355
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,600
in the script, Nan Heng turns Song Yimeng

356
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
into a human swine, doesn't he?

357
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,810
How do you like it if you end up

358
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,550
that way?

359
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,820
Stay!

360
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,490
Guards!

361
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,000
I need help!

362
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,000
Guards!

363
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,330
Help me!

364
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,240
Hurry.

365
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,960
Take Chu...

366
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,390
I am Lord Qianyu.

367
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,450
What are you doing?

368
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,320
Take him away.

369
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,600
Chu Guihong,

370
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,680
you crazy man!

371
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,840
I'll curse you!

372
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,670
When I go back,

373
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,120
I'll make you die in the script

374
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,240
a thousand times!

375
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,320
Too bad

376
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,240
that you can never go back.

377
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,200
I'm Lord Qianyu.

378
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
How dare you defy me?

379
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,840
Move!

380
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,480
Let go of me!

381
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,210
Keep moving!

382
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,200
I'm Lord Qianyu!

383
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,750
You...

384
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,380
Nan Heng!

385
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,120
Don't yell.

386
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,200
Nan Heng,

387
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,200
Chu Guihong has gone crazy.

388
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,150
He placed 5,000 soldiers outside the city.

389
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,870
Precisely at nine tonight,

390
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,070
they'll besiege you.

391
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,200
If you don't want to die,

392
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,360
quickly finish the iconic scenes
with Song Yimeng.

393
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,030
When I'm back to...

394
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,290
Still thinking about the iconic scenes?

395
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,130
Do you know you've already died twice?

396
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,590
I've died twice?

397
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,320
When?

398
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,030
According to Song Yimeng,

399
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,380
first,

400
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,000
Rong Hua killed you.

401
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,840
Then,

402
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,000
Chu Guihong killed you.

403
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,800
It was I who collected your body.

404
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,250
That reincarnation thing is true.

405
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,810
I'm telling you,

406
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,349
a new round of reincarnation has begun.

407
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,680
If you want to survive,

408
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,240
collaborate with me

409
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,720
to fight Chu Guihong.

410
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,530
Fight Chu Guihong?

411
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,920
Are you out of your mind?

412
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,240
I'm just a screenwriter.

413
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,960
I know how to type,

414
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,089
but not how to fight.

415
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,970
You looked down on us
fictional characters, didn't you?

416
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:28,680
I...

417
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,080
Weren't you omnipotent?

418
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,890
How about this?

419
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,070
You're here already.

420
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,030
Might as well make this visit count,

421
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,720
right?

422
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,880
Help me out of here.

423
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,030
I'll hide somewhere.

424
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,070
Then, you guys can
proceed to political struggles

425
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,030
or fights.

426
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,720
I won't hold you back, okay?

427
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,310
Hide somewhere?

428
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,270
This is a critical time.

429
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,400
Are you even a man?

430
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,850
Don't be so mean.

431
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,200
I'm just pointing out my incompetence,

432
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,920
aren't I?

433
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,720
I'm a tiny screenwriter,

434
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,550
not the male lead.

435
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,270
These glorious moments
of fighting and killing

436
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,800
should be reserved for you.

437
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,110
Nan Heng.

438
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,450
Heng...

439
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,310
My dearest Heng,

440
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,350
I've already had a hard time

441
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,790
in reality because of you.

442
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,510
I-In the script world,

443
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,400
please spare me from trouble.

444
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,270
Cut the crap.

445
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,030
I...

446
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,720
No matter who you are,

447
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,100
you can only be Lord Qianyu today.

448
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,850
Lord Qianyu?

449
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,450
Have some water.

450
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,590
Thank you.

451
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,270
Nan Heng,

452
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,490
how are you holding up?

453
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,790
If you really can't manage...

454
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,510
Don't worry.

455
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,880
I...

456
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,060
I'm coping well.

457
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,300
Don’t tell me you can die

458
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,060
and let reincarnation commence again

459
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,340
if the worst happens.

460
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,510
Listen,

461
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,240
this time,

462
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,240
I won’t let you get hurt.

463
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,120
But Chu Guihong commands

464
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,830
5,000 soldiers now.

465
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,880
Lord Qianyu hasn't agreed to help us yet.

466
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,210
What do you have
to fight Chu Guihong with?

467
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,080
Don't tell me you can count on

468
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,240
your plot armor as the male lead.

469
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,580
As you said, I'm the male lead.

470
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,450
The male lead has to

471
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,750
come up with

472
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,210
certain solutions
that only he can think of.

473
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
What's your plan?

474
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,110
My uncle told me before his execution

475
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,310
that he had 3,000 private soldiers
outside the city.

476
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,510
I have 3,000 private soldiers

477
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,270
stationing outside the city in secret.

478
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,550
Once Your Highness gives an order,

479
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,350
they'll raid the capital
from inside and outside.

480
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,350
The capital prefecture's office
has failed to find this troop.

481
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,160
Therefore,

482
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,700
I asked Yao Qian
to lead the Nightwalkers

483
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,110
to look for clues.

484
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,440
They'll search every corner
on the outskirts

485
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,170
till these soldiers are found.

486
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,110
But it was you who revealed
Chancellor Gao's crimes.

487
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,440
Will his private soldiers

488
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,700
follow your commands?

489
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,350
I had Yao Qian take
a crown prince's edict with him.

490
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,240
These soldiers can choose to hide

491
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,030
and conceal their identities forever,

492
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,750
or to make amends by following me

493
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,880
to quell the unrest.

494
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,440
I believe most of them

495
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,700
will go for the latter.

496
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,030
The more people join us,

497
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,820
the higher the odds of us winning.

498
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,880
More people?

499
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,670
Perhaps

500
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,090
before your uncle's private soldiers
enter the capital,

501
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,550
we can recruit some people

502
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,770
and have them stall Chu Guihong for us.

503
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,960
What people?

504
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,560
Officials.

505
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,720
People from the martial arts world.

506
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,960
Residents in the capital.

507
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,360
They can all be our aides.

508
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,590
I-I'm having a stomachache.

509
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,270
Jia Ruru,

510
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,350
please hear me out.

511
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,000
Y-You...

512
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,980
Mrs. Li,

513
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,170
why wouldn't he help us?

514
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,960
Yunlong and I

515
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,590
even offered him a luminous pearl.

516
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,720
This big.

517
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,790
To fear is human.

518
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,590
The idea of fighting Chu Guihong

519
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,120
who holds a large army,
scares them even more.

520
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,120
I wish there were helpers from thin air.

521
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,790
Mrs. Li!

522
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,070
Mrs. Li.

523
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,030
Mrs. Shangguan

524
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,240
and Mr. Song are here.

525
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,000
Dad!

526
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,590
Yimeng,

527
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,510
what's the emergency?

528
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,110
Why did you tell us to come?

529
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,400
Let's talk over there.

530
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,030
Come on.

531
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,590
The Eighteenth Prince is here as well?

532
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,920
Nan Heng needs to
explain something to him.

533
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,110
I just hope he won't faint

534
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,160
upon hearing Heng's words.

535
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,960
Faint?

536
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,560
What exactly is going on?

537
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,080
Jixiang,

538
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,640
they must've reached the part
about the script world.

539
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,510
When I first heard it,

540
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,070
I reacted the same way.

541
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,590
Now, they must be
talking about the reincarnation.

542
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,120
This beautiful world
is filled with wonders.

543
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,220
Ignorant people are easily shocked.

544
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,440
The Eighteenth Prince and you

545
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,560
seldom travel far.

546
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,840
It's understandable for people

547
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,310
with scanty information like you

548
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,720
not to know these bizarre things.

549
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,380
Hope you don't feel inferior.

550
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,250
[Jixiang]

551
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,720
I've said too much.

552
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,800
You need time to process it.

553
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,210
Though Chu Guihong
has set you up three times,

554
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,140
his real target has always been me.

555
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,070
If

556
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,860
you can't bring yourself to fight him,

557
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,860
-I will...
-Heng.

558
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,350
Look,

559
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,590
you died so many times.

560
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,590
You must've been in a lot of pain.

561
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,310
This is all my fault.

562
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,350
When I first bought
those red tangerines,

563
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,110
if I had discovered the poison in them...

564
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,750
No.

565
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,680
I shouldn't have bought
those red tangerines at all.

566
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,440
Wait.

567
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,370
Do you understand what I'm saying?

568
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,440
I do.

569
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,610
Thoroughly and completely.

570
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,880
You're saying

571
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:12,830
that the Nightwalkers and you

572
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,160
will lure Chu Guihong's rebel forces
to the South City

573
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,070
to create a chance for me

574
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,200
to lead 300 Xuanjia soldiers

575
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,600
to charge into the palace
to rescue Father.

576
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,750
But, Heng,

577
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,750
we only have a small number of soldiers.

578
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,960
You've been defeated by Chu Guihong twice.

579
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,920
What if

580
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,060
you die again?

581
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,440
But we've gone this far now.

582
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:36,920
I...

583
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,000
I have an idea.

584
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,930
See if you find it feasible.

585
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,440
I'll lead Xuanjia Army to lie in ambush

586
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,040
in the South City in advance,

587
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,720
while you lure Chu Guihong
to go there alone.

588
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Once he falls into our trap,

589
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,790
I'll suddenly appear from nowhere.

590
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,920
He'll be thrown into utter panic

591
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,880
and erupt into fury.

592
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,830
We'll be able to change our fate
when that happens.

593
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,400
Isn't it a good idea?

594
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,240
Not at all.

595
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,470
Heng,

596
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,160
you can count on me, your brother!

597
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,660
Stop with that gibberish.

598
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,690
Just do as I say.

599
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,680
I'll head to the South City.

600
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,830
You'll storm the palace.

601
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,790
But...

602
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,860
Without you...

603
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,900
If I do it alone, I'm afraid...

604
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Those 300 Xuanjia soldiers
will be with you, right?

605
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,890
Plus, that great fighter

606
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,680
Jixiang will await you in the palace.

607
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,410
I'm sure you can rescue Father.

608
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,750
Don't worry.

609
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,830
Nan Rui,

610
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,070
you are my brother.

611
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,880
You can definitely do

612
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,590
what I can,

613
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,520
or even perform better than me.

614
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,260
Besides, don't forget

615
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,720
that you are heaven's chosen one

616
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,140
and Great Jing's symbol
of good fortune.

617
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,200
Okay.

618
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,770
I'll protect the palace.

619
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,600
You'll protect the capital.

620
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,640
The two of us

621
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,350
will definitely survive this time.

622
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,440
What did you say?

623
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,450
Chu Guihong is going to start a coup?

624
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,200
In less than six hours,

625
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,000
Qianyu rebels

626
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,330
will enter the capital.

627
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,720
How is that possible?

628
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,200
Lord Qianyu is reputed for his loyalty.

629
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,800
Why would he allow his son
to rise in rebellion?

630
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,590
Dad,

631
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,850
I don't have time

632
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,730
to explain everything to you.

633
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,510
But we must

634
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,000
stop Chu Guihong now.

635
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,480
Otherwise, Nan Heng, his people

636
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,940
and the entire Song family
will be in danger.

637
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,750
My goodness.

638
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,380
What can we do?

639
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,560
Alright.

640
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,830
Say no more.

641
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,660
It's just that this matter...

642
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,810
I...

643
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,480
Dad,

644
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,920
if Great Jing is in jeopardy,

645
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,350
will you brave all dangers

646
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,710
to protect the country?

647
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,160
This is my obligation.

648
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,100
I'll resolutely fulfill my duty.

649
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,720
That's enough.

650
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,680
Yiting,

651
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,510
what about you?

652
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,530
Will you do it too?

653
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,310
No need to give me lectures on morals.

654
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,110
I will go

655
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,350
wherever you go.

656
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,160
Madam,

657
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,540
what about you?

658
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,240
M-Me?

659
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,700
I...

660
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:28,880
I...

661
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,200
I'm gutless and afraid of death.

662
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,240
I'm weak and...

663
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,090
You show great strength

664
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,480
when you hit me.

665
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,070
Can...

666
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,350
can that be the same thing?

667
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:35,960
Cut it out.

668
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:36,830
Tsk.

669
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,850
What about you guys?

670
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,720
It's okay.

671
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,600
If you are afraid,

672
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,830
you may leave now.

673
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,790
I won't force you to stay.

674
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,880
Let's go!

675
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,110
They...

676
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,310
They really left?

677
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,370
There are only the four of us now.

678
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,280
Nonetheless,

679
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,480
every new helper

680
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,270
represents new hope.

681
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,350
Right?

682
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,160
Your Highness!

683
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,020
Your Highness!

684
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,540
Your Highness, we'll all go with you.

685
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,400
I'll make those who dare to hurt

686
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,680
the Song family pay a price!

687
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,270
This

688
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,070
can't move fast.

689
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,530
I'll go get some more rods.

690
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,740
Where did you get all these?

691
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,880
They were lying around
