1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sword is heavy.

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the deep roots of the enemy.

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,800
It's not as good as the dust.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am willing to be a beast.

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
I am willing to be a beast.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
A heart is not a sword.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
The four seas are in harmony.

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
No need to wait.

10
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
No need to hate.

11
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Write a poem for myself.

12
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
For all that I have.

13
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,800
I will write a poem with my love.

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
The wind blows.

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
I am not good at fighting.

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
I don't regret my youth.

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,800
I will be a man of my word.

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,800
For this life and for all that I have.

19
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
I will give my all.

20
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
The Legend of Chusen

21
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Episode 16

22
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
The battle of Pingrong.

23
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
The country is in danger.

24
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Gao Chang Yin and his party

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
are all dead.

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
They are all dead.

27
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,800
Ten thousand soldiers are all dead.

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
They are all dead.

29
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
They are all dead.

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,800
All the officials are dead.

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
They are all dead.

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
They are all dead.

33
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,800
I am lucky to be in the seven-day summer.

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Your Highness, you have come to send me off.

35
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Is the Imperial Consort all right?

36
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,800
The Yus said that she fainted when she heard about me.

37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Before I came here, I was in a bad mood.

38
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
I was very worried.

39
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
I was worried about you.

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
I was worried about you.

41
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
I was worried about you.

42
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Before I came here, I went to visit the Imperial Consort.

43
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
She was just a little stimulated.

44
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
She should be kept safe.

45
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
She is fine.

46
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
That's good.

47
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,800
The person I feel most guilty about in this life is her.

48
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,800
She is young and weak.

49
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
I should have been her brother

50
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
to take care of her.

51
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,800
But for the honor of the Gao family,

52
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
I let her enter the palace.

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,800
She has been suffering all her life.

54
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
These years, Uncle

55
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,800
has done a good thing for my mother.

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Your Highness, you hate me, don't you?

57
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
I hate you because of your streets

58
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
and crashed other people like you.

59
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Do not blame yourself if you don't have your future.

60
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
It is your own fault.

61
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
It's all because of our kindergartens

62
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,800
because of their family and children.

63
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
This time, I should know

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
all the pains and wounds

65
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
that my stories were.

66
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
But I can't tell you

67
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
until the Sentry明命

68
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,120
I won't live like what you want.

69
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,120
But I promise you

70
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,920
I'll become a strong man

71
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,440
to protect my mother

72
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,120
and the Gao family.

73
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,720
Please rest assured.

74
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,440
Go!

75
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,080
Money!

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
Go back

77
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,240
to the hall of papacy now!

78
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

79
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,680
Hurry up and leave.

80
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,240
The fire is cmoth

81
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,980
onic

82
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,220
By claiming Deity's gold on board

83
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,400
in order to go quickly and stop Yu Long from death

84
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,960
I will never regret

85
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,980
and I will pass on my life

86
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,520
Go to your room

87
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,940
Father's love

88
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,340
Chu Gui Hong's companionship

89
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,380
are almost turn after turning

90
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,960
Give them your heart

91
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,960
is to give them the right to hurt you.

92
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
Without them,

93
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Heng can also become a strong man.

94
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,960
Use your sword to fight

95
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,960
to fight for your future.

96
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,960
In this world,

97
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,960
only my mother and uncle are really good to me.

98
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,960
I must become a strong person.

99
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,960
Protect my mother and protect the Gao family.

100
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,960
I'm here to fight for the sake of my life.

101
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,960
I must be a strong man.

102
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
In the battle of Pingrong,

103
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,960
the evil Gao Changying is a sinner.

104
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,960
He was assassinated for no reason and has already given up.

105
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,960
However, when I see the twenty thousand yu yin-ling,

106
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,960
I feel that I have done a great service.

107
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,960
I must be a strong person.

108
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,960
I must be a strong man.

109
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,960
I am the old emperor.

110
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,960
I know that I have done a great service.

111
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,960
The emperor has been sealed and buried.

112
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,960
I will put out the lantern in the city today.

113
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,960
I announce that Li Shu is going to be a yin-ling.

114
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,960
All the people in the capital can go.

115
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
Remember your love.

116
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Your love.

117
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,960
Minister Wang,

118
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,960
you can rest in peace.

119
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
Father,

120
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,960
I have killed your enemies.

121
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,960
I have no more Pingrong.

122
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
I will be with you.

123
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,960
I will protect the mountain for the sake of the Jin Dynasty.

124
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Don't worry.

125
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,960
Great to serve your father.

126
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,960
Get rid of the vicious root of the rot.

127
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,440
Remember,

128
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,080
remember cute little drives cover be smart,

129
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,820
And don't be a liar,

130
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,140
we should help the fatal PHятьDAR seva get rid.

131
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,180
I will give them...

132
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,720
I will have them.

133
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,380
I will help the fatal PH outta my sight.

134
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,060
Rest easy,

135
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,060
Gao Changying is Gao Changying,

136
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,060
and you are you.

137
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,060
Even if there is a mistake in the surveillance,

138
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,060
you have already cleared their wrongs.

139
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,060
This world's fishbowl

140
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,060
shouldn't have trapped you.

141
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,060
I understand all of this.

142
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,060
But this matter

143
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,060
really started because of me.

144
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,060
You are using this kind of

145
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,060
scheming to deceive the world

146
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,060
and the world.

147
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,060
Chu Guihong,

148
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,060
the case is cleared.

149
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,060
What else do you want to do?

150
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,060
What do I want to do?

151
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,060
I want the guilty to pay the price.

152
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,060
Are you blind?

153
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,060
The guilty has been caught.

154
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,060
Why are you still not letting go?

155
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,060
There is a kind of fire in the grasslands.

156
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,060
You are a wolf.

157
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,060
Every time you attack the sheep,

158
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,060
you have to

159
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,060
throw the sheep's bones

160
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,060
at the door of the dog house.

161
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,060
But the wolf

162
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,060
has to hide in the dark

163
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,060
and watch the dog being killed by the owner.

164
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,060
I am not a wolf.

165
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,060
My uncle is not a dog.

166
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,060
What I want to do now

167
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,060
is just to make up for it.

168
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,060
You killed your own family.

169
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,060
You should be guilty.

170
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,060
You dare to say that you are making up for it.

171
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,060
What are you making up for?

172
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,060
What do you want me to do?

173
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,060
I want my father to stand here.

174
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,060
I want the 20,000 Qianyu Army

175
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,060
to come back alive.

176
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,060
I want you to die.

177
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,060
Can you do this?

178
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,060
Chu Gui Hong,

179
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,060
I don't want to explain it to you anymore.

180
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,060
My uncle owes you

181
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,060
20,000 Qianyu Army.

182
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,060
I will definitely

183
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,060
give you an explanation on behalf of the Gao family.

184
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,060
Nan Hao, don't do anything stupid.

185
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,060
Do you think I will forgive you

186
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,060
for your fake actions?

187
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,060
Nan Hao, listen to me.

188
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,060
No matter what you do,

189
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,060
you will be the one

190
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,060
who is the enemy

191
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,060
between us.

192
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,060
Jin Xiang,

193
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,060
do you think those who died

194
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,060
can really receive these lanterns?

195
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,060
When I was young,

196
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,060
I always put lanterns.

197
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,060
At that time,

198
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,060
I was hoping that the spirit of my mother

199
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,060
could bless me to be able to live in peace.

200
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,060
But every time, I was not very smart.

201
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,060
I was always angry at that time.

202
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,060
But now that I think about it,

203
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,060
I am quite lucky.

204
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,060
Hmm.

205
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,060
Hmm.

206
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,060
I still think Qi is the right person to sit in this position.

207
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,700
No, I know I let you down.

208
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,500
But you can't cheat us, can you?

209
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,060
Ji Xiang, I'm telling you.

210
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,260
A prince has his own way of life.

211
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,380
You can't be too careful with your salary.

212
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,860
Qi doesn't give me anything.

213
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,660
I beg him, I scold him.

214
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,260
He doesn't need to give me anything.

215
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,660
He's just...

216
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:43,060
If you didn't become the chief of the imperial family,

217
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,860
would you still follow me?

218
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,060
Your Highness, the chief of the imperial family is a eunuch.

219
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,060
I'm not a eunuch.

220
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,260
Ji Xiang, Ji Xiang.

221
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,260
I'm telling you, he...

222
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,660
Anyway,

223
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,060
put it down.

224
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,060
Ji Xiang, how many do you want? I'll pay you.

225
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,060
Ten. If ten isn't enough, we'll have fifteen.

226
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,460
Fifteen isn't enough, let's have fifty.

227
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,660
No need, I don't have any relatives.

228
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,060
Then you said you worshiped the Lord of the Thousand Jade Mountains.

229
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,260
At least you should put down a hundred.

230
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,060
No need, I don't know him.

231
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,460
Why are you so annoying?

232
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,660
I know.

233
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,660
You can put down one for me.

234
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,460
Right? Write some lettering.

235
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,060
I'm usually embarrassed to write it.

236
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,460
I'm sorry, I'm expressing it. You can write it.

237
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,860
Don't go.

238
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,460
I'm not done yet.

239
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,460
Ji Xiang.

240
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,860
Look at you. Why are you so shy?

241
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,060
Slow down, wait for me.

242
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,260
Look at you, you're so stubborn.

243
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,860
Ji Xiang.

244
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,060
Enough.

245
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,060
You can't even handle your own feelings.

246
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,860
Don't give me lessons here.

247
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,660
If you have time to nag,

248
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,260
it's better to go to A-Ting's place and do some painting with her.

249
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,260
I'm not giving you lessons.

250
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,260
I'm doing it for myself.

251
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,060
Which one of these two looks good?

252
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,860
Think about it. The Chief is about to leave.

253
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,660
I finally got a job and it's gone.

254
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,260
You're so stubborn.

255
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,260
You're a master of the Jade Palace. What job do you have?

256
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,460
Besides, it's good that it's gone.

257
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,460
A-Ting is still waiting for you.

258
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,060
We're from a rich family.

259
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,660
After getting this job, I'm so angry.

260
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,060
Let me tell you.

261
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,660
You should at least work less for 20 years.

262
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,660
Isn't eating soft food good for your health?

263
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,860
As the saying goes,

264
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,660
cutting one's wealth is like killing one.

265
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,860
So Miss Song,

266
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,860
you've saved me once.

267
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,660
Saving me once again is what you call meritless.

268
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,260
Don't worry, Brother Shangguan.

269
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,660
The sky will fall and your Chief won't be able to leave.

270
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,460
The plot is here.

271
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,060
No one can escape.

272
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,460
Also,

273
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,460
selling silk clothes is useless here.

274
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,860
Stop doing this.

275
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,660
Which one looks good?

276
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,460
The blue one. The white one with the white skin.

277
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,060
Your Majesty,

278
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,060
the Black Armor Army's record is here.

279
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,260
There are 23,600 people.

280
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,060
The county has already handed over the army's army supplies.

281
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,660
This is the Fire Talisman,

282
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,060
returned to Your Majesty.

283
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,660
Get up and talk.

284
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,660
The death of the Empress has nothing to do with you.

285
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,260
Huh?

286
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,460
Yes.

287
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:04,060
You didn't mean to take her that way.

288
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,260
Yes.

289
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,260
Why didn't you explain all these years?

290
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,060
I've explained it. When I was young...

291
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,460
I know my mistake.

292
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:32,060
Forget it. I know that you've always hated me.

293
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,660
I dare not.

294
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,860
Take the Fire Talisman first.

295
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,660
That day,

296
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,260
you and I conspired to co-organize and set up a bait for Gao Changying.

297
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:05,060
We promised that if we failed, we'd return the military power.

298
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,740
Now that we've succeeded,

299
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,060
Gao Changying will be able to get out.

300
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,460
I now promise you

301
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,060
that this time,

302
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,020
I promise you

303
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,100
that this matter will stop here

304
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,980
and will not be investigated anymore.

305
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

306
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,820
But I'm not afraid of your responsibility.

307
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,940
I've figured it out.

308
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,300
What have you figured out?

309
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,700
My uncle

310
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,820
was a criminal

311
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,780
who committed a grave crime.

312
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,780
All this

313
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,660
is because of his greed for power.

314
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,700
I'm one of them.

315
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,780
I can't get my hands clean.

316
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,060
So I

317
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,140
naturally have no right

318
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,140
to go after something that doesn't belong to me.

319
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,820
You mean

320
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,180
you want to return to the field without a armor

321
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,940
and don't want to work anymore?

322
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,140
You want to blame yourself,

323
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,660
then go back to your prince's mansion to blame yourself.

324
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,780
Stop making a fool of me here.

325
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,300
Let me tell you the truth.

326
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,020
I won't just let you go,

327
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,700
but I'll also give you this.

328
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,100
Open your eyes and look carefully.

329
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,020
Li Chu.

330
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,460
Your Majesty.

331
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,500
Rui-er saw me last night.

332
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:54,140
He said that

333
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,500
he is far better than your intelligence

334
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,020
in studies of art and martial arts.

335
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,660
In studies of art and martial arts.

336
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:56,820
OK.

337
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,620
He also said that

338
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,500
he was cruelly

339
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:02,780
incited to embezzle sizi car transporting.

340
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,060
But you

341
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,540
have never been 미안othκα.

342
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,220
Mr. Jiang Zutong

343
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,460
You have been demoted for years

344
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,660
in the Jiangnan case.

345
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,420
Today,

346
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,220
I will confer you as the crown prince.

347
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,900
Your Majesty.

348
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,140
I am a god of death.

349
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,540
I should not be exiled.

350
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,900
18th brother,

351
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,620
the new emperor,

352
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,060
will be the emperor.

353
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,900
The emperor?

354
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,260
Can Rui Er, the stupid head,

355
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,140
take the responsibility of governing the country?

356
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,500
If you really want to atone for the Gao family's sins,

357
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,300
you should not hand over the military power.

358
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,500
Your sin

359
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,700
should not be atoned for by me.

360
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,460
It should be atoned for the Great Jin

361
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,300
and the world.

362
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,100
Get up.

363
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,620
Take these things

364
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:11,820
and get out.

365
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,180
I will take my leave.

366
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,140
You like Song Yi Meng, right?

367
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,420
Your Majesty,

368
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,140
I like Song Yi Meng.

369
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,460
I will leave.

370
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,380
You will have the honor

371
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,420
of being reviewed sexual pleasure by Your Majesty.

372
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,660
Then I'll주세요

373
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,940
to your kindness.

374
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,340
Mentor Xu.

375
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,260
received the letter,

376
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,900
Just now,

377
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,500
spelled it out

378
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,620
the principle

379
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,100
as well as the neighborhoods.

380
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,380
Now let's enjoy this moment

381
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,780
as we become friends

382
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:11,940
Please

383
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,660
Yes

384
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,100
I...

385
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,100
Are you waiting for me?

386
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,980
No.

387
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,860
Since you said so,

388
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,980
I'll just wait for you.

389
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,220
What's up?

390
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,780
I...

391
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,060
I...

392
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,100
I...

393
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,580
Qi,

394
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,780
I want to apologize to you.

395
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,660
I've been wronged for so many years.

396
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,660
I shouldn't have misunderstood you killing my mother.

397
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,660
I shouldn't have treated you so rudely.

398
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,460
If you don't vent your anger,

399
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,540
I can give you my house,

400
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,540
Yu Qilin,

401
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,220
and the pearl that father gave me.

402
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,220
No.

403
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,780
Is... Is it not enough?

404
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,380
You don't want the auspicious incense, do you?

405
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,380
No, no, no.

406
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,380
I can give you anything else.

407
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,780
You must keep the auspicious incense.

408
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,780
I mean you don't have to give me this.

409
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,740
Your mother died because of Gao Jian.

410
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,740
It's reasonable for you to vent your anger on me.

411
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,220
I knew it.

412
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,940
You're the Crown Prince.

413
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,220
It's the most appropriate.

414
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,620
Come on.

415
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,340
Let me ask you.

416
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,540
Why did you give up the position of Crown Prince?

417
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,220
Besides, you have the heart of a son.

418
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,220
You'll be good to the people in the future.

419
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,740
The heart of a son?

420
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:40,220
But only the heart of a son is enough.

421
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,220
Do you think it's enough for me?

422
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,220
Qi, let me tell you the truth.

423
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,220
Although I'm a man of the heaven,

424
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,220
I'm also very good.

425
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,220
But I'm not the son of the Crown Prince.

426
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,220
In addition to the heart of humanity,

427
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,220
the Crown Prince must have a head that can fight against the rebels

428
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,220
and protect the heads of our people.

429
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,220
Do I have this?

430
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,220
Obviously I don't, right?

431
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,220
But you're different.

432
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,220
For so many years,

433
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,220
I, the father, and my cousin,

434
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,220
we all need to find a way out for my mother's death.

435
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,220
And you are the only way out.

436
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,220
We hate you and target you.

437
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,220
But you can still take the responsibility

438
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,220
and make the world a better place.

439
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,220
Such a person

440
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,220
is the best person for our country.

441
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,220
All right.

442
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,220
Actually, sometimes,

443
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,220
I really don't understand your smart ideas.

444
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,220
You always think about it.

445
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,220
But you still rely on us to solve it.

446
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,220
You're not a fool.

447
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,220
You're the Crown Prince of Jin.

448
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,220
If someone dares to call you a fool,

449
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,220
I won't forgive him.

450
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,220
Qi...

451
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,220
Wanqi, can I discuss something with you?

452
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,220
Go ahead.

453
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,220
Although I was in a bad mood just now,

454
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,220
but can I still call you Qi after a while?

455
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,220
I always feel that I'm a little sorry for my cousin

456
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,220
for calling you Qi now.

457
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,220
Of course you can.

458
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,220
Really?

459
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,220
That friend is good.

460
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,220
That's great.

461
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,220
Okay.

462
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,220
Come on, Qi.

463
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,220
Come on.

464
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,220
Come on.

465
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,220
Come on.

466
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,220
Cousin, I'm relieved to hear that.

467
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,220
Our cousin and Qi Xin are on the same side.

468
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,220
Even if we have ten more difficulties,

469
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,220
we're definitely not our opponents.

470
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,220
Right?

471
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,220
Brother Qi Xin.

472
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,220
We're not our opponents.

473
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,220
But now...

474
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,220
We've changed.

475
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,220
What can we keep?

476
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,220
Fine.

477
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,220
We have to move forward.

478
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,220
As long as Nanhe can accept the punishment,

479
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,220
the rest is not important.

480
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,220
General, the imperial edict has been issued.

481
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,220
You mean, the boss is going to be the crown prince?

482
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,220
Song Yun Meng is right.

483
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,220
Of course.

484
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,220
Old Yan, Old Huang,

485
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,220
prepare some hard dishes.

486
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,220
Let's celebrate it today.

487
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,220
Yes.

488
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,220
I still don't understand.

489
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,220
What does the boss have to do with us

490
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,220
when he becomes the crown prince?

491
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,220
What's the use of your head?

492
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,220
Think about it.

493
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,220
Who is the crown prince?

494
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,220
The crown prince is the second most respected person in the world.

495
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,220
In the past, our Ye You God was still a man of the martial arts world.

496
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,220
I'm a man of martial arts.

497
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,220
I've seen the Qianyu Army,

498
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,220
they all have to bow their heads.

499
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,220
But in the future...

500
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,220
In the future?

501
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,220
In the future, we have to compete.

502
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,220
At least, bow your head half.

503
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,220
Get up.

504
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,220
What do you mean by making these military uniforms?

505
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,220
As the most useful person around the crown prince,

506
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,220
I must share the burden of the master.

507
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,220
Now, the crown prince is already the crown prince.

508
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,220
It's not suitable for these people to be around him.

509
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,220
How about this?

510
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,220
I'll take you to the home of my Black Armor Army.

511
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,220
For the sake of past relationships,

512
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,220
you can start from the lowest level of the Fire-Head Army.

513
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,220
Lord Fugui,

514
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,220
if you haven't slept enough,

515
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,220
you can sleep more.

516
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,220
You can have everything in your dreams.

517
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,220
In terms of intelligence,

518
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,220
you're not enough to join our Ye You God.

519
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,220
I'm the second boss of the Cangjiang Yue.

520
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,220
Why should I join the Black Armor Army?

521
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,220
What the Black Armor Army needs

522
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:00,220
is a valuable person like A'Long and A'Hu.

523
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,220
As for you...

524
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,220
You mean I'm not worthy?

525
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,220
You're not.

526
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,220
I'm not.

527
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,220
You mean

528
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,220
the boss needs you more?

529
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,220
I'm leaving.

530
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,220
Stop.

531
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,220
Come back.

532
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,220
Put it down.

533
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,220
Sister-in-law,

534
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,220
you've been fighting for so long.

535
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,220
It's time for you to make up.

536
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,220
Brother-in-law,

537
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,220
before you talk about others,

538
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,220
think about yourself first.

539
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,220
When can I drink the wedding wine

540
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,220
you and Ting are drinking?

541
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,220
If it's not an accident,

542
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,220
it'll be next month.

543
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,220
When did I say I'm getting married?

544
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,220
After you and His Highness get married.

545
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,220
When did I say I'm getting married again?

546
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,220
You're about to get married.

547
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,220
Stop being so affectionate.

548
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,220
The imperial decree of the Crown Prince has been issued.

549
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,220
Will you still be together after you get married?

550
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,220
Ting Heng.

551
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,220
I'll leave now.

552
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,220
I love you.

553
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,220
owing to start.

554
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:37,020
Your connectors aren't connected.

555
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,220
Eat with me

556
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,580
Your Royal Highness

557
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,180
You don't want to receive the imperial edict

558
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,580
Is it because of Miss Song?

559
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,940
Where did you say that?

560
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,220
This Miss Song

561
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,940
Always thinks that the emperor is a bad person

562
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,260
And the emperor

563
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,900
The emperor has always wanted to prove that he is a good person

564
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,140
For this reason, the emperor took the lead

565
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,620
Find out the truth and get the tiger's talisman

566
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,380
And now

567
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,380
It's time for the emperor to continue to perform a gentlemanly style

568
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,260
The best time to play the crown prince

569
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,140
I was wrong again

570
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,860
I didn't let you and Gao Dang go together

571
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,540
I was wrong

572
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,300
Your Royal Highness

573
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,100
Your Royal Highness

574
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,860
A letter from Shangguan

575
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,740
Something bad happened, Chief

576
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,060
So Meng Tai is leaving again

577
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,000
Where is Gaoilia

578
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,860
written

579
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,140
A letter from Matchmaker

580
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:22,980
A тво

581
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,300
Ding Ochie

582
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,980
I think Brother Ling is too hard

583
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,620
Jiang Huai

584
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,260
Worse

585
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,020
who is Jin Yan

586
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,700
Gang可能

587
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,260
Gang and After dream

588
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:36,940
od

589
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,740
Jingte

590
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,620
who are you?

591
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,580
Why is her question so familiar?

592
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,660
No

593
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,700
The point is the kind of person that I love

594
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,660
The point is

595
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,540
I'd want to know what kind of life she's living

596
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,580
is there no mistake?

597
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,780
You want know what?

598
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,380
Watch my videos

599
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,260
I'm not interested.

600
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,460
How is that possible?

601
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,060
Qingying, you're thinking too much.

602
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,060
This place is where I...

603
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,460
This...

604
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,460
Second Miss, Second Young Master.

605
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,860
Why is my painting here?

606
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,860
I'm thinking that I'm leaving.

607
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,060
Before I leave,

608
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,260
I'll help you two to start a relationship.

609
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,860
Second Miss!

610
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,260
Second Young Master!

611
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,460
A'Long, Door only.

612
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,660
A'Long, Door only.

613
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,260
I'm here.

614
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,060
Let's put down your work.

615
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,220
I've been following you for so long.

616
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:10,980
I'm not a fool.

617
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,180
I don't want to let others know.

618
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,380
I'll help you.

619
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,740
Miss.

620
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:16,860
Miss.

621
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,580
Bad news.

622
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,380
Cang Jiangyue.

623
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,780
Cang Jiangyue is in trouble.

624
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,940
The Seventh Prince is going to be the Crown Prince.

625
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,460
He said he would disperse the Night God

626
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,820
and release Cang Jiangyue.

627
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,420
Miss.

628
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,780
Go and have a look.

629
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,820
I'll go and have a look.

630
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,580
Wait.

631
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,100
Miss.

632
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,300
Miss.

633
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,020
Mr. Shangguan

634
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,220
just gave you a lecture.

635
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,980
The Seventh Prince

636
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,380
is going to disperse the Night God.

637
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,220
It sounds strange.

638
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,620
Is it a trap?

639
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,060
Tell me.

640
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,020
What trap?

641
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,860
Miss, think about it.

642
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,460
According to the general situation of the script,

643
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,980
the relationship between you and Mr. Shangguan

644
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,980
is blocked.

645
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,660
There must be a midwife to help.

646
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,860
According to the situation of the people around the Seventh Prince,

647
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,500
they won't deliberately lead you to Cang Jiangyue, right?

648
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,220
It makes sense.

649
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,220
But

650
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,300
when did you become so smart?

651
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,780
Who let you

652
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,580
talk about the script every day?

653
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,140
I'm so talented.

654
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,620
I even heard some literature.

655
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,260
So, are we going to Cang Jiangyue or not?

656
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,660
I'm begging you.

657
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,540
If you lend me 800 taels,

658
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,620
I'll promise you everything.

659
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,100
Even marriage.

660
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,900
When there is no matter, there is no rush.

661
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,700
You come to beg me like this when there is a matter.

662
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,020
What?

663
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,900
Am I a woman who can talk well?

664
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,420
I...

665
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,740
How dare I miss you so much?

666
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,940
In your heart,

667
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,900
I'm a woman who can't communicate.

668
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,900
It seems that

669
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,260
the more I meet, the more troublesome it is.

670
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,460
Stop.

671
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,500
For so long,

672
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,140
I haven't put my love on your mouth.

673
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,780
But those words that I haven't said

674
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,100
are in my heart.

675
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,860
To marry you,

676
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,020
I have to have a serious life.

677
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,260
Otherwise, I'll take the honor

678
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,380
to see your parents.

679
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,420
If Cang Jiangyue is gone,

680
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,540
I'll still be the one

681
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,820
who is the best in the world.

682
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,260
But I'm living such a hard life.

683
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,580
I can't bear to let you go.

684
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,540
That's it.

685
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,580
I know

686
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,540
I've always been cold to you.

687
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,700
But if it weren't because I really like you,

688
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,220
I'm a useless person.

689
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,460
How can I endure the hard practice

690
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,460
of talking for so long?

691
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,580
It's true that Cang Jiangyue is in trouble.

692
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,940
But I can't bear to part with you.

693
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,940
You're the one who I can't bear to part with.

694
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,980
It's true that

695
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,620
I can't bear to part with you.

696
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,500
It's good to say that I'm weak.

697
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,140
It's okay to be timid.

698
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,620
But now I've opened this mouth.

699
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:23,900
One, two, one, two, one, two.

700
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,820
One, two, one, two, one, two.

701
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,500
Go.

702
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,380
One, two, one, two, one, two.

703
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,580
Didn't you say you were going to act?

704
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,460
Why are you still calling it kissing?

705
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,620
What's wrong with kissing?

706
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,540
It's not up to you

707
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,260
to decide how to act.

708
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,860
You've said so many

709
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,340
annoying words just now.

710
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,540
You must pay back the debt you owe.

711
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,140
I only used two or three points of strength just now.

712
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,300
You can't bear it.

713
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,660
What a hero.

714
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,900
It's just like that.

715
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,700
Wait.

716
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,540
Come on.

717
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,380
What should we do?

718
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,940
Boss doesn't want us.

719
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,780
Where can we go?

720
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,420
Who can save us?

721
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,140
Boss doesn't want us.

722
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,780
Where can we go?

723
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,940
Who can save us?

724
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,620
Boss, it's too hard.

725
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,420
Hu.

726
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,540
Sister-in-law.

727
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,180
Sister-in-law, you're finally here.

728
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,980
Please help us.

729
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,500
Boss insists on kicking us out.

730
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,700
You said you kicked us out.

731
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,060
Where can we go?

732
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,500
Right, brothers?

733
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,260
Right.

734
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,340
Where is he?

735
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,140
There.

736
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,220
You're here.

737
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,220
You're here.

738
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,220
You're here.

739
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,220
You're here.

740
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,220
You're here.

741
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,220
You're here.

742
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,220
You're here.

743
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,220
You're here.

744
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,220
You're here.

745
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,220
You're here.

746
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,220
You're here.

747
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,220
You're here.

748
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,220
