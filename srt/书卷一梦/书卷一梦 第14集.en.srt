[Episode 14]

3
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,400
Father.

4
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,000
How did you get this?

5
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,610
What happened to your face?

6
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,650
It's nothing, just a small scratch.

7
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,940
Where did you get this note from?

8
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,590
You recognize this?

9
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,030
There's a secret rumor going around

10
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,550
that this is

11
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,540
a formula for weapon forging.

12
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,210
This is actually a pun that means

13
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,480
your "beauty"

14
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,220
stole my "heart."

15
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,130
Father,

16
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,250
this is just a cheesy pickup line

17
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,590
that has nothing to do
with weapon forging.

18
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,710
You still haven't answered me—

19
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,770
How did you

20
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,960
get this note?

21
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:46,790
Not important.

22
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,840
Didn't you just mention

23
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,760
pickup lines?

24
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,280
If you can recognize them,

25
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,430
it means you're of marriageable age.

26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,520
Black tea or green tea?

27
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,180
Stop beating around the bush.

28
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,400
What exactly

29
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,810
do you want to discuss about marriage?

30
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,030
Recently in the capital,

31
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,680
rumors about you and the Seventh Prince

32
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,550
have been spreading wildly.

33
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,240
It hurts both you
and the Song family.

34
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,980
That Chu Guihong

35
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,950
is almost 30.

36
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,230
And you, a young lady,

37
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,800
are already 24,

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,870
no longer a child.

39
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,079
As your father, I think

40
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,460
it's time to fulfill
your marriage agreement.

41
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,800
I swear, everyone in this drama

42
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,280
has nothing better to do

43
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,079
than push romance plots.

44
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,190
Father.

45
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,470
Chu Guihong and I

46
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,240
have only known each other for days,

47
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,030
with zero connection.

48
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,080
You've to

49
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,430
nurture it gradually
by experiencing things

50
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,240
together.

51
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,190
I'm just worried that

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,280
if the court ever becomes chaotic,

53
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,920
there will be no one to protect you.

54
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,640
My darling daughter—

55
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,070
Enough already.

56
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,830
Stop with the theatrics

57
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,030
and tell me straight.

58
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,070
Why are you suddenly

59
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,870
insisting on the marriage?

60
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,540
Yimeng, oh Yimeng.

61
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,180
Rumors are spreading about you
and the Seventh Prince.

62
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,870
If it were someone else,

63
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,240
I might consider it.

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,040
But he's no ordinary man's son.

65
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,310
Someone who grew up

66
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,240
struggling in the cold palace,

67
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,800
he has developed such a heart of stone,

68
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,510
the nature of a wolf.

69
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,000
For him,

70
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,480
self-preservation always comes first.

71
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,560
All those sweet words
and tender affection

72
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,060
that come with romance

73
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,190
are merely

74
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,820
manipulable pawns at his disposal.

75
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,100
Treasured when needed

76
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,170
and discarded like worn-out shoes.

77
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,070
He approaches you strategically,

78
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,330
plotting against you.

79
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,270
I don't trust anyone

80
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,120
because no one has ever trusted me,

81
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,430
not even you!

82
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,510
You should know

83
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,830
that things are

84
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,480
not what they appear to be on the surface.

85
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,030
What people say isn't
necessarily the truth.

86
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,060
If

87
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
you truly want to understand me,

88
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,480
don't use your eyes.

89
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,480
Use this.

90
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,460
I'm just worried that the longer we wait,

91
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,090
the more likely
he'll take advantage of you.

92
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,630
Of course I know
Nan Heng isn't a good person,

93
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,000
but I can't sacrifice

94
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,720
Chu Guihong's happiness
just to save myself.

95
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,930
Alright, alright.

96
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,870
I may be old

97
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,920
and don't understand you youngsters,

98
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,430
but I can't stand by and watch

99
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,690
you jump into the fire.

100
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,600
At the musical banquet,

101
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,030
try to build a connection
with Chu Guihong.

102
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,160
In the coming days,

103
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,560
I'll personally go
to the prince's residence

104
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,020
to discuss your marriage.

105
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,070
It's settled.

106
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,230
Father!

107
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,720
I didn't say yes!

108
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,630
It's not up to you.

109
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,310
She's getting married?

110
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,190
I'm sure!

111
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,630
I saw it with my own eyes.

112
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,680
After court, Mr. Song and Chu Guihong

113
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,330
were all smiles.

114
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,630
Today I give you gifts;

115
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,020
tomorrow you return the favor.

116
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,720
At one point, they even
addressed each other

117
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,650
as father-in-law and son-in-law.

118
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,510
The wedding must be soon.

119
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,390
Song Yude must be hastening

120
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,450
that old marriage arrangement again

121
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,390
so he wouldn't have to

122
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,680
join under my command.

123
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,120
And that Song Yimeng,

124
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,190
does she think she can escape me

125
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,650
by relying on Chu Guihong?

126
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,680
Song Yude is my father.

127
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,100
Chu Guihong is my fiancé.

128
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,490
Isn't that enough?

129
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,120
Do you already have a plan?

130
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,440
The musical banquet
is the perfect opportunity.

131
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,270
I'll humiliate Chu Guihong

132
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,240
in front of all the capital's elites.

133
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,100
By then, let's see if

134
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,510
Song Yimeng still has
any desire to marry him.

135

[Musical Banquet]

136
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,950
Why did the Seventh Prince
choose such a place?

137
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,720
The southern district has always been home
to the lowest classes,

138
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,230
way beneath our status.

139
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,410
Waning River Crescent

140
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,940
is renowned in the capital.

141
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,040
Since we're here,
let's make the best of it.

142
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,370
I think it's quite nice.

143
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,070
Today is a big day
for the Seventh Prince

144
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,120
and our Xuanjia Army.

145
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,630
Today is a big day
for Waning River Crescent

146
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,510
and us Nightwalkers too.

147
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,210
In the past, we dominated the battlefield,

148
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,920
guarding the borders
against powerful enemies.

149
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,650
In the past, we stood united,
commanding respect

150
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,600
throughout the martial world.

151
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,630
Today, for His Highness,

152
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,720
we must make this banquet a success

153
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,110
and connect with renowned figures
from all over!

154
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,909
Today, we must

155
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,840
host this banquet well for our Chief,
and establish our dominance

156
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,440
among the capital's guilds.

157
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,120
For His Highness to connect
with renowned figures!

158
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,669
For our Chief to dominate
the capital's guilds!

159
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:45,530
For His Highness to connect
with renowned figures!

160
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,260
For our Chief to dominate
the capital's guilds!

161
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,200
Isn't this Mr. Shangguan
from Waning River Crescent?

162
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,600
What a unique way of
managing your subordinates.

163
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,120
I'm just working for the Chief Master,

164
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,220
nothing worth mentioning.

165
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,200
But I must say,

166
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,120
Mr. Fugui, you're usually so subservient

167
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,670
by Seventh Prince's side,
kneeling and kowtowing,

168
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,870
but you're actually quite commanding

169
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,510
in front of the Xuanjia Army.

170
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,080
It seems you've been paying
close attention to me.

171
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,510
Have we met before?

172
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,870
Don't be mistaken.

173
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,410
Unattractive things
don't leave an impression on me.

174
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,600
Well, well.

175
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:26,640
[Graceful and Composed]

176
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,200
Through changing seasons,
His Highness maintains his grand spirit.

177
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,200
As empires rise and fall, only
His Highness's vision remains constant.

178
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,000
-Yes.
-Indeed.

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,710
Talents gather from all corners,

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,860
embracing the world's brilliant minds.

181
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,480
Throughout history,
great generals and talents have emerged,

182
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,750
but none compare to
His Highness's unmatched elegance.

183
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,960
-Bootlicker.
-Bootlicker.

184
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,870
Cousin.

185
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,440
Cousin!

186
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,930
What's wrong with you?

187
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,910
Please don't call me Cousin.

188
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,710
I don't deserve it, truly don't.

189
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,440
I was confined for 20 days,

190
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,080
but you didn't come visit me once.

191
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,510
Am I still your family?

192
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,650
Your Highness.

193
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,440
I was busy renovating the south
with Yimeng

194
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,600
during those days.

195
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,200
I understand. I get it.

196
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,870
Gals before pals.

197
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,170
I wonder who it was

198
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,440
who accompanied you
to make trouble all his life,

199
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,270
who helped you fight battles,

200
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:19,840
and who...

201
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,970
You've got it wrong.

202
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
That's what General Chu did for you.

203
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,120
Is that so?

204
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,840
Chu Guihong!

205
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,840
Yimeng!

206
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,430
Your Highness, I was wrong about that.

207
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,630
I'm really sorry.

208
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,150
No need.

209
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,080
Listen,

210
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
principle matters the most as a prince.

211
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,500
We wouldn't need the capital prefect

212
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,960
if apologies were useful!

213
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,870
Also,

214
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm a mature adult

215
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,130
who's had my coming-of-age ceremony.

216
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,910
I'll never get upset

217
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,550
because you care more about women

218
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,720
than me.

219
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,320
It'd be so childish.

220
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,980
Extremely, thoroughly,
and utterly childish!

221
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,550
Like a three-year-old kid.

222
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,200
Watch your words.

223
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,840
Who are you calling a three-year-old?

224
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,570
How can you insult me like this?

225
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,200
Also, you and Father

226
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,910
both treat me

227
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,510
like a child who never grows up,

228
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,910
never consulting me on anything,

229
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,080
yet now suddenly expect me
to mature overnight.

230
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,600
You get to make all the arguments,

231
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,720
while all the faults are mine.

232
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,000
Is that fair? Is it?

233
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,370
Your Highness,

234
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,080
if you're truly upset,

235
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,480
let's find a private place

236
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,810
to clear everything up.

237
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,030
This will only make us a laughingstock.

238
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,860
What are you doing?

239
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,790
Mind your behavior!

240
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,240
Don't pull at me like that!

241
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
What would others think if they saw us?

242
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
Wait, I'm stepping on my robe.

243
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,910
I never noticed before

244
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,520
that those two are quite interesting.

245
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,520
But weren't you

246
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,750
planning to

247
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,950
clear things up with General Chu today?

248
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,510
The Eighteenth Prince was right—

249
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,440
You're the one he cares about most.

250
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,530
If he finds out you like Mr. Li,

251
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,720
won't he be heartbroken?

252
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,480
What can I do about it?

253
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,370
Feelings

254
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,000
can't be faked.

255
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,840
Better to come clean soon

256
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,510
so I don't waste his time.

257
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,840
Is everything in place?

258
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,890
Don't worry.

259
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,710
Everything is under control.

260
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,390
Chu Guihong will definitely

261
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,790
make a fool of himself
in front of Miss Song.

262
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,720
Come here.

263
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,170
Not you.

264
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,630
Come here!

265
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,280
Sorry,

266
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,320
but being popular with women

267
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,150
has nothing to do with rank.

268
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,390
Miss Song.

269
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,840
Come here!

270
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,210
Why are you hanging out with Nan Heng?

271
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,720
Don't you know how cunning

272
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,480
he is?

273
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,880
You'd better be careful.

274
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,120
Okay.

275
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,120
I don't see Mr. Li anywhere.

276
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,080
Where is he?

277
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,390
The Chief is on a mission.

278
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,320
If you have a message,

279
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,920
I'd be happy to pass it along.

280
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,790
Well, maybe this is better.

281
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,510
If Chu Guihong found out,

282
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,380
who knows what might happen.

283
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,580

The food here's good.

297

Why are you everywhere I go?

298
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,870
Didn't you know that I'm the host

299

of this banquet?

with Shangguan He?

302
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,700
Is that any of your business?

00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,000
What,

304
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,150
do you have a cold?

305
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,450
I'm just concerned about you.

306
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,120
Is the food to your liking?

just say so.

Song Yimeng.

312
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,970

Don't embarrass her.

What are you on about?

318
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,790
This must be from Chapter 16,

pours his heart out over wine

Are you sure?

324
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,240
It sounds more like the part where

325
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,790
the young general forces marriage

326
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,820
and breaks up the true lovers.

Of course I do—

No need for explanations.

Fine, whatever you say.

342
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,630
Seventh Prince, I disagree.

343
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,410
A rumor must be clarified.

344
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,970
Yimeng is my fiancée.

345
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,630
Regarding this novel,

346
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,290
I've been wanting to explain.

347
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,790
Since everyone is here,

348
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,120
I request Your Highness
to clarify this in person.

349
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,120
Neither of the involved parties
has spoken.

350
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,930
You're just an outsider. Why so anxious?

351
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,250
General Chu, aren't you
a bit too insecure?

352
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,190
Your Highness.

353
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,510
Yimeng and I've been engaged
since childhood.

354
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,120
You've repeatedly harassed her.

355
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,520
What exactly do you want?

356
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,840
What do I want?

357
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,720
Isn't it clear?

358
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,480
You—

359
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,200
Enough!

360
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,320
Will you two ever stop?

361
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,600
Fine, I'll take this opportunity

362
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,600
to make things clear today.

363
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,570
You and you!

364
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,670
I'm not interested in either of you.

365
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,270
What "Illusory Dream"
and "Exceptional Love"?

366
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,750
Utter nonsense!

367
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,670
From now on,

368
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,030
if anyone gossips behind my back again,

369
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,510
I won't be so polite.

370
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,270
Alright, stop staring.

371
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,600
Just eat your food!

00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,320
Your Majesty.

373
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,120

00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,630
have always been at odds,

377
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,840
yet she continues to get involved
with the Seventh Prince.

378
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,360
She's calculating and cannot be tolerated.

379
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,480
Your Majesty, I suggest issuing

380
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,480
an imperial decree right now

381
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,920
to severely punish her.

00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,329
Ladies and gentlemen,

386
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,000
this is the first year
Waning River Crescent

387
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,720
has hosted this banquet.

388

[Big Fortune]

389
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,720
I've been instructed to spice things up

390
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,790
for all our distinguished guests.

391
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,640
Legend has it that
the ancient kingdom of Rulan,

392
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,790
standing in the desert,

393
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,070
nurtured a Seven-Jewel Snow Lotus
within a mirage.

394
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,640
Later, skilled craftsmen
adorned it with fine gold.

395
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,970
Another iconic scene from period dramas:

396
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,590
people fighting over some treasure,

397
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,880
trying to trip each other up.

398
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,720
This hairpin shall be given
to a person of talent.

399
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,220
Bravo! Bravo!

400
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,590
Bravo! Bravo!

401
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,340
I've heard that

402
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,880
whenever the Qianyu Army
returns victorious,

403
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,400
they play their military anthem

404
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,640
to showcase their might to the world.

405
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,450
Unfortunately,

406
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,790
General Chu has suffered
consecutive defeats in recent years,

407
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,920
and we haven't heard
that anthem for a while.

408
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,130
I wonder if General Chu is in the mood

409
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,680
to bless us with the magnificent tune?

410
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,510
Heng.

411
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,680
Don't go too far!

412
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,640
As a prince of Great Jing,

413
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,920
is the defeat of Qianyu Army

414
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,320
something to be proud of?

415
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,180
At the Battle of Pingrong,

416
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,830
General Chu was defeated

417
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,510
and fled in panic.

418
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,560
If not for the Seventh Prince's
clever strategy

419
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,720
to rescue General Chu

420
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,350
from the Heyuan prisoner's cage,

421
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,270
the so-called war god of Great Jing

422
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,400
would now be nothing
but bones on the northern frontier.

423
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,450
Shut up!

424
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,350
Y-You're just a demoted official.

425

What do you know?

426
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,270
If you're so capable,
go fight them in Heyuan yourself!

427
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,030
Go on!

428
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,720
Eighteenth Prince,

429
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,480
you must be joking.

430
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,160
I am but a civil official.

431
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,030
Officials advise with words,
soldiers fight with weapons.

432
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,440
Don't you know this principle,
Your Highness?

433
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,070
What nonsense are you talking about?

434
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,590
After General Chu's defeat,

435
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,520
not only did he escape punishment,

436
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,680
but His Majesty favored him even more,

437
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,070
promoting him twice.

438
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,920
Naturally, many in court and beyond
are displeased.

439
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,680
Therefore,

440
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
I'm hosting this musical gathering

441
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,480
to help restore General Chu's morale.

442
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,770
Rui, I mean well.

443
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,060
You just...

444
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,530
For this musical banquet,

445
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,930
the Seventh Prince is the host,
and I'm merely a guest.

446
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,310
A guest shouldn't

447
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,130
steal the host's thunder.

448
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,880
Guihong is right.

449
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,540
Heng, as the host,

450
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,030
you should perform the opening piece.

451
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:43,980
Very well.

452
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,490
Look at that sinister look on his face.

453
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,850
I bet he is up to no good.

454
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,750
Everyone,

455
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,360
the opening piece for today's banquet

456
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,240
is really significant.

457
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,130
It's called

458
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,440
"Pingrong Battle:

Guihong,

462
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,050
isn't that Fugui?

463
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,720
Look at his crazy getup.
Who is he supposed to be?

464
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,850
Eighteenth Prince,

465
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,790
Fugui is portraying the person beside you,

466
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,680
the brave and mighty General Chu.

467
00:20:59,030 --> 00:20:59,830
Guihong,

468
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,310
why is Fugui dressed up like you?

469
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,070
Why did you make Fugui dress up

470
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,110
like Chu Guihong?

471
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,840
Aren't you deliberately
mocking Jing's war god?

472
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,750
I know nothing about this.

473
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,750
As if!

474
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,030

[Big Fortune]

477
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,790
This depicts General Chu
scouting the enemy camp at night.

478
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,770
Now the Heyuan forces are
surrounding the Qianyu Army.

479
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,190
He's been captured.

480
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,640
What a failure.

"Pingrong Battle:
Guihong Scouts the Camp"?

482
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,070
More like "Nan Heng Making a Scene
at the Musical Banquet."

483
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,480
Are you really a prince of Great Jing?

484
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,720
A noble prince of Great Jing

485
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,110
actually let his subordinates

486
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,640
humiliate the Qianyu Army.

487
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,120
Have you no shame?

488
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,050
Where are you going?

489
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,280
To beat the drum.

490
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,440
You know how to?

491
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,880
Sorry, just about two years' practice.

492

Seventh Prince.

493
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,080
What's going on with Fugui?

494
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,510
Fugui volunteered

495
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,960
to perform this scene.

496
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,240
I couldn't stop him.

497
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,650
I only want Chu Guihong humiliated,

498
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,630
not the Qianyu Army.

499
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,150
As the war drum sounds,

500
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,600

503
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,190
The drumbeat is all wrong.

504

How can we perform like this?

00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,000
Should I go explain it to him?

681
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,050
Would he believe you?

682
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,590
You're right.

683
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,200
Your reputation outside is terrible.

684
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,170
No, no, no, what I meant was...

685
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,890
um...

686
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,510
The "Pingrong Battle:
Guihong Scouts the Camp" novel

687
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,470
[Pingrong Battle: Guihong Scouts the Camp]

688
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,510
is good to go.

689
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,440
Before long,

690
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,530
this story will spread
throughout Great Jing.

691
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,550
By then, he'll be completely disgraced

692
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,350
and have no place in the capital.

693
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,030
Tear it up.

694
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,020
Your Highness,

695
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,680
not going after Chu Guihong anymore?

696
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,940
I told you to tear it up!

697
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,510
Sure, sure.

698
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,880
Right away.

699
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,280
It's torn.

700
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,480
Also...

701
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,920
Look into the matter
of those carrier pigeons.

702
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,370
Chu Guihong's performance

703
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,500
was truly beyond impressive.

704
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,400
Totally!

705
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,280
Yeah!

706
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,670
-Exactly!
-I agree!

707
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,190
The best!

708
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,030
So, Nan Heng,

709
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,969
you should

710
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,719
give up your first place.

711
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,810
Why should I give it up?

712
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,960
Seventh Prince,

713
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,710
the musical banquet

714
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,570
is filled with decadent music.

715
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,320
Being immersed in it for too long

716
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,760
makes one forget the hardships
of people at the border

717
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,889
and the difficulties soldiers face
defending our land.

718
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:51,000
Today's performances of
singing and sword dancing

719
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,800
fully displayed Great Jing's might,

720
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,120
upholding our national prestige.

721
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,330
Truly admirable.

722
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,400
Yes,

723
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,020
indeed.

724
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,680
I didn't expect Yiting to be so eloquent.

725
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,110
Your Highness,

726
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,030
I concede.

727
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,070
Yimeng.

728
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,310
I was at the border before,

729
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,120
which delayed us for years.

730
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,320
Now I've returned to the capital

731
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,650
and rejoined the court.

732
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,510
Our engagement's been postponed
for too long.

733
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,550
I've let you down.

734
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,760
Today,

735
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,190
in front of everyone present...

736
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,590
Chu Guihong, please.

737
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,000
Stop, please stop.

738
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,280
Would you marry me

739
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,560
and fulfill our engagement?

740
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:13,130
I, Chu Guihong, swear by the name
of the Qianyu Army

741
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,710
to protect you for the rest of your life.

742
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,150
I...

743
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,050
Chu Guihong, I...

744
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,150
I object!

745
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:32,020
My marriage is not for
others to object to.

746
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,710
Chu Guihong, we—

747
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,770
What if I object?

748
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,040
The latest update on "Exceptional Love"!

749
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,590
An emotional crisis in "Illusory Dream,"

750
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,360
with Chu Guihong's marriage proposal
creating imminent conflict!

751
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,400
New love or old flame?

752
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,510
Accept or reject?

753
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,440
How will she choose?

754
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,840
All in today's update!

755
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,400
Give me one!

756
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,110
Latest edition or not?

757
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,080
I want to see

758
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,000
how incompetent Nan Heng is,

759
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,780
letting Chu Guihong take the lead.

760
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,360
Great, great.

761
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,360
Give me ten copies!

762
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,400
I support Chu Guihong!

763
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,960
I'll pay to support him, okay?

764
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,590
Nice!

765
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,670
One at a time!

766
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,000
Ten copies, here you go!

767
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,480
Mother, why'd you

768
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,960
come unannounced?

769
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,880
If I hadn't come,
what would you have done?

770
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,230
Just wait patiently.

771
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,470
Today, I won't disappoint you.

772
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,860
The Noble Consort has a decree:

773
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,750
The eldest daughter of the Songs,
descendant of a noble house in the capital,

774
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,320
is intelligent and accomplished in music,
calligraphy, and painting.

775
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,760
The Seventh Prince Nan Heng,

776
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,110
young and unmarried,

777
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,880
is of gentle nature and well accomplished.

778
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,760
The two families shall unite
in matrimonial bliss.

779
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,230
So all these betrothal gifts

780
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,110
are for me.

781
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,670
This is too much!

782
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,180
Fine, Heng.

783
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,540
I finally understand.

784
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,550
Everything today

785
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,010
was all planned by you
in advance, wasn't it?

786
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,760
Creating buzz with "Exceptional Love,"

787
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,150
then the seduction at the musical banquet.

788
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,630
And now just as Guihong proposes marriage,

789
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,030
you pull something like this!

790
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,320
You sly fox.

791
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,320
Rui,

792
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,800
how can you slander
your brother like this?

793
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,360
Am I wrong?

794
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,400
Since childhood,

795
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,930
he's always been the most calculating.

796
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,260
Back then,

797
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,710
who knows what methods he used

798
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,440
to harm my mother, the Empress.

799
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Now you're even occupying her position!

800
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,110
You're all thieves,

801
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:32,510
nothing but robbers—

802
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,150
Nan Rui!

803
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,600
I'll say this one last time.

804
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,550
The former Empress's death had

805
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,480
nothing to do with me nor my mother.

806
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,400
If you dare disrespect my mother again,

807
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,720
I won't hold back.

808
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,500
And what if I do?

809
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,840
Your family only knows how to use

810
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,320
disgraceful, dirty tactics!

811
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,230
Your uncle is like that,

812
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,190
and so is your mother!

813
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:51,840
You!

814
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,070

815
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,680
Your Majesty!

816
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,620
Seventh Prince...

817
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,190
Wait, the plot has changed.

818
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,280
Nan Heng shouldn't be here

819
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,940
having a falling out with Chu Guihong.

820

-Your Highness!
-Stop!

00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,480
His Majesty orders

823
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,410
the Seventh Prince and Miss Song
to enter the palace.

824
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,920
I...

825
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,120
Eunuch Liu,

826
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,760
the princes were fighting.

827
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,150
Why am I arrested?

828
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,320
Miss Song,

829
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,840
His Majesty has given his royal word

830
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,230
that he must see you in person.

831
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,360
Please come with me.

832
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,880
My Lady! My Lady!

833
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,070
Gently, gently.

834
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,070
Be gentle.

835
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,760
Oh no.

836
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,770
What should we do now?

837
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,580
Why are you panicking?

838
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,720
Greetings, Second Miss.

839
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,510
My father should be hosting
guests at Juxian Tower.

840
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,840
Come find him with me

841
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,660
to ask him to go to the palace now.

842
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,360
Yiting,

843
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,670
is this matter really that serious?

844
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,400
The two princes just drew weapons
against each other.

845
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,190
Such actions

846
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,590
will surely provoke His Majesty's wrath,

847
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,990
and someone must bear the Emperor's anger.

848
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,090
Song Yimeng,

849
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,280
the situation looks grim.

How long do we have to kneel here?

852
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:28,980
Pad your knees.

853
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,950
Drop the act.

854
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,040
Stop scheming against me already.

855
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,460
Who schemed against you?

856
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,130
The arranged marriage
was my mother's idea.

857
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,790
What does it have to do with me?

858
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,630
Yes, yes, yes,

859
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,580
You're the kindest person in the world.

860
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,600
How could you possibly be involved?

861
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,320
Can you stop being so

862
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,030
sarcastic?

863
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,030
This was clearly a fight
between the three of you.

864
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,700
Why do the Eighteenth Prince

865
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,990
and Chu Guihong get away with it?

866
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,330
I didn't do anything,

867
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,880
yet I have to keep kneeling here.

868
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,440
Who did I offend?

869
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:10,320
Can the royals just do
whatever they want?

870
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,550
His Majesty didn't even
get the facts straight.

871
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,440
Miss Song.

872
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,140
[Imperial Study]

873
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,920
His Majesty summons you
to the Imperial Study.

874
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,480
Sure, sure.

875
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,730
As long...

876
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,190
As long as I don't have to kneel anymore,

877
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,030
I'll do anything.

878
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,800
My legs are numb!

879
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,190
I...

880
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,920
Watch your words inside.

881
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,780
I know!
