I'm sorry.

67
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Sorry.

68
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Sorry.

69
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm sorry.

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I won't come back to school today too.

You'd better not come to school tonight.

76
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Why did I tell you so?

77
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You're going to ask for punishment anyway.

78
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This is also the final one before I send you the proceed.

79
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't want you

80
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
always there

81
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
whenever I see the Elizabeth answer.

82
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
you want to see the right one

83
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
OK

84
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
All the Paste

85
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000

86
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Akha

87
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I have nothing else to do.

92
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,240
Stop for one

93
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
Look again

94
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,140
對啊

95
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,640
To stop

96
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I can't take it

97
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I've never been so innocent

98
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't know who's going to be confused

99
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I want to make a bet with you

100
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Do you want to know

101
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
How much I love Song Yi Meng

102
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let the wind touch my past

103
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let the pen draw my sorrow

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I want to see how much fate has broken

105
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let the wind touch my past

106
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let me be strong and strong

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Even if fate is destined

108
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I can't take it

109
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Let the wind touch my past

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Let the pen draw my sorrow

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let me be strong and strong

112
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Didn't you say

113
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It will be my birthday in ten days

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Can't see blood

115
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Let the rainbow block my blood

116
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let me be hurt by the next wound

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Now I see blood

118
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I can't take it

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What should you do

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I can't take it

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So you mean

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
His Majesty is trying to take away your military power

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's just a marriage

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He won't do that

125
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
He was charged with murdering the ministers

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But how did you see it

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If you start at nine years old

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
More than a person's nose

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Naturally understand him

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Your Highness

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Be careful

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Today, the crown prince saved the Song

133
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sure Mr. Song will agree to this marriage

134
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
If so

135
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Not only do you want to save the fan

136
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I have to send half the troops to the east

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's your loss

138
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You go and get Li Shiliu's clothes

139
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Your Highness

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You have been so badly hurt

141
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Where else do you want to go

142
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Isn't this someone who is on a mission?

143
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I have to go see

144
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What medicine is sold in his throat

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
General Li

146
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Scholar's life

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,700
click

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
General Li

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You're my best friend, right?

150
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
How about you?

151
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Did Nan Heng make it difficult for you?

152
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I understand.

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
No.

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Nan Heng didn't make it difficult for me.

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He knows that we're looking for a way to cut the road.

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So he wants to work with me.

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's good.

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let's go.

159
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Don't stand there. Come and sit.

160
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's go.

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You look good in this dress.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Where did you make it? Take me to ask around next time.

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's all made by Shangguan He.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If you like it...

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No need.

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't want to.

167
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Let me explain.

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Mr. Li, you don't have to explain.

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I told you last time.

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I understand.

171
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What do you understand?

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Let the past be the past.

173
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay? I won't say it anymore.

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You have to talk.

175
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You have to talk.

176
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What?

177
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You have to talk.

178
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You have to talk.

179
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I want to talk to you about something very important.

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,240
But Young General, you've released so many people.

181
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,520
If the Seventh Prince is willing to send troops, he should have come long ago.

182
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,760
Why is he like this now?

183
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,560
I was wrong about that year.

184
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,680
I shouldn't have doubted him.

185
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,320
I left him alone in the Cold Palace.

186
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,560
As long as he's willing to help me this time,

187
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,560
I'll be willing to atone for my previous mistakes.

188
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,440
No matter what kind of price I have to pay,

189
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,640
I'll...

190
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,160
I'll beg him.

191
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,360
If you don't help, it's Young General's fault!

192
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,400
If he hadn't killed him,

193
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,240
we could have changed our plan.

194
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,920
We wouldn't have been attacked and killed!

195
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,240
Chu Gui Hong, since the Song family is in trouble,

196
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,840
why don't we just let go of our past and solve this together?

197
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,040
How about it?

198
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,240
I've thought it through.

199
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,160
This Song Yi Meng is the Consort I've been looking for.

200
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,160
That Lord Song is my father-in-law.

201
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,840
I'll be the first to be executed for my father-in-law.

202
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,240
What?

203
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,840
Even you want to be like me?

204
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,440
What did I teach you?

205
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,840
A horse is used by the person who wants it.

206
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,440
Get up!

207
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,640
Father...

208
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,440
Father!

209
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,840
Silly boy, you still have a long life.

210
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,040
You can't be a hero if you fail in one attempt.

211
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,440
Look, these are all your soldiers.

212
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,840
They are your weapons.

213
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,440
From now on, Yu Long and the Qianyu Army will be yours sooner or later.

214
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,240
The battlefield in the capital is much harder than this.

215
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,440
In the future, you'll assist Rui Er and Nan Heng in fighting.

216
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,240
You'll help them to get rid of their past feelings.

217
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,440
You are loyal to your people, but you're burdened by your past feelings.

218
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,640
Do you still remember that book?

219
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,240
Father, Nan Heng said that he had burned the Qianyu Army.

220
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,040
Didn't you also send someone to search for it?

221
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,240
Why don't you believe it?

222
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,040
Promise me, Father.

223
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,840
If one day, you find that Nan Heng still has that thing in his hands,

224
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,440
you will destroy it completely.

225
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,240
There's a knife in it.

226
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,240
Do you hear me?

227
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,840
Rui Heng, if anyone dares to bully you,

228
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,840
just tell me. I'll clean it up for you.

229
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,240
Are you playing hard to get? I'm the one who's cleaning up for you.

230
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
Killing Nan Heng again?

231
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,240
Hero Li, calm down.

232
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,840
It's not killing, it's exposing.

233
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,640
Look, Nan Heng is looking for the knife and the knife together.

234
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,440
You must have evidence of him investigating the case.

235
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,040
If we hand these evidence to His Majesty,

236
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,640
his wild ambition will be completely destroyed.

237
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,440
He won't even let us do anything.

238
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,640
He'll be dead.

239
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,440
What about the engagement? We'll break it.

240
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,440
Wild ambition?

241
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,240
To this day, you haven't changed your opinion about Nan Heng?

242
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,840
I have.

243
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,440
I know.

244
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,240
He's not just a defiant villain.

245
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,840
He's a living person.

246
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,240
Whether you think he's a seductress is just a privacy bye-bye.

247
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,040
If he believes anyone would do this,

248
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,240
you just let him tell their story.

249
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,060
He already loved you,

250
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,840
but the truth isenter the interest of this Lesbians.

251
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,840
He won't become Nan Heng's biological son, right?

252
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,840
Since you understand all of this, why do you still want to harm him?

253
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,840
How can I harm him? He wants to investigate the knife-cutting method.

254
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,840
He will do the same thing in the future.

255
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,840
I reported him in advance to save my life.

256
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,840
But I also wanted to stop more people from getting hurt.

257
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,840
Why don't you understand, Hero Li?

258
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
I don't understand.

259
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,840
You'd rather believe in a life of nothing,

260
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,840
than a living person. How can I understand that?

261
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,840
And in my opinion,

262
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,840
Nan Heng is so loyal to you. How could he kill you?

263
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,840
Hero Li, why are you so fast today?

264
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Why do you keep helping him?

265
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,840
Am I wrong?

266
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,840
He might not want to kill me,

267
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,840
but I will die because of him.

268
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,840
This is the rule. It's destined.

269
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Then break the rule and destroy the destiny.

270
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,840
You don't understand. It's destined to be broken.

271
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,840
It will happen in the future.

272
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,840
At this moment, we can only use the rule to break the wall first.

273
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,840
Have you ever thought about it?

274
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,840
If the knife-cutting method is reported to the world,

275
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,840
you will be angry.

276
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
How can you die?

277
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,840
Or...

278
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,840
you don't care if he dies or not?

279
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,840
I... I... I don't care.

280
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,840
I just...

281
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,840
I just...

282
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,840
I just...

283
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,840
You are more cruel...

284
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,840
and cruel than him.

285
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,840
Hero Li!

286
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,840
Hero Li!

287
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,840
Hero Li!

288
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
Hero Li!

289
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,840
If possible,

290
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,840
I don't want him to die.

291
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,840
Hero Li!

292
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,840
Hero Li!

293
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,840
Hero Li!

294
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,840
Hero Li!

295
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,840
Hero Li!

296
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Hero Li!

297
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,840
Hero Li!

298
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,840
Hero Li!

299
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,840
Hero Li!

300
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,840
Hero Li!

301
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,840
Hero Li!

302
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,840
Hero Li!

303
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,840
Hero Li!

304
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,840
Hero Li!

305
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,840
Hero Li!

306
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,840
Hero Li!

307
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,840
Hero Li!

308
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,840
Hero Li!

309
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,840
Hero Li!

310
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,840
Hero Li!

311
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,840
Hero Li!

312
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
Hero Li!

313
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,840
Hero Li!

314
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,840
Hero Li!

315
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,840
Hero Li!

316
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,840
Handcuff me!

317
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,840
Handcuff me!

318
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
What are you two doing?

319
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840
Who?

320
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,840
Second Master, you're finally here.

321
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,840
Boss came back from the village last night

322
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
and locked himself in there for the whole night.

323
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
Did he stab him?

324
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,840
No.

325
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,840
If only he did that.

326
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,840
There's no movement inside.

327
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,840
It's so quiet.

328
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840
We're both scared.

329
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,840
Do you think Boss will...

330
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
You two do something else.

331
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,840
I'll take care of it.

332
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
Forget it.

333
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
Right now,

334
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,840
we're both scared.

335
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
You two,

336
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
that's all we have to do.

337
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840
Boss,

338
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
I'm not scared.

339
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,840
There's no reason to be scared.

340
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840
I'm here to save you.

341
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
Boss,

342
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,840
I'm here to save you.

343
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,840
Boss,

344
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
I'm here to save you.

345
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
Boss,

346
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,440
Either you or Li has already lost proper if you stay or die.

347
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,080
He doesn't care I don't have the scheme.

348
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,420
Nothing's surprising.

349
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,260
I should have thought of it earlier.

350
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,620
Then, what are you doing so detector on me?

351
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,820
I already told you.

352
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:31,880
yin-yang 7-old will Maori only get

353
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,920
yin-yang 7-old will Ma you only get

354
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,060
Look, as you know

355
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,200
Don't forget to take care of it.

356
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,280
Most important thing,

357
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,180
you must consider right from wrong,

358
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,860
and keep in mind this.

359
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,280
If you send me a message that your family lost you,

360
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,900
I really won't let you down.

361
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,400
Let's go out now?

362
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,240
No, you're not coming with me.

363
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,000
Can I leave if you're still here?

364
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,200
What...?

365
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,400
If you give up, it's a miracle.

366
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,640
You're so haggard after a short time.

367
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
Don't mention it.

368
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,000
Master Li's speech almost broke me.

369
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,440
I should make up for it.

370
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,440
Master Li too.

371
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,520
He came back from the palace last night and he was so angry.

372
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,640
We can't even beg for mercy.

373
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,160
My father is still thinking about it.

374
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,400
He wants to help me to get married.

375
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,600
It's a pity that he can't fulfill his wish.

376
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,800
How do you know?

377
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,880
The man wants the power of Song family.

378
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,280
It's a plan that can't be changed until death.

379
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,280
I should be strong and strong.

380
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,960
I want to persuade Master Li to help me.

381
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,520
Your Highness, you're finally back.

382
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,160
Master Song is waiting for you in the mansion.

383
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
Your Highness.

384
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,400
Sorry for your sudden visit.

385
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
Sit down.

386
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
Your Highness.

387
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,920
I'm sorry for your sudden visit.

388
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
I'm sorry for your sudden visit.

389
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
I'm sorry for your sudden visit.

390
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,920
Your Highness, you're being serious.

391
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,720
You've prepared a punishment for me.

392
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,120
I should go to the door and thank you.

393
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,120
These are the medicines I prepared for you to cure your wound.

394
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,920
Please accept them.

395
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Thank you, sir.

396
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,920
You're here today.

397
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
You're not here to deliver medicines, right?

398
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,920
I have something to ask you.

399
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Your Highness.

400
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,920
What did you do outside the mansion yesterday?

401
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,920
How sincere and selfish were you?

402
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,920
Of course I'm a sensible person.

403
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,920
I won't hide it from you.

404
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,920
If you're not selfish, you won't ask for it.

405
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,920
If you're not sincere, you won't blame yourself.

406
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
Your Highness.

407
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
Please forgive me for my slip of the tongue.

408
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,920
Your Highness, if you don't behave yourself,

409
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
you'll be in trouble.

410
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,920
If one day, you lose your power,

411
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,920
and the high-ranking prince becomes the next emperor,

412
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
you'll be in trouble.

413
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
I'm sorry.

414
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
I'm sorry.

415
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
I'm sorry.

416
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
I'm sorry.

417
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
I'm sorry.

418
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,920
I'm sorry.

419
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
I'm sorry.

420
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
I'm sorry.

421
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
I'm sorry.

422
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
I'm sorry.

423
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
I'm sorry.

424
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
I'm sorry.

425
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Because people in the street have to live in isolation,

426
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
and to be free forever.

427
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,920
Or to live in seclusion.

428
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,920
How can you protect me?

429
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
Your Highness.

430
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,920
I've been living a life of freedom since I was young.

431
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
I seem to be free-minded.

432
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
But I'm the one who's the most important to me.

433
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,720
If you succeed, he will be trapped in the Palace forever.

434
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,720
If he fails, he will lose his life.

435
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:55,120
As a father, I don't want my daughter to marry into this kind of family.

436
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,320
I don't want her to be in the Danjing Shoupa for the rest of her life.

437
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:08,920
Shiyi, I beg you to let Xiaomeng go.

438
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,920
If you agree to cancel the marriage,

439
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,120
I will pay you back.

440
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
Please rise, Your Excellency.

441
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,120
I understand what you said.

442
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,120
And I was hesitating on my way back.

443
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:45,120
Should I give up my obsession and let her go?

444
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,120
But I can't.

445
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,120
Everything I did before was for self-protection.

446
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,520
But in the future, I want to break off the obsession with her.

447
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,520
I want to be her best friend.

448
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,920
I promise you that I will use all my strength to protect her.

449
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,120
Your Excellency, I also want to ask for her opinion.

450
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,920
You want to give me one last chance.

451
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,920
So, Your Excellency,

452
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,720
I can't do it.

453
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,920
Protect the emperor!

454
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,920
Protect the emperor!

455
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,520
What's your name?

456
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,320
This is the seven royal houses of the noble.

457
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,320
It's the duty of the royal guards.

458
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,920
Be careful.

459
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,920
You guys go over there.

460
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,920
Yes.

461
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,920
Oh my god.

462
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,920
I'm so scared.

463
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,920
There's nothing.

464
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,920
Wait for me.

465
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,920
Rong Hua, let's go.

466
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,920
Let me see the girl.

467
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,920
I saved her yesterday, but I didn't do it on purpose.

468
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,920
Does Miss Tian Tian know it?

469
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
Hurry up.

470
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,320
Where should I go?

471
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,320
You should tell her first.

472
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,920
She said that she can't be with you.

473
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,720
Please don't come and get me.

474
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,320
When did I get here?

475
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,920
Open the door.

476
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,920
Tian Tian!

477
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,920
This...

478
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,920
What?

479
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,920
What?

480
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,920
Oh.

481
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,920
Why are you still standing there?

482
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,920
Hurry up and call me Mother-in-law.

483
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,920
You're Mrs. Song?

484
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,920
I've met Mrs. Song before.

485
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,920
Come on.

486
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
Keep this.

487
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,920
This is all the schedule of Song Yiting this month.

488
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,920
Your Highness, I'm very happy for you.

489
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,920
I can only help you here.

490
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,920
Don't let me down in the future.

491
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
I will definitely...

492
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
No.

493
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Thank you, Mother-in-law.

494
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,920
Okay, I'll go in first.

495
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,920
Goodbye.

496
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,920
came.

497
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,920
Come, let's go.

498
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Okay.

499
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
Hurry.

500
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,920
呢, базi.

501
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,920
Let's do this.

502
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,880
I'm doing it for your own good.

503
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,320
You're a rich lady.

504
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,160
You should have prepared a dress for us.

505
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,680
Next year,

506
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,680
you should choose a good husband.

507
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,680
Choose a husband?

508
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,600
Will a woman die if she doesn't choose a husband?

509
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,760
The scale is good.

510
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,680
I'll leave now.

511
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,880
Wait a minute, Miss.

512
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,760
I'll give you an umbrella.

513
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:34,480
Chichor

514
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,840
Tien Dung!

515
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,920
It's such a coincidence that we meet here today.

516
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,280
It must be God's arrangement.

517
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,400
I have booked a wedding banquet at the restaurant.

518
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,120
Miss TianTian, please...

519
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,000
Your Highness,

520
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,400
within three days,

521
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,520
we have met 21 times.

522
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,040
Do you think I will believe it?

523
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,280
Is it that much?

524
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,400
No matter what means you used,

525
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,440
or what method,

526
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,520
I will tell you clearly today.

527
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,040
I don't like people like you.

528
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,680
You only listen to father.

529
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,680
You are not a man of good character.

530
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,720
Don't waste your energy.

531
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,840
Tiantian.

532
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,840
Tiantian.

533
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,680
Jin Xiang, stop her.

534
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,840
Your Highness,

535
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,920
what are you doing?

536
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,560
Do you want to be rude?

537
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,000
No, I really have no intention to offend you.

538
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,360
But I have to tell you something.

539
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,200
You asked me why I want to get married.

540
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,960
I thought about it for a long time and finally figured it out.

541
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,920
It's not because of father,

542
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,720
nor because I want to compete with my wife.

543
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,280
It's because...

544
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,200
It's mother's hospital.

545
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,360
She is a big-hearted queen.

546
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,560
You should listen to her.

547
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,800
Tiantian.

548
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,760
No,

549
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,880
my mother told me that

550
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,360
she wanted me to marry a girl with knowledge.

551
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,960
If she can speak and communicate,

552
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,440
then we can have a harmonious relationship.

553
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
And mother said that

554
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,360
if she marries a girl,

555
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,880
she will be in full love with her forever.

556
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
Enough.

557
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,000
Don't follow me anymore.

558
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,080
Tiantian.

559
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,920
Tiantian.

560
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,400
You can't do this to me.

561
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,920
I'm not your daughter.

562
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,040
I'm your daughter.

563
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,040
I'm your daughter.

564
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
You can't do this to me.

565
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
I'm your daughter.

566
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,760
Tiantian.

567
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,640
Don't worry.

568
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,520
Even if you and mother can be harmonious,

569
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,400
I will save you first.

570
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,800
Eagle.

571
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,360
Eagle.

572
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,640
Fresh eagle.

573
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,400
Eagle.

574
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,920
Childe.

575
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,120
Buy some eagle soup.

576
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,400
Is it sweet?

577
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,040
Childe, try it.

578
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,600
How is it?

579
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,920
Sweet.

580
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,720
But not as sweet as you.

581
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,840
Eagle soup.

582
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,040
Sell eagle soup.

583
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,440
It's too big.

584
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,120
Run.

585
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,080
Hurry up.

586
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,760
Are you okay?

587
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,640
I'm fine.

588
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,160
Stop pouring rain.

589
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,760
Here you go.

590
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,760
Thank you, childe.

591
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:34,880
Be careful.

592
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,280
Song Yi was there,

593
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,640
Master Tung is here!

594
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,320
Master Tung!

595
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,960
Master Tung!

596
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:06,960
No one.

597
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,520
I'm such a handsome and handsome man.

598
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,000
But I'm a beggar in front of him.

599
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,200
Is there such a beggar who is so handsome and handsome?

600
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,760
So funny.

601
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,880
Isn't it just a robe?

602
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,400
I'll buy you another one.

603
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,160
Is it important?

604
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,880
It's important that I'm dressed up

605
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,440
and I'm in the mood of the rain.

606
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,360
Wait and see.

607
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,800
I have to take her down from the altar.

608
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,880
I tell you.

609
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,040
She is Song Yi Meng's sister.

610
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,680
Don't go to her.

611
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,560
You're so generous to her.

612
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,880
I've checked it.

613
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,720
This Song Yiting is the son of Zhou family.

614
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,680
She is not related to your Meng.

615
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,920
She is also the daughter of the Song family.

616
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,640
Don't forget.

617
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,800
After you saved her last time,

618
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,440
it's not over yet.

619
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,240
Don't cause me trouble.

620
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,920
If there's nothing else, go back first.

621
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,680
Go back door.

622
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,960
Which time I didn't go back door?

623
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,280
And,

624
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,280
do I have to cause her trouble?

625
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,880
That woman wants to cause me trouble.

626
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,920
What can I do?

627
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,320
Did I tell you

628
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,040
not to mess with my things in the study?

629
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,600
You...

630
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,360
You have to find a limit to her.

631
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,320
If you really don't like me,

632
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,880
I won't be the second master.

633
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,800
You send me back to the prison.

634
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,800
We'll go now.

635
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,960
I got her here.

636
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,760
What are you doing?

637
00:34:40,800 --> 00:35:05,120
Your

638
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,740
wife killed her

639
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,580
You're here?!

640
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,380
Boss Wu, you're being��

641
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,460
You're here!

642
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,580
I've been looking for you for three days

643
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,560
and I finally found the secret room

644
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,060
General Chu, you're not loyal

645
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,660
commanders

646
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:52,580
What are they look for?

647
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:54,880
no

648
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,600
ronонь

649
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,200
If ronson causality

650
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,360
I'm investigating veterans

651
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,980
even if I just met our dealer

652
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,780
This is what I do

653
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,300
Ronson drops

654
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,100
You have made up too many excuses.

655
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,100
So what do you say?

656
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:16,100
If you leave, you will never get what you want.

657
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,700
You came here three days ago.

658
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,700
But your hands and feet are dirty.

659
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,700
You left a stain.

660
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,700
So I told the rich to keep an eye on you.

661
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,100
For the past three days,

662
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,100
you have searched the entire Gu mansion.

663
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:37,100
But the most frequent visit is still this study.

664
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,500
So I think

665
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:45,500
you are looking for this.

666
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,500
Nai Heng, the Qianyu weapon is my family's.

667
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Give it back to me.

668
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,900
If I remember correctly,

669
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,900
this is what General Chu gave me 19 years ago.

670
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,900
Give it back to me.

671
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,100
I gave you a friend.

672
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,100
Now,

673
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,100
you are not.

674
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,100
But,

675
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,100
how can I take back what I gave you?

676
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,100
And I'm curious,

677
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,100
General Chu wants this book so much.

678
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,100
Is there any secret in it?

679
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,100
It's none of your business.

680
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,100
You have no right to know.

681
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,100
Okay.

682
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,100
If so,

683
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,100
why don't you...

684
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,100
Why don't you just give it back to me?

685
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,100
I'm not going to give it back to you.

686
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,100
I'm going to give it back to you.

687
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,100
I'm going to give it back to you.

688
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,100
I'm going to give it back to you.

689
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,100
I'm going to give it back to you.

690
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,100
I'm going to give it back to you.

691
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,100
I'm going to give it back to you.

692
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,100
I'm going to give it back to you.

693
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,100
I'm going to give it back to you.

694
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,100
I'm going to give it back to you.

695
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,100
I'm going to give it back to you.

696
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,100
I'm going to give it back to you.

697
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,100
I'm going to give it back to you.

698
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,100
I'm going to give it back to you.

699
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,100
I'm going to give it back to you.

700
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
Nanhang...

701
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,100
Nanhang...

702
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,100
Nanhang...

703
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,100
He died.

704
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,100
You killed him!

705
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,100
You said it was me who killed him.

706
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,100
Do you have any evidence?

707
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
The thing I regret the most in my life

708
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,100
is to play a trick on you.

709
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,100
I taught you a friend who is not saved by death.

710
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,100
I am not saved by death.

711
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,100
I was trapped in the Cold Palace.

712
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,100
I was trapped in the Cold Palace.

713
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,100
I was trapped in the Cold Palace.

714
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,100
I was trapped in the Cold Palace.

715
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,100
I was trapped in the Cold Palace.

716
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,100
I will find evidence

717
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,100
I will find evidence

718
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,100
I will find evidence

719
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,100
from now on

720
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,100
I will be more lovely than you

721
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,100
I will be more lovely than you

722
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,100
until you kneel in front of me and beg for mercy.

723
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,100
until you kneel in front of me and beg for mercy.

724
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,100
Okay.

725
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,100
I want to see

726
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,100
how cruel General Chu can be.

727
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,100
I will go.

728
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,100
I will go.

729
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,100
The End

730
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,100
The End

731
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,100
The End

732
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,100
The End

733
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,100
The End

734
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,100
The End
