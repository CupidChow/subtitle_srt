1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,060
The End

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The큐 Stephan

32
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,420
Woman

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,920
are you playing fire?

34
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,200
Who said I closed the door

35
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,500
Who said who are your eyes are small

36
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,020
Your Highness, I didn't say you.

37
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,740
You have small eyes.

38
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,540
Just go, Your Highness.

39
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,660
It's too late if you don't light the lanterns.

40
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,300
Hurry up.

41
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,420
Light the lanterns.

42
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,420
Come here.

43
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:36,940
You have small eyes.

44
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,580
I'll give you a ride.

45
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,060
Thank you, brother.

46
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,460
So beautiful.

47
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,260
My lords.

48
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:55,820
18th Prince.

49
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,860
Long time no see.

50
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,620
I propose a toast to you.

51
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,220
This one.

52
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,940
It's not on the same spot.

53
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,700
It's already in the same shape.

54
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,620
Are you satisfied with the banquet?

55
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,740
Yes, I am.

56
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,980
Lord Heng.

57
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,340
Lord Song.

58
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,220
I've been waiting for you all night.

59
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,380
Finally, I have a chance to propose a toast to you.

60
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,660
I remember you said that

61
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,100
you were loyal to my cousin in court.

62
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,500
I'll propose a toast to you

63
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,420
when I have the power.

64
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,460
No, I dare not.

65
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,740
I'm just a public figure

66
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,340
in the court.

67
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,860
I can't afford to disappoint 18th Prince.

68
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,500
Well, he and I...

69
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,380
Stop it.

70
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,500
Lord Song.

71
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
You're being too rude.

72
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,060
My cousin is going to marry a rich girl soon.

73
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,860
Right?

74
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,500
I'm listening to you.

75
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,020
Lord Song, you...

76
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,060
You...

77
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,580
I'm sorry for my rudeness.

78
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,100
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,500
Lord Song.

80
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,460
Lord Song.

81
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,180
You...

82
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,500
Really?

83
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,700
I'm so embarrassed to refuse

84
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,020
the wine of the selection.

85
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,500
Your Highness, let's go after him.

86
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,220
What?

87
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,420
He has nothing to do with it.

88
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,020
He's still in the position.

89
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,140
Tingting.

90
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,260
That...

91
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,180
Mr. Li is the second son of the minister.

92
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,540
He's a traitor.

93
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,900
What about that?

94
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,180
The chief of the Hanlin Court

95
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,700
was born with a flower at the age of 20.

96
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,820
He must be talented.

97
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,020
I'm not sure about that.

98
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,900
What about this?

99
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,900
Your Highness.

100
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,180
I have something to do.

101
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,220
I'll leave now.

102
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,180
Tingting.

103
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,780
Tingting.

104
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,740
Tingting.

105
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,140
You...

106
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,780
There's a flower.

107
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,980
Can't you see it with me?

108
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,900
This is a good chance to know me.

109
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,780
Tingting.

110
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,900
Come here.

111
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,700
This...

112
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,380
It seems that the wind is too strong today.

113
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,140
He feels inferior.

114
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,460
Remember what I said.

115
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,740
If Li Shiliu's assassination is failed

116
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,940
or the situation changes,

117
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,580
you must send more people to the palace.

118
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,380
Yes.

119
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,980
It's me.

120
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,100
Come out.

121
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,340
Hurry, go back to the palace.

122
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,460
Stay here.

123
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,220
You stay here and fight with them.

124
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,900
Here comes the special agent of our army.

125
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,540
Tell Mr. Hong to tell Mr. Hong to stay here,

126
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,900
instead of making an opportunity between us.

127
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,540
As I thought

128
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,620
Your Highness

129
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,820
Your Highness

130
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,660
My men took all glasses that it could only bear on each other.

131
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,060
bit brother Li my headset

132
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,740
La la la la

133
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,320
brother Li年

134
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,660
brother Chu too

135
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
You also called me Brother Li, right?

136
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
Why can't I call you Brother Chu?

137
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,820
I've fought with Li Shiliu before.

138
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,820
He's not weak.

139
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
If others want to steal his blood,

140
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,820
they won't be able to do it easily.

141
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,820
Tell me, who are you?

142
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,820
Good!

143
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
Good!

144
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,820
Good!

145
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,820
Let's hat off to Second Tian Eng!

146
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,820
Second 10th Brother!

147
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,820
Good!

148
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,820
Thank you!

149
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
Let's hug and quietly laugh together.

150
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
He will merchandise me!

151
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
That's the spirit!

152
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:59,820
Having this marriage is about friendship and friendship.

153
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
This marriage is our own desire to live a happy life together.

154
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,820
Good.

155
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,780
What wish did you make?

156
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,860
Your Highness, tell me first.

157
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,340
What wish did you make?

158
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,140
I don't believe in these things.

159
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,780
What I want is

160
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,940
to take it myself.

161
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,420
But

162
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,780
as long as you do me a favor,

163
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,020
I will fulfill all your wishes.

164
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,940
Really?

165
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,900
Okay, listen carefully.

166
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,900
I want a cat that looks like a cat.

167
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,140
A cat that looks like a cat.

168
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,740
A horse that flies in the sky.

169
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,980
I also want a big house.

170
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,980
I want to see snow in the summer and see the lotus in the winter.

171
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,180
I will work all year round.

172
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,140
No PPT, no POA.

173
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,420
I can't meet the heart-to-heart man when I go out.

174
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,860
I can't meet the keyboard man when I go online.

175
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,740
The person I like

176
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,860
is a little milk dog in the day and a little wolf dog at night.

177
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,500
When I have time, I have to help me walk that dog that looks like a cat.

178
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,980
What nonsense are you talking about?

179
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,740
Look.

180
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,300
You can't do it.

181
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,420
If you can't do it,

182
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,260
you will miss the time when I played the boss.

183
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,220
Okay.

184
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,940
I said okay.

185
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,860
As long as you help me find the way to cut the knife,

186
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,220
I will fulfill your wish for you.

187
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:37,860
You...

188
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,460
What are you trying to do?

189
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,020
If I tell you that I can fulfill your wish for you,

190
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,180
I only ask this time.

191
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,700
Will you believe me?

192
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,940
I...

193
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,020
I believe you, you월z.

194
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,180
It's the firework that Qian Yujuan and others prepared.

195
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,540
Your Highness, let's go to the ship and have a look.

196
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,100
I'm sorry.

197
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,300
I'm so clumsy.

198
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,500
Please punish me.

199
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
It's okay.

200
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,860
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

201
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,660
I'll go to clean up.

202
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,260
You eat and drink first.

203
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,260
Wait for me.

204
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,260
Miss Song,

205
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,260
I'm sorry.

206
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,260
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,260
I'm sorry.

208
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,260
Miss Song,

209
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,260
I thought it was so hard to kill the Seventh Prince.

210
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,260
I think so.

211
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,260
Hush.

212
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,260
You just said that.

213
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,260
How can you say that to him?

214
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,260
Let's get out of here.

215
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,260
Don't delay the fight.

216
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,260
I thought it was a start to the final battle.

217
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,260
I didn't expect Chu Chang to save the Prince.

218
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,260
Chu Gui Hong,

219
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,260
what does this mean?

220
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,260
There are thieves in the city tonight.

221
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,260
I'm here to arrest them.

222
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,260
I don't want to disturb you.

223
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,260
That's why you, Chu Gui Hong,

224
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,260
did something wrong

225
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,260
and let the traitors escape.

226
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,260
You can leave now.

227
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,260
I'll interrogate him myself.

228
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,260
No.

229
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,260
What does it have to do with you?

230
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,260
Your Highness,

231
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,260
it's the duty of every Great Jin people

232
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,260
to maintain the safety of the capital.

233
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,260
In my opinion,

234
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,260
he's hurt.

235
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,260
He's pitiful.

236
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,260
He didn't do anything bad.

237
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,260
Let him go.

238
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,260
No.

239
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,260
General Chu is right.

240
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,260
He can't leave before he's identified.

241
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,260
What you said is right.

242
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,260
If he's identified,

243
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,260
then let the Jin State do it.

244
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,260
No.

245
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,260
Miss Song,

246
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,260
Chu is not a good person.

247
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,260
He must have hurt Boss Hai.

248
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,260
What does it have to do with you?

249
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,260
Miss Song said

250
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,260
it's the duty of every Great Jin people.

251
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,260
Today is the festival of Shangyuan.

252
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,260
I think General Chu

253
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,260
has a lot of things to do.

254
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,260
Why don't we just let them go?

255
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,260
Don't come over.

256
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,260
Run!

257
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,260
Someone wants to kill us!

258
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,260
Nan Heng,

259
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,260
I came here to kill you.

260
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,260
Don't make a mistake.

261
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,260
Let's go.

262
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,260
Wait.

263
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,260
Our people are our enemies.

264
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,260
Yes.

265
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,260
What are you doing?

266
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,260
Kill him!

267
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,260
Don't come over.

268
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,260
Qi Zhengqiang,

269
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,260
don't hurt him.

270
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,260
Don't hurt him.

271
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,260
Let's go.

272
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,260
Don't hurt him.

273
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,260
Qi Zhengqiang,

274
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,260
the whole family is here.

275
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,260
Move away!

276
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,260
Tien Yen,

277
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,260
go to the dock with me.

278
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,300
Stop!

279
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,820
Stop!

280
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,780
Your highness!

281
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,300
Don't be impulsive!

282
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,980
Don't be impulsive, Your highness!

283
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,780
Chu Gui Hong, I need an explanation from you.

284
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,780
What's your relationship with them?

285
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,340
And...

286
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,940
How many times have you been involved in the assassination?

287
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,260
Your Highness, it has nothing to do with him.

288
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,660
It's me. I did it all by myself.

289
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,020
Song Yi Meng, Mu Er, do you know what kind of crime it is to assassinate a prince?

290
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,460
You can't afford to be the one to be executed.

291
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,660
I have to do it even if I can't afford it.

292
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,460
Your Highness, it's because I didn't find what you wanted,

293
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,460
so I made this plan. They are all innocent.

294
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,260
Enough, I didn't ask you.

295
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,260
I didn't ask you.

296
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,860
Chu Gui Hou, you are the King of Jingzhao.

297
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,660
Who are they talking about?

298
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,060
Or,

299
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:05,460
the one who wants to risk his life is actually you.

300
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:10,660
I said it from the beginning that it was the time to catch the thief.

301
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,660
As for the three people in the martial arts world,

302
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,460
both I and Mu Er don't know them.

303
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,660
Okay,

304
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,460
I will now

305
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,860
take this thief

306
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,060
and take him to the ground.

307
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,260
Nan Hong, don't touch him.

308
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,860
If you touch him, I won't let you finish.

309
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,660
Mu Er.

310
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,660
I am your son after all.

311
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,460
What I said was just out of my own will.

312
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,660
Your Highness, do it.

313
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,660
Chu Gui Hou, what did you say?

314
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,260
Mu Er, you go back first. I will explain to you when you go back.

315
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,260
Your Highness!

316
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,060
General!

317
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,860
I will save him!

318
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,660
General, take them back.

319
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,260
Yes!

320
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,060
Go!

321
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,460
General, are you okay?

322
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,260
Yes.

323
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,460
Chu Gui Hou.

324
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,860
I am waiting for you to give me a satisfactory explanation about tonight's matter.

325
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,060
It's great.

326
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,860
General Li should be far away by now.

327
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,260
I got it.

328
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,660
General Li failed to assassinate Nan Hong.

329
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,460
Nan Hong didn't die.

330
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,260
That means

331
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,660
the three people in the martial arts world

332
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,660
are both dead.

333
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,660
That means

334
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,860
Nan Hong didn't die.

335
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,460
That means

336
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,460
everything will happen as planned.

337
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,060
Oh no.

338
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,060
Master.

339
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,860
You go over there and check.

340
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,460
No suspicious person can be released.

341
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,060
Yes!

342
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,060
Mu Er.

343
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,060
Mu Er.

344
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,060
Mu Er, that person is not Li Shi Liu.

345
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,660
Tonight's matter is not right.

346
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,060
Trust me.

347
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,660
Chu Gui Hou, you suspected him from the beginning.

348
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,060
Now you are satisfied with what you did.

349
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,460
Listen to me first.

350
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,060
Tonight's matter just started.

351
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,060
Later, there will be a fire on this street.

352
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,260
Many innocent people will be hurt.

353
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,860
If you believe me,

354
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,460
If you believe me,

355
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,060
can you send some army

356
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,060
to follow me

357
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,660
and stop all this from happening?

358
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,260
Fire?

359
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,860
Why would there be a fire in the city?

360
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,060
Mu Er.

361
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,860
Rong Hua and others are searching for Li Shi Liu's whereabouts.

362
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,460
Nan Hong's people are still watching.

363
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,460
I can't leave here.

364
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,060
I knew it.

365
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,460
Mu Er.

366
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,060
I'll send you back first, okay?

367
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,460
So many things happened tonight.

368
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,260
Nan Hong will not give up easily.

369
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,460
I can only rest assured if you stay at home.

370
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,460
No need.

371
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,860
Mu Er, where are you going?

372
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,660
I'm going to find Hero Li.

373
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,460
I'll go with him

374
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,460
to change the world.

375
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,860
Good job!

376
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,660
Although our plan tonight is messed up,

377
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,460
including running it wrong,

378
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,900
Of course, the plan is messed up tonight

379
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,380
But fortunately, the goal has been achieved

380
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,380
The matter is over

381
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,820
What are you doing in this shape?

382
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,060
Don't worry

383
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,500
Aren't you hurt?

384
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,300
Go back first

385
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,820
Are you worried about the chaos in Song Yi Meng's mouth?

386
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,060
Put your heart in your stomach

387
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,900
Now Qianyu Army is so fierce

388
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,340
Searching for Li Shiliu

389
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,980
The whole capital is like a iron bucket

390
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,900
Only you dare to cause trouble at such a night

391
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,220
This is the key

392
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,300
I've been thinking these days

393
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,740
What is the chaos in Song Yi Meng's mouth?

394
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,940
What is the purpose?

395
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,860
Who is the instigator?

396
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,700
If something happens to Donghui

397
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,060
Chu Guihong is in trouble

398
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,380
The biggest beneficiary should be me

399
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,460
I think His Majesty can also think of it

400
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:11,540
But who is the one behind this?

401
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,580
Wait for me

402
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,620
Wait for me

403
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,340
Wait for me

404
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,140
Wait for me

405
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,740
This is the way out

406
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,340
Excuse me

407
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,140
Boss

408
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,020
This fire is not dangerous

409
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,140
Put out the fire

410
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,620
Stop

411
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,660
Dangerous

412
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,340
What's wrong?

413
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:12,980
Miss

414
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,940
This fire is too dangerous

415
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,060
What are you doing?

416
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,220
Change the official

417
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,180
Not change others

418
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,580
Just change me

419
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,380
Shifu Lin Yun

420
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:50,360
so

421
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,620
1 man

422
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,980
I don't need this

423
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,580
Turn off the light

424
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,780
The water is falling

425
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,380
Get away

426
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,980
Hurry up

427
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,980
Hurry up

428
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,380
The water is falling

429
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,820
Xiao Ding, get up!

430
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,820
Hurry!

431
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,820
Xiao Ding!

432
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,820
Thank you!

433
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,060
Xiao Ding!

434
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,580
Are you okay?

435
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,580
I'm fine.

436
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,060
Hero Li, are you okay?

437
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,060
It's just a small injury.

438
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,060
It's nothing.

439
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,860
Move aside!

440
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,860
Move aside!

441
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,860
Qing Huo!

442
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,860
Move aside!

443
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,860
Move aside!

444
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,860
Hurry!

445
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,860
Move aside!

446
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,860
Move aside!

447
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,860
Move aside!

448
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,860
Move aside!

449
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,860
Move aside!

450
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
Move aside!

451
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
Hurry and save Huo!

452
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,860
Hurry and go!

453
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,860
Hurry!

454
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,860
Let the civilians over there stand!

455
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,860
Hurry!

456
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,860
Who is it?

457
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,860
Hurry!

458
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,860
Over there!

459
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,860
Walk slower!

460
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,860
Go!

461
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,860
The lights are on, the city is on fire.

462
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,860
What you said is all a lie.

463
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,860
How did you know?

464
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,860
Hero Li, do you believe in fate?

465
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,860
I don't believe in fate.

466
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,860
I just believe in it.

467
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,860
I just believe in it.

468
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,860
I just believe in it.

469
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,860
I just believe in it.

470
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,860
I just believe in it.

471
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,860
Do you believe in fate?

472
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,860
What do you mean?

473
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:51,860
In this world, everyone's birth is a pre-written script.

474
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,860
Set up all the sad and happy parts.

475
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:02,860
And in the end, you will reach an end that you can never change.

476
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,860
This is the rule of this world.

477
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,860
I don't believe in those nonsense.

478
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,860
Mountains are not born with wind.

479
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,860
Roads are not born with plain.

480
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,860
It's okay to humiliate the gods.

481
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,860
It's okay to be sad and happy.

482
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,860
I have my own hands and feet.

483
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,860
But breaking the economy can also be seen as a long-lasting thing.

484
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,860
Why should the end of life and death be in the hands of others?

485
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,860
If there are rules and manipulators behind this world,

486
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,860
then the one who forces it should be me.

487
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,860
I knew it.

488
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,860
The Lantern Festival was a disaster.

489
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,860
And we didn't know each other.

490
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:01,860
But since you saved me in the Lantern Festival,

491
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,860
I always feel that something has been changed.

492
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,860
Master Li, thank you.

493
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,860
I knew it.

494
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,860
Fate can be changed.

495
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,860
The world can also be changed.

496
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,860
I want to tell you something.

497
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,860
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.

498
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,860
I just want to tell you that I love you.

499
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,860
I love you.

500
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,860
I love you.

501
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,860
I love you.

502
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,860
I love you.

503
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,860
I love you.

504
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,860
I love you.

505
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,860
I love you.

506
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,860
Just now, a friend said that he saw his last name on Xushui Street.

507
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,860
I sent two people to follow him.

508
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,860
I didn't go there.

509
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,860
General.

510
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,860
What's wrong?

511
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:36,860
Didn't you say that you wanted to give Miss Song a fireworks at the Lantern Festival?

512
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,860
I left some for today.

513
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,860
General, do you want to give Miss Song a surprise?

514
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,860
No need.

515
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,860
Go find Li Shiliu.

516
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,860
Master Li, let me help you.

517
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,860
Give it to me.

518
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,860
I know that burning is the most painful.

519
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,860
I don't know if there's any antibiotics in this medicine.

520
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,860
I'm sorry.

521
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,860
The medical conditions here are not good.

522
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,860
Remember, don't touch water.

523
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,860
Don't eat the food that's released.

524
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,860
You can't eat lamb, beef, seafood.

525
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:32,860
If you don't pay attention, your arm will be broken.

526
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,860
You can't take in a hero.

527
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,860
What hero?

528
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,860
Jiang Shen.

529
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:47,860
The blood that flows from my blood inside is the jadegranite.

530
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:53,860
I am afraid that the power maximum of a female hero would be trapped by the might of a man.

531
00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:00,860
You won't quickly, after the medicine polo is exhausted by women.

532
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,860
There is a meteor shower in a corner.

533
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,860
I brought you some gifts.

534
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,860
Thank you, Miss Song.

535
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,860
But Master Li saved my life.

536
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,860
It's already this time.

537
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,860
Why don't you remember Master Li?

538
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,860
Nan Hao! Don't touch him!

539
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,860
If you touch him, I won't let you off!

540
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,860
Hurry and move!

541
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:37,860
Fang Si Jin

542
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,860
Does my stain hurt?

543
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,960
No.

544
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,860
Do you do this often?

545
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,860
Of course not.

546
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,860
I'm not a doctor.

547
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,860
I didn't mean that.

548
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,860
Then what is it?

549
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,860
Hero Li,

550
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,860
are you embarrassed?

551
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,860
Because I met you.

552
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,860
How is that possible?

553
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,860
I've been walking around for years.

554
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,860
I've never seen anything like this.

555
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,860
It's nothing.

556
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,860
Yes, yes, yes.

557
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,860
Everything is a small thing in your heart,

558
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,860
right?

559
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,860
Hero Li,

560
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,860
you were defeated by Nan Heng today

561
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,860
and you're holding this thing.

562
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,860
In your heart,

563
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,860
is it not a big deal?

564
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,860
Why are you talking so strangely?

565
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,860
Let me ask you.

566
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,860
About the recent assassination,

567
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,860
Nan Heng already knows that it has something to do with you.

568
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,860
How do you think you should end it?

569
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,860
I don't know.

570
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,860
Whatever.

571
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,860
Anyway, it's all about tomorrow.

572
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,860
Tonight,

573
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,860
we'll sit here.

574
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,860
Let's enjoy the lantern show.

575
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,860
After all,

576
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,860
how can there be

577
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,860
someone like you in this world?

578
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,860
Why can't there be?

579
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,860
That's because

580
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,860
in this world,

581
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,860
there are things that you can't consider

582
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,860
and things that you can't even think about.

583
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,860
If you've experienced

584
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,860
a lot of trouble

585
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,860
and want to climb to the top,

586
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,860
you should know that

587
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,860
it's actually good

588
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,860
to see the scenery

589
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,860
under the mountain.

590
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,860
Don't think too much.

591
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,860
These are all things that the main characters should think about.

592
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,860
I've always wanted to ask you

593
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,860
what the main character is.

594
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,860
And the male lead you mentioned before.

595
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,860
I'm not sure.

596
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,860
I'm not sure.

597
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,860
The male lead.

598
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,860
The male lead is usually

599
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,860
the strongest person

600
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,860
in the script.

601
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,860
He must be beautiful and strong.

602
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,860
He must have all the advantages in one body.

603
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,860
He must treat the sacrifice of others

604
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,860
as natural as possible.

605
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,860
He must be cruel and cruel.

606
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,860
He must...

607
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,860
Anyway,

608
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,860
he's not a good person.

609
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,860
You said that

610
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,860
the male lead is the main character.

611
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,860
What about me?

612
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,860
What am I?

613
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,860
You?

614
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,860
You're the supporting role.

615
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,860
The supporting role is usually

616
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,860
not important in the script.

617
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,860
It doesn't have any existence.

618
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,860
Then,

619
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,860
if I'm not important,

620
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,860
why did you save me?

621
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,860
You're right.

622
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,860
The supporting role is also important.

623
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,860
And you've helped me before.

624
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,860
So you're important to me.

625
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,860
The fireworks in the river.

626
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,860
The love and hatred of the lovers.

627
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,860
The wind blows and the water scatters.

628
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,860
The floating dust.

629
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,860
If you're not awake, you'll be lost.

630
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,860
How many times have I seen others

631
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,860
who are still in love with you?

632
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,860
I'm still in love with you.

633
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,860
The script doesn't say

634
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,860
that the fireworks in this world

635
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,860
will be so beautiful.

636
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,860
And

637
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,860
it doesn't say

638
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,860
that the love is so beautiful.

639
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,860
The supporting role

640
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,860
is also handsome.

641
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,860
Wow.

642
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,860
Nothing.

643
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,860
Ji Xiang, did you see that?

644
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,860
How many times

645
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,860
did Tingting laugh at me?

646
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,860
I have to have three times.

647
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,860
I knew it.

648
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,860
He didn't mean everything to me.

649
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,860
In the capital,

650
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,860
there are many talented people.

651
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,860
Can you find half of them

652
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,860
who can be my matchmaker?

653
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,860
There's no half.

654
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,860
I won't find the one who can be my matchmaker.

655
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,860
Get out of here.

656
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,860
Look at you.

657
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,860
Look at the rich man.

658
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,860
After so many years,

659
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,860
you're suppressed by your father.

660
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,860
You have at least half responsibility.

661
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,860
You...

662
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,860
Are you okay?

663
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,860
I'm fine.

664
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,860
I won.

665
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,860
Let's go.

666
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,860
We shouldn't go back.

667
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,860
Don't worry.

668
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,860
I love to go wherever I want.

669
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,860
Hurry up.

670
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,860
Be careful.

671
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,860
There are fireworks in the wooden box.

672
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,860
Don't let anything happen.

673
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,860
Yes.

674
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,860
Your Highness.

675
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,860
Your Highness.

676
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,860
Your Highness.

677
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,860
Qian Yu Jie.

678
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,860
What are you doing?

679
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,860
Where's my cousin?

680
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,860
Your Highness.

681
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,860
There are assassins and fires tonight.

682
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,860
General took people to search.

683
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,860
Assassins?

684
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,860
Where are they?

685
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,860
I dare to ask assassins.

686
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,860
Be careful.

687
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,860
There are fireworks here.

688
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,860
Yes.

689
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,860
It's a pity.

690
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,860
They were brought back from the jade.

691
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,860
General said he would give them to Miss Song.

692
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,860
But he said he didn't need them.

693
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,860
I've never seen

694
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,860
fireworks outside the jade.

695
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,860
If my cousin doesn't want them,

696
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,860
I'll give them to Ting Ting.

697
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,860
Give it to me.

698
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,860
I'll go with you.

699
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,860
Yes.

700
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,860
Go.

701
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,860
Go.

702
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,860
Go.

703
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,860
Go.

704
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,860
Go.

705
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,860
Go.

706
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,860
Go.

707
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,860
Go.

708
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,860
Go.

709
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,860
Go.

710
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,860
Go.

711
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,860
Go.

712
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,860
Go.

713
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,860
Go.

714
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,860
Are you okay?

715
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,860
Get up.

716
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,860
There are fireworks.

717
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,860
I'll go.

718
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,860
I'll go.

719
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,860
Go.

720
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,860
Go.

721
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,860
Go.

722
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,860
Go.

723
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,860
Go.

724
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,860
Where are you going?

725
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,860
Go inside.

726
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,540
I'm an old man and I run like this corrupt king

727
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,740
Debut

728
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:27,540
P assess

729
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,260
The flower and the flower are in the heart

730
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,460
The color of the dream is like a dream

731
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:41,260
How can love and hate hide?

732
