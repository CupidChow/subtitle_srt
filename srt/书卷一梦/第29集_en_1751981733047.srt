1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The sword is heavy.

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the deep roots of the hell.

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,200
It's better to be a man than to be a man.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,200
I am willing to be a beast.

6
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,600
I am willing to be a beast.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,600
I am willing to be a beast.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,600
I am willing to be a beast.

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
No need to wait.

10
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
No need to hate.

11
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Write your own story.

12
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
For all that I have.

13
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,800
I will be a hero forever.

14
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,580
The

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
I will not be afraid of the storm.

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
I will not regret my youth.

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,800
I will be the hero forever.

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,800
For this life and for all lives.

19
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
I will be the hero forever.

20
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
The Legend of Chusen

21
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Episode 15

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
The Legend of Chusen

23
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Do you understand?

24
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Your Majesty.

25
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
I have been awake day and night.

26
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,800
I have been following the sacred order.

27
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
For the Great Jing.

28
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
For the people.

29
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
I have been awake day and night.

30
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
I don't know

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
where I am wrong.

32
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Minister.

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Your Majesty always scolds the party and the private sector.

34
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Your Majesty is wise.

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
I am not going to

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,800
blame you for the past.

37
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Who you colluded with before.

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
What you did.

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
It doesn't matter.

40
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
What I care about

41
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,800
is the result of the trial tomorrow.

42
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Tomorrow.

43
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
The trial of the battle of Pingrong.

44
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,800
I will be fair.

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,800
I will give you the truth.

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
The battle of Pingrong

47
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,800
is the injury of the Great Jing.

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,800
I do want to ask for the truth for the people.

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
But

50
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,800
it can only be the truth I want.

51
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Minister.

52
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
I think it's too late.

53
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
I will go.

54
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Go.

55
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Minister.

56
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
You

57
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
you died.

58
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Disappointed?

59
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
I dare not.

60
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,800
I didn't mean this.

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,400
Your kindness to me is like raising my parents.

62
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,800
I feel so happy and happy.

63
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,800
But I don't know why you are so agitated today.

64
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,200
Of course, it's because of the 7th princess.

65
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,800
What are you going to do?

66
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,800
His Majesty ordered three secret councils to investigate a murder case.

67
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Nan Heng is the suspect of this case.

68
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,800
You go and get me your master.

69
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Come with me to the Ministry of Justice to be interrogated.

70
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,800
You are late. Our general is not here.

71
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Not here?

72
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Don't play tricks. Where did he go?

73
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,800
The Ministry of Justice.

74
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
He knows there are three secret councils to investigate today.

75
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,800
There is no wall that doesn't break through the wind.

76
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,800
That's good. Since he committed suicide,

77
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,800
he saved me from trouble.

78
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,800
When the general took away, he asked me to bring you a message.

79
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Say it.

80
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,800
The crime of the Yu family is not to be blamed.

81
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Today, the three secret councils are investigating the 7th prince.

82
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
What did he do?

83
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,800
I heard that the lord of the Jingzhao Temple found the evidence that the 7th prince was colluding with the traitors in the battle of Pingrong.

84
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,800
If the 7th prince can't prove his innocence, he will be beheaded.

85
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
It's starting.

86
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Nan He, you are a criminal, but you can't break through.

87
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,800
What did you do to break into the Ministry of Justice?

88
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Chu Gui Hong, as a member of the Jingzhao family,

89
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,800
you are making false evidence and forcing me to do so.

90
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,800
What did you do?

91
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Nan He, where did you get the blood?

92
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,800
The Tian Lao of the Jingzhao family.

93
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Boss.

94
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Hu.

95
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Boss.

96
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
He is torturing you.

97
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
It's okay, Ya Ya.

98
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
It's okay.

99
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Chu Gui Hong is a fool.

100
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,800
It's okay, I can't beat him.

101
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Don't worry.

102
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
When my brother is dead,

103
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,800
I will make him pay twice as much.

104
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Where are A'Long and A'Hu now?

105
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,800
They have been sent to the clinic to be treated.

106
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,800
You are raping the Tian Lao and taking away the prisoners.

107
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
This is a death sentence.

108
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,800
I won't escape from the crime I should be convicted of.

109
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,800
But Chu Gui Hong, you are making false evidence and trying to frame me.

110
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,800
I don't want any of my fellow countrymen to die in the middle of a conspiracy.

111
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
My lords.

112
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Today, the three departments will be in the trial.

113
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
The people are watching.

114
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,800
If anyone dares to hide the truth about the battle of Ping Rong,

115
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,800
I will take him to court.

116
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Don't sleep.

117
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Your employer is here to arrest you.

118
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Why are you running?

119
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I'm not here to find you.

120
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Something happened to Nan Heng.

121
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Lord Chu, you reported to Nan Heng

122
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,800
that you ordered someone to assassinate the Chihou of the Qianyu Army.

123
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Do you have any evidence?

124
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Nan Heng found out that the traitor Lu Yi was found by me.

125
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
He was afraid that the battle of Ping Rong would be exposed

126
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,800
by colluding with Lu Yi to hide the truth about the Qianyu Army's request for aid.

127
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,800
So he sent his men, A'Long and A'Hu, to kill him.

128
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,800
This is A'Long and A'Hu's confession.

129
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
A'Long and A'Hu didn't kill Lu Yi.

130
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,800
This is the evidence that you, Chu Gui Hong, fabricated.

131
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,800
They were tortured by you.

132
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
They were tortured by you.

133
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
This is the evidence.

134
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
If you don't believe me,

135
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,800
you can send word to them to come to the court.

136
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
They are your men.

137
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Then you can say whatever you want.

138
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
If it's true,

139
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,800
why would they point to me?

140
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
So it's enough to prove that

141
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,800
either you tortured them and made a confession,

142
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,800
or the evidence was fabricated by you.

143
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
What are you looking for?

144
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
I'm looking for evidence.

145
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
These are letters from Chu Gui Hong.

146
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
How could there be evidence?

147
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
I found it.

148
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Nan Heng's son is trapped in the city of You.

149
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,800
His father has set up a spy around him.

150
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
If he dares to do anything,

151
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
he will be punished.

152
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,800
This letter was written five days before the battle of Pinglong.

153
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Everyone was watching Nan Heng's every word and action.

154
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,800
How could he collude with others and not be found?

155
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
I'm going to the Ministry of Justice to file a case for him.

156
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Zhang Jian, the trial of the Three Judicial Offices is not a small matter.

157
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
All the leaders and dignitaries are here.

158
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
I've been to the execution ground.

159
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
What are you afraid of?

160
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Chu Gui Hong is clearly going to charge Nan Heng with death.

161
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
If I don't help him,

162
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
who will believe him?

163
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
I'll go to the Cangjiang Prefecture to find help.

164
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
No.

165
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
You can't involve Ye You Shen.

166
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,800
What Nan Heng needs is justice and truth.

167
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Lord Song, do you remember the battle report of the battle of Pinglong?

168
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
I dare not forget.

169
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Four years in the Western Plains,

170
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
the second day of the first lunar month,

171
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,800
the He Yuan Army wrote hundreds of names to form and inherit the people.

172
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
The soldiers are outside the city of Pinglong.

173
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,800
King Qian Yu led his troops to fight for six days.

174
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
The second day, the battle lasted for six days.

175
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
He was trapped.

176
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Later, the young general Chu Gui Hong

177
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
took the enemy's camp at night.

178
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,800
He tried to take the enemy's general Fang Shi Ming's life.

179
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,800
He didn't expect to be captured by the enemy's army.

180
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Kill!

181
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
One day,

182
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Fang Shi Ming led 30,000 soldiers of He Yuan to the city of Changqu.

183
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
They went all the way to the city of You.

184
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
King Qian Yu led his troops to guard the border.

185
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Why did the other two cities be destroyed outside the city of Pinglong?

186
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
Do you have any record?

187
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,800
King Qian Yu's 40,000 soldiers are hard to control.

188
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
Pinglong is an open city.

189
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
It's hard to attack.

190
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
It's a place for the army.

191
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,800
The city of Xing is not well guarded.

192
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,800
The enemy's army broke in first.

193
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,800
So I think there's something wrong with it.

194
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
What's wrong?

195
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
The military defense is a secret.

196
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,800
But He Yuan people are like the eyes that grow.

197
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,800
They attack the weak and the weak.

198
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,800
I think someone must have

199
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,800
revealed the situation to He Yuan people.

200
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
My father's army is strict.

201
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
King Qian Yu will not betray us.

202
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
The traitor Lu Yi that you said

203
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,800
is the descendant of King Qian Yu.

204
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Your Highness.

205
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,800
You mean Lu Yi was bought by He Yuan people?

206
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
I thought so.

207
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,800
But a traitor can return to the capital without a sound.

208
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
He returned to the capital without a sound.

209
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
He left with no sound.

210
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
I think he's not that capable.

211
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,800
There must be someone behind this.

212
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,800
The traitor not only revealed the military situation to He Yuan people

213
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,800
but also manipulated people's hearts.

214
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,800
But someone believed his conspiracy.

215
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,800
He's willing to help him cover up the truth.

216
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
I think he's a traitor.

217
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
He's a traitor.

218
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
He's a traitor.

219
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
He's a traitor.

220
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,800
The Qing Dynasty has such a traitor.

221
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Who else can it be except you, Nan He?

222
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,800
You...

223
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
You...

224
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
Father.

225
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Why are you here?

226
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,800
Minister Song, this is your family matter.

227
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
You can handle it.

228
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Minister, the battle of Pinglong is a great disaster.

229
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
The people have the right to know the truth.

230
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Please let us in.

231
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Yes, let us in.

232
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Let us in.

233
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Long Song.

234
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Let us in.

235
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
I can't decide.

236
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
You should make the decision.

237
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Father.

238
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
My ears.

239
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
My ears hurt.

240
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
Long Song.

241
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
My ears.

242
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
My eyes.

243
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
I can't see.

244
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
My ears hurt.

245
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
My eyes.

246
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Let me do it.

247
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Hold me.

248
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Minister Yan, what's going on?

249
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Why are you here?

250
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
For the truth.

251
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
For justice.

252
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,800
Song Yi Meng, what evidence do you have?

253
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Bring it here.

254
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Everyone knows that General Chu and I have a marriage agreement.

255
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,800
He often wrote to me when he was on the border.

256
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,800
This letter is written by him.

257
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:45,800
General Chu, do you mind if I read it to everyone?

258
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Since Miss Song said it was written by me, I have to read it.

259
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Fine.

260
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
You have so many eyes on you.

261
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,800
You'd better read it as the truth.

262
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,800
Nan Heng is trapped in the city of You.

263
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Father has set up a trap on his left and right.

264
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,800
If he dares to act recklessly, he will be punished.

265
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Ridiculous.

266
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Meng, when did you become such a person who can make up the truth?

267
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,800
I didn't write this letter.

268
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
It must be him.

269
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Yeah.

270
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Chu Gui Hong, how dare you say that you didn't write it?

271
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,800
Miss Song, when did you write this letter?

272
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Five days before the battle of Pingrong.

273
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,800
I hurt my right hand when I was training in the battle of Pingrong.

274
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
It was healed after the battle.

275
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
The whole Qianyu Army knows this.

276
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
How can I write a letter?

277
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
You really can't be saved.

278
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,800
General Chu, if you don't believe me, you can compare yourself.

279
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,800
If I have any lies, I will punish you as you wish.

280
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
Enough.

281
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,800
You have done this for the sake of Nan Heng.

282
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Father was ordered to kill the thousand soldiers who were in charge.

283
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,800
But he was assassinated when he arrived in Youcheng.

284
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,800
So he cut off the connection between Qianyu Army and Youcheng.

285
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
How can we keep an eye on him?

286
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,800
Chu Gui Hong, you are talking nonsense.

287
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
You are lying.

288
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,800
Everyone, this letter is a fake.

289
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,800
But Nan Heng's ambition has long been exposed.

290
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,800
He betrayed the country and lured the wolf into the city.

291
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,800
He wants to use He Yuan's sword to completely eradicate the power of Qianyu Army.

292
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
You...

293
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Listen to me. Leave first.

294
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Nan Heng, the letter is not faked.

295
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Of course I believe it's not faked.

296
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,800
How dare you lie to the public?

297
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
A letter test his character.

298
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,800
It may not be a good thing for the elder sister.

299
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,800
Lord Yan, the truth of the battle of Pinglong has been clear.

300
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
You are the chief judge today.

301
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Still not a case of punishment.

302
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Are you the same as Miss Song?

303
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,800
You are also forced by this evil person.

304
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,800
If he is really a ghost, he won't let you sit here today.

305
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,800
Father, father, no, Liu Gugu, wait for me.

306
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,800
No, no, father, no, no, father.

307
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,800
No, no, Liu Gugu, wait, wait, no, no.

308
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Liu Gugu.

309
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
What are you doing? Stop.

310
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,800
Father, you always taught me to tell you to tell me the evidence.

311
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,800
Now my cousin has no evidence.

312
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,800
How can you make a mistake and punish me?

313
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
You always quarreled with me before.

314
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Do you want to target my wife?

315
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,800
I'm helping you.

316
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
I...

317
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Father, I don't want this kind of help.

318
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
It's because you always go so far away.

319
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
That's why everyone is laughing at me.

320
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
I don't know anything.

321
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
I only know to rely on my father's fool.

322
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,800
You are blaming me.

323
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
I...

324
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
I'm blaming myself.

325
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Father, I know I was too reckless before.

326
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
That's why you have a hard time.

327
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,800
I know I was wrong.

328
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
But now I understand.

329
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
If my wife is really guilty,

330
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,800
we should investigate it in a fair and just way.

331
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
This kind of crime can be punished by the imperial power.

332
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Maybe it can be used to get her military power.

333
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,800
But if she gets the talisman, she will lose her heart.

334
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Father.

335
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Again.

336
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
I didn't arrange this.

337
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
The world is in chaos.

338
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
The human power is in danger.

339
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,800
The dark is always bright.

340
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,800
20,000 souls are the only cause of death.

341
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
The righteous are killed.

342
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
I, Yang Qian, come to you with the evidence.

343
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
What is she doing?

344
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
She is just a copy of the official document.

345
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Minister.

346
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
You have a letter, too?

347
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Thank you.

348
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Minister.

349
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
General Chu, I saw it.

350
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:51,800
I accidentally saw the letter of the seven princes, Nan Heng, and He Yuanren in the Royal Library.

351
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
I hope all the ministers can have a look.

352
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Mr. Yao, it's a capital crime to betray the country.

353
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
You can't talk nonsense.

354
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
I didn't talk nonsense.

355
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
I'm a scholar.

356
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
I read the holy books for the world.

357
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Now the capital is in such a difficult situation.

358
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,800
I dare to risk my life to kill my relatives.

359
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,800
I only want a fair judgement.

360
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
Yao Qian.

361
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,800
You should know what you have done to frame me.

362
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,800
These are the evidence I prepared for you.

363
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,800
Tomorrow His Majesty will issue an order to kill the seven princes in the Ministry of Justice.

364
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
He will kill the witnesses.

365
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
This case is very important.

366
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
You should be on the side.

367
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
Minister.

368
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,800
If I betray him like this, he won't let me go.

369
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,800
If you insist on pushing me, it will be betraying me.

370
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
Mr. Yao, don't be afraid.

371
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,800
You are a great man for the Mingyuan Army.

372
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,800
His Majesty will make the decision for you.

373
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Now the evidence is clear.

374
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Guards.

375
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,800
Take the criminal to the south and put him in jail.

376
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Wait.

377
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
You are trying to frame him.

378
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Minister, please give us the evidence.

379
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,800
His Majesty has the order.

380
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
Guards.

381
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,800
The leader of the Black Armor Army, Nan Heng colluded with He Yuan.

382
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,800
He betrayed the country and committed a crime.

383
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Zhuo Sansi put the criminal, Nan Heng, in jail.

384
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
He will be punished.

385
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Nan Heng.

386
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
You asked me to believe you once.

387
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
I believed you.

388
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
But you didn't do it.

389
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Why did you confess?

390
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,800
As long as you believe me, it's enough.

391
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
But...

392
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
Nan Heng.

393
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
Nan Heng.

394
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Even if the sky falls, we have to eat, right?

395
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
No.

396
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Nan Heng is in jail.

397
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Chu Guihong will harm him at any time.

398
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,800
I have to save him quickly.

399
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Don't blame yourself too much.

400
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,800
You have used your full strength to save him.

401
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
I'm not blaming myself.

402
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
I'm just trying to help you.

403
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
I'm not blaming myself.

404
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
I'm just trying to help you.

405
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
I'm not blaming myself.

406
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,800
I just don't want the whole world to slander him.

407
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
What are these?

408
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,800
These are all good things he's done.

409
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
Jingyang's change four years ago.

410
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
Qianyi Army did nothing.

411
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,800
He led the Black Armor Army to fight for seven days to pacify the war.

412
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,800
Five years ago, the battle of Tan City.

413
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Ten years ago, the battle of Juguo with Dongshuo.

414
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
If Nan Heng hadn't been in the battle,

415
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,800
how could he have changed the peace of the border for ten years?

416
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
He told me long ago.

417
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
I didn't take it seriously.

418
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,800
You can see clearly what happened today.

419
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Chu Guihong has His Majesty's support.

420
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,800
They are determined to fight against Nan Heng.

421
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,800
As long as he's willing to hand over the Tiger Tally,

422
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
he'll be able to save his life.

423
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,800
If you take the risk,

424
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,800
you'll only put yourself in danger.

425
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
You won't pay any attention to him.

426
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
You're right.

427
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
But, Ting,

428
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,800
do people have to do the right thing?

429
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Nan Heng has done so many good things so far.

430
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
But no one has ever trusted him.

431
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,800
No one has ever stood by his side firmly.

432
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Everyone calls him the God of Death.

433
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
He's evil.

434
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Even His Majesty hates him.

435
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,800
He's cold to him.

436
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
I know.

437
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
He pretends to be okay.

438
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
But actually,

439
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
he also hopes that everyone

440
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,800
can support him

441
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,800
and trust him.

442
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
Your Majesty,

443
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,800
Song Yimeng has come to beg Nan Heng for mercy.

444
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,800
He's kneeling outside the palace gate.

445
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
I won't see him.

446
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
The wind is strong again.

447
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
I'm afraid that he's going to fall into the snow.

448
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
Let him freeze.

449
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
I want to see

450
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,800
how long he can hold on to his old wife.

451
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
I, Song Yimeng,

452
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
beg to see Your Majesty.

453
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
Nan Heng, the Prince of Great Jin,

454
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,800
is the 12th year of the Xuans.

455
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,800
He loves the people and is very respectful.

456
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
I beg Your Majesty to forgive him.

457
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Nan Heng,

458
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
it's snowing.

459
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,800
Can you see it?

460
00:27:53,800 --> 00:28:20,700
applied for complete

461
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,960
But you want the world to scold me

462
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,560
You are a tyrant

463
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,080
I dare not

464
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,240
That day's fire

465
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,760
If it wasn't for you, they might have died like this

466
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,280
But a hero like Nan Heng

467
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,280
Only cares about the latest plan

468
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
He doesn't care about the lives of the people

469
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,240
He only wants to fight for power with the people

470
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,040
He doesn't care about letting the people give up everything

471
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Even life

472
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,640
Is this fair?

473
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,000
I, Song Yi Meng, request to see Your Majesty

474
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Nan Heng, the son of the Great Jin Emperor

475
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,800
The 12th generation of the Zhizhang family

476
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
The people love to give up everything

477
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
I request to see Your Majesty

478
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
I, Song Yi Meng, request to see Your Majesty

479
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
Nan Heng, the son of the Great Jin Emperor

480
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
The 12th generation of the Zhizhang family

481
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
The people love to give up everything

482
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
I request to see Your Majesty

483
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
This way

484
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
Uncle, you are here

485
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,800
According to Your Highness's strategy

486
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,800
You should have known I wasn't dead

487
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
Uncle is a man of the past

488
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,800
He is a man of the past

489
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
He will die easily

490
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Now I am a prisoner

491
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
The only one who can risk his life to see me

492
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,800
Is only Uncle

493
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,800
If it wasn't for all these years

494
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
You still have the luck to be with His Majesty and Chu Gui Hong

495
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,800
Why are you forced to such a situation?

496
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
Why are you forced to such a situation?

497
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
Do you regret it?

498
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,800
Uncle, you colluded with He Yuan people

499
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,800
You caused 20,000 people to die in vain

500
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,800
You caused the people of the border to die

501
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,800
Do you regret it?

502
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,800
You are indeed a dragon in the human race

503
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
You are indeed a dragon in the human race

504
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,800
I must have already known the answer

505
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,800
I must have already known the answer

506
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,800
I have no regrets

507
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,800
I have no regrets

508
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,800
From the moment Her Highness gave birth to you

509
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,800
The Gao family is destined to walk a path of blood and wind

510
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,800
The Gao family is destined to walk a path of blood and wind

511
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
The battle has already been fought for a long time

512
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,800
Your hands are destined to be covered with blood

513
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
Just 20,000 people

514
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,800
Just 20,000 people

515
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,800
Just 20,000 people

516
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
What can it be?

517
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
So in uncle's eyes

518
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,800
So in uncle's eyes

519
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,800
As long as you can help me to ascend the throne

520
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
As long as you can hold the whole pie in the hands of the Gao family

521
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
As long as you can hold the whole pie in the hands of the Gao family

522
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
No matter how many people die

523
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,800
No matter how many people die

524
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,800
I taught you since childhood

525
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
I taught you since childhood

526
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Only if you are not bullied by your own feelings

527
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Only if you are not bullied by your own feelings

528
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
You can ascend the throne

529
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
But you were weak

530
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,800
You were weak

531
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,800
I was afraid that His Majesty was not satisfied with you

532
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
I was always careful and weak

533
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,800
Even Chu Guihong can do anything to you

534
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
Even your own father

535
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Even your own father

536
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Can do such a cruel thing to you

537
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Uncle

538
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
The death of the Empress

539
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Does it have anything to do with you?

540
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,800
If I don't kill her

541
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,800
The Gao family will never be able to get out of it

542
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,800
The Gao family will never be able to get out of it

543
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,000
Excuse me

544
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,780
I'm sorry

545
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,000
But will you be able to live with that blood that was poured?

546
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,800
I love you

547
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
I would rather die than fight

548
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
I would rather die than fight

549
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,800
Leave

550
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,040
But have you ever thought

551
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,300
That everything you did

552
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,520
to fight for your own country.

553
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,200
Your Highness.

554
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,080
You want me to make a vow?

555
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,000
I tried my best to push you into the deadlock.

556
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,560
I want you to make up your mind to take the throne.

557
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,280
Your Highness, don't worry.

558
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,600
The reason why I escaped that day

559
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,880
was because there was someone in the Black Armor Army.

560
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,000
I could bring the dead body to the prison of the Jinzhao Prefecture.

561
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,560
It was because there was someone in Qianyu Army

562
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
who was also in the Black Armor Army.

563
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,480
I have 3,000 soldiers

564
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,680
to secretly ambush outside the city.

565
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,280
Once His Highness gives the order,

566
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,400
we can make a deal

567
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,520
to surround the palace

568
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,400
and imprison His Highness.

569
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,560
Uncle, you think I

570
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,520
and my mother are your pawns?

571
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,480
You said that for the Gao family.

572
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,320
Aren't you afraid that the Gao family

573
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,680
will be blamed for their death?

574
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,720
Those who take the bait will be killed. Those who take the bait will be killed.

575
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,320
Your Highness, don't hesitate anymore.

576
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,120
This is the last chance I can give you.

577
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,480
Now that you are in danger,

578
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,560
you can only ask for more soldiers to rebel.

579
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,040
Do you have any other choice?

580
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,880
So, the Great Jin's Great Ghost

581
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,240
is Gao Changying.

582
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,920
What a great Jin's name

583
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,080
is trying to kill the empress

584
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,080
and betray the country.

585
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,040
He even wants to raise an army to rebel.

586
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,280
I am really

587
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,000
a useless emperor.

588
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,880
It seems that this is a game

589
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,840
that His Highness and His Majesty play together.

590
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,760
What do you want from me?

591
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,680
Your Majesty,

592
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,640
I heard what 18th Brother said.

593
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,800
He confirmed that Gao Changying is not dead.

594
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,880
He has been hiding behind the scenes.

595
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,200
So I beg Your Majesty

596
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,000
to play with me

597
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,720
to lure Gao Changying to show up.

598
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,240
Why should I believe you?

599
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,280
Your Majesty, you don't have to believe me.

600
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,400
Just take it as a gamble.

601
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,880
Ridiculous.

602
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,520
In your heart,

603
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,880
the Great Jin's Great Ghost is a game?

604
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,920
I dare not.

605
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,920
But I am willing to bet.

606
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,440
You are so picky.

607
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,680
Then tell me

608
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,960
what you want.

609
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,600
If my plan

610
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,440
can't lure Gao Changying out,

611
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,360
I am willing to hand over the Black Armor Army Tiger Tally

612
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,880
and leave the government

613
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,560
and never return to the capital.

614
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,080
Your Highness, you really don't care about the past?

615
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,560
You insist on killing me?

616
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,480
Uncle,

617
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,880
I let go of my obsession.

618
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,960
Everything is over.

619
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,240
That's so funny.

620
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,280
Your Highness, your ungrateful heart

621
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,040
really makes me feel relieved.

622
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,320
Why did you

623
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,240
kill interest of scar?

624
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:40,320
Who killed the

625
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,320
Your Majesty.

626
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,720
Shouldn't you be in the prison?

627
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,720
How could you...

628
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,400
Your Highness! Your Highness!

629
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,560
Gao Xiang has confessed!

630
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,240
Thank you for your help!

631
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
I...

632
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,240
Miss Song.

633
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,080
Gao Xiang confessed?

634
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,080
Yes.

635
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,320
So,

636
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,120
you're not really in trouble.

637
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,520
It's just a game you played.

638
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,640
Then why did you...

639
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
Fine.

640
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,800
I'm too stupid.

641
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,080
Let's go.

642
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,160
I...

643
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,640
I wanted to hide it from you.

644
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
It's because

645
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,360
my uncle is too powerful.

646
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,640
That's why it happened.

647
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,120
Listen to me.

648
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,760
Today, when we had a meeting,

649
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,160
you suddenly appeared.

650
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,520
I was quite surprised.

651
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,280
I didn't expect you to care about me so much.

652
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,800
You trusted me so much.

653
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,040
Who cares about you?

654
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,600
Who trusts you?

655
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,760
You should go to the prison right now.

656
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,080
You should die in there.

657
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,920
Listen to me.

658
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,040
From now on,

659
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,760
we're even.

660
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,920
We're even.

661
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,120
Don't come to me again.

662
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:42,840
No.

663
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:43,720
You...

664
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,600
I'll follow you to the bridge you're going to.

665
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,280
I'll follow you to the bridge you're going to.

666
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,200
You're the one who follows me.

667
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,360
It's the Naihe Bridge.

668
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,320
The Huangquan Road.

669
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
No, Su Yimeng.

670
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:51,920
No.

671
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,280
I'm telling you for the last time.

672
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,400
Before I'm gone,

673
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
don't let me see you.

674
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,000
Su Yimeng.

675
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,160
When are you going to be gone?

676
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,280
Su Yimeng.

677
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,840
You bastard,

678
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,840
stop!

679
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,680
Don't let him go.

680
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,080
Time flies.

681
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,520
I can't forget about you.

682
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,600
I'm suspicious.

683
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,440
Time flies.

684
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,160
What does time mean?

685
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,520
The drug for thejść

686
00:40:44,160 --> 00:41:06,760
Luckily I caught a變

687
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,280
How many cold questions

688
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:24,280
You and I are fated to be entangled in the wrong

689
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,280
The wind blows gently in the ear

690
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,280
The black night's attempts

691
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,520
The eyes are

692
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,280
Shou yi luan rizhu

693
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,280
