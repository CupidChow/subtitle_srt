00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,030
I didn't expect there to be such a place

in the script world.

00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,150
The people and stories I didn't even write

10
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,280
are so interesting,

11
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,750
even better than the ones I did write.

12
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,480
No offense, Mr. Screenwriter,

13
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,460
but what you wrote
really wasn't that great.

14
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,870
Look at the stories we actors
came up with ourselves.

15
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,840
They're way better than yours,
don't you think?

Tell me,

17
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,680
why did you bring me here?

18
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,840
I wanted you to understand what it means

right?

29
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,190
But in my eyes,

30
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,190
they're living, breathing people.

31
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,160
Every day of their lives is real,

they all just want to live in the moment.

Yes.

But if you're asking me to hand
Yiting over to someone else,

I'm afraid I can't do that.

Don't tell me you want to marry Yiting?

If she's willing to marry me,

then I'm willing to marry her.

You are right.

give her the life she wants?

Good that you understand!

94
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,659
But later, I realized I was wrong.

95
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,800
Because what Song Yiting wants
isn't a marriage,

96
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,260
nor a match
that just looks perfect on paper.

97
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,950
She wants someone
who can roam the world with her

to her myself.

102

If she wants a life free of constraints,

00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll gladly go with her.

104
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,800
If she wants to experience
the joys of marriage,

105
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,460
I'll marry her with proper rites
and tradition.

106
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,000
Or perhaps,

107
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,040
I can marry into her family.

108
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,330

have you been through in real life

113
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,390
to come up with
a character like Mrs. Song,

114
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,240
someone who likes to break couples up?

115
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,430
If you had just been merciful

116
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,950
and let Song Yiting marry Nan Heng,

117
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,480
wouldn't this whole drama
have been avoided?

118

What's wrong with His Highness?

119
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,040
Strange.

120
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,870
It's truly weird.

121
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,430
Your energy and blood are both depleted.

122
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,159
Your Highness,
this looks like a serious injury.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,980
Could it be...

124
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,680
that the wound
he suffered on his wedding day

125
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,880
still hasn't healed?

126
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,200
No, that can't be it.

127
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,040
Even during the worst days of his injury,

128
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,630
his body wasn't this weak.

129
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,480
So why has it only gotten worse

130
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,270
over time?

131
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,190
It feels more like

132
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,210
that injury

133
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,560
triggered some deeper illness.

134
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,650
Is there any way to treat it?

135
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,360
I can only

136
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,000
try some tonics

137
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,040
to replenish your energy and blood,

138
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,500
and observe how things go.

What are you doing here?

I just returned to the capital.

142
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,680
I shouldn't be interfering
in your family affairs.

143
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,950
Then please don't.

144
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,190
Madam, what you said

145
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,140
is rather unpleasant to hear.

146
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,390
Unpleasant or not,

147
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,680
this is still the Song family's business,

148
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,720
not something for outsiders to meddle in.

149
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,720
That may have been true before,

150
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,510
but now

151
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,450
it's also the business of the Chu family.

152

Don't you want a son-in-law

who's a good match in status?

154
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,750
Then today,

155
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,870
I'll officially adopt
Shangguan He as my son

156
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,530
and give him the status
of a prince's household.

157
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,120
Adopted son?

158
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,120
That's great.

159
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,560
My father and the old lord

160
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,760
were sworn brothers.

161
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,950
And now Yiting and Chu He are in love—

162
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,650
what could be more perfect?

163
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,680
Madam,

164
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,560
if Father knows about it,

165
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,630
he'll be thrilled.

166
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,310
Wait.

167
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,440
You're already calling him Chu He now?

168
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,730
Our Second Master sure gave up
a lot just to get a wife.

169

He's a real man.

170
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,460
Family name is just a superficial thing.

00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,270
didn't you keep saying he was just

173
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,330
a nobody from the martial arts world?

174
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,870
Are you satisfied now?

175
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,670
I... I...

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,790
I...

177
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,670
What are you waiting for?

178
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,120
Hurry up and call him Father.

179
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,960
Well...

180
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,630
It's...

181
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,600
In the blink of an eye,
I suddenly have a father.

182
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,060
Isn't this all too sudden?

183
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,440
Don't hesitate.

184
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,120
Shanhu,

185
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,250
get paper and brush.

186
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,200
There's no better time than the present.

187
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,660
Today, let's sign the marriage contract
between the Song family and Chu family.

188
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,030
He finally did something good.

189
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,890
Father, what exactly
was your intention with this?

190
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,090
Naturally, it's to deal with Nan Heng.

191
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,330
Deal with Nan Heng?

192
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,910
What does this marriage
have to do with him?

193
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,440
Could it be...

194
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,270
that you want to bring Shangguan He
and the Song family

195
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,270
into our camp

196
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,810
to drive a wedge
between them and Nan Heng?

197
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,880
From your character's point of view,

198
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,440
whatever you think is right.

199
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,510
I had my reasons

200
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,790
for doing this.

201
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,600
Nan Heng should be

202
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,750
close to death from his illness by now.

203
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,530
[Your Majesty, I am willing to take Shangguan as my adopted son
and personally teach him to serve the country. I humbly ask for your gracious consent.]

204
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,670
He used to be Shangguan Baihe,

205
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,600
then Shangguan He.

206
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,770
Now, look at him.

207
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,360
He's lost even the Shangguan surname.

208
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
I must say, He,

209
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,070
you're really generous.

210
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,320
Shut up.

211
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,600
Lord Qianyu came at a strange time

212
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,730
and acts strangely.

213
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,480
Though he seems to strike blindly,

214
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,210
I suspect...

215
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,030
there's more to this.

216
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,630
Fugui.

217
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,380
Dismiss everyone.

218
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,490
There's nobody else here, Your Highness.

219
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,930
[Lofty Aspirations]

220
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,630
What's so secret

221
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,160
that even Fugui can't hear?

222
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,360
Have you ever heard of

223
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,830
the script world?

224
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,570
[As per custom, we respectfully ask for your daughter's name
and seek your approval for the marriage. Chu Li.]

225
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,800
Come on, Father,

226
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,200
I've already taken care of it.

227
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,120
why do you still look so worried?

228
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,550
Yimeng,

229
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,270
why did Chu Li

230
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,080
help Shangguan He and Yiting?

231
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,730
He certainly wanted
to prove that, in this world, he...

232
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,470
He wanted to solve
your biggest problem, of course.

233
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,030
Father,

234
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,720
you actually quite like Shangguan He,

235
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,390
don't you?

236
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,150
And you don't want Yiting
to marry into the royal family,

237
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,360
right?

238
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,240
Nothing escapes your sharp eyes.

239
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,600
See?

240
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,150
The family's long-lasting conflict

241
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,030
is finally coming to an end.

242
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,700
Let me enjoy some peace and quiet now.

243
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,140
Song Yude!

244
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,820
I've been looking all over for you!

245
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,630
Come, come.

246
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,830
Honey.

247
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,840
The marriage contract is already signed.

248
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,120
Please stop causing trouble.

249
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,910
Wait.

250
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,600
I'm not the one causing trouble.

251
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,360
Get your facts straight.

252
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,790
It's your precious daughter
who is causing trouble.

253
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,000
She says she won't marry him.

254
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,910
She says

255
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,150
she won't marry Chu He until she hears him

256
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,960
confess his feelings to her in person.

257
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,880
You're really driving me crazy!

258
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,600
Wait a moment.

259
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,150
Let me process this.

260
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,720
Are you saying
this storybook created its own world

261
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,450
and we are all characters in it?

262
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,080
When I first heard this,

263
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,170
I had the same reaction as you.

264
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,600
This...

265
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,530
This is absolutely preposterous.

266
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,120
I understand

267
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,720
it's hard

268
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,200
to accept now.

269
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,320
No, no, no.

270
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,880
I've long thought something was strange.

271
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,840
How could

272
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,390
such an

273
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,990
incredibly handsome face exist
in this world?

274
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,120
So you are from a storybook?

275
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,640
That explains everything.

276
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,080
Tell me,

277
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,360
what kind of ending

278
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,010
could someone like me have?

279
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,120
I'm sure I'm more popular with the readers

280
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,850
than you, a cold-faced prince.

281
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,870
You

282
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,990
don't have an ending.

283
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:41,010
[One with Light and Dust]

284
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,870
Which means

285
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,270
Shangguan He wasn't even

286
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,120
in the original script.

287
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,110
What?

288
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,870
How is that possible?

289
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,050
Then how did I come into existence?

290
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,960
I think

291
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,390
you must be a character born

292
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,150
from the workings of this script world,

293
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,440
someone who appeared out of nowhere

294
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,300
and could vanish just as quickly.

295
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,720
Someone who appeared out of nowhere

296
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,580
and could vanish just as quickly.

297
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,030
Yes.

298
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,720
I believe the identity of Li Shiliu

299
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,910
came about because of

300
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,550
the unpredictable changes

301
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,200
during the script's progression.

302
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,360
The changes became too overwhelming

303
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,510
to control,

304
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,270
so the screenwriter took the form
of Lord Qianyu and came here.

305
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,260
Then tell me,

306
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,150
does this storybook

307
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,840
include Song Yiting?

308
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,840
Yes.

309
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,080
Who did she end up marrying?

310
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,410
The Eighteenth Prince?

311
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,420
She married me.

312
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,360
You?

313
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,270
Don't worry.

314
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,910
I have absolutely
no interest in Song Yiting.

315
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,910
I'm telling you this

316
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,240
because I think there's something fishy

317
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,570
about this Lord Qianyu.

318
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,200
But it's strange.

319
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,720
According to the storybook,

320
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,670
he should be trying hard to match you

321
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,030
with Song Yiting.

322
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,910
So why did he end up arranging
for her to marry me instead?

323
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,240
The one controlling the game

324
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,750
only needs to move
a single piece to change everything.

325
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,550
So,

326
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,910
we need to figure out

327
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,720
his next move quickly.

328
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
Know yourself and know your enemy,

329
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,140
and you'll never be defeated.

330
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,030
But…

331
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,790
you're not saying

332
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,640
I should do the investigation, are you?

333
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,360
You've been around Song Yiting
so long that

334
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,480
you've even learned
to jump in and answer questions.

335
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,550
And now,

336
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,070
you're Lord Qianyu's adopted son.

337
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:16,910
That makes you

338
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,080
the perfect person to look into this.

339
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,840
We're all just fictional characters,

340
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,910
so why do some

while others

don't even get a chance to fight back?

344
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,930
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

345
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,480
I'm the male lead.

346
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,970
What the hell is a male lead?

347
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,080
So your fate is completely

348
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,120
controlled by the writer, isn't it?

349
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,170
Is that interesting?

[Lofty Aspirations]

351
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,030
I appeared out of nowhere

352
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,440
and could vanish just as quickly.

353
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,240
My life is far more interesting.

354
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,750
Wait.

355
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,810
Doesn't that just mean

356
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,510
I came from nothing

357
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,680
and could vanish into nothing too?

358
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,550
Am I going to disappear?

359
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,400

No!

and could vanish just as quickly?

Yiting,

366
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,440
you have to understand,

367
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,240
people have different personalities.

368
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,790
Shangguan He

369
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
has always been carefree.

370
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,270
It's normal that he doesn't know
how to express his feelings.

371
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,880
But everything he said
at Waning River Crescent today

372
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,110
must have come from
the bottom of his heart.

373
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,400
He didn't say a word about love,

374
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,640
but every word showed that

375
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,790
he cares about you,

376
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,680
likes you,

377
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,010
and wants to be with you.

378
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,750
A confession

379
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,240
is just one way to express one's feelings.

380
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,840
Is it really that important?

381
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,220
You don't understand.

382
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,030
I've made my feelings clear
to him for so long,

383
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,110
but he has never once
said anything in return.

384
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,240
I don't understand?

385
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,440
Me, a married woman with experience,

386
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,570
I don't understand?

387
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,750
You just lie there doing nothing.

What's up?

396
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,690
Your Highness,

397
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,200
I heard everything

398
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,530
you said to Shangguan He

399
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,080
in the courtyard today.

400
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,240
So...

401
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
you know about the script world now?

402
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,790
I do.

403
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,360
And you've accepted it?

404
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,130
Your Highness,

405
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,510
you thought that,

406
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,480
with my personality, I'd make a huge scene

407
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,210
when I found out, didn't you?

408
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,790
I was shocked at first.

409
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,750
But after eating eight buns

410
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,750
and running ten laps around
the Crown Prince's Residence,

411
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,680
I suddenly understood everything.

412
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,180
Have I ever seen
this so-called "real world"

413
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,680
outside the storybook?

414
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,910
I haven't.

415
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,130
So it doesn't exist.

416
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,680
And since it doesn't exist,

417
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,110
why can't I treat this place

418
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,640
as the real world?

419
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,800
I didn't expect
you'd come to that conclusion.

420
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,640
Well, I did grow up with you.

421
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,270
Not like that Shangguan He—

422
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,870
who knows where he came from.

423
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,970
Your Highness,

424
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,940
why didn't you tell him

425
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,890
you've been coughing up blood?

426
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,520
I didn't tell him

427
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,370
because I didn't want him to worry.

428
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,480
And you're keeping it
from the Crown Princess too?

429
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,280
That's right.

430
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,270
She absolutely cannot know.

431
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,830
If Lord Qianyu is really that powerful,

432
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,220
what will happen if you

I don't know yet.

00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,110
But no matter what,

437
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,130
I must find a way to change the ending,

438
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,720
because when we got married,

439
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,160
I promised her
I would protect her for life.

440
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,020
Your Highness,

441
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,150
that's my wish as well.

442
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,550
I may be slow,

443
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,400
but I'm not stupid.

444
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,310
If what you told Shangguan He

445
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,510
wasn't dangerous,

446
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,040
then why didn't you tell me?

447
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,720
Isn't it because you were afraid

448
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,830
I'd expose your health issues

449
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,720
and mess up the plan against Lord Qianyu?

450

I have my own plans.

451
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,900
Yes!

452
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,530

when we returned to the capital,

455
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,190
when you were wronged,

456
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,270
even when your life
was hanging by a thread.

457
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,130
Your Highness,

458
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,710
let me ask you one thing:

459
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,070
in your plans,

460
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,280
have you ever considered your own safety?

461
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,350
Of course I'll consider

462
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,660
my own safety.

463
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,040
Really?

464
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,930
If there really is a storybook,

465
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,210
then I was written

466
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,310
to protect you.

467
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,790
I know everything

468
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,720
you plan to do.

469
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,880
If—

470

I'm just saying if—

471
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,510
I knew that wound would hurt you so badly,

472
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,830
I definitely
wouldn't have listened to you—

473
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,000
I would have tried my best
to kill Chu Guihong first.

474

I know you're loyal.

477
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,440
Then promise me

478
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,270
you'll include your own safety

479
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,350
in your plans.

480
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,440
Fine.

481
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,110
I still don't believe you.

482
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,510
Unless you tell me

483
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,440
your detailed plan now,

484
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,500
I can't be at ease.

485
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,030
Don't push it too far.

486
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,350
Fine.

487
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,110
From now on, take me with you

488
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,840
when you go to discuss matters.

489
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,100
Your Highness,

490
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,400
remember this:

491
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,830
in the storybook, I was written

492
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,490
to be completely loyal to you.

493
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,830
Unlike that Shangguan He,

494
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,270
who could vanish any moment

495
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,270
and just fly away.

496
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,870
When that happens, who will you turn to?

497
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,920
It'll still be me.

498
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,920
I got it.

499
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,830
Nan Heng.

500
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,230
Nan Heng.

501
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,680
Today, on my way back to my room,

502
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,810
I smelled medicine.

503
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,000
Is your injury still not fully healed?

504
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:30,750
Come.

505
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,970
Turn around.

506
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,920
Let me see.

507
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,640
No, no, no.

508
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,510
I'm fine now.

509
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,350
I've been fine for a while.

510
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,550
The imperial physician
gave me some prescriptions,

511
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,950
and now I'm out of danger.

512
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,400
Really?

513
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,400
Really.

514
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,240
You're lying.

515
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,250
You always pretend to be fine
when you are not.

516
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,000
I need to see for myself to be sure.

517
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,750
Let me take a look.

518
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,480
I have something to ask you.

519
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,590
Just one quick look.

520
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,350
No, no, wait.

521
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,880
I need to ask you something.

522
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,270
What did you and Lord Qianyu do

523
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,960
at Waning River Crescent today?

524
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,640
And...

525
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,080
why did he adopt Shangguan He as his son?

526
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,750
Nan Heng.

527
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,510
Why did...

528
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,880
Can we please

529
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,140
keep work talk out of private time?

530
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,160
Come on,

531
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,310
don't worry.

532
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,550
Lord Qianyu

533
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,310
is gradually fitting into this world.

534
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,160
Otherwise, how could he have outdone Madam

535
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,820
and helped Shangguan He and Yiting
get engaged?

536
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,130
But he wanted to take you away
this morning.

537
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,640
While we women
are busy handling things outside,

538
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,790
can you men

539
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,500
stop overthinking

540
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,960
at home?

541
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,680
Okay?

542
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,980
Trust me this once.

543
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,310
Okay.

544
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,160
Nan Heng.

545
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,990
Take off your boots.

546
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,590
And your belt too.

547
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,160
Here.

548
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,850
Your outer robe,

549
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,310
take that off too.

550
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,610
You're acting a bit strange today.

551
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,280
Here.

552
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,550
What are you doing?

553
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,110
Nan Heng.

554
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,200
What?

555
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,790
Nan Heng,

556
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,030
I like you.

557
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,880
How much do you like me?

558
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,880
I like you so much that

559
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,430
if you and an ATM
both fell into the river,

560
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,240
I wouldn't hesitate to save you first.

561
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,740
An ATM?

562
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,020
I don't know who that is,

563
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,760
but...

564
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,320
it surely can't beat Xuanjia Army, right?

565
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,150
You fool.

566
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,960
Anyway,

567
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,590
that's a romantic line.

568
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,700
And from now on,

569
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,970
I'll say sweet things to you often.

570
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,430
Before,

571
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,630
you took so many steps toward me.

572
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,240
From now on,

573
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,960
I'll be the one walking toward you.

574
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,950
Love isn't just about words.

575
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,310
You need to show it with actions.

576
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:46,760
Really?

577
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:48,980
Yes.

578
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,210
I'm not talking about this.

579
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,550
Didn't you tell me to take action?

580
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,160
So I'm showing you my actions.

581
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,960
Well...

582
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:14,830
Wait.

583
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,830
You haven't taken off your hairpin yet.

584
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,590
In costume dramas,
no one really minds that.

585
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,720
What if it pricks me?

586
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,790
You must have OCD.

587
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,140
If it pricks you, we'll deal with it then.

588
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,180
Dongting red oranges!

589
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,510
Dongting red oranges!

590
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,910
Juicy and delicious Dongting red oranges!

591
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,290
Take a look.

592
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,660
Dongting red oranges.

593
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,900
Last time we bought some Dongting
red oranges, and then things went wrong.

594
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,650
This time…

595
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,720
You're worrying too much.

596
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,230
Last time, it was because we bought them
to honor my mother.

597
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,350
This time we're buying them
to give to Father.

598
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,270
That's not the same.

599
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,200
It's different.

600
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,440
Here.

601
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,160
Take it.

602
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,260
Your Highness.

603
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,270
Rong Hua? What brings you here?

604
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,610
May I have a word with you
in private, Your Highness?

605
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,350
It's just a engagement,

606
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,250
yet such a grand event.

607
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,470
You really hold my Song family

608
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,680
in high regard.

609
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,310
Song, you're too polite.

610
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,200
In the capital, only our two families

611
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,160
are noble families in the whole drama.

612
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,360
It should be this way.

613
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,540
But Your Highness,

614
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,480
you actually made time to attend

615
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,480
your sister-in-law's engagement.

616
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,240
Some things can't reach a conclusion

617
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,110
without seeing them with your own eyes.

618
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,000
Besides,

619
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,400
your recent actions

620
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,790
have all involved people close to me,

621
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,540
which naturally

622
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,180
made me a little suspicious.

623
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,350
I'm getting old.

624
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,750
What schemes could I have?

625
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,590
I just want to see the younger generation

626
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,550
settle down peacefully.

627
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,210
Guihong wasn't lucky enough
to marry a Song girl,

628
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,590
but He

629
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,490
honored the old friendship
between me and Song.

630
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,720
Indeed.

631
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,550
However...

632
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,640
I consulted
the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

633
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,110
and it seems there's no
suitable wedding date

634
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,000
within the next six months.

635
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,350
So perhaps this matter should...

636
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,550
I think you're trying

637
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,440
to call off the engagement because

638
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,640
Miss Song Yiting refuses to get married.

639
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,510
Chu Guihong,

640
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,500
why are you everywhere?

641
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,280
You even know about
the Song family's affairs.

642
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,770
Yesterday, Guihong was on patrol

643
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,550
and happened to run into Mrs. Song,

644
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,750
so they chatted a bit.

645
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,090
Happened to?

646
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,340
Mrs. Song went to Waning River Crescent,

647
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,940
and you just happened
to take in an adopted son.

648
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,350
Chu Guihong also "happened"

649
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,070
to hear about the Song family's affairs.

650
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,800
What a coincidence.

651
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,440
That's what they say:

652
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,370
"No coincidences, no good story."

653
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:50,960
Song,

654
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,510
I suddenly need to use the restroom.

655
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,510
Could you wait a moment?

656
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,110
Of course.

657
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,110
This way, please.

658
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,940
[Graceful and Composed]

659
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,400
Shangguan He,

660
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,070
we've already rolled out
the red carpet for you.

661
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,330
Is it really that hard to say
"I like you?"

662
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,350
What exactly are you hesitating about?

663
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,210
Your Highness,

664
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,480
Mrs. Li,

665
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,160
please stay out of this matter, okay?

666
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,400
I'm begging you.

667
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Stop right there.

668
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,310
Come back.

669
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,220
Between Nan Heng and me,

670
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,400
you and Yiting have meddled quite a bit.

671
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,160
So it's only fair

672
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,640
that I return the favor.

673
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,480
Didn't you once tell me

674
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,240
that people like us

675
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,350
have to risk everything

676
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,350
for someone in our lifetime?

677
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,520
You and I

678
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,050
are both lazy souls

679
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,660
with no grand ambitions.

680
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,010
Don't we just want a peaceful, comfortable
life?

681
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,270
But if, in your whole life,

682
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,590
you never meet even one or two people

683
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,320
worth risking everything for,

684
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,970
and you just merely exist,

685
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,920
can you say you've truly lived?

686
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,830
I believed you

687
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,110
and acted on it.

688
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,610
But what about you?

689
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,490
You clearly care
about Yiting more than anyone.

690
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,400
So why do you only say sweet things

691
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,640
behind her back

692
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,700
but stay silent when you're with her?

693
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,240
Chief told me

694
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,380
I don't exist in the storybook.

695
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,960
How could a nonexistent person

696
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,640
give her a happy ending?

697
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,290
The storybook?

698
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,220
So you know everything?

699
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,640
So,

700
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,960
you don't want me to suddenly disappear

701
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,890
and leave your sister
all alone in this world, right?

702
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,280
How could you suddenly disappear?

703
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,640
Things aren't as bad as you think.

704
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,240
Trust me. Really.

705
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,100
Second Master.

706
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,130
Second Master.

707
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,350
bad news.

708
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,510
Something happened.

709
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,640
The enemy showed up at our place.
Go check it out quickly!

710
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,810
Eighteenth Prince,

711
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,440
Why did you specifically invite me

712
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,190
to Waning River Crescent?

713
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
This way, please.

714
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,670
Yiting.

715
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,080
You gave him 73 portraits.

716
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,620
I have one more than him.

717
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,880
As long as you agree,

718
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,510
Father's imperial edict for our marriage

719
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:50,370
will surely come before
the Chu family's proposal.

720
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,700
Eighteenth Prince,

721
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,480
didn't you already ask His Majesty
to cancel the imperial marriage grant?

722
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,740
What are you doing now?

723
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,270
Well,

724
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,110
just consider it a moment of impulse.

725
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,530
Please don't blame me.

726
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,280
Isn't this Shangguan He?

727
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,160
Yiting,

728
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,830
I can accept you don't like me,

729
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,790
but I can't just watch you

730
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,000
marry someone who doesn't care about you.

731
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,810
Yiting,

732
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,880
I like you.

733
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,030
I can write love letters
and poems for you,

734
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,590
confess my feelings in front of

735
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,480
all the noble ladies of the capital,

736
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,660
and ask Father for your hand.

737
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,000
I can do anything you want.

738
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,480
But what about Chu He?

739
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,830
What can he do for you?

740
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,970
So, Eighteenth Prince,

741
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,460
are you here to steal the bride today?

742
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,750
Yes.

743
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,590
I cherish Yiting

744
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,720
and love her deeply.

745
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,960
That's why, before everyone here,

746
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,800
I'm here to steal the bride!

747
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,200
I support the Eighteenth Prince!

748
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,440
Me too!

749
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,650
I support the Eighteenth Prince!

750
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,640
You really scared me.

751
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,590
Your Highness,

752
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,800
you have such a villainous aura!

753
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,770
Those with clear consciences

754
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,320
have nothing to fear.

755
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,699
In broad daylight,

756
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,800
why are you so nervous?

757
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,760
Could there be

758
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:22,820
other reasons behind

759
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,750
Shangguan He's engagement?

760
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,380
You've started suspecting me already?

761
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,600
Song Yimeng told me

762
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,230
you worked

763
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,150
tirelessly

764
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,230
for this script.

765
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,710
But now, seeing it changed like this,

766
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,000
I'd want to turn the tide

767
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,030
and set the story back on track

768
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,670
if I were you.

769
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,150
Why would I do that?

770
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,070
Of course you would.

771
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,030
I don't believe

772
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,090
you actually want to stay here.

773
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,640
Well, you actually guessed right.

774
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,550
Nan Heng,

775
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,150
after the wedding,

776
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,710
have you

777
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,150
felt unwell?

778
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,710
Is it getting worse
as the Song and Chu families

779
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,180
are getting engaged?

780
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,070
Marry him!

781
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:22,920
Marry him!

782
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,710
Marry him!

783
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,490
Marry him!

784
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,370
Marry him!

785
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,270
Marry him!

786
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,040
Marry him!

787
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:27,960
Marry him!

788
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,810
Marry him!

789
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:29,730
Marry him!

790
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,520
Marry him!

791
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,390
Marry him!

792
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,020
Marry him!

793
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,170
At a time like this,

794
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,330
why are you still staying silent?

795
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,230
Do you really want Yiting to marry him?

796
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:36,760
I...

797
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,400
Marry him!

798
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,200
Marry him!

799
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,030
Marry him!

800
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,850
Marry him!

801
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,610
Marry him!

802
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,990
I'll count to three.

803
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,230
If no one objects,

804
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,640
I'll take your silence as consent.

805
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,710
Let me tell you, Shangguan He,

806
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,240
you better not regret this.

807
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,110
Three!

808
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,600
Two!

809
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,800
One...

810
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,730
No need to count.

811
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,750
I accept.

812
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:09,700
What?

813
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,980
You agreed so quickly?

814
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,090
Don't you want to think it over?

815
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,550
I chased you so many times before

816
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,150
and you never accepted.

817
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,070
Why suddenly today...

818
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:15,550
I didn't want to marry you before,

819
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,210
but now I do. Is that a problem?

820
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,550
Well...

821
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,140
It's not a problem at all.

822
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:20,840
Yiting,

823
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,590
I'm actually quite happy
to hear you say that.

824
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,710
But you know,

825
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,710
a relationship like ours

826
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,190
sometimes needs to...

827
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,000
Enough.

828
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,230
You men

829
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,470
are all so indecisive.

830
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,000
I'll go to the palace myself
and ask for the decree.

831
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,480
Yiting.

832
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,400
Wait!

833
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,930
Song Yiting, let me ask you,

834
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,850
what kind of love do you truly want?

835
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,810
Love that asks nothing

836
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,390
of the past or future,

837
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,880
understanding each other
and staying together,

838
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,150
and sharing life's journey
to the ends of the earth.

839
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,680
Asks nothing of the future?

840
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,460
What if I suddenly disappear?

841
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,230
Whether you stay or go,

842
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,480
it's your choice.

843
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,490
When have I ever forced you?

844
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,070
What if I leave this world before you do?

845
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,420
Then I'll keep you forever in my heart

846
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,360
and go find the next love,

847
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,860
and the one after that.

848
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,820
There are plenty of men in this world.

849
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,050
I, Song Yiting,

850
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,280
would never waste my youth

851
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,400
mourning over a coffin.

852
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,400
What a heartless Song Yiting.

853
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,070
I don't understand what they're saying,

854
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,800
but I can see what's happening.

855
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,670

what are you doing?

899
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,850
Yimeng,

900
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,560
it's...

901
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,320
Actually,

902
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,440
my uncle sent me to help.

Help?

904

00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,150
this is intentional,

906
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,080
a fake proposal?

Besides the two you already know,

there are two more.

00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,630
One

912
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,620
is related to my returning.

I can go back.

916

And the last one is—

917
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,360
changing iconic scenes

918
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,970
comes at a price.
