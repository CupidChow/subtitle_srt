He can escape from death

Are you crazy? We'll die if we jump!

Just trust me this once.

Jumping off a cliff in this world

00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,890
definitely won't kill us.

Yeah right, like I'd trust you...

182

That's right.

188
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,680
I'm the female lead

who got inexplicably dragged
into this.

190
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,610
Just think of me as someone

I know this is all hard for you to accept,

but this is the truth.

195

If we keep being together,

196
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,790
not only will you turn me into
a human pig,

197
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,190
but the whole Song family

198

and trying to leave here

202
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,330

everything you're saying right now,

00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,240
I hope you

207
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,710
can give me some time.

208
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,210
I'll go figure something out.

209

and has wasted many years waiting
in her chamber.

Now, looking throughout
the entire capital,

besides Heng,

who else could you find

231
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,660
that would be a suitable match for her?

232
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,550

My daughter

241
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,220
has a terrible temper

242
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,480
and really isn't fit to be
the future empress.

243
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,930
Her character is indeed flawed.

244
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,840
Exactly.

245
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,080
But she's quite open-minded.

246

I actually find her

247
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,530
quite admirable now.

Your Highness, why are you injured?

Say something, will you!

381
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,800
Are you worried about me?

Of course!

383
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,750
Why?

384
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,050
We've grown up together since childhood,

385
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,410
been through life and death together
for so many years,

386
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,400
and you've treated me so well.

387
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,310
If I don't care about you, then who else
would I care about?

388
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,960
Your Highness.

389
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,420
Let's get back first and
talk about it later.

Let me ask you,

392
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,030
what if all of this is fake?

393
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,350
Fake?

394
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,050
I mean hypothetically,

395
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,760
if this world we live in

396
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,870
is actually inside a storybook,

397
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,520
what would you do?

398
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,590
In a storybook?

399
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,030
Well...

400
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,980
If we're in a storybook,

401
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,990
is Your Highness's kindness to me real?

402
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,240
It is real.

403
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,510
Can I still eat my fill every day?

404
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,750
Yes.

405
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,270
Can I still have eight steamed buns
at each meal?

406
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,070
You can.

407
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,750
Can I still stay by Your Highness's side,

408
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,480
ranking one level higher than
that Shangguan He?

409
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,730
Of course you can.

410
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,030
Then that settles it.

411
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,280
As long as I can stay by
Your Highness's side

412

413

what does it matter
whether I'm in a storybook or not?

446
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,580
So why did you still accept

447

the imperial edict for
this marriage arrangement?

448

The current Seventh Prince

449

has been officially appointed crown prince

He's no longer the Seventh Prince
who was out of favor.

Father.

453
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,380
Just because Nan Heng is now
the crown prince,

454
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,440
you no longer care about my feelings?

455
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,400
Isn't social climbing

456

Let me be honest with you.

459
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,790
His Majesty has given me an ultimatum.

460
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,000
Either

461
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,160
you obediently marry the crown prince
and be his wife,

462
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,920
or

463
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,210
I lose my position as minister.

464
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,090
If you want the whole family to starve,

465
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,920
I'll enter the palace right now
to defy the imperial edict for your sake.

I...

467
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,290
I'll go check on her.

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,520
I didn't give myself away, did I?

By the way,

472
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,350
just now

473
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,950
when she accused me of social climbing,

474
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:47,920
what were you doing?

475
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,320
Why didn't you defend me?

476
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,750

Come with me.

484
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,510
Father isn't someone who chases power,

485
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,050
but he's not a fool either.

486

Everything you've done for
the Seventh Prince

is clear to anyone with eyes.

488
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,830
Saving him doesn't mean I like him.

489
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,000
Even if I do like him, it doesn't mean

490
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,110
I have to marry him.

491

You're just worried that marrying him

493
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,000
might bring

Nan Heng told Father about it.

499
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,420
Since Father already knows everything,

500
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,000
why is he still helping Nan Heng?

501
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,200
Father has been an official
his whole life,

502
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,150
how could he not understand this?

503
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,910
He's willing to help Nan Heng

Once she's made up her mind,

Therefore,

00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,660
The Minister of War, Mr. Song.

676
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:27,070
Song Yude has always adhered to
the Doctrine of the Mean.

677
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,280
Since entering court,

678
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,440
he has never formed factions
or shown favoritism,

679
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,440
making him the best candidate
for Chancellor indeed.

680
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,460
However,

681
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,680
you've just become Crown Prince

682
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,310
and now want to recommend
your father-in-law.

683
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,040
I'm afraid it'll be hard
to convince the crowd.

684
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,660
Your Majesty is right.

685
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,190
I dare not act out of personal interest.

686
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
However,

687
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,890
if this appointment

688
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,330
would cause discontent among officials,

689
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,530
I humbly request Your Majesty

690
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,870
to issue another imperial edict

691
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,880
to check my power.

692
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,490
How would this check work?

693
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,130
If in the future I

694
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,610
should act improperly,

695
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,630
Mr. Song may,
with the support of officials,

696
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,230
have me removed from office.

697
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,330
Nonsense.

698
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,860
If that were the case,

699
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,790
wouldn't our empire change hands?

700
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,320
Your Majesty.

701
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,790
The empire our ancestors established

702
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,850
should be entrusted to worthy hands.

703
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,540
Only then can it be preserved.

704
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,420
With this imperial edict,

705
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,510
Mr. Song can offer frank advice
in the future

706
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,770
without any concerns.

707
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,630
I

708
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,610
will also be diligent in state affairs

709
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,740
and dare not show the slightest slack.

710
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,680
You're doing this

711
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,010
because of Song Yimeng's influence,
aren't you?

712
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,840
I don't believe

713
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,590
that if someone else

714
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,350
were appointed as Chancellor,

715
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,910
you would act the same way.

716
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,970
Your Majesty is right.

717
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,690
I'm also doing this

718
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,970
for the sake of Song Yimeng.

719
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,580
I don't want

720
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,230
Mr. Song to try to please me

721
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,110
because of his daughter in the future,

722
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,030
nor do I want Song Yimeng

723
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,210
to compromise because of her father.

724
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,070
Therefore,

725
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,770
please consider this as a promise

726
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,290
I make to Song Yimeng.

727
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,690
No matter what she does in the future,

728
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,230
it will not affect the Song family.

729
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,510
You're being ridiculous!

730
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,080
You're the noble crown prince,

731
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,810
yet your mind is filled with nothing
but romance.

732
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,360
How dare you say you have
no selfish motives?

733
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,880
For the sake of a woman,

734
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,630
you've actually gone to such lengths,

735
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,630
even coming to request

736
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,320
an official position for her father.

737
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,120
Your Majesty.

738
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,880
Mr. Song

739
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,030
is truly a pillar of the state

740
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,480
and worthy of the position of Chancellor.

741
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,050
I earnestly request Your Majesty

742
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,200
to grant my request.

743
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,630
I've heard you.

744
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,720
Get lost.

745
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

746
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,130
[In Memory of Our Roots]

747
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:35,380
[In memory of the late Duchess of Anping,
Wang Nianmei]

748
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,170
Father.

749
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,870
I rushed back as soon as I heard the news.

750
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,560
Why are you hiding over here?

751
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,110
Is this

752
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,510
the imperial edict appointing you
as Chancellor?

753
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,930
[With deeds known at home and afar,
loyal and steadfast, pillar of the court]

754
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,930
[Left Vice Minister of the Imperial
Secretariat & Minister of War, Song Yude]

755
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,590
His Highness entered the palace today,

756
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,380
and besides recommending me as Chancellor,

757
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,580
he also persuaded His Majesty
to issue an edict,

758
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,240
granting the Song family

759
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,410
the Imperial Pardon Certificate.

760
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,150
The Imperial Pardon Certificate?

761
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:15,960
Is it

762
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,800
the Death-Exemption Plate?

763
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,880
That's right.

764
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,510
When the Crown Prince ascends the throne,

765
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,170
no matter how
the political situation changes,

766
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,190
and whether your relationship
with him

767
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,510
is good or bad,

768
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,200
everyone in the Song family

769
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,370
can be spared from execution.

770
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,960
This royal favor

771
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,510
has never been granted to any noble family

772
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,570
since the founding of the Great Jing.

773
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,630
Yimeng.

774
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,710
For the sake of what you call

775
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,710
a nonexistent future,

776
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,670
Nan Heng has gone to such lengths.

777
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,760
It clearly shows his feelings for you.

778
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,320
Regarding your marriage,

779
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,630
you've been reluctant to agree.

780
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,550
What exactly are you afraid of?

781
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,710
Perhaps

782
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,280
I'm afraid of

783
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,000
an unknown ending.

784
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,290
Fate is in our own hands.

785
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,400
Why fear something

786
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,130
that hasn't even happened yet?

787
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,970
Indeed.

788
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,410
I'm worried Nan Heng will hurt me,

789
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,490
but I'm also worried I'll let him down.

790
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,210
Because I don't belong in this world.

791
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,830
What if...

792
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,960
What if one day, I have
to leave this place?

793
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,560
What should Nan Heng do then?

794
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,210
I've

795
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,400
never been a brave man,

796
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:59,230
but falling in love with your mother
from humble origins,

797
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,190
marrying her, and having you

798
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,270
were the bravest things I've ever done.

799
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,670
Father.

800
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,710
I think this is the first time

801
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,660
you've ever talked to me about my mother.

802
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,320
Your mother passed away

803
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
just days after giving birth to you.

804
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,830
Not being able to grow old with her

805
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,550
is my greatest regret.

806
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,230
But the time I spent with your mother

807
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,670
was also the most beautiful time
of my life.

808
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:56,920
Yimeng.

809
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,000
Love in this world isn't always

810
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,360
about seeking perfection.

811
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,290
In matters of the heart,

812
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,840
regret hurts more than

813
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,670
not being able
to spend a lifetime together.

814
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,030
I'm sure Nan Heng

815
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,440
feels the same way.
