Please, let me explain.

00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,280
I-I swear I didn't ask Father
to send those geese.

6
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,280
I had no idea he was planning
to arrange this marriage.

7
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,190
I'm telling the truth.

If I'm lying,

may I be struck by lightning!

10
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,070
If it wasn't Your Highness's instruction,

11
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,630
then it must have been His Majesty's will.

Don't worry.

As long as it's something
you don't agree to,

I'll never force it upon you.

How about this?

No.

20
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,360
I'll go see Father right away,

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,150
clear things up,

22
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,190

23
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,960
alright?

24
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,240
Okay.

25
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,560
Then I'll leave it to Your Highness.

the Five-Flavored Tea of Forgetfulness,

so that in her next life,

she can have an eye for some truly
good and worthy guys.

Those "good guys" you speak of

121
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,750
Didn't His Highness just say

122
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,240
this is a family gathering,

123
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,270
and there's no need for formalities?

124
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,950
Why talk about manners?

125
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,480
Don't go too far.

126

Hey, Song Yude.

Don't you know that

129
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,750
the guy Yiting fell for is

130
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,480

Today is the homecoming banquet for
Yimeng and His Highness.

133
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,560
Do you have to make everyone
uncomfortable?

134
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,620
Am I making everyone uncomfortable?

135
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Have you forgotten

136
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,360
how badly they hurt you
in that shabby room

137

Well,

141
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,800
about what happened at Zijin Pavilion,

142
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,240
I was indeed in the wrong.

143
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,720
I'd like to take this opportunity

144
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,600
to apologize to the Song family

145
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,480
and to Miss Song Yiting.

146
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,680
If anyone in the Song Residence
has any needs in the future,

147
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,600
please don't hesitate to ask.

148
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,190
I'll certainly make amends.

149
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,040
You're too kind.

150
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,560
It's nothing.

151
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,000
It's only right.

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,310
How could we possibly deserve
such a grand gesture?

153
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,390
Your Highness, that subordinate of yours,
Shangguan He,

154
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,560
is still shamelessly hanging around our
Song family now.

155
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,310
If he hadn't been leading our Yiting on,

156
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,190
would her marriage prospects

157
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,750
be in such a state now?

158
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,480
Would we have offended His Majesty

159
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,010
and the Eighteenth Prince?

160
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,750
Mother, please stop making
baseless accusations.

161
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,070
Not marrying the Eighteenth Prince
was my decision.

162
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,560
It has nothing to do with His Highness

163
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,240
and Shangguan He!

164
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,360
Even so,

165
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,390
Your Highness still owes our Song family

166
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,680
an explanation.

167
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,920
If you truly feel sorry,

168
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,070
you should send your subordinate
Shangguan He

169
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,870
back to Jiangnan immediately,

170
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,000
so none of us ever have to see him again.

171
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,570
Your Highness.

172
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,390

343
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,440
we'll roll with the punches

344
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,640
and deal with everything as it happens.

345
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,980
You don't understand.

346
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,600
If we've truly changed the plot,

347
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,750
it means all the information I had

348
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,150
has become meaningless.

349
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,150
Without the cheat code,

350
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,890
how can we change our fate?

351
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,750
Don't worry.

352
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Don't forget,

353
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,550
the part where we were supposed
to stab each other on our wedding day

354
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,510
was successfully prevented, wasn't it?

355
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,320
So you see,

356
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,090
what changes our fate isn't
some cheat code,

357
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,030
but you and I.

358
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,270
But...

359
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,070
In the future,

360
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,240
no matter what happens,

361
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,280
I'll face it together with you.

362
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:15,070
[The Late Empress's Residence,
Fengyi Palace]

363
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,960
I never thought that after years of
searching for the truth,

364
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,280
the culprit was right before our eyes.

365
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,840
Gao Changyin

366
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,200
has been hiding his true nature so well.

367
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,000
By the way, Your Majesty,

368
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,000
why did you appoint the Seventh Prince
as crown prince?

369
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,930
Uncle.

370
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,910
Heng is actually quite a decent person.

371
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,870
In the end, it was thanks to
his placing justice above family ties

372
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,960
and exposing Gao Changyin

373
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,220
that the Qianyu Army's name was cleared.

374
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,080
Besides,

375
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,480
I have neither the desire

376
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,410
nor the ability to be crown prince.

377
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,480
It was perfectly reasonable for Father

378
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,880
to name him crown prince.

379
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,840
Uncle.

380
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,270
The court has finally found peace.

381
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,870
And regarding Guihong's attempt
to assassinate Heng,

382
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,630
Heng has agreed
not to pursue this matter further.

383
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,360
Let's just

384
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,120
call it even, shall we?

385
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,180
After my brush with death,

386
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,829
I've come to terms with many things.

387
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,720
Guihong.

388
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,270
Today, before your Aunt's memorial,

389
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,720
don't you think you should

390
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,720
formally apologize to His Majesty?

391
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,440
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

392
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,810
I should have remained at my border post,

393
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,030
yet I abandoned my duty

394
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,850
and rashly attempted
to assassinate His Highness.

395
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,310
My crime is unforgivable.

396
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,440
I beg Your Majesty

397
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,680
to consider the Chu family's

398
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,270
years of loyal service guarding
the Great Jing's borders

399
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,680
and grant me another chance.

400
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,030
I will certainly redeem myself

401
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,440
and serve the Great Jing
through fire and water

402
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,640
without hesitation.

403
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,920
Chu Guihong.

404
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,190
You were once Yurong's most beloved child.

405
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,230
When it comes down to it,

406
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,070
the conflict between you and Heng

407
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,720
all stems from old grudges.

408
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,400
Now that Lord Qianyu has returned
to the capital,

409
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,550
I have no wish to keep you two apart.

410
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,080
You may remain in the capital

411
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,270
for the time being.

412
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

413
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,110
However,

414
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,330
if you dare show disrespect to
my Crown Prince again,

415
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,170
you won't be so lucky

416
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,870
next time.

417
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,510
I wasn't wrong, was I?

418
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,720
His Majesty is totally lovestruck,

419
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,510
and Nan Rui

420
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,720
is just brainless.

421
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,270
As long as you show your loyalty,

422
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,310
all past transgressions

423
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,790
can surely be wiped clean.

424
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,530
Others are easy to manage,

425
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,880
but as for Nan Heng,

426
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,690
given how far things have deteriorated
between us,

427
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,170
truly clearing the grudges

428
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,370
and earning his trust

429
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,240
won't be so easy, I'm afraid.

430
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,640
Son,

431
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,790
why should you worry?

432
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,160
I'm here, aren't I?

433
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,940
At tonight's banquet,

434
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,830
I'll make sure

435
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,010
to help you smooth things over
with Nan Heng.

436
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,720
Uncle.

437
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,110
You've had a hard time out there lately.

438
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,110
Have more meat to nourish yourself.

439
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,860
Your Highness.

440
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,920
I must apologize to you.

441
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,310
On Your Highness's joyous day,

442
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,640
I caused a disturbance.

443
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,510
Though Your Highness,
magnanimous as ever,

444
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,880
did not hold me accountable,

445
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
I still feel deeply ashamed.

446
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,550
I'll punish myself with this drink.

447
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,510
Thank you for your magnanimity,
Your Highness,

448
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,710
and for not holding the past against me.

449
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,200
You see, I told you before,

450
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,440
Heng is magnanimous

451
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,770
and not someone who holds grudges, right?

452
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,610
Lord Qianyu.

453
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,410
There's something

454
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,440
I've been puzzling over.

455
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,150
Please go ahead, Your Highness.

456
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,100
When Pingrong City fell,

457
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,090
not even a small bird could fly out.

458
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,270
How did you manage to escape?

459
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,460
I remember when the city fell,

460
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,960
I intended to protect our banner
and fight to the last moment.

461
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,220
However, several Deputy Generals
knocked me unconscious,

462
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,530
put on my armor to impersonate me,

463
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,680
and dressed me in Heyuan Army's armor,

464
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,530
hiding me among their dead.

465
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,440
I

466
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,450
only survived because of this.

467
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,870
After escaping from Pingrong,

468
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,830
why did you not come to rendezvous with me

469
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,590
and choose to run for your life instead?

470
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,510
I had deep misunderstanding
about Your Highness before,

471
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,620
even suspecting

472
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,280
you were behind the defeat
of Pingrong battle.

473
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,200
So of course, I was reluctant to seek out
the Xuanjia Army.

474
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,440
Then after the Xuanjia Army
returned to the capital,

475
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,640
why didn't you come back
to report to His Majesty?

476
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,920
Did you not trust

477
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,880
His Majesty either?

478
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,000
During those days,

479
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,000
I wandered through the countryside,

480
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,740
and whenever I thought of
the 20,000 soldiers who died,

481
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,110
I wanted to take my own life to atone.

482
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,590
But I still have my son, Guihong,

483
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,030
who lost his mother at a young age

484
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,510
and has no siblings.

485
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,790
How could I leave him with peace of mind?

486
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,880
For his sake,

487
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,000
I forced myself to carry on,

488
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
fleeing to the outskirts of the capital

489
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,100
to find an opportunity
to reunite with Guihong.

490
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,920
As parents,

491
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,440
this is all we care about.

492
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,520
Chu Li.

493
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,510
Here.

494
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,030
I understand you.

495
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,510
Thank you, Your Majesty.

496
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,020
Your Highness.

497
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,310
I know

498
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,030
the Chu family and Your Highness
have been entangled for years,

499
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,640
with deep misunderstandings between us.

500
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,070
I have no intention of

501
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,200
threatening Your Highness upon my return.

502
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,240
I hope Your Highness can
put aside past grievances.

503
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,920
From now on,

504
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,440
I will serve with utmost loyalty

505
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,830
and work together with Your Highness

506
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,200
to defend our state.

507
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,260
Lord Qianyu, you jest.

508
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,790
Junior General and I
share the same banner.

509
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,590

as soon as possible.

679
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,770
So you did get it.

680
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,300
Then why aren't you showing any reaction?

681
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,000
He knows the entire plot.

682
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,460
He's basically cheating.

683
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
If you ask me,

684
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,960
you should quickly prepare
some valuable gifts

685
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,440
and pay a visit to the Qianyu Mansion.

686
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,350
You should know,

687
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,310
actors who offend the screenwriter

688
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,640
never end up well.

689
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,420
Let me ask you,

690
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,790
do you know why he came here?

691
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,320
Have you noticed anything unusual lately?

692
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,680
And have you heard

693
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,920
that so-called

694
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,460
keyboard sound again?

695
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,240
No.

696
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,830
Well, if nothing's unusual,

697
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,240
and the rules of this world

698
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,750
have already been broken by us,

699
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,550
then there's no need to fear him.

700
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,150
Even if he created everything
from outside,

701
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,120
in here,

702
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,070
the plot has already changed.

703
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,310
Therefore, the one who should be worried

704
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,590
and can't sit still right now

705
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,590
is him, not us.

706
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,510
So according to you,

707
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,510
Mr. Screenwriter

708
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,810
should even come curry favor with you?

709
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,760
That might actually happen.

710
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,160
Oh, you.

711
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,550
Remember,

712
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,160
you're just a fictional character,

713
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,480
not a producer.

714
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,760
So stop being so arrogant, okay?

715
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,500
Your Highness,

716
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,960
Lord Qianyu is here.

717
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,130
What did I tell you?

718
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,790
Let's go meet this

719
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,440
Mr.

720
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,820
Screenwriter.

721
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:24,480
[Jize Palace]

722
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,440
You've even come out
to greet me personally.

723
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,240
Come on,

724
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,920
bring the gifts inside.

725
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,920
So you really guessed it right?

726
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,960
He really is here to win your favor?

727
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,680
Your Highness.

728
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,550
I'm new here

729
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,510
and don't understand many of the rules.

730
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,640
You have to help me.

731
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
So the gifts...

732
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,170
They're for you.

733
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,640
And if these aren't enough,

734
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,840
there's plenty more at Qianyu Mansion.

735
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,960
What are you looking at?

736
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,360
Got nothing better to do?

737
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,480
With so many strangers going in,

738
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,010
don't you know to stop them?

739
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,970
[Cultivate Virtue and Pursue Knowledge]

740
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,240
Hey, Xiaoyu.

741
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,300
He looks exactly like Nan Feng.

742
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,640
Even that stuck-up celebrity attitude

743
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,960
seems like they were cut
from the same cloth.

744
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,240
You and Lord Qianyu

745
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,000
are quite different, however.

746
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,830
Lord Qianyu didn't eat venison,

747
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,630
and his behavior was dignified,

748
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,160
unlike you, who are so frivolous and rude.

749
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,160
He knows everything?

750
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,150
You...

751
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,050
We're husband and wife.

752
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,350
What secrets could there be between us?

753
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,840
But none of that matters now.

754
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,920
Let's just get straight to the point.

755
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,210
Mr. Screenwriter,

756
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,740
how exactly did you time-travel here?

757
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,200
It was all thanks to you two.

758
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,160
I've been pulling my hair out every day

759
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,550
just to squeeze out a tiny bit
of final draft,

760
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,440
yet you two have been

761
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,910
changing it all inexplicably the next day.

762
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,030
At first, I didn't know

763
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,290
and didn't believe it,

764
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,510
so I kept writing,

765
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,590
and you kept changing it.

766
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,400
I write,

767
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,000
you change.

768
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,400
Write,

769
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,000
change.

770
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,400
Now the drama's about to start shooting.

771
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,760
How am I supposed to explain this
to the client?

772
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,590
Am I supposed to tell them that

773
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,710
the male and female leads
aren't cooperating

774
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,370
and keep changing the script?

775
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,510
Or should I tell them

776
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,370
the female lead has time-traveled
into the script?

777
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,320
In the end, I ran out of options,

778
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,480
so I wrote a story

779
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,880
about the screenwriter
traveling into the script,

780
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,670
just to see what would happen.

781
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,070
Unexpectedly, I dozed off that night,

782
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,730
and when I woke up the next day,

783
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,199
I was actually here. Can you believe it?

784
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,110
So you wrote yourself into this world.

785
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,360
But I have to admit that
your time-traveling method

786
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,489
is a bit more sophisticated than mine.

787
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,300
So you came here

788
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,139
to restore the original plot?

789
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,760
I...

790
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,440
I believe Your Highness

791
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,070
wouldn't let that kind of thing
happen, right?

792
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,230
Well...

793
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,310
By the way, Xiaoyu,

794
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,370
enough about me.

795
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,370
Have you gotten used to being here?

796
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,070
I'm doing fine here.

797
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,920
There are carriages and houses here,

798
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,050
and there's no smog.

799
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,760
And I even managed

800
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,760
to snag a boyfriend while I was at it.

801
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,150
Really?

802
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,590
Is this more delicious than
the Starbucks afternoon tea?

803
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,400
Well,

804
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,840
each has its own merits.

805
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,920
Can that thing provide warmth
like modern underfloor heating?

806
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,320
I won't freeze to death here anyway.

807
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,110
It's fine.

808
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,940
There's no water heater for bathing here,

809
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,670
no automatic toilets in the bathroom,

810
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,710
and you can't even scroll through
your phone before bed.

811
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,920
What kind of life is this?

812
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,920
It's like living as an ascetic monk.

813
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,000
"Dream of Qingning" will start shooting
at the end of the month.

814
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,990
It's definitely a top-tier production.

815
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,080
I'm telling you,

816
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,590
if you were in the modern world,

817
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,450
you'd definitely be the next
hit-leading actress.

818
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,800
Lord Qianyu, are you implying something?

819
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,590
No, I'm not.

820
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,280
How to live

821
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,230
and where to settle down

822
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,400
are Song Yimeng's own choices.

823
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,620
If you have ulterior motives,

824
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,410
I'll be the first to object.

825
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,000
Which eye of yours saw

826
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,100
that I have ulterior motives?

827
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,730
Then let me ask you,

828
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,600
what brought you here today?

829
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,880
To visit a hometown folk.

830
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,800
Visit a hometown folk,

831
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,880
yet criticize their way of life like that?

832
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,800
Can't I, as a modern person,
make a few complaints?

833
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,550
I think you're just being sarcastic

834
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,150
with malicious intentions!

835
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,150
You're just over-interpreting

Alright, alright.

Stop arguing.

I understand

all your concerns.

844

Mr. Screenwriter,

845
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,400
I've figured out
what you're getting at too.

Come on.

847

[Achieve Great Ambitions]

849
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,960
Let me have a sip of that herbal tea.

850
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,290
Last night, His Lordship
made me bow to him

851
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,630
for four hours,

852
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,710
and insisted I address him
with genuine feeling in every word.

853
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,760
This morning when I woke up,

854
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,190
my throat was on fire.

855
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,760
That's nothing compared to my situation.

856
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,400
Yesterday, His Lordship made me
hold a horse stance

857
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,860
for the entire afternoon,

858
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,920
saying something about experiencing
the strength of the Qianyu Army.

859
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,030
This morning when I got up,

860
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,160
my legs were shaking uncontrollably.

861
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,470
What are you doing?

862
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,730
What are you all doing?

863
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,900
Don't you have anything better to do?

864
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,960
Now that we're not at war,

865
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,960
you've even forgotten
how to train yourselves, huh?

866
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,360
Go run ten laps
around the training ground!

867

I've failed in my duty.

870

silly jokes during their free time.

Please don't take it to heart.

from the Pingrong City Tower back then?

876
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,160
Why would you ask
such a question, General?

877
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,220
There are some matters

878
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,060
I've always had doubts about.

879
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,230
Rong Hua,

880
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,680
I want you
to investigate something for me.

881
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,440
Let me ask you,

882
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,710
did you come to
the Crown Prince's Residence

883
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,320
to take me back with you?

884
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,360
That's right.

885
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,150
I wanted to talk to you alone,

886
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,960
but I didn't expect Nan Heng to be here,

887
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,960
so I couldn't speak plainly.

888
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,190
What do you mean?

889
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,940
Are you saying

890
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,710
you know how to get back?

891
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,480
Of course.

892
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,440
Who am I?

893
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,550
I'm the screenwriter.

894
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,230
I set all the rules here.

895
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,300
Let me tell you,

896
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,320
the script world has four...

897
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,880
Three rules.

898
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,630
Besides the hero always saving the heroine
when she's in danger,

899
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,320
and the iconic scenes must happen,

900
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,550
there's one more rule:

901
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,680
once we complete all the iconic scenes
until the finale,

902
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,930
we can get back.

903
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,070
I see.

904
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,400
You want me to help you complete

905
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,590
the city tower choice scene,

906
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,360
and also go through

907
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,760
the scenes where I become a human pig,

908
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,440
right?

909
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,680
Smart.

910
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,030
But if you're afraid of pain,

911
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,690
I can have Zhao prepare
some anesthetic for you.

912
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,420
The doctor who saved Nan Heng's life.

913
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,280
But if we follow the original plot,

914
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,590
the entire Song family will be executed.

915
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,520
Do you know that?

916
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,640
What Song family or Li family?

917
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,630
They're all just fictional characters.

918
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,440
You...

919
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,590
What?

920
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,590
Nothing.

921
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,550
So what if

922
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,000
we don't follow the original plot?

923
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
What will happen?

924
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,760
Then we'll be trapped here forever.

925
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,510
I won't become a top-tier screenwriter,

926
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,960
and your dream of becoming an actress

927
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,020
will shatter like broken glass, too.

928
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,630
Alright, that's fine.

929
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,880
As long as this world doesn't collapse.

930
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,210
What do you mean "fine"?

931
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,230
Do you really want to stay here

932
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,360
and be the God of Death's beloved wife?

933
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,460
Listen carefully,

934
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,400
Nan Heng is not some God of Death,

935
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,510

Don't forget he's going to kill you
in the end.

At first,

944
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,030
he did want to kill me,

945
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,150
but everything is different now.

946
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,710
The keyboard sounds have disappeared,

947
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,070
and he's already broken free from
his original character design.

948
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:56,960
How could he hurt me

949
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,290
or harm the Song family?

950
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,320
This is just a fictional world.

Of course it does!

Good, it should hurt.

Let me tell you,

00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,920
from the moment you entered this world,

Understand?

You're right.

Outside the script,

985
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,800
something terrible has happened!

986
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,710
Her Highness and Lord Qianyu

987
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,550
were whispering to each other
for quite a while,

988
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,840
and she even said she wants to take him
to Waning River Crescent for a visit.

989
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,300
To Waning River Crescent?

990
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,710
The Crown Princess said that?

991
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,440
Yes.

992
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,190
And she asked me to tell Your Highness

993
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,440
not to worry at all.

994
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,840
How can you not worry?

995
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:18,320
Back then, the engagement between
Her Highness and Chu Guihong

996
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,150
was arranged by Lord Qianyu himself.

to steal Her Highness away

to rekindle her relationship
with Chu Guihong?
