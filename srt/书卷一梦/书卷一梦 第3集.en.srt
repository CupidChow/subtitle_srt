Jia Ruru,

4
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,840
are you really not

5
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,510
going to lock me up in a room

6
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,780
and beat me up?

7
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,350
What's going on?

8
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,720
Why aren't they moving?

9
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,740
Help! The script is killing me!

10
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,870
Miss Song fell into the water!

11
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,320
Seriously?

12
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,640
Taking my life again?

13
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,960
I've died so many times.

14
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,480
Nan Heng?

15
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,510
He looks exactly like Nan Feng.

16
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,610
The same smug look.

17
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,270
The same...

18
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,070
I'd rather be dead.

19
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,000
I'd sooner be drowned

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,940
than go through the plots with you.

21
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,020
It was His Highness's decision to jump?

22
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,110
Are you sure?

23
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,430
It is so

24
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,710
wise of His Highness.

25
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,150
How brilliant.

Yiting!

28
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,520
I heard someone fell into the water.

29
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,760
Are you okay?

30
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,890
I'm standing right here.
Of course I'm fine.

31
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,630
It was my sister who fell into the water,

32
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,800
followed by the Seventh Prince.

33

34
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,910
No way!

35
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,590
Did it really happen?

36
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,780
This is bad.

37
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,120

40
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,080
for saving my life.

41
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,649
Well, I need to be somewhere else.

42
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:17,670
I have to go now.

43
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,950
Song Yimeng,

44
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
I know

45
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,510
you deliberately fell into the water

46
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,170
to seduce the Seventh Prince!

47
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,040
I don't know what you're saying.

48
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,430
Let me go.

49
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,430
You want to leave?

50
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,040
Now you're scared, huh?

51
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,720
Remember what you just told me?

52
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,040
"Chu Guihong wants to marry me."

53
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,500

How am I supposed

57
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,330
have the answer?

58
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,900
He's still putting on an act.

59
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,290
Fine.

60
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,680
I'll take a risk then.

61
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,340
This story line must end here.

62
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,200

63

66

for a purpose, right?

67
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,160
What?

68
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,720
It's true, isn't it?

69
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,310
You're aiming

70

71

Do you really think I'm ignorant?

72
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,760
Well said!

73
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,160
The Song sisters are unexpectedly

74
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,680
perceptive.

75
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,760

Right.

I'll definitely not interfere.

There won't be a next time.

Your Highness and I

88
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,430

00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,240
Your young mistress refused to meet with us.

518
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,920
She just doesn't want to

519
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,320
be responsible for His Highness, does she?

520
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,670
Did he really say that?

521
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,110
The Seventh Prince also said,

522
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,830
"Today,

523
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,790
I will see her no matter what.

524
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,880
Tell her to give up her struggle

525
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,720
and stop resisting.

526
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,320
Otherwise,

527
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,030
she'll never be able to clear her name

528
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,440
for tarnishing the reputation of a good prince."

529
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,160
Isn't that blackmailing?

530
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,030
I've never seen

531
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,680
such a shameless person.

532
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,750
If he were put in modern times,

533
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,240
he would be really good at

534
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,720
staging a showmance.

535
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,200
[Salted Fish Escape Plan]

536
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,560
That's odd.

537
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,030
There's no plot

538
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,160
of his passionately pursuing me here.

539
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,760
Is it the script playing tricks again—

540
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,480
forcing a romantic subplot

541
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,960
between the leads?

542
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,270
Miss.

543
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,640
Miss.

544
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,510
Miss.

545
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,440
Bad news.

546
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,880
The Seventh Prince and his men broke in.

547
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,080
You two, cover for me.

548
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,750
I'm outta here.

549
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,440
Miss,

550
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,770
Master wants to see you.

551
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,780
The Seventh Prince is also there.

552
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,640
Mr. Song, have you recovered from your cold?

553
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,900
Yes, I just got over it.

554
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,880
White tea is brewed with snow water,

555
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,520
mixed with Evodia fruit and dried tangerine peel.

556
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,250
You have a good taste, Mr. Song.

557
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,270
The water was from the jar of snow

558
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,640
I collected in the plum woods outside the city

559
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,880
the year it snowed heavily.

560
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,510
I knew Your Highness were coming today,

561
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,640
so I asked someone to
take the jar out from underground.

562
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,500
Your Highness,

563
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,110
try this tea.

564
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,690
It's ambrosia that has been
sealed for three years.

565
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,540
It is indeed ambrosia.

566
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,030
Everyone says that the Seventh Prince
has great military merits

567
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,510
and uncommon perspectives.

568
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,550
I didn't expect you also excel in

569
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,350
these refined pastimes of winter.

570
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,880
My daughter is different.

571
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,270
All she knows is fooling around all day.

572
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,550
She never behaves properly.

573
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,440
I put well water and water from the sky

574
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,960
in front of her at the same time,

575
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,090
and she couldn't tell the difference!

576
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,030
It seems that Your Highness and my daughter

577
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,550
are like clouds and mud.

578
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,270
I can't agree with that, Mr. Song.

579
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,350
I've seen many beautiful girls,

580
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,720
but I'm only into

581
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,310
Miss Song's natural

582
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,160
and uncarved personality.

583
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,870
How can a favored man like you

584
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,110
be mentioned in the same breath as
an ordinary woman like my daughter?

585
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,160
You will achieve great things in the future,

586
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,830
but my family...

587
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,310
I'm not young anymore.

588
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,170
I'm afraid

589
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,000
that when I'm six feet under,

590
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,680
our family will have nothing to help you.

591
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,000
There are things,

592
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,750
Your Highness,

593
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,750
that you have to have other plans with.

594
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,350
Miss Song and I

595
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,880
love each other.

596
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,880
Why did you talk about helping me?

597
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,680
However,

598
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,590
I deeply appreciate your love for your daughter.

599
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,720
So, rest assured.

600
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,160
As long as you are willing to

601
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,960
leave your daughter in my care,

602
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,510
when you pass away,

603
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,750
I will take care of the Song family.

604
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,790
Isn't this

605
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,510
a win-win situation?

606
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,550
You... Well…

607
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,200
Father.

608
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,070
Your Highness.

609
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,790
Yimeng.

610
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,640
Come, sit down.

611
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,970
Miss Song, has your cold

612
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,240
recovered, too?

613
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,160
Your Highness,

614
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,310
the cold did get better,

615
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,970
but I'm left with this ailment

616
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,590
of coughing.

617
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,200
That's why I dare not

618
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,160
go out recently.

619
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,870
What's going on?

620
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,110
Didn't the script say

621
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,480
they never got along?

622
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,850
Why did he invite Nan Heng to sit here?

623
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,240
Yimeng,

624
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,240
didn't you say

625
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,440
there was a misunderstanding
between you two in the royal garden?

626
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,000
I invited His Highness here today

627
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,030
so that you can explain everything

628
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,380
with him face to face.

629
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,820
I can't agree with that, Mr. Song.

630
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,890
That day, the shore was crowded
with onlookers.

631
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,310
Miss Song and I

632
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,680
love each other.

633
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,000
There's no misunderstanding.

634
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,510
Your Highness, this isn't something
to say without thinking.

635
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,680
My daughter

636
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,590
has been engaged to Chu since childhood.

637
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,200
She has always abided by the rules.

638
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,590
The rules are rigid,

639
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,420
but people are alive and should be flexible.

640
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,550
But we can't let

641
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,730
the living people be drowned

642
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,220
by other people's slander.

643
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,500
So,

644
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,750
my daughter

645
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,550
dare not have any feelings

646
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,920
toward Your Highness.

647
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,270
So, Your Highness,

648
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,240
please don't take it the wrong way.

649
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,720
Come on.

650
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,170
Have some tea.

651
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,640
Have some tea.

652
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,160
So, Mr. Song, do you mean

653
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,270
I think too much?

654
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,700
Yimeng,

655
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,420
who is right between me and His Highness?

656
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,400
Miss Song,

657
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,110
tell us.

658
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,510
This is an EQ question.

659
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,560
Miss Song.

660
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,590
That day,

661
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,990
I saved you from the lake.

662
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,750
But if you don't remember

663
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,350
what happened on the shore,

664
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,620
I don't mind describing it

665
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,550
for Mr. Song.

666
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,330
Your Highness is wise.

667
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,540
Thank you for saving me

668
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,390
in the loyal garden that day.

669
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,510
It's a blessing for me.

670
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,990
Your Highness,

671
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,460
what you have done for me these days,

672
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,740
I'm really grateful.

673
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,930
I'll never forget your kindness.

674
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,430
It's just that…

675
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,510
love

676
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,210
can't be forced.

677
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,630
Just take what I did that day as

678
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,680
an act of drunken recklessness.

679
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,960
My mind was fogged.

680
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,200
Just consider it

681
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,510
a mistake that most women would make.

682
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,240
But I also have something

683
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,720
to ask you.

684
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,070
You're obviously skilled in martial arts

685
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,350
and invincible,

686
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,830
but why did you let me

687
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,680
molest you in public?

688
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,750
You didn't take the initiative,

689
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,750
but you didn't refuse

690
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,240
or take responsibility, either.

691
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,070
Is it that

692
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,030
you want to make

693
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:13,310
the mistake that every man would make?

694
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,750
Why does Yimeng behave like a different person?

695
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,090
So,

696
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,260
it takes two to tangle.

697
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:23,860
I

698
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,590
might be a player,

699
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,000
but Your Highness,

700
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,590
you seem to be one, too.

701
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,790
But don't worry.

702
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,280
I'm not the kind of woman

703
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,640
who cries and threatens to hang herself

704
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,900
to force the man to take responsibility.

705
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,200
When the fleeting passion

706
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,200
fades,

707
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,990
let it fade.

708
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,350
From now on,

709
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,310
let's just

710
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,510
go our separate ways.

711
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,190
How is it, Your Highness?

712
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,110
This should break

713
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,240
the romantic subplot with him, right?

714
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,000
Don't get drunk again.

715
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,920
Do you hear me?

716
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,210
Your Highness.

717
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,270
The misunderstanding has been cleared up.

718
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,070
Here.

719
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,400
Have some tea.

720
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,640
Have some tea.

721
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,480
Mr. Song,

722
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,540
since it's a misunderstanding,

723
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,340
it's great that it's solved now.

724
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,530
I won't bother you then.

725
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,070
Miss Song,

726
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,560
can you see me out?

727
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,300
No, this is not appropriate, Your Highness.

728
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,930
We have just made this clear.

729
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,680
Others would gossip again.

730
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,410
Yimeng,

731
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,750
all who come are treated as guests.

732
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,840
His Highness is so very understanding.

733
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,190
Besides,

734
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,870
refined people like us

735
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,640
can't be rude.

736
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,710
Please, Your Highness.

737
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,340
Your Highness,

738
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,510
Miss Song doesn't seem to play hard to get.

739
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,460
She really doesn't like you.

740
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,250
Shut up.

741
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,310
What a waste of my delicacies.

742
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,680
Fugui.

743
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,160
Go ahead and watch for me.

744
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,270
I have something

745
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,710
to tell Miss Song.

746
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,200
I don't think it's necessary.

747
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,070
We've said

748
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,040
all that we should say, haven't we?

749
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,100
You...

750
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,620
What do you want?

751
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,610
I just want to see

752
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,970
what will happen.

753
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,480
That day,

754
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,580
you controlled me.

755
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,310
Am I right?

756
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,550
I...

757
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,690
You were under…

758
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,330
control, too?

759
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,550
"Too"?

760
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,110
Stop pretending.

761
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,270
Say it.

762
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,210
You played tricks to control me.

763
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,550
What is your agenda?

764
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,030
I...

765
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,200
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

766
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,440
I saved you when you
fell into the water that day.

767
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,900
You didn't appreciate it.

768
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,680
But then you threw yourself
into my arms on the shore.

769
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,270
And now "misunderstanding" is your excuse

770
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,400
for turning me down?

771
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,680
What?

772
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,880
Do I look like a fool?

773
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,000
No, Your Highness.

774
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,020
This really is a misunderstanding.

775
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:18,960
It's true.

776
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,660
Your Highness!

777
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,260
This is where the Minister of War…

778
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,680
Say it!

779
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,620
How can I explain it?

780
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,750
If I tell him it's the script's setting

781
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,960
and the romantic subplot between the leads

782
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,200
or it's the iconic scene mechanism,

783
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,830
he'll stab me now.

784
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,640
Say it!

785
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,550
Okay.

786
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,450
Okay, I will, Your Highness.

787
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,170
Calm down. Calm down.

788
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,770
I'll tell you everything.

789
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,030
Actually...

790
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,240
Actually it's all because of...

791
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,030
well,

792
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,060
Mr. Screenwriter.

793
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,790
Mister…

794
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,100
Screenwriter?

795
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,130
Yes.

796
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,970
It's Mr. Screenwriter.

797
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,530
This is

798
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,860
a mysterious power from the ancient east.

799
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,110
He knows everything

800
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,360
and can control

801
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,560
everyone's life, death, pain, and joy.

802
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,360
If you

803
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:21,260
really can't understand,

804
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,150
you can take him

805
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,190
as Bodhisattva,

806
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,150
God of Earth,

807
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,980
Buddha, or any other god.

808
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:27,840
The point is

809
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,320
he sent me many dreams.

810
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,670
They were all about you.

811
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,760
So, Your Highness,

812
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,270
I came to this world

813
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,880
to help you succeed.

814
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,139
We are on the same side.

815
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,469
God?

816
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,639
Sent you dreams?

817
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,760
Keep lying.

818
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,900
I'm not making up stories.

819
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,630
When you were nine,

820
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,710
did the emperor leave you
in the cold palace or not?

821
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,840
You had chilblains on your hands and feet,

822
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,710
but he turned a blind eye.

823
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,480
At the age of ten,

824
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,550
you fell victim to a plot

825
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,800
while training in martial arts.

826
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,600
Your right arm

827
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,800
was fractured in three places

828
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,920
and nearly ended up disabled.

829
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,150
Am I right?

830
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,630
Okay.

831
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,960
When you were 12,
there was a drought in the capital.

832
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,070
Then you were in the cold palace

833
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,710
and you had absolutely nothing to eat.

834
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,280
At that critical moment,

835
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,140
wasn't it the grass in the yard
that saved your life?

836
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,530
Fine.

837
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,710
Those are just anecdotal rumors

838
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,710
about the palace.

839
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,290
Ask any of the old eunuchs

840
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,710
and they'll tell you.

841
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,190
Fine.

842
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,220
If you don't believe any of those,

843
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,050
what about what happened between
you and Chu Guihong?

844
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,510
You two

845
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,360
had been best friends since childhood.

846
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,110
[Chu Guihong (as a child)]

847
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,890
[Nan Heng (as a child)]

848
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,650
But because of the death
of the late Empress,

849
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,760
you two fell apart

850
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,070
and became enemies.

851
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,840
I know all of it.

852
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,590
Really, I know everything.

853
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,190
I also know

854
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,120
you've been through a lot,

855
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,220
but no matter how hard you try,

856
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,200
the world only sees you as God of Death

857
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,320
and someone evil.

858
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,310
Even His Majesty

859
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,030
has never even spared you a proper glance,

860
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:06,960
because all he sees is

861
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,320
that Eighteenth Prince, Nan Rui.

862
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,030
That's why you're feeling wronged.

863
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,960
That's why you want to revolt.

864
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,670
That's why you want to take back

865
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,960
everything that should've been yours
in the first place!

866
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,150
Am I right,

867
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,110
Your Highness?

868
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,220
I really underestimated you.

869
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,100
Who told you these things?

870
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,180
Chu Guihong,

871
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,280
Song Yude,

872
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,660
or someone else?

873
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,550
Wait, bro.

874
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,070
You don't believe in anything.

875
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,320
You're just being a troll now, huh?

876
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,190
What exactly do you want to hear?

877
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,590
What on earth do you want?

878
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,680
What does he want?

879
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:54,650
[A Dream of Qingning
Scene 29, Episode 38]

880
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,150
What exactly do you want?

881
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,680
Within three days,

882
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,650
I want you to hand in all the letters

883
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,190
between Song Yimeng

884
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,990
and Chu Guihong.

885
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,510
Otherwise…

886
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,880
Letters?

887
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,740
What exactly are you looking for?

888
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,400
The method of weapon forging.

889
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,600
The method of weapon forging.

890
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,250
The method of weapon forging.

891
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,480
Am I right, Your Highness?

892
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,140
Now, you should

893
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,020
trust me?

894
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,860
Miss Song, do you know
what you're talking about?

895
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,060
Of course I know what I'm talking about.

896
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,140
The method of weapon forging

897
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,060
of the Qianyu Army.

898
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,610
Your Highness.

899
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,090
If you want to find it,

900
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,840
I can help you get it.

901
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,480
Really.

902
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,020
Nan Heng.

903
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,920
It's better to have one more ally than enemy.

904
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,670
I can really help you get it.

905
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:02,880
Can...

906
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,360
Can...

907
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,440
Can you let me go first?

908
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,770
Please.

909
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,150
Fine.

910
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,320
What happened today

911
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,790
is a secret between you and me.

912
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,660
From now on,

913
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,000
you and I are allies.

914
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,740
Miss Song, I'll count on you

915
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,650
to help me in the future.

916
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,480
Don't worry, Your Highness.

917
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,240
I will. I will.

918
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,380
For sure.

919
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,360
[Song Residence]

920
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,670
The method of weapon forging.

921
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,260
The method of weapon forging.

922
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,350
The method of weapon forging.

923
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,740
Where can I find the method of weapon forging?

924
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,440
It's clearly written in the script

925
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,420
that it's in the letters Chu Guihong
wrote to me.

926
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,540
But the rich family has so big a mansion.

927
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,790
It will take me forever to find it!

[Dear Yimeng, Heyuan people frequently cause trouble at the border these days]

929
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Chu Guihong

930
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,110
is not a general

931
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,550
but a writer, isn't he?

932
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,400
He wrote so much!

933
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,060
[The Method of Weapon Forging]

934
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,360
I found it!

935
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,800
Come on, Mr. Screenwriter.

936
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,280
If you can't write,

937
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,550
you can just quit.

938
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,640
Now, you're killing me!

939
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,190
Miss, what happened?

940
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,440
Nothing.

941
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,590
You guys…

942
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,280
go get me a grave plot.

943
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,780
Instead of having all my limbs cut off,

944
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,630
I'd rather kill myself.

945
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,010
Your Highness.

946
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,500
We've got the news.

947
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,320
Ten years ago,

948
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,300
when Chu Guihong went to the border
on a military expedition,

949
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,550
it was Miss Song who saw him off in person.

950
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,690
Since then, they've corresponded
with each other every month.

951
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,630
Before, in the capital,

952
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,480
Miss Song

953
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,360
lived in seclusion.

954
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,230
She didn't have many friends.

955
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,000
And she didn't get along with her sister.

956
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,260
Say something useful.

957
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,760
Miss Song

958
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,220
rarely came to the palace.

959
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,880
And we didn't find

960
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,630
she's ever paid any attention to your news.

961
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,030
What she said today

962
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,030
is probably true.

963
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,760
I don't buy into

964
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,270
all the supernatural stuff,

965
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,590
but a young lady who lives in seclusion

966
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,320
knows so much about me.

967
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,830
She even knows about my great cause.

968
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,510
Who is she loyal to?

969
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,760
Nan Rui

970
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,630
or His Majesty?

971
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,710
No matter who she is loyal to,

972
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,280
that mouth of hers

973
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,670
is better to be shut.
