<i>Doumoto closely follows Han Junhao,</i>

4

5
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,439
<i>The time gap between them is one second.</i>

6
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,480
<i>We can now see</i>

7
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,599
<i>Han Junhao's No. 95 car is starting to smoke.</i>

8
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,359
<i>I think some malfunction has occurred.</i>

9
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,640
<i>I wonder if it will affect</i>

10
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,512
<i>Han Junhao's performance.</i>

11
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:05,519
What's going on?

12

What's the situation?

13
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,039
It might be a steering gear oil leakage.

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,599
Is this okay? Could there be any danger?

21
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,520
<i>Alright, past the First Bend.</i>

22
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,560
<i>Once again, they are here
in this long straight.</i>

23
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,000
<i>Han Junhao and Doumoto are equally matched.</i>

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,919
<i>Only in the bends can they decide the winner.</i>

25
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,439
<i>Han Junhao's performance today is remarkable.</i>

26
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,879
<i>Even though the smoking issue with the car
still can't be resolved,</i>

27
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,159
<i>Han Junhao remains calm,</i>

28
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,759
<i>and even continually speeding up.</i>

29
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,280
<i>Doumoto attempts to overtake again.</i>

30
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,840
<i>Han Junhao defended properly,</i>

31
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,888

183
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:39,360
Okay, I heard you.

184
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,519
I heard you. Bye.

185
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,320
Han Junhao!

186
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,759
Actually, in yesterday's qualifying race,

187
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,440
I've crashed the car,

188
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,879
due to the car's engine oil leakage.

189
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,824
This is…

190
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,399
The headquarters has approved
your transfer application. Congratulations!

191
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,480
How is this so sudden?

192
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,799
What? Do you think Ms. Lam
played favorites with you?

193
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,960
From my observation of Ms. Lam,

194
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,880
she would not play favorites
and will do things professionally.

195
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,680
Don't overthink it.

196
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,640
We all know what you can do.

197
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,640
Although I am reluctant

198
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,359
to let you go,

199
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,160
I will never say those clichéd words

200
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,208
of keeping you.

201
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:24,160
Congratulations.

202
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,680
Thank you. When do I need to leave?

203
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,240
They say, while your visa is still valid,

204
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,680
to complete the work handover,

205
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,079
hoping you can go to your post
within three days.

206
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,559
Three days?

207
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:38,279
Such a rush?

208
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,680
Yes.

209
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,680
But I hope you can come to my wedding.

210
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,400
I heard at the headquarters,

211
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,599
the colleague who was responsible
for this position has been promoted,

212
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,640
so there can't be a vacancy.

213
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,680
That's why you need
to go there as soon as possible.

214
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,400
When is the latest I can reply?

215
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,599
Don't you want to go?

216
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,216
Well,

217
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,839
I need more time.

218
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,839
Okay.

219
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,680
Okay, thank you.

220
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,000
Elvis!

221
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,200
Elvis!

222
00:18:14,068 --> 00:18:16,896
<i>[Xu Jiajia and Xu Junhao, Nov. 20 2024]</i>

223
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,119
<i>Choose one.</i>

224
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,448
<i>How about this one?</i>

225
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,799
Han Junhao, here.

226
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:28,704
Keep it up.

227
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:30,496
Let me tell you.

228
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:31,519
It's been a long time

229
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,160
I haven't been this excited about a race.

230
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,519
Thanks to Elvis today

231
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,200
- for making us a miracle.
- Good.

232
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,400
Wait, what do you mean?

233
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,799
All of us made this miracle happened.

234
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,079
You all have been up for thirty hours.

235
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,759
How could I race without you all?

236
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,039
But there is one thing.

237
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,279
We were right not to listen to them.

238
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:50,359
Who said this car couldn't be fixed, right?

239
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,039
Right, we were right not to listen to them.

240
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:53,720
So, let me say two things.

241
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:56,759
Zu, you wrap things up tomorrow morning.

242
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,319
Get the car into the container
and shipped it out.

243
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,839
We have a press conference in the afternoon.

244
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,799
After it, we'll fly directly to Shanghai.

245
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,200
Test drive in Shanghai the next day.

246
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,160
- Let me know if you have any problem.
- Okay.

247
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,519
Second, we haven't slept
for more than thirty hours.

248
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,759
Let's go back and catch some sleep.

249
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:11,440
Tonight, I'll find a place
to have a drink, alright?

250
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,200
Good, thank you!

251
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,680
- Let's enjoy.
- Good.

252
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,680
- Let's go.
- Alright, that's it.

253
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,896
- Go take a break.
- Let's go.

254
00:19:16,896 --> 00:19:17,984
Bro.

255
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:19,759
Discuss something.

256
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:20,832
Go ahead.

257
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,920
Can I fly to Shanghai the day after tomorrow?

258
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,512
No, I've already arranged everything.

259
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:29,720
Once we're in Shanghai,

260
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,440
we'll have to go dine
with the brand representatives.

261
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,799
They specifically asked for you to go.

262
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,880
And, while test-driving,

263
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,400
you also need to shoot
an endorsement commercial.

264
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,920
We've worked hard to secure this commercial.

265
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,359
You should know

266
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,920
I've put in a lot of effort.

267
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,079
Wait, well…

268
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,920
If you don't go, then what can I do?

269
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:06,912
Casey.

270
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,472
Casey.

271
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,600
What are you doing?

272
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,599
I thought you would

273
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,839
play that song you wrote yourself today.

274
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,839
That song doesn't need to be practiced.

275
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:28,928
Why?

276
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,559
I've always been looking forward
to hearing the full version.

277
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:35,599
I'll play it on my performance.

278
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,559
Mr. Wei, Ms. Lam wants you.

279
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,696
Want me to help you?

280
00:21:45,696 --> 00:21:46,759
No, thank you.

281
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:47,808
I can handle it myself.

282
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:55,616
Hello, mom.

283
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:06,240
<i>[San Tou Tou Restaurant]</i>

284
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,400
Jiajia's dad.

285
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,760
Sit.

286
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:49,640
Well, today…

287
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,640
Freshly-baked egg tarts.

288
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,376
Mr. Xu.

289
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,359
You're being a bit ungenerous.

290
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:59,880
I thought you were inviting me
to eat shark fins.

291
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,960
I didn't expect

292
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,160
that you'd choose a place like this
to treat me egg tarts.

293
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,720
As long as it's tasty.

294
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:10,119
Okay, but there must be
something to drink, right?

295
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:12,039
Get me one cup of milk tea.

296
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,359
No tea, less sweet, two cups.

297
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,039
What did you say?

298
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:19,680
What does that mean? Don't you let me drink it?

299
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,039
You don't want me to drink it?

300
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:27,480
No. "No tea" means using condensed milk.

301
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:30,160
You northerners don't understand.

302
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,839
Then you southerners
are being a bit overbearing.

303
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:35,480
If my daughter marries into your family

304
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,079
and wants to drink a cup of milk tea,

305
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:39,279
does she need your approval?

306
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:41,799
I can't control what Jiajia wants to drink.

307
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:43,240
Just like with my son,

308
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,920
if he wants to have a lightning marriage
with your daughter,

309
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,759
I can't control him either.

310
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,720
If my daughter insists on
marrying such an older man,

311
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,544
I can't control her either.

312
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,839
You are absolutely right.

313
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:02,200
I guess your current father-in-law
feels the same way.

314
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:11,759
Mr. Qiang, we've known you for decades,

315
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,839
I've never seen you dressing so formal before.

316
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:18,279
Zhen told me to show respect
when meeting the in-laws.

317
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:21,119
So I dug out my suit
from the bottom of the trunk.

318
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,559
Heard that?

319
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,039
He's showing you a lot of respect.

320
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,599
W-What did he say?

321
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,248
Never mind him.

322
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,880
It's rare for you to fly all the way to Macau.

323
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,160
I must recommend the best to you.

324
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,359
Have a taste, see if you like it.

325
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,480
How is it?

326
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,400
Delicious, it has a unique taste.

327
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,599
Every time you come, I'll take you to have it.

328
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:52,160
Okay.

329
00:24:54,432 --> 00:24:55,584
Ms. Zhen.

330
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,200
No need to be so formal, just call me Zhen.

331
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,720
Alright, Zhen.

332
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:07,519
Actually, I have a favor to ask of you.

333
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,519
What is it?

334
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,440
Well, ever since I became a mother,

335
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,559
I would think a lot.

336
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,559
I was thinking, if Jiajia gets married,

337
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,160
then naturally,

338
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,599
she would get pregnant and have children.

339
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:26,039
There would be big changes
both psychologically and physically.

340
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,799
By then, I think

341
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:32,000
she might need someone
who is close and familiar

342
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,640
to be with her and support her.

343
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,248
Well,

344
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,359
every time I come,
I can only stay here for seven days.

345
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,319
I want to ask you

346
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:48,119
to take good care of her on my behalf.

347
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:53,319
Jiajia's mom, you can rest assured.

348
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:56,279
Qiang is also about to retire.

349
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,160
And we won't rush them

350
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,680
to have children.

351
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,264
Whether she wants to have children,

352
00:26:03,264 --> 00:26:04,400
we respect that very much.

353
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,160
Yes. Let them decide it on their own.

354
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,240
Exactly.

355
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,160
If they really have children,

356
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,920
Qiang and I will certainly do our best

357
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,359
to take good care of Jiajia.

358
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,519
Don't worry.

359
00:26:20,384 --> 00:26:21,519
Thank you.

360
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:23,599
It really puts my mind at ease.

361
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,680
Moreover, after they get married,

362
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,720
you can apply for three months…

363
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,279
You apply for a family visit visa,

364
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,519
then you can stay for up
to three months each time.

365
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:35,599
For family visits,
we can stay here for three months?

366
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,400
Right, what are you worried about?

367
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,319
I really overthought it.

368
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:45,160
We will be one family.

369
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,839
We'll face every difficulty together.

370
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,839
We'll face every difficulty together.

371
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,680
What subject do you teach?

372
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,240
My most popular course is economics…

373
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,200
Microeconomics.

374
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:07,160
I don't quite understand.

375
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:12,799
Your family has a professor
and a high-level executive in a big company.

376
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,680
Our family can't match yours.

377
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,960
But I'm good at eating and drinking.

378
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,880
Mr. Xu, don't be modest about this.

379
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,240
Food is the paramount necessity of the people.

380
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,799
For three meals a day,
you're definitely an expert.

381
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,880
Do you cook at home?

382
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,240
Not even going to the kitchen,

383
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,519
I feel headache once I enter the wet market.

384
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,200
That smell…

385
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
And it's such a mess…

386
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,799
A gentleman stays away from the kitchen.

387
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,240
Something like killing chickens and fish,

388
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,359
I can't bear to watch it.

389
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,880
Mr. Xu, don't get me wrong.

390
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,160
Let me tell you,

391
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,519
I have blood phobia.

392
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:04,039
When I went to the wet market,

393
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:06,359
watching others slaughter eels.

394
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:09,160
That nail hammered it into the board.

395
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,759
As the knife went in, and the blood came out.

396
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,519
I felt so scared

397
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,039
and wanted to pass out.

398
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,599
I simply can't watch, sweating profusely.

399
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:21,640
So, you've spent half of your life
bustling in the kitchen

400
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,640
and raising three children.

401
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:28,720
In this aspect, I am such a beginner.

402
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,880
I just run a small restaurant. Nothing special.

403
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:38,559
We just love using fresh ingredients,

404
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,880
catering to the customers' tastes.

405
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,200
I like to try cooking

406
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,279
different dishes.

407
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,400
Well, using seasonal ingredients

408
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,799
gives the best value for money.

409
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:56,839
This is called cost control.

410
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,119
Catering to customers' tastes
is called satisfying client demand.

411
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,200
Regularly updating the menu

412
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,599
is called the uniqueness of the suppliers.

413
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,640
You've already mastered economics.

414
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,559
Professor, you're too kind.

415
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:18,480
I need to learn from you more in the future.

416
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,519
Mr. Xu.

417
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:20,960
I've noticed that you

418
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,599
are not one to stick to conventions.

419
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,759
Because of this,

420
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:28,799
if Jiajia marries to your family,
I would feel at ease.

421
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,776
Why?

422
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,000
Jiajia's mom and I divorced quite early.

423
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:40,359
Jiajia actually grew up with her mom.

424
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:42,599
So, the way she does things,

425
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:46,720
her personality, and her way of speaking,
are very much like her mom's.

426
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,840
A bit unmindful.

427
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,160
Not mindful.

428
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,440
What does it mean?

429
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,960
Well, it means…

430
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,200
Unreliable?

431
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Right, close.

432
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,319
- Okay.
- Unreliable.

433
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,319
Got it.

434
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:09,079
So, you need to be more tolerant of her.

435
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,240
You can rest assured.

436
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,799
Jiajia marries into Macau,

437
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:18,000
we will definitely
treat her as our own daughter.

438
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,079
My eldest son doesn't talk much with me,

439
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,640
but he has been disciplined and orderly.

440
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,519
He's very reliable.

441
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:31,119
I can guarantee you that.

442
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:34,279
Jiajia is sometimes a bit unreliable,

443
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:35,960
but she has always been

444
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,759
a girl with a kind heart and filial piety.

445
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:41,079
I can guarantee this as well.

446
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,079
That's wonderful.

447
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,839
Here, two more cups.

448
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:50,319
No tea, less sweet.

449
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,279
Who bought the balloons?
The color is so tacky.

450
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,480
Hurry up.

451
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:05,119
Why the long face?

452
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,352
Aren't you supposed to be glad
Casey got transferred?

453
00:31:08,352 --> 00:31:09,480
Not really.

454
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,039
I've finally adapted to Casey's work pace,

455
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,119
but now she's transferred.

456
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,720
It's troublesome to get used
to another one's work pace again.

457
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,960
Actually, you don't want Casey to go, do you?

458
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,279
Do I look like a masochist?

459
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,759
- Casey.
- You do.

460
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:23,799
Mom agreed to let me perform my own piece.

461
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,632
Mr. Wei.

462
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,352
Where's Casey?

463
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,720
She went to deal with work.

464
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,559
Anything I can help you with?

465
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,513
<i>[Dear Casey, congratulations
on your new career challenge.]</i>

466
00:31:35,513 --> 00:31:37,056
<i>[Wishing you smooth sailing
and great success in your new position.]</i>

467
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:41,400
She's going to be transferred?
Where is she going?

468
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,039
She's going to the United States

469
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:54,000
Mr. Wei, do you need me
to contact Casey for you?

470
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,168
No need.

471
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,920
Happy birthday.

472
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,720
Why do you know today is my birthday?

473
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,400
You are my VIP,

474
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,759
and even more, my friend.

475
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:28,960
So childish.

476
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:33,720
Make a wish.

477
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,816
Okay.

478
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,552
Make a wish.

479
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,480
Happy birthday.

480
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,559
Have you discussed
changing the music piece with Ms. Lam?

481
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,848
Yes.

482
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,400
Your mom cares about you.

483
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,640
You can communicate more
with her in the future,

484
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,839
then she can know what you're thinking.

485
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,559
When is your birthday?

486
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,104
I don't celebrate my birthday.

487
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,992
Why not?

488
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:21,079
A birthday celebrates
one's coming into the world,

489
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:23,400
and bringing happiness to everyone.

490
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,759
There's nothing

491
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,480
for me to celebrate it.

492
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:35,839
You're a great kid, and an amazing adult.

493
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,880
Just so-so.

494
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,240
What was your birthday wish
when you were a kid?

495
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:48,480
I remember now.

496
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,319
When I was a kid, I wished to have superpowers.

497
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,640
I wanted to travel to the future.

498
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,680
Because I was unhappy every single day.

499
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:01,960
I wondered
if it'll get any better when I'm grown.

500
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,096
Or,

501
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,519
whether I would grow.

502
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,199
You've done well.

503
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,519
I hope you can accomplish what you want to,

504
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,239
go to the places you want to, and don't stop.

505
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,840
But I still have a promise to a friend
that I haven't fulfilled.

506
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,320
This friend's promise is for you to be happy.

507
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,639
I don't think you break this promise.

508
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,864
Thank you.

509
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,519
It's really fast.

510
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,280
I always thought
Jiajia was still a little girl,

511
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,480
following me around

512
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,000
and calling me all the time.

513
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:31,239
From now on,

514
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,199
someone else will accompany her.

515
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:37,079
Who did Jiajia grow up with
since she was a kid?

516
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,960
Well…

517
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,960
Why aren't you speaking? Doesn't it look good?

518
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,639
Good, so beautiful.

519
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,519
Jiajia, when you wear a wedding dress,

520
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:11,159
I suddenly feel that you have grown up.

521
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,320
I've grown up for so many years now.

522
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,199
I was worried that you wouldn't come.

523
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:18,239
At such an important moment
as trying on a wedding dress,

524
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,239
how could your mom and dad

525
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:21,360
not be around?

526
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,960
Besides, we've already talked

527
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,400
to Hao's parents respectively.

528
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,360
We're looking forward to your wedding
as much as you are. Don't worry.

529
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:34,599
You met them alone?

530
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:35,599
We've gone through a lot

531
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,880
to raise you, such an outstanding daughter.

532
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:41,679
And soon you will marry into their family.

533
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:44,320
Naturally, we should interact with them more.

534
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,599
It's hard for you to understand my feelings.

535
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:52,199
Yes, you can understand

536
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:55,039
what grandpa used to feel to you back then.

537
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:02,000
No, how can that boy compare to me?

538
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:06,480
When I came to propose to you back then,
I was so sincere.

539
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,280
What?

540
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,496
At the very least, he's more romantic than you.

541
00:37:10,496 --> 00:37:11,719
Am I not romantic?

542
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:12,920
Romantic. Xu Jianming.

543
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,656
Okay, you two chat,
I'll go change into the next one.

544
00:37:14,656 --> 00:37:15,800
You?

545
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,320
I am a thorough and complete romantic.

546
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,719
What have you done that's romantic?

547
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:23,039
Tang Wei, over all these years,

548
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:25,000
do you think I am not a romantic person?

549
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,920
Don't say that to me, Xu Jianming.

550
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,960
Why ask me if you're romantic or not?

551
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,239
You should ask Meng.

552
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:37,760
Li Meng, is he romantic?

553
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,719
He's just not that kind of person, right?

554
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:42,119
Meng, am I not romantic?

555
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,000
Xu, just think about it.

556
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,360
When was the last time
you gave Li Meng flowers?

557
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,039
Everybody, stand up!

558
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:23,360
Everybody, stand up!

559
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,840
We are the champion!

560
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,519
Champion!

561
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,112
Champion!

562
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:38,519
Champion!

563
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:41,880
Let's hear the champion say something.

564
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,039
Okay.

565
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:46,400
- I…
- Hurry, say something.

566
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:53,920
It's tough to win this championship.

567
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,519
It's tough. I thought

568
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:03,719
that today we would lose at Macau again.

569
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:08,360
Actually, I didn't expect
I'd be back on the track today.

570
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,400
Because my car was already smashed up, so…

571
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,039
It was really tough.

572
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,800
We had no spare parts,

573
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,760
and Charles had to go around asking for help.

574
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,960
It was all thanks to him

575
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,920
to get those spare parts delivered overnight.

576
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,024
Otherwise, I wouldn't have

577
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,000
had the chance to race today.

578
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,519
It's tough.

579
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,559
I think it's really hard
to win the championship,

580
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:44,480
but the hardest thing is having a good team,

581
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,519
and a good manager.

582
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,960
The ones with me
to win the championship is the key.

583
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,719
So the championship belongs to all of us.
Come on.

584
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:52,736
Well said.

585
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,599
Cheers!

586
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:01,119
We are the champion!

587
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,559
We are the champion!

588
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:09,920
Awesome!

589
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,079
Congratulations.

590
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,199
Champion!

591
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:17,039
- Champion!
- Great!

592
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,400
Come on, cheers, one more.

593
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,464
Well done.

594
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,880
We are the best.

595
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:31,712
I always believe in you.

596
00:40:32,288 --> 00:40:33,408
Impressive?

597
00:40:33,408 --> 00:40:34,960
Awesome!

598
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,688
Champion!

599
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:45,088
Champion!

600
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:00,679
<i>It is because Marlena regards love as her life,</i>

601
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:03,280
<i>she's like a fearless warrior,</i>

602
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,840
<i>never hesitant to love, nor afraid to love.</i>

603
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,519
<i>Love is the blade that hurt her,</i>

604
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,679
<i>also her endless creative fuel.</i>

605
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,519
<i>She constantly explores
the desires of human nature,</i>

606
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:21,960
<i>the essence of life and the limits of pain.</i>

607
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,639
<i>Extreme pain allows her
to be reborn from the flames,</i>

608
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,079
<i>awakened from the chaos of the universe,</i>

609
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,039
<i>and blossom new flowers from the ruins of life.</i>
