<i>[Begin Again]</i>

2
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,400
Have you ridden in the rain before?

3
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,239
Yes, but

4
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:03,159
it's the first time
for two people to ride together.

5
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,400
You know what?

6
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,199
There's only one sound

7
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,879
that makes me sleep well.

8
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,039
What's the sound?

9
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,199
It's the sound of the rain.

10
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,840
I play it every night before I go to bed.

Did you sleep well?

36
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,600
The best sleep I've had this year.

37
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,199
Don't you usually sleep well?

38
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,480
Usually,

39
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,639
I sleep lightly.

40
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,280
Be careful.

41
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,240
I've arrived.

42
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,440
Which one?

43
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,384
You guess.

44
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,360
Give it to me.

45
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,552
I'm off.

46
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,752
Bye.

47
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,120
- That's amazing.
- Okay, we're leaving.

48
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,759
- Bye.
- Bye.

49
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,120
Hello.

50
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,759
On the glasses.

51
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,879
Put it on the glasses.

52
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,720
Yes, you look so cool like this.

53
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,759
The back.

54
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,288
I can't see anything.

55
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,120
There you go, I've put it on for you.

56
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,160
All done.

57
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,000
Done?

58
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,040
It's done.

59
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,519
Okay.

60
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,519
Thank you. Then our task today

61
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,600
is completed.

62
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,199
Then I'm leaving.

63
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,319
Okay, goodbye.

64
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,120
Alright, thank you. Wish you study well.

65
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,319
Goodbye.

66
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,279
Kids, do you still have some?

67
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,000
That big brother just bought them all.

68
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,279
I still have one here,

69
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,759
the last one.

70
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,040
It's for you.

71
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,399
Thank you.

72
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,079
- Bye.
- Bye.

73
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,279
I understand, Ms. Lam.

74
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,344
Bye.

75
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,000
I've already confirmed with Ms. Lam.

76
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,080
She wants

77
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,559
you to overcome

78
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,039
the discomfort of your body

79
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,519
and persist in training.

80
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,559
But you can reduce the amount.

81
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,679
How about this?

82
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:59,240
You don't swim today,

83
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,720
and make it up when you've recovered.

84
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,912
Is that okay?

85
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,240
I think Mike

86
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,440
probably won't snitch.

87
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,936
Thank you.

88
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,039
Hello. Want to join us?

89
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,440
No need, thank you.

90
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,480
When you want to join,

91
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,679
come find me.

92
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,519
Don't you want to make a friend your own age?

93
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,879
Getting to know others

94
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:32,480
or letting others get to know you

95
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,519
is indeed a very tough thing.

96
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,320
I already have a friend.

97
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:43,639
You have a friend?

98
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,600
Who?

99
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,624
You.

100
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,960
Me?

101
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,080
Am I your friend?

102
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,200
Aren't you?

103
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:04,639
I…

104
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,840
Do you want to go see the sea?

105
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,759
Mr. Frank, I have something…

106
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,000
It's okay.

107
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,120
When you finish your work,

108
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,879
we'll go see the sea then.

109
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:22,039
Mike, send me to the piano class.

110
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,480
Mr. Frank.

111
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,208
Remember to come pick me up.

112
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,480
Vegetable soup…

113
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,799
Is Portuguese vegetable soup okay?

114
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,639
Okay.

115
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:50,279
Portuguese vegetable soup, and spinach noodles.

116
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,320
Do you want to eat sea bass?

117
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,639
- Okay, that's it.
- Okay.

118
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,799
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

119
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,776
Thank you.

120
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,919
What's wrong? Any trouble?

121
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,039
Do I look like I'm troubled?

122
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,559
It's just written all on your face.

123
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,639
There's something

124
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:36,759
I think I didn't handle it very well.

125
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:39,039
About that little man?

126
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,720
I taught you a trick last time.

127
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,879
Didn't it work?

128
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,960
No.

129
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:58,080
I think

130
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,159
I shouldn't take advantage of this friend.

131
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,200
You are already friends.
Isn't that a good thing?

132
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,759
Shouldn't friends be honest with each other?

133
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,080
Actually, I…

134
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,240
I've been thinking about

135
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,960
how to resolve this.

136
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,600
Because, he and I are of the same kind.

137
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,039
I've been through everything
he has gone through.

138
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,919
It's really hard for people like us
to trust anyone.

139
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,679
Once we open our heart,

140
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,399
if get hurt, it's really hard to

141
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,759
continue the relationship.

142
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,600
I don't know what to do.

143
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,360
After you went back,

144
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,080
do you miss…

145
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,080
Macau?

146
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,776
Of course.

147
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,519
What do you miss about Macau?

148
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,440
The sunsets in Macau,

149
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,120
that band,

150
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,679
and the scenes of people dancing.

151
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,360
That's all?

152
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,279
And the dishes of Zhen Qiang.

153
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,080
My boss

154
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,200
is quite nice,

155
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,559
but I often feel like

156
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,600
she's always being defensive.

157
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,039
So I'm curious about her,

158
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:23,519
and want to know
what kind of person she really is.

159
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,240
I'm not being defensive.

160
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,679
But between people,

161
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,840
I think everything

162
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,480
should be

163
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,960
clear and straightforward.

164
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,000
Owing nothing to each other.

165
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,080
I don't like those

166
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,000
ambiguous relationships.

167
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,080
So is it the same
when you meet someone you like?

168
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,600
Would you take out a notebook and write down

169
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,759
how he smiled at me today,

170
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,200
or what he treated me?

171
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,039
Even when being with someone I like,

172
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:46,799
I hope the relationship between us two
to be simple and straightforward.

173
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,519
And we can take care of our own things,

174
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,600
try to be considerate
of each other's difficulties,

175
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,080
and not to put any pressure or burden
to each other.

176
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,440
Owing nothing to each other.

177
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,600
I do admire the pattern

178
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,360
that you're talking about.

179
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,399
But it feels like that's what happens

180
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,440
between colleagues.

181
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,440
What about you?
What kind of relationship do you want?

182
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,200
I hope the person I love

183
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,360
is my best friend.

184
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:26,320
We don't need to be one hundred percent alike.

185
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,519
We can have our own interests and hobbies,

186
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,399
but we are willing

187
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,200
to experience new things together
for each other.

188
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,840
If I see

189
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,759
a very beautiful cloud,

190
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,360
I would take a picture of it

191
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,519
and share it with her.

192
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,399
If I see something delicious,

193
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,559
I would take her to try it.

194
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,120
How is it, is the food good today?

195
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,200
Very happy.

196
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,879
I hope to go see beautiful scenery

197
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,559
with the person I like.

198
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,840
Even though I may have seen
this scenery many times,

199
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,840
when I go with her,

200
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,759
it would be the most special one.

201
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,736
It's my turn.

202
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,360
When was the last time you fall for someone?

203
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:35,712
<i>♫ I raise for your love ♫</i>

204
00:15:35,712 --> 00:15:38,976
<i>♫ I freeze for your pause ♫</i>

205
00:15:38,976 --> 00:15:41,120
<i>♫ If you want me to ♫</i>

206
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,667
<i>♫ Like we used to do ♫</i>

207
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,039
<i>♫ I pace on the floor ♫</i>

208
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,112
Let's go.

209
00:15:50,112 --> 00:15:55,040
<i>♫ I open the door knowing you were there ♫</i>

210
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,945
<i>♫ Like we used to do ♫</i>

211
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,200
Where shall we go to see the sea?

212
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,879
Did your practice go well today?

213
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,960
Great, shall we go now?

214
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,039
Are you hungry?

215
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:13,240
Want to eat something first?

216
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,519
You don't want to go?

217
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,200
Frank, I'm sorry.

218
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,480
Sorry, Mr. Frank.

219
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:33,600
I can't go to see the sea with you,

220
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,240
nor can I be your friend.

221
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,759
You are my client.

222
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:46,039
I helped you hide your allergies

223
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,552
because of Ms. Lam.

224
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,240
I wanted to transfer to the United States,

225
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,120
but…

226
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,240
but I failed.

227
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:00,519
So I thought

228
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,919
to get in touch with Ms. Lam through you.

229
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,160
Got it.

230
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,720
Aren't you angry with me?

231
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,160
Don't you want to scold me?

232
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,599
It's normal. You're not the first one

233
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,000
to try to please my mom through me.

234
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,480
I'm sorry, I…

235
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,519
I've deceived you.

236
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,920
Enough, Casey.

237
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,559
What time shall we go practice piano tomorrow?

238
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,759
Don't you want to replace me?

239
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,480
Since you're just like everyone else,

240
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,759
then there's no need to change.

241
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,104
<i>[Oyster Sauce Store]</i>

242
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,279
Mr. Jian.

243
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:20,720
Why are you here so early today?
Everything you need is ready.

244
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,519
What's ready? Let me check.

245
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,759
Five pork tongues, seven sets of pork liver,

246
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,200
ten jin each of pork belly and tenderloin.

247
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,039
Twenty ducks and thirty geese.

248
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,319
- About five jin, plucked, right?
- Right.

249
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:31,000
If there's no problem,
I'll help you load them up.

250
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,319
- I'll find Ms. Hong. Deliver them to Zhen Qiang.
- Okay.

251
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,839
Ms. Hong.

252
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,440
Le, you are here.

253
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,720
How is it?

254
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,799
Lettuce, crown daisy,
mustard greens, bean sprouts,

255
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,839
pepper, sand ginger, fermented bean curd,

256
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,279
cinnamon, cloves,

257
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:44,480
licorice, Middle Southern, abalone sauce

258
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,559
dried tangerine peel, and bay leaves.

259
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,799
- Okay, no problem. I'll pack them for you.
- Okay.

260
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,319
Le.

261
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,799
Mr. Jian.

262
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,400
Today I brought a birthday gift for Bin.

263
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,559
You're so kind.

264
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:56,960
I'll give it to him
when he gets home from school.

265
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,240
Give it to him, okay?

266
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,519
What?

267
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:00,640
Girlfriend?

268
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,799
Pretty.

269
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,839
Enough. Don't talk nonsense.

270
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,079
Miss.

271
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,400
Take whatever you'd like to eat.

272
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,279
It's on me.

273
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,799
She doesn't understand Cantonese.

274
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,400
Miss, Le is really nice.

275
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,240
Picking him as your boyfriend

276
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,160
is an excellent choice.

277
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,759
Be serious. Don't bother others.

278
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,079
Miss, don't mind it.

279
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,480
We are very close with Le.

280
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,559
It's his first time
taking a girl to the market.

281
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:29,119
Yes.

282
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:31,359
No, we are good friends

283
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,000
Don't overthink it.

284
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,160
- Alright.
- You get things done.

285
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,640
- Pack up.
- Give the toy to Bin.

286
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,240
Alright, you go on dating.

287
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,119
- Dating.
- No.

288
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,920
Alright, just go.

289
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,839
Do you feel that people here
are all very enthusiastic?

290
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,759
I can feel that you all are really close,

291
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,519
just like family.

292
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:53,759
Maybe this is why

293
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,920
I like Macau.

294
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,279
It's especially warm

295
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,720
and lively.

296
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
It reminds me of my hometown.

297
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,400
When I was young and went back
to my hometown during holidays,

298
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,000
my grandma would take me for strolls like this.

299
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,119
She was also like this.

300
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:10,039
She felt like she knew everyone.

301
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:12,559
And every neighbor was very close.

302
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,599
She could chat

303
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:15,880
with anyone we met.

304
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,440
She used to love taking me out,

305
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,519
and then would introduce me to everyone,

306
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,680
"Look, this is my grandchild.

307
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,119
She's pretty,

308
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:24,400
and has good grades."

309
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,000
My dad did something similar.

310
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,079
But I was not as lucky as you.

311
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,880
He always told the neighbors,

312
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,039
"Today, Le got complained

313
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,920
about by the teacher again."

314
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,279
It's quite embarrassing.

315
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,319
So do you still often go back
to your hometown now?

316
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,119
I haven't been back for a long time.

317
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,960
Where is your hometown?

318
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,720
In a small city in Fujian,

319
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,559
quite similar to Macau.

320
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,480
In that place, I would feel

321
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,160
that people are very close to each other.

322
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,119
Later on, I went to study and work alone.

323
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,880
And I rarely had that kind of feeling anymore.

324
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,480
Maybe because I'm in a big city,

325
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,640
people are distant from each other,

326
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,240
and we are all busy with work.

327
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,480
I think we have no time

328
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
or space to care for each other.

329
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,680
Once you've done your work,

330
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,119
remember to find time to go home
and spend some time with your family.

331
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,312
I really want to too.

332
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,759
My grandma's soup is really delicious.

333
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,920
It's very fresh,

334
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,160
like I can taste the sea.

335
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,640
I often feel

336
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,960
that I would see her in my dreams.

337
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:37,400
She would be always sitting there,

338
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,559
and fanning herself with a fan every day,

339
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,359
waiting for me at the door.

340
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:43,240
She would call me and say,

341
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,000
"Come back and I will cook you

342
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
that soup."

343
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:53,279
Did you learn from your grandma

344
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,400
how to make that soup?

345
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,944
My grandma has passed away.

346
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,799
I'm sorry.

347
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,480
I didn't mean to bring up your sadness.

348
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,768
It's okay.

349
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,839
I think

350
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:24,400
your grandma must miss you very much,

351
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,640
so she would go to see you in dreams.

352
00:22:32,096 --> 00:22:38,720
<i>♫ Today's sky is still blue ♫</i>

353
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,042
<i>♫ Just like yesterday ♫</i>

354
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:50,119
<i>♫ The room and mood are still a mess ♫</i>

355
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,039
You know what?

356
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:55,920
I don't think time is linear.

357
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,240
I think

358
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,640
every moment, every second in life

359
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,880
exists independently

360
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,200
and eternally.

361
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,880
So, the grandma in that past

362
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,920
could still feel

363
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,160
your love and longing for her.

364
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,519
While, in our current time,

365
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:22,559
your grandma might already

366
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,519
have become

367
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:26,319
a lovely butterfly,

368
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:28,759
flying before us,

369
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,000
or a beautiful cloud

370
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,200
in the sky,

371
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:41,799
or a breeze that comes toward us.

372
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:46,400
Past, present, future,

373
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,039
you still have many opportunities
to meet each other.

374
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:54,599
And this beauty

375
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:59,519
won't disappear with the time.

376
00:24:01,785 --> 00:24:04,000
<i>♫ Watch the sunset and the tide rise ♫</i>

377
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,053
<i>♫ Listen to the evening breeze
singing everything ♫</i>

378
00:24:09,053 --> 00:24:13,759
<i>♫ Leaves turn yellow,
and everything is as usual ♫</i>

379
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,079
I thought you only cry

380
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,799
when eating something delicious.

381
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,992
<i>♫ You are already strong enough ♫</i>

382
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,960
<i>♫ You're a bit nervous occasionally ♫</i>

383
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,104
Maybe sometimes I cry
even when I'm not eating something delicious.

384
00:24:27,104 --> 00:24:30,184
<i>♫ Release your uneasiness ♫</i>

385
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,336
Let's go, I'll take you to eat something good.

386
00:24:34,336 --> 00:24:39,400
<i>♫ You've always had wings ♫</i>

387
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:45,240
<i>♫ Little fish also have their own ocean ♫</i>

388
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,319
Yes, this way.

389
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,480
Hello.

390
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,759
I'm Mai, Mai Youge.

391
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,240
It's quite hot in Macau.

392
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,920
Coming from Beijing, it feels like
summer's coming in an instant.

393
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,920
Yes.

394
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,480
Let me introduce first.

395
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,960
This is the Director Mr. Qiang.

396
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,519
- Mr. Qiang.
- Mr. Qiang.

397
00:24:58,519 --> 00:24:59,920
Mr. Qiang's partner, Mr. Xing.

398
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,839
- Mr. Xing.
- Mr. Xing.

399
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,519
These three are the producers in Macau.

400
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:03,640
Ms. Fish,

401
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,839
Ms. Shadow and Mr. Le.

402
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:06,880
The execution

403
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
of the proposal in Macau

404
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,599
will all depend on them.

405
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,839
Please, have a seat.

406
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:11,920
Have a seat. Everyone, please sit.

407
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,440
Thank you.

408
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,960
Meeting Mr. Qiang for the first time.

409
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,344
So nervous.

410
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,359
Actually, you gave us some suggestions

411
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,680
to the proposal,

412
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,599
and we have already made the changes.

413
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:26,799
Would you like to take a look?

414
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,799
Well, we are shooting tomorrow.

415
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,359
And we didn't double-check
of the scene before shooting.

416
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,880
If we'll go directly to the site tomorrow,

417
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,480
can you guarantee
the shooting will go smoothly?

418
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,160
Shooting in Macau

419
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,599
has some

420
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:38,720
strict regulations,

421
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,839
which we must follow.

422
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,119
So now I have written

423
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,920
all the matter to pay attention

424
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,559
of every scene.

425
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:47,119
You may take a look now.

426
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,640
Does the production team

427
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,279
have any restrictions for us?

428
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,720
Actually, we are okay

429
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,799
if you start shooting tomorrow.

430
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,960
But the day after tomorrow,

431
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,920
the scene will be in a public area,

432
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,559
and we can only shoot from 7 AM to 11 AM.

433
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,039
And, on the road,

434
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,839
we can't set up equipment.

435
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:04,359
And as for pedestrians,

436
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,039
we can't block their way.

437
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,039
Macau

438
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,640
is a tourist city,

439
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,640
so please be understanding.

440
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,880
Thank you.

441
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,599
Let's shoot then, okay?

442
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,599
It's late today, and I'm getting old.

443
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,519
I won't stay up late with you guys.

444
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:20,359
We'll start shooting tomorrow, okay?

445
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,279
- Okay.
- Thank you.

446
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,240
- Thank you, Director.
- Thank you, Director.

447
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,359
Rest well.

448
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:27,680
- Thank you, Director.
- Thank you.

449
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,920
Maybe we should

450
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,160
discuss something about tomorrow?

451
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,720
Right, you guys help me check it out

452
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,480
- tomorrow's…
- Shadow,

453
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
let's check.

454
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,039
Right.

455
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:37,160
Take a look.

456
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,816
I think…

457
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:42,279
Tell me if you need any help.

458
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:44,799
No problem, you'll definitely be needed.

459
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,599
No worries. We're professional.

460
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:49,039
Have some herbal tea.

461
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,200
Why did you just call me

462
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,079
Mr. Le?

463
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,680
Just show some respect.

464
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,680
You've never been a laborer.

465
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,200
You haven't heard of it.

466
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,920
But I'm your laborer now.

467
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,400
Hello, Miss McMuffin.

468
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,920
You've worked hard, Mr. Le.

469
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,240
I'll work hard for a bit.

470
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
What do you still need now?

471
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,568
Nothing.

472
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,599
Everyone, please pay attention.

473
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,759
There are more tourists around here.

474
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,400
We can't block them if they need to pass by.

475
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,559
Let them pass before shooting.

476
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,680
Make sure to keep a good attitude.

477
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,119
We must not get complaints.

478
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,720
Macau looks so beautiful.

479
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,839
Let's go for a 4:3 ratio.
Come on, I want the widest one.

480
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:33,880
2.39:1.

481
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,519
The wider one.

482
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:37,160
Director suddenly wants

483
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,799
to change an image format,

484
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,759
and he suddenly says he wants

485
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,640
an anamorphic widescreen lens.

486
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,559
- He didn't mention it when applying for equipment.
- Ten meters.

487
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:47,759
- I have to figure it out.
- Turn on the lights.

488
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:50,200
I wonder if Macau has one.

489
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,599
Don't panic, I'll handle this.

490
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,240
- You…
- Alright.

491
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,839
Our time is limited today,

492
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:00,279
I think we should
do the scene walkthrough first, right?

493
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,960
Okay, go through it again from that spot.

494
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,519
Walk up to here, the two of you stop here.

495
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,920
Keep up, camera.

496
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,079
Walk up to here and make a turn.

497
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:07,319
- The lights are turned on.
- Have a drink.

498
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,559
- What kind of clothing is this? Change it.
- Okay.

499
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:12,079
- The wide lens.
- Thank you.

500
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,720
You really got it.

501
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,799
Mr. Xing, check if this works.

502
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:16,839
Only wide angle, no telephoto.

503
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:18,119
It really is a wide shot.

504
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:20,079
No telephoto.

505
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,680
- Does it work?
- It's fine.

506
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,880
Thank you.

507
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:25,599
You are amazing.

508
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:26,759
I'm still waiting for the message from Fish.

509
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:28,319
She hasn't replied to me,
but you managed to get it.

510
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:30,400
Awesome! You are the best of the day.

511
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,680
Really.

512
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,279
- Uncle Zhong.
- You are here.

513
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:41,119
See what I've brought for you.

514
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,496
You're thoughtful.

515
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:46,160
Uncle Zhong.

516
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,440
You've met before.

517
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:51,799
Are you fellow patients, or

518
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:54,200
a couple?

519
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,000
What?

520
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,599
He is sick, treat him now.

521
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,799
He's here to see a doctor.

522
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,880
Then why did you come along?

523
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:06,240
I came to see you.

524
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,599
That's so nice.

525
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,839
What's your problem?

526
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:12,160
My neck feels a bit stiff.

527
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,440
Wait, what?

528
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,400
Sorry. I don't feel comfortable.

529
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,160
I can't turn…

530
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,960
Come on, sit down.

531
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,039
Let me take a look.

532
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,224
Okay.

533
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,799
You…

534
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,960
Be gentle, don't do it like last time.

535
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,160
It's okay.

536
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,640
Relax, relax.

537
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:44,584
See how it feels.

538
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,079
Uncle Zhong, when I got up this morning,

539
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:50,640
I could only move my head this much.

540
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,840
But now, you see.

541
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,319
Look.

542
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:55,319
You've caught a chill in your neck.

543
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:57,000
These past few days,

544
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,279
you must have been
using the air conditioner quite a bit.

545
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,559
Actually, I haven't been
using the air conditioner much,

546
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,079
but I got caught in the rain,

547
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:07,359
and it was a heavy downpour.

548
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:15,319
But it's not serious, right?

549
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:17,000
It is serious, come here.

550
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,720
- Let me give you a cupping therapy.
- No.

551
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,839
Don't rush. Have you eaten?

552
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:22,599
Look what I brought for you.

553
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:24,200
Smell it.

554
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,799
I've waited in line for a long time.

555
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:26,920
Chen's roast goose.

556
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,960
I can tell just by smelling it.

557
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,000
- And fatty char siu.
- Thoughtful, aren't I?

558
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,720
The lower parts of roast goose
are the most delicious.

559
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,759
An animal walking on two legs,

560
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:36,319
their essence lies in their lower parts.

561
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,440
Looking for a man…

562
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,960
Looking for a man with a strong lower part.

563
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,512
Smart.

564
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,920
Wait, I…

565
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,599
I just, I…

566
00:30:58,599 --> 00:30:59,759
You're talking too fast.

567
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:00,960
I didn't catch some of it.

568
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,319
Looking for…

569
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,759
Looking for a man…

570
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,160
The first time I met you,

571
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,640
I saw you

572
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,440
with a full and rounded forehead,

573
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,759
extraordinary bone structure,

574
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:12,440
- and sharp eyes.
- Not bad.

575
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,279
You're a responsible man.

576
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,920
Jiahui, he's good.

577
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,599
I am the one who's acknowledged
by Uncle Zhong's discerning eyes

578
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:24,839
and skilled techniques.

579
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:27,279
So, think it over.

580
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,079
Uncle Zhong, next time not just roast goose,

581
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:31,759
I will bring you roast pork,
roast duck, and roast chicken too.

582
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:33,000
I'll take care of all of it.

583
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,839
Not just the lower parts of roast meat,
but roast pig's large intestines too.

584
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,680
- No problem.
- Don't try to buy him over.

585
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,039
Uncle Zhong is on my side.

586
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,359
Why bother?

587
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:42,519
We are all yours.

588
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,440
You're so talkative.

589
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,559
Let Uncle Zhong give you acupuncture later.

590
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,960
Right. I forgot it.

591
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,519
- Come on.
- Uncle Zhong.

592
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,759
Don't waste time.

593
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:52,920
I really can't accept acupuncture.

594
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,440
- No acupuncture. Come on.
- I really can't accept the acupuncture.

595
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,799
Are cupping treatments okay?

596
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:56,400
- Wait.
- Let's do cupping.

597
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,440
I'm scared of the cupping treatments.

598
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,200
It's okay, Uncle Zhong is skilled.

599
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,759
No. No acupuncture.

600
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,000
Push to the end, just a little down.

601
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,559
Okay, hold on.

602
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:12,759
Tighten your abdomen.

603
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:14,240
Try to feel your abdomen.

604
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,160
Don't rush, rise slowly.

605
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,880
Good. Exhale

606
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,160
and slowly move forward.

607
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,799
Slowly. Good.

608
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,519
Keep going, hold on.

609
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,279
Good, inhale and lean back.

610
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,839
Yes, good.

611
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:32,519
Exhale and move forward.

612
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:34,039
Right, keep going slowly.

613
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:36,264
To the limit.

614
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,359
Okay, very good.

615
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,279
Let's take a ten-minute break.

616
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:44,519
Just rest well.

617
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:46,039
That was quick.

618
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,920
I asked you to go home to have a meal,

619
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,920
you always said you're too busy to.

620
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,880
Why do you suddenly come here to see me today?

621
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,400
No. I was busy before.

622
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,680
Wei and Huan have been asking

623
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,640
why you don't go to the store.

624
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,680
Qiang has mentioned it many times.

625
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,920
He has no time to care about me.

626
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,839
He's devoted to Zhen Qiang.

627
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:13,279
Look at you.

628
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,839
You're always talking tough, just like him.

629
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,559
Right, well…

630
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,720
How has he been lately?

631
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,119
Is his health okay?

632
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:29,400
As always.

633
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,440
After all, he's getting old,

634
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,559
always with his medication.

635
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:36,000
How can he be like a young man,

636
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,400
running the store every day
with such high intensity?

637
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,160
I've been thinking recently

638
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,759
about the next plan of Zhen Qiang.

639
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,000
I've said it.

640
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,920
Either sell it,

641
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,599
or find a professional to run it.

642
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:53,160
Sooner or later, you'll have to let go.

643
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,079
Easier said than done.

644
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:57,680
It's not easy to let go.

645
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,279
Forget it.

646
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,480
If you really care about him,

647
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,519
why not go home and have a meal?

648
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,000
Okay, tomorrow then.

649
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,400
You agreed?

650
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,639
I'll bring my girlfriend along.

651
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,760
Girlfriend? Since when?

652
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,559
How? For how long?

653
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:17,480
- From where?
- You'll meet tomorrow.

654
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,119
You can ask her yourself.

655
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,280
I can't wait.

656
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,639
You haven't brought any girl home

657
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,639
in all these years.

658
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,920
If you don't tell me, I couldn't sleep tonight.

659
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,280
Don't overact it.

660
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,559
You'll meet her tomorrow.

661
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:31,000
It seems you two brothers

662
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,199
will meet your loved ones this year.

663
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,760
You two are having quite the romantic luck.

664
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,320
Such good news,
I'll talk to Xu about it tonight.

665
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,559
We'll treat you well tomorrow.

666
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,559
Us two?

667
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,119
Is Le dating someone?

668
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,239
Almost.

669
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,239
With his boss.

670
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,119
The two of them are well matched.

671
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,960
I feel they are

672
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,840
almost getting there.

673
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:55,800
I wonder why he hasn't come to me recently.

674
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:31,199
Mr. Wei.

675
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,760
Want me to walk you

676
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,159
back to the hotel?

677
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,760
Where's Casey?

678
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,079
I'll contact her.

679
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,440
Hello, I am Mandy, the PR coordinator.

680
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,599
Where's Casey?

681
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:47,880
Sorry, Mr. Wei.

682
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,039
Casey has something to take care of today.

683
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:52,320
So I will be accompanying you for today.

684
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
Why did she take leave?

685
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,559
She didn't explain the specific reason,

686
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:00,840
just mentioned she has
some personal matters to deal with.

687
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:04,104
Let's go back to the hotel.

688
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,320
<i>[Schedule]</i>

689
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
Mr. Wei.

690
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,000
There's no other plans

691
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,639
for your schedule today.

692
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,639
After you return to the hotel,

693
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:20,280
any other plans?

694
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,519
No.

695
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:23,320
Do you need me to tell you

696
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,920
about tonight's dinner menu?

697
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,079
When is Casey back?

698
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,039
I don't know it exactly.

699
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:33,360
Do you know where she lives?

700
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,159
Sorry, Mr. Wei.

701
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,320
Normally, I only coordinate work with Casey.

702
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,599
We have no private interaction.

703
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:41,256
So…

704
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,888
Mr. Wei.

705
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:19,639
Check.

706
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,360
I've lost again.

707
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,159
Why?

708
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,360
Any news from her?

709
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,639
Not yet.

710
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,239
Please contact her supervisor.

711
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,159
- Hello, this is Frank.
<i>- Hello.</i>

712
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,159
Why didn't Casey

713
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:46,360
come to pick me up this morning?

714
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,559
<i>Casey is sick.</i>

715
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,920
<i>And she's in the hospital now.</i>

716
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,432
Which hospital is she in?

717
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,119
How are you feeling? Is there any discomfort?

718
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,679
Doctor, is…

719
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,840
Is the cancer coming back?

720
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,000
Don't overthink it.

721
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,280
I've checked for you.

722
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,360
All indicators are normal.

723
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,679
You just have gastroenteritis.

724
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:37,679
Stay in the hospital for overnight.

725
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:40,608
And you can go home if nothing's wrong.

726
00:39:40,608 --> 00:39:41,719
Thank you, doctor.

727
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:43,360
The hospital admission procedures
need to be handled by a family member.

728
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,056
Where's your family?

729
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:51,760
It doesn't matter.
I'll take care of it for you.

730
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,159
- Thank you, doctor.
- Rest well.

731
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:09,239
Why are you here?

732
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,440
Howard told me.

733
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,824
Does it hurt?

734
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,679
You lie down. I'll turn off the light for you.

735
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:34,320
Aren't you angry with me?

736
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,360
Why are you here?

737
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:45,159
Please go.

738
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:47,880
I'm fine.

739
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,960
I don't have classes tomorrow morning.

740
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,880
You're sick, aren't your parents
coming to be with you?

741
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,840
I don't want them to come.

742
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:07,079
Why?

743
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:09,800
Are you afraid they will worry?

744
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:20,039
I don't want to disturb others.

745
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,400
Don't you feel lonely alone?

746
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,599
Don't you also like being alone?

747
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:36,039
I'm so tired, and I want to sleep.

748
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:26,559
<i>Grandma, this is really tasty.</i>

749
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,168
Grandma.

750
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:38,159
Sour pig's knuckles.

751
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,079
I want to eat

752
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:43,840
sour pig's knuckles.

753
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:49,192
Grandma.

754
00:43:00,192 --> 00:43:05,024
<i>♫ The sun creeps in, it catches ♫</i>

755
00:43:05,024 --> 00:43:10,472
<i>♫ The leaves quietly and wakes the treetops ♫</i>

756
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:15,712
<i>♫ Dreaming, oh, dreaming ♫</i>

757
00:43:15,712 --> 00:43:19,392
<i>♫ The wonderfulness without any sign ♫</i>

758
00:43:19,392 --> 00:43:24,224
<i>♫ I listen to the breeze
with the tune of the sea ♫</i>

759
00:43:24,224 --> 00:43:30,304
<i>♫ I'm about to embrace the unknown ♫</i>

760
00:43:30,304 --> 00:43:35,031
<i>♫ Dreaming, oh, dreaming ♫</i>

761
00:43:35,031 --> 00:43:39,360
<i>♫ Nothing is predictable ♫</i>

762
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,043
<i>♫ Why not dance with your heartbeat ♫</i>

763
00:43:43,043 --> 00:43:48,227
<i>♫ And swing your dress ♫</i>

764
00:43:48,227 --> 00:43:52,992
<i>♫ At this moment, forget ♫</i>

765
00:43:52,992 --> 00:43:57,000
<i>♫ About all the worries ♫</i>

766
00:43:58,496 --> 00:44:02,670
<i>♫ Why not carry cute curiosity ♫</i>

767
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:07,402
<i>♫ To dance in the wind and the sea ♫</i>

768
00:44:07,402 --> 00:44:09,568
<i>♫ Keep looking ♫</i>

769
00:44:09,568 --> 00:44:17,568
<i>♫ All the wonderful answers
have been predicted ♫</i>

770
00:44:39,392 --> 00:44:43,008
<i>♫ Why not dance with your heartbeat ♫</i>

771
00:44:43,008 --> 00:44:48,249
<i>♫ And swing your dress ♫</i>

772
00:44:48,249 --> 00:44:53,019
<i>♫ At this moment, forget ♫</i>

773
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:57,035
<i>♫ About all the worries ♫</i>

774
00:44:58,624 --> 00:45:02,592
<i>♫ Why not carry cute curiosity ♫</i>

775
