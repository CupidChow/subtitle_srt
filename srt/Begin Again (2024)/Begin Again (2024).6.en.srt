Once your documents are ready, hurry over.

4
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,920
I'll contact the external affairs
in the next couple of days.

5
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,879
Then I'll go double-check the setting.

6
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,599
Just confirm the staff's itinerary.

7
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,680
Make sure there are no omissions.

8
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,359
Is there no elevator here?

9
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,719
No, our hotel has been around
for over 400 years.

10
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,640
There's no elevator, only stairs.

11
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,439
Our hotel had 16 cannon emplacements.

12
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,319
They were used to defend
against pirate invasions in the past.

13
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,680
Now they have become decorations.

14
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,040
There is also a place called
Xiwan Lake near the hotel.

15
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,120
It's very photogenic there.

16
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,359
I recommend it.

Is it Elvis?

21
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,199
Don't bring him up.

22
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,360
What, did you two have a fight?

23
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,240
Fight? Who has the time to argue with him?

24
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,039
So you're not talking.

25
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,280
Yesterday, we went to play in the water.

26
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,800
And then somehow, we
bumped into my ex-boyfriend.

27

I don't know what they talked about.

28
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,439
After coming back, he's been acting strange.

29
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,599
Later, we went up to the mountain top.

30
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,719
I asked him if he had anything to say to me.

31
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,960
He didn't talk.

32
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,319
And he left me there alone.

33
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,159
Why don't you send a text to Elvis?

34
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,439
And clear things up with him.

35
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,840
Maybe.

36
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,280
But if someone says something
bad about me, he just believes it.

37
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,560
I don't want to explain to him.

38
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,800
But you know how boys are.

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,319
He wants to hear something sweet.

40
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,680
No way.

41
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,800
I know you're very proud.

42
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't want to be with someone
who still needs me to explain

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400

Mike, aside from the main meals today,

54
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,919
did Mr. Frank eat anything else?

55
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,400
He is usually very careful with what he eats.

56
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,000
He usually checks the ingredient list.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,120
But I don't know where he
got these cookies from.

May I ask who you are looking for?

133
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,399
So are you friends with Fish?

134
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,680
She is my high school classmate.

135
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:35,039
So, will you be taking over
her work from now on?

136
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,200
No, no, not at all.

137
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,559
I'm just a temp worker today.

138
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,759
I probably won't be able
to help her in the long run.

139
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,440
Because I have my own things to do as well.

140
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,200
Okay.

141
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,919
If you're not at ease,

142
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,320
you can ask her to come again next time

143
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,720
and take you for another tour.

144
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,879
Thank you for today.

145
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:02,679
Of course, I'm just helping a friend

146
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,480
How long will you stay this time?

147
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:15,440
About two weeks, I guess.

148
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,000
Just to scout locations and maybe
revise the script a few times.

149
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,080
As soon as Xinghao confirms the plan,
we'll hurry up and shoot it.

150
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:24,480
That's short.

151
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,960
I thought you could stay about a month.

152
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,240
Can't stay that long.

153
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,000
There are a lot of projects
to work on in the company.

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,120
It's better to shoot and finish up
earlier rather than later.

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,672
Hello?

156
00:09:40,672 --> 00:09:41,759
Hello, Miss Mai.

157
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,840
I am finalizing the on-site filming
locations with the outreach team.

158
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,559
All shooting locations,
including the interior of the Xinghao Hotel,

159
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,440
require advance application and reporting.

160
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,559
So we don't have much time left.

161
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:54,080
It would be best to secure
the locations as soon as possible.

162
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,399
Okay, I know.

163
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,559
I am scouting the sites during the day.

164
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,919
And I'll revise the script at night.

165
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:01,216
I will leave enough time for the actual shoot.

166
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:02,240
Another thing is,

167
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,720
Miss Fish needs a detailed shooting plan.

168
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,159
Okay, I will confirm this
with the shooting team again.

169
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,696
I will let you know once it's confirmed.

185
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:13,080
You were on the phone,
so I went to look at something nearby.

186
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,000
Did you hear any

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,120
strange sounds?

188
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,320
Herbal tea?

189
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,840
Like that?

190
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,639
Delicious chrysanthemum tea.

191
00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:38,600
<i>[Macau Museum]</i>

192
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,559
How long will you stay this time?

193
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,799
You asked that question.

194
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,679
Really?

195
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,808
Yes.

196
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:01,679
Two weeks, right?

197
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,320
I don't know what work Fish
has arranged for tomorrow.

198
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,720
I'll call her in a bit to ask and confirm.

199
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,440
Our shooting schedule is
actually quite rushed this time.

200
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,200
I do need someone who is
very familiar with Macau,

201
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,679
and also familiar with my way of working.

202
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,336
It's better for advancing the work.

203
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:23,399
That's fine.

204
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,360
Fish has many excellent producers around her.

205
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,528
Are you free?

206
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,799
Are you hungry? Do you want
to go eat something together?

207
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:56,200
Anything but McMuffin's is fine.

208
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,759
We won't eat McMuffin.

209
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:00,399
If we do, we'll have two of you.

210
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:04,992
How about I take you to a restaurant?

211
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,000
Here he comes, here he comes.

212
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,440
- Who is coming?
- Your Iron Horse Prince.

213
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,639
What are you waiting for? Hurry up and go.

214
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:25,879
Sir, is there anything I can help you with?

215
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,720
It's quite oppressive.

216
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,000
Compared to other works, this piece

217
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,200
doesn't have vivid colors.

218
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,320
So it's very oppressive.

219
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,320
This work is from the period
when Monte was in the vineyard,

220
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,039
after breaking up

221
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:51,159
with his lover of many years.

222
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,919
Did they ever get back together?

223
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:57,080
Some things between lovers are unsolvable.

224
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,559
I think it's a matter of personal will.

225
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:13,200
If he wanted to find her,
he would come to see her.

226
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,399
What if she doesn't want to see him?

227
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:17,440
Do you want to see me?

228
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,159
What do you want to eat?

229
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,960
I'll take you to eat something delicious.

230
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,200
Do I have a choice?

231
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,240
No.

232
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,480
This way.

233
00:14:46,112 --> 00:14:47,392
- Three guests.
- Okay, a group of three.

234
00:14:47,392 --> 00:14:48,399
Come on, beauty.

235
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,440
- Over there, thanks.
- This way, this way.

236
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,320
Qiang, they asked you to go fishing,
but you didn't go.

237
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,799
They asked you to watch a play,
and you didn't go either.

238
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:56,039
<i>[Zhen Qiang]</i>
You're always here, hoping to make a quick buck?

239
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,120
You keep saying the same thing
over and over again.

240
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,240
If I don't look after this shop,

241
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,559
who will cook for you?

242
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,799
Yeah, if you don't cook,
we won't have anything to eat.

243
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,896
There's such a long queue.

244
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,639
Don't follow me. Go stand in line.

245
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,352
Then, what are you going to do?

246
00:15:16,352 --> 00:15:18,360
You go line up, and I will go up
and see the boss.

247
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,159
I think he might still remember me.

248
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,600
I'm going to say hi.

249
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,232
You go line up; otherwise, we won't
have anything to eat later.

250
00:15:23,232 --> 00:15:24,320
- Okay.
- Let's go.

251
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,344
Bye-bye.

252
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,440
Boss.

253
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,639
Isn't this just fate?

254
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,879
Do you really recognize me?

255
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:34,080
Of course, I do.

256
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,039
Last time you didn't get to eat
the salt and pepper mantis shrimp, right?

257
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,720
Yes, yes, that was me.

258
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,759
Can I eat it today?

259
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,080
Of course, they are especially big today.

260
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,136
I'll save one for you.

261
00:15:43,136 --> 00:15:44,679
I also brought a friend with me today.

262
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,560
- No worries, if it's not enough, order more.
- Okay.

263
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,279
- Alright, please line up.
- Okay.

264
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,679
- Okay.
- Good, thank you.

265
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,720
Thank you, boss.

266
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,840
Is it my turn, boss?

267
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,919
Do you have a table for two?

268
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,799
- For three?
- We have space for three.

269
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,840
Please come in, party of three.

270
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,840
- Party of three, follow me.
- Thank you.

271
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,720
<i>[Zhen Qiang]</i>
Boss, a table for two.

272
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
My friend, Le.

273
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,320
So he's your friend.

274
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,679
Yes, when I last came to Macau,

275
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:22,679
he was my local guide.

276
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,279
And this time, he's helping me
with the location scouting again.

277
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,240
Let me tell you, be careful
when making friends.

278
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,712
This rascal is unreliable.

279
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:36,799
Le.

280
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,519
Last time, he was the reason you didn't

281
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,519
get to eat the salt and pepper mantis shrimp.

282
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,080
Qiang, it's not right for you to say that.

283
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,960
They didn't catch any large shrimp.

284
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,720
How can you blame me for that?

285
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,440
If you don't do your work properly,
I'll break your legs.

286
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,240
Alright, Qiang, hurry up.

287
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,279
I don't want to work anymore.
Will you take care of me, please?

288
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,639
You know each other?

289
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,120
We've known each other for a long time.
He's my dad.

290
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,480
Your dad?

291
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,799
And she is?

292
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,799
My boss, Mai.

293
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:11,240
No, no, a friend, a friend.

294
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,744
- Boss, huh?
- Boss, yes.

295
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:16,839
Boss, please have a seat.

296
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,839
Sit, boss.

297
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,200
Sit, come on.

298
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,376
Thank you, Boss.

299
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,599
Order whatever you want to eat.

300
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,880
If he does anything wrong,

301
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,000
tell me, and I'll teach him a lesson.

302
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,920
Okay, okay.

303
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,200
Okay, Boss.

304
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,256
Go on with your work, Boss.

305
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:42,240
Your dad?

306
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,328
Is this your family's shop?

307
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,359
Yes, it is.

308
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,759
Then why didn't you tell me before?

309
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,960
My family photos are all over there.

310
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,000
Who would notice that?

311
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,424
Every time I mentioned this store before,

312
00:17:51,424 --> 00:17:52,480
you never told me.

313
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,400
I didn't have the chance to tell you.

314
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,279
Every time, I talked as if I were
very familiar with the boss.

315
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,640
I'm utterly embarrassed.

316
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,599
You two really are quite familiar
with each other, that's good.

317
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,599
Someone come and give us a hand.

318
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,279
What is it? Come on, come on.

319
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,599
Something for you to drink, herbal tea.

320
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,839
Thank you, thank you.

321
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:11,680
Zhenzhen. Zhenzhen.

322
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,880
Where's Qiang?

323
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,888
In the back.

324
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,519
Hey, you.

325
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,759
Le.

326
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:22,799
Have you finished your homework?

327
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,599
You haven't, have you?

328
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,599
Miss Mai.

329
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:28,559
- I've told you many times.
- Hello, Miss Mai.

330
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,440
You should just focus on watching the kitchen.

331
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,000
Look at you, having to cook, serve dishes,
and greet guests at the same time.

332
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Do you think you're still in your twenties?

333
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,440
Come, try this signature dish.

334
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,504
Thank you, thank you.

335
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:39,400
Who says you can't do things when you're older?

336
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,759
Nowadays, young people may not
be in better shape than me.

337
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,640
Yes, yes, yes, just look at yourself.

338
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,559
If you ran with me every day,

339
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,880
it might be possible, just look.

340
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,319
If you feel sorry for me, just come
to the shop and keep me company more often.

341
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:53,160
Then my back wouldn't be sore,
and my legs wouldn't hurt.

342
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,304
I'm with you every day

343
00:18:54,304 --> 00:18:55,456
Alright, alright.

344
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:56,680
Go home and show off your love, alright?

345
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,799
There are guests here.

346
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:59,680
Your mother loves me.

347
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,720
If you're envious, find someone for yourself.

348
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,848
Find what?

349
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:05,519
Qiang, over here.

350
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,880
Coming.

351
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,359
Mai, this is Zhenzhen, my mom.

352
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,640
This is Mai, my boss.

353
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,832
Hello, my name is Mai Youge.

354
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:13,920
Just call me Mai.

355
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,104
Hello, please sit down.

356
00:19:15,104 --> 00:19:16,759
Alright.

357
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:18,960
Sit.

358
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
What are you doing?

359
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,480
What?

360
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,304
Mai, are you a friend of Le's?

361
00:19:26,304 --> 00:19:27,400
Yes.

362
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,119
Eat whatever you want.

363
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:31,039
- Okay.
- He's treating.

364
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,160
Okay.

365
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,280
You treat us.

366
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,400
You treat.

367
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,680
You have money, so you treat.

368
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,160
Follow me.

369
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,240
She's a friend, come back.

370
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,799
Your mom looks so young.

371
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,599
She looks younger than me.

372
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:51,400
Not really, that's an exaggeration.

373
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,680
She runs every day, so she
might be in good shape.

374
00:19:56,992 --> 00:19:59,599
- Not bad, not bad.
- Full of energy.

375
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,960
Here it comes.

376
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,799
All right.

377
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,519
So cool.

378
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:07,519
Jiahui, is that your boyfriend?
He's so handsome.

379
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,440
Just friends, Miss Kang.

380
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,880
I think you two are a good match.

381
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,640
Alright, go on and get busy.

382
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,000
Let me know if you need anything else.

383
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,720
Actually, there are many small shops
like this in Macau.

384
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,759
It seems like the service
attitude isn't very good.

385
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:24,799
But the taste is truly amazing.

386
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,920
Just like you.

387
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,000
What?

388
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,200
Just like you.

389
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,264
Is my attitude bad?

390
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,096
I'm not saying your attitude is bad.

391
00:20:36,096 --> 00:20:37,240
Let's put it this way.

392
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,839
Someone who just met you might
think you're really cool.

393
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,440
But after getting to know you for a while,

394
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,039
they'll find you're actually
warm-hearted beneath the surface.

395
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,200
Go on.

396
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,920
Beautiful and kind-hearted.

397
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,480
I meant keep drinking the sweet soup.

398
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:56,240
Oh, I see.

399
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,880
Go ahead, it's sweeter than being in love.

400
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,799
Then how long have you been the sweetest?

401
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,160
Not very long.

402
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,304
Why?

403
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,839
Flowers have their blooming seasons.

404
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,960
Maybe it's the same
with relationships between people.

405
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,359
Every relationship is perfect in the beginning.

406
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,400
Everyone wants to show

407
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,400
their best side to each other, right?

408
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,880
So actually,

409
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,640
you always enjoy

410
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,880
the best part of a relationship, right?

411
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,960
How should I put it? I just feel

412
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:43,480
that once the beautiful part is exhausted,

413
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,920
you start to see a person's true colors.

414
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
And in fact, not everyone

415
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,079
can unconditionally accept those true colors.

416
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,559
So instead of slowly depleting
the fondness between each other,

417
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,880
it's better to part ways sooner.

418
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,640
This way, you can keep the good memories.

419
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,119
Isn't that so?

420
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,519
I see, you actually don't believe in love.

421
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:09,680
Where did you draw that conclusion from?

422
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,480
Let's put it this way, you

423
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,799
don't believe that after you
fully understand someone,

424
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:19,319
you will continue to like them, right?

425
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:21,000
Or vice versa,

426
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,680
when that person fully understands you,

427
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,160
you don't believe they will
continue to love you, right?

428
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,759
So, do you really believe in love?

429
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:34,559
Of course, I believe in love.

430
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,000
And I've always believed

431
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,279
that only when you understand
someone completely,

432
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:44,799
and then you still like them,

433
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:47,319
can it be considered love.

434
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,400
Otherwise, what is it?

435
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,200
It could just be a shallow liking,

436
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,799
or infatuation over a short period of time.

437
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,680
Have you ever encountered this kind of love?

438
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,279
Regrettably, I have not.

439
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:05,680
But I believe I will.

440
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:14,759
Actually, I quite want to experience
the love you talked about.

441
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:17,160
Not just a shallow liking.

442
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,160
How did Le introduce Mai to you just now?

443
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:35,160
He said she was his boss.

444
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,119
And he's accompanying her
for site surveys and such.

445
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,160
When have you ever seen Le

446
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,160
bring a girl to eat at the restaurant alone?

447
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,359
How could she be the boss?

448
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:45,079
Now that you mention it, it does seem so.

449
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,160
Go and feel things out first.

450
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,799
Going over like that is quite sudden.

451
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,559
Serve the dishes.

452
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,599
- Good idea.
- Hurry on.

453
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,480
It feels like your family is really close-knit.

454
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,072
It seems like there's no generation gap
between you and your sister.

455
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,240
How many years apart are you?

456
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,280
18 years, I think.

457
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,000
18 years? So it's just the two
siblings in your family.

458
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
We also have an elder brother.

459
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,480
But he's quite busy, so he
rarely comes to the shop.

460
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,160
This handsome guy is him.

461
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,240
Mai, Mai, there's another dish.

462
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,359
How come there are still more?

463
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,559
I know, right?

464
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,976
Today, there are many dishes
that I haven't seen before.

465
00:24:22,976 --> 00:24:24,079
How can we finish eating so much?

466
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,920
These are all Qiang's creative dishes.

467
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,519
This one is called 'A Prime Minister's
belly can hold a boat'.

468
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:34,359
This one is called 'The Taste of First Love'.

469
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:36,359
First love is full of gains and losses.

470
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:38,720
It makes you feel both sweet and salty inside.

471
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,680
It looks very light, but it is flavorful.

472
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,480
This is from the first time
Qiang and I traveled.

473
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,536
Alright, alright.

474
00:24:45,536 --> 00:24:48,160
Save the lovey-dovey stuff
for when you get home, okay?

475
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,200
Don't scare others.

476
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,480
They all have very interesting names,
all chosen by Qiang.

477
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,440
Le, come over and help.

478
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,359
Your dad is calling you, go and help quickly.

479
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,599
- Go.
- Roger that.

480
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,688
Go, go, go.

481
00:24:58,688 --> 00:25:01,680
- Hurry up and go.
- Don't talk nonsense.

482
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,599
I'm chatting with your friend. Go, go, go.

483
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:06,039
Go help your brother.

484
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,104
Go to the kitchen.

485
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,480
Let me show you.

486
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,160
Guess which one is Le.

487
00:25:18,048 --> 00:25:19,680
- Take a look.
- This is Le.

488
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,559
No, this is his elder brother.

489
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:22,960
This one is actually Le, right?

490
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,519
This one is the elder brother,
and this one is Le.

491
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:26,359
- Very cute.
- Really very cute.

492
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,392
Very cute.

493
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,640
Our shop wasn't here before.

494
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,880
At that time, I was pregnant with Le

495
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,720
when I fell at this doorstep.

496
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,359
The owner of the shop, a good person,

497
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:39,599
took me to the hospital, and Le was okay.

498
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:41,000
Later, we learned that the owner

499
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,519
wanted to retire and stop.

500
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:45,480
So we thought it was fate.

501
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,160
So Qiang and I

502
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,559
simply took over the shop to run it ourselves.

503
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:52,640
- Until today.
- Prosperity abounds.

504
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,440
Hurry up and eat, or the food will get cold.

505
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,519
Mom.

506
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:57,960
Are you feeling shy? Is that it?

507
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,319
Not at all.

508
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:00,519
This is you when you were a child.

509
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,039
- So cute.
- Very cute.

510
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,240
Very cute.

511
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,519
Me, my brother is cuter.

512
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,640
No, you're cute, you're cute.

513
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,759
- Really?
- Yes, yes, yes.

514
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,359
Mai, come and eat whenever you're free.

515
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:12,279
Whatever you want to eat,
let Qiang make it for you.

516
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,279
Okay, thank you.

517
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,599
- Okay.
- Okay.

518
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:18,400
Do you live far from here?

519
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,920
No, I can walk there.

520
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,160
Let Le take you.

521
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,079
- It's okay.
- You're his boss.

522
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,880
Let him run some errands for you.

523
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,759
Remember to take Mai home, okay?

524
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,984
I will, Mom.

525
00:26:29,984 --> 00:26:31,119
Enjoy your meal.

526
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,119
Thank you, thank you.

527
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,912
What did she say about me?

528
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,200
All good things.

529
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,720
Sorry, that's just how Zhen is.

530
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,440
She's warm and passionate towards everyone.

531
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,359
I hope you can handle it.

532
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:58,519
I finally understand who you
really take after now.

533
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,519
How is the food today?

534
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,200
Very happy.

535
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:42,799
Take one oral medication before bedtime.

536
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,000
If it feels itchy, you can use
the topical medication.

537
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,039
Don't scratch it with your hands.

538
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,160
My mommy told me.

539
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,920
Why did you say it was your negligence?

540
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,880
It's not important.

541
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,799
Sorry for causing you trouble.

542
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,440
Thank you for helping me.

543
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,240
Can you promise me one thing?

544
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,920
If there's anything you don't
want to do in the future,

545
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,839
or anything you want to do, you should tell me.

546
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:21,640
We can face it together, okay?

547
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,128
Okay.

548
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,680
Just ahead is Lingnan Bend.

549
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,119
It's the most challenging
section in all of Macau.

550
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,839
Try to maintain the lane while driving.

551
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,200
Make slight adjustments to the throttle.

552
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,480
Prepare in advance for the next turn.

553
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,720
I remember that Doumoto performed
particularly well here last year.

554
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,240
The timing of his braking and turning

555
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,480
was mastered very precisely.

556
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,599
Junhao, what's on your mind?

557
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:52,440
Nothing.

558
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,279
I was just thinking

559
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:56,559
that Doumoto did do a good job here.

560
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,680
And how I should do it.

561
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,279
Why haven't you brought me here before?

562
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,200
You were so busy when you came last time.

563
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,839
I didn't have time to bring you here.

564
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:21,359
Besides, Macau is a place
where you need to slow down

565
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:23,799
and truly savor.

566
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,440
Moreover, as a local,

567
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,319
I think there are still too many
tourists here, and it's too commercial.

568
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:35,319
This is a lighthouse, why isn't it by the sea?

569
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:37,240
This place used to be the sea.

570
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,319
But due to later constructions,

571
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:41,640
it was filled and became land.

572
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:45,799
Do you think Macau has changed a lot

573
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:48,119
compared to when you were a child?

574
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,319
I think it's just like people.

575
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,240
Time keeps moving.

576
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,960
Some things have changed,

577
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,279
but some things always stayed the same.

578
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:04,559
What about you?

579
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,880
Is there anything that has remained unchanged

580
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,400
for you from childhood to adulthood?

581
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,839
Well, me,

582
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,119
I might have always been very hardworking.

583
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:18,039
It shows.

584
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:19,839
And you seem like the type

585
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:22,039
who has always been the top
student throughout your life.

586
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:24,079
I haven't always been the top of the class.

587
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:26,400
Really?

588
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,880
I just really attended a lot of
interest-based tutorial classes.

589
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,920
Since childhood, my parents said,

590
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,480
if you like something, go and learn it.

591
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,000
And if you learn, learn it well.

592
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,559
If you do something, do it well.

593
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,759
Otherwise, it's better not to do it at all.

594
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,200
Sounds like I was indeed quite fortunate.

595
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,160
Because my parents were too busy.

596
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,039
As a child, I used to go to the shop to do
my homework as soon as the classes ended.

597
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:51,119
After finishing, I would sneak out

598
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,960
to play with neighbors and other kids.

599
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,759
We went to toy stores and comic book stores.

600
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:59,559
Then, I would return to the shop for dinner.

601
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:01,240
Pretending to have been doing
my homework the whole afternoon.

602
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,359
Didn't you go to tutorial classes?

603
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:08,160
I did attend some, both tutorial
and interest classes.

604
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,839
In the end, I just liked driving.

605
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,920
Then why didn't you continue?

606
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,200
A few years ago, I participated
in a competition,

607
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,799
and there was a pretty serious accident.

608
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,160
At that moment, I thought of my parents.

609
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,720
I decided that I couldn't let them
worry about me anymore.

610
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,079
Moreover, I feel that being
a professional racer

611
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:51,079
is quite boring.

612
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:55,279
Because you're always dealing
with teammates and coaches.

613
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,519
And you also have to go out
and take photos for advertisements.

614
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,599
I really don't know what these things

615
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:01,359
have to do with driving.

616
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:05,759
I just want to drive purely.

617
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:14,160
Everyone has their own troubles, I guess.

618
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:22,720
But we all have the right to choose happiness.

619
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,320
Are you happy?

620
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,960
I am quite happy now.

621
00:34:20,128 --> 00:34:21,519
<i>[Baishun]</i>

622
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:24,159
Am I going too fast?

623
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,519
Not fast enough.

624
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:29,039
What are you looking at?

625
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:31,079
The clouds.

626
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,800
Are they pretty?

627
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,800
If you wanted to space out,

628
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,320
where would you go?

629
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,639
I'm taking you there.

630
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,800
Yes.

631
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,840
We have already confirmed this shooting plan.

632
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,159
But there are still some legal
processes at Xinghao's side.

633
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,199
So it might take a few more days.

634
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,800
Okay, okay.

635
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,920
Alright.

636
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,320
Rest assured, I will keep an eye on it.

637
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:07,208
Okay, okay.

638
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:09,760
Alright.

639
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,920
Okay, then let's meet in Macau.

640
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,960
Okay, bye.

641
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:18,719
Okay, okay.

642
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,679
Yes, yes, okay, okay, okay

643
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:23,400
I know, okay, okay.

644
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,784
Okay, okay.

645
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,280
Okay, bye.

646
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,559
Have you ever counted how many 'okays'
you say in one sentence?

647
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:43,800
I just counted, and there are about

648
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,280
273.

649
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,119
This is just normal phone talk.

650
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:52,760
Every employee talks like this on the phone.

651
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,239
When you say 'okay' on the phone,

652
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,800
it sounds all right.

653
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,199
But when texting, you can't just say 'okay'.

654
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,679
What would you say then?

655
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:04,920
Well, you need to say,

656
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,239
'okay-dokey',

657
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,920
'alrighty',

658
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,880
'roger that', 'okay kay'.

659
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,039
Okay kay?

660
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:17,719
The goal is to appear as friendly
and enthusiastic as possible.

661
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,519
So friendly.

662
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:20,800
Okay-dokey.

663
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,119
Yeah.

664
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,559
Go and take a look in the subway.

665
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,079
During the morning and evening rush hours,

666
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:30,320
people in each carriage

667
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,239
have their mobile phones in their hands,

668
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,239
and they keep on texting.

669
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:35,232
But their faces are expressionless.

670
00:36:35,232 --> 00:36:36,360
But if you accidentally look at their phones,

671
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,719
you might catch a glimpse of their
messages reading 'darling' or 'sweetheart'.

672
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:40,119
Those aren't sent to their significant other.

673
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:42,239
They're all sent to the clients.

674
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,599
This is the daily routine of the working class.

675
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:46,599
You just don't understand it.

676
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,888
Hurry up.

677
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:07,320
I finally know why you ride so fast.

678
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,639
You were eager to see the sunset, right?

679
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:11,920
Glad we made it in time.

680
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,199
Beautiful, isn't it?

681
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,256
It is.

682
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,519
You've shown me a different
side of Macau again.

683
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,639
We are so lucky.

684
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,760
One day the Little Prince said he

685
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,719
watched the sunset 44 times in one day.

686
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,280
If our Earth were as small as his planet,

687
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,400
I would also be willing to bring a little
stool here every day to watch it.

688
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:08,320
But do people who love to watch
sunsets tend to be lonely?

689
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,032
Maybe.

690
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:38,840
Have you ever thought about what
you would do if you weren't

691
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,872
doing this job today?

692
00:38:47,155 --> 00:38:48,992
No.

693
00:38:48,992 --> 00:38:52,512
But I really loved singing when I was younger.

694
00:38:52,512 --> 00:38:53,679
Singing?

695
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:56,400
In the past, when I passed by
the school auditorium,

696
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,440
if I saw someone singing inside,

697
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,360
I would imagine what it would be like

698
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,400
if I were singing on that stage.

699
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:09,039
Do you sing?

700
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,760
Do I look like someone who can't sing?

701
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
No, no, no, not at all.

702
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
It's probably because of your current job.

703
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,639
You seem rather tense.

704
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:20,719
So it's hard to imagine

705
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:24,199
what you'd be like when singing.

706
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,519
Handsome guy, sorry to bother you.

707
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:48,800
Can I borrow your guitar?

708
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,920
For about five minutes or so.

709
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,256
Come on.

710
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,960
Are we really doing that?

711
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,000
Why not?

712
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,199
What do you want to sing?

713
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:15,304
Let me think.

714
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:29,728
I really haven't sung in a long time.

715
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:31,559
- Come on
- I'll sing a song

716
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:34,559
I used to like but never sang.
