00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:29,952
[Begin Again]

2
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,079
I did some research last night

3
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,840
about where we are going today.

4
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,000
Today, we are not going
to the tourist attractions.

5
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,040
Besides, didn't we agree

6
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,560
I'm in charge of today's schedule?

7
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,480
- Yes.
- Don't worry. I will definitely show you

8
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,840
a Macau beyond your expectations, okay?

9
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,680
Okay.

10
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,480
- Okay?
- Yes.

11
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,592
Okay.

12
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,120
Hold on tight.

13
00:02:19,688 --> 00:02:24,768
[Episode Three]

14
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,120
Junhao, our goal

15
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,159
is not to achieve the fastest lap time,

16
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,240
but to achieve a good

17
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,199
- average lap time.
- Okay.

18
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,360
This position is really crooked.

19
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,479
Take something to prop it up a bit.

20
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,159
Xia, here.

21
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,719
- It's arriving this afternoon, right?
- Yes.

22
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,520
- Then unpack it. It's going on display tomorrow.
- Okay.

23
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,400
- There are four pieces inside, right?
- Yes.

24
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,439
Make this spot a bit brighter.

25
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,439
And make this spot a bit darker.

26
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,280
Actually, your three fastest sections combined

27
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,759
are way faster than your fastest lap today.

28
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,280
But just like last year,

29
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,599
they didn't happen in the same lap.

30
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,919
Let's talk about the T7 low-speed corner first.

31
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,400
It's very similar to Macau's hairpin turn.

32
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,280
But there's a problem with you
taking the low-speed corner.

33
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,120
You're being too aggressive.

34
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,000
Of course, it will bring you

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,919
slight improvement in lap time,

36
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,280
but it will also increase tire wear.

37
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,759
I don't suggest you focus on that.

38
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,360
So, next up,

39
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,240
we should practice hard

40
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,199
on the T14 section. Try it out.

41
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,639
The shadow on the side needs to stand out,

42
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,759
otherwise there's no contrast right now.

43
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,840
Alright, I understand.

44
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,240
- Put this one over there.
- Okay.

45
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,520
Put the square one over here.

46
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,919
It's too small over there.

47
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,319
It's almost set.

48
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:38,159
- See if there's anything wrong.
- No.

49
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,719
I'll come over an hour early tomorrow morning

50
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,759
to make the final confirmation.

51
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,199
Okay, don't worry. It will be done well.

52
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,840
Where is this?

53
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,639
You'll know later.

54
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:55,039
Wait, I'm not here for tourism,

55
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,199
but to scout the location.

56
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,120
I know. But you promised me yesterday

57
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,319
that you'd follow my schedule today.

58
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,560
I have to work on a proposal.

59
00:04:14,163 --> 00:04:18,995
♫ The sun creeps in, it catches ♫

60
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:23,443
♫ The leaves quietly and wakes the treetops ♫

61
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:29,683
♫ Dreaming, oh, dreaming ♫

62
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:33,363
♫ The wonderfulness without any sign ♫

63
00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:38,519
♫ I listen to the breeze
with the tune of the sea ♫

64
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,839
♫ I'm about to embrace the unknown ♫
How is it? Seeing the sea for the first time?

65
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,800
♫ Dreaming, oh, dreaming ♫
I've growing up by the sea, you know.

66
00:04:49,043 --> 00:04:52,410
♫ Nothing is predictable ♫

67
00:04:53,372 --> 00:04:57,055
♫ Why not dance with your heartbeat ♫

68
00:04:57,055 --> 00:04:59,720
♫ And swing your dress ♫

69
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,319
I just haven't seen the sea in a long time.

70
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,879
♫ At this moment, forget ♫
Do you feel like returning to your hometown?

71
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:10,099
♫ About all the worries ♫

72
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,839
♫ Why not carry cute curiosity ♫
Can we play a game?

73
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,439
I'll think of something in my mind,

74
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,560
and you can

75
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
ask me some questions.

76
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,120
I will answer "yes" or "no".

77
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,800
- Is it the sea?
- No.

78
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,600
Is it a color?

79
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
What do you mean?

80
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,680
You should ask about a specific color.

81
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,664
Food?

82
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,584
Right.

83
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,360
- Getting closer.
- Really?

84
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,480
- Yes.
- So…

85
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,504
It's edible.

86
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,480
- Is it something we've eaten these days?
- No.

87
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,264
No?

88
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,240
Raw or cooked?

89
00:05:55,296 --> 00:05:56,416
Raw or cooked?

90
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
That's two questions.

91
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,279
- Okay.
- The first is "No", the latter is "Yes".

92
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,879
- Okay, so it's cooked.
- Yes.

93
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,952
Cooked.

94
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,808
Meat?

95
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,664
Yes.

96
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,680
Cooked meat.

97
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,519
- Something that flies in the sky?
- No.

98
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
- Something that runs on the ground?
- Hmm.

99
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,279
Cooked meat, running on the ground.

100
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,288
Getting closer.

101
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,720
- Beef?
- No.

102
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,480
- Pork? Pork product?
- Yes.

103
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,759
See, is it efficient?

104
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,399
Soon, I think you could guess it.

105
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,639
You are smart.

106
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,800
Cooked, processed,

107
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,480
pork products.

108
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,680
- Sausage?
- No.

109
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,680
Here's a tip.

110
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,399
It's not something

111
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,720
with a single ingredient.

112
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,040
Well, is the other ingredient eggs?

113
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,368
Really?

114
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,800
Pork, eggs.

115
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,839
Something processed with pork and eggs.

116
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,000
You are amazing.

117
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,439
Chinese or Western style?

118
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,072
Okay, one question at a time. Chinese style?

119
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:09,376
No.

120
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,839
- Western style?
- Yes.

121
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,480
Western style, pork, eggs.

122
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,879
Western style, processed.

123
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
- Pig filet and eggs?
- It's close.

124
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,160
You're so smart. It's very close.

125
00:07:28,384 --> 00:07:29,504
But,

126
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,800
just one step away.

127
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,519
What is one step away from pig filet and eggs?

128
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,639
No, that's not the name.

129
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,600
Don't tell me it's the pig filet and eggs meal.

130
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,920
No, how could it be?

131
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,639
- Very close.
- What could it be?

132
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,240
Just pig filet and eggs.

133
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,319
Very close.

134
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,759
But it's not this name.

135
00:07:50,688 --> 00:07:51,776
One word.

136
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,696
McMuffin?

137
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Because you are Mai,

138
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,528
and you are perfect.

139
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,199
- What's wrong?
- Thank you.

140
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
One more thing.

141
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,879
In the mainland China,

142
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,680
McMuffin

143
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,360
is not available all day.

144
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,888
So in here,

145
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,079
you are perfect

146
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,160
the whole day.

147
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,200
What?

148
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,320
Is this the Portuguese style architecture?

149
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,399
Yes, this area used to be

150
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,559
where the Portuguese officials lived.

151
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,000
Now it has all been turned into museums.

152
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,039
Look at this pavement.

153
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,960
It was all laid out using ballast stones

154
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,679
by the sailors.

155
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,279
In this way, the Portuguese style

156
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,279
was integrated into Macau.

157
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,159
And now this place

158
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,039
has become the backyard for Macau residents.

159
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,528
I can tell that.

160
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,679
Indeed, everyone here looks very relaxed.

161
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,879
How long haven't you had a vacation?

162
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,048
Vacation?

163
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,399
I can't remember when was the last time

164
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,440
I had a vacation.

165
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,759
There are so many clients to deal with,

166
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,919
and so many proposals to make.

167
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,360
I don't even think about taking a vacation
when I have time.

168
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,000
If I have time, I would get some sleep first.

169
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,120
Then if you could take a day off tomorrow,

170
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,320
what would you like to do?

171
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,159
If I could take a day off tomorrow,

172
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,480
I'd like

173
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,919
to watch a sunset leisurely.

174
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,639
I want to watch

175
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,879
a pink sunset

176
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,080
like in Altay.

177
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,039
When the sun sets,

178
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,360
the whole sky

179
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,039
would look like being dyed
with thousands of pink roses,

180
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,279
complemented by the clouds in the sky.

181
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,320
The whole sky

182
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,679
would feel like soft and sweet.

183
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,919
And you would feel like

184
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,080
being melted by it,

185
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,720
which is soul-healing.

186
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:26,960
Of course, I haven't seen it with my own eyes.

187
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,759
I've only seen it in my friend's proposal.

188
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:32,352
Come with me.

189
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,320
- Where are we going?
- You'll know later.

190
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,279
Hurry up.

191
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,440
Where to?

192
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,448
We're almost there.

193
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,120
Although we don't have

194
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,200
a pink sunset like in Altay,

195
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,919
we have a golden sea.

196
00:11:16,436 --> 00:11:23,104
♫ And I really don't know what to do ♫

197
00:11:24,712 --> 00:11:30,048
♫ Should I resist or let you go ♫

198
00:11:31,476 --> 00:11:36,928
♫ Or should I listen to my heart ♫

199
00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:42,112
♫ My body and soul ♫

200
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:45,088
♫ Just reach out to you ♫

201
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:50,676
♫ I know it's not right ♫

202
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:54,240
♫ But it's so hard to fight ♫

203
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:03,392
♫ And I must confess I love you ♫

204
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,279
Here, let's drink.

205
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,440
Fine.

206
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,519
Just take a sip, don't drink it up.

207
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,840
I don't care. I'm drinking it up.

208
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,639
Miss, you really beat me.

209
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,759
Don't you want to find the feeling of Marlena?

210
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:23,840
Alright.

211
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,000
- I'll drink with you.
- That's the spirit.

212
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,200
Want to go dancing?

213
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Of course.

214
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,000
But we have to finish this drink first.

215
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,008
Fine.

216
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,120
Let's go.

217
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,200
Let's go dance.

218
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,039
Thank you for today.

219
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,279
I really didn't expect

220
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,360
to see such scenery in Macau.

221
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,000
If I had come alone,

222
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,279
I definitely wouldn't have found it.

223
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,080
See? I told you to trust me.

224
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,376
What is this?

225
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,279
Is this a performance?

226
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,879
This is a band's performance

227
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,279
that I wanted to show you today.

228
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,279
Rhesus, hello.

229
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,600
Hello.

230
00:13:18,112 --> 00:13:19,136
You know him?

231
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,704
My dad's friend.

232
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,440
I'll go buy you a drink.

233
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,080
Why don't you wait here for me?

234
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,120
Okay.

235
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,320
- Okay, don't go around.
- Okay.

236
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,248
Why standing there?

237
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,440
Macau is so small that brings us together.

238
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:42,919
Here comes fate.

239
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,440
Beauty, come and play.

240
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,879
Come play together.

241
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:02,240
- No.
- Anyone takes her in? Hurry.

242
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,159
No, I can't dance.

243
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,399
Wait, I can't dance.

244
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,600
I can't dance.

245
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,600
- What?
- Let's dance.

246
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,720
I can't dance.

247
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,144
We meet again.

248
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,432
You know each other?

249
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,256
Yes.

250
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,159
- Isa.
- Hi, Isa. Nice to meet you.

251
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,200
Nice to meet you too.

252
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,919
And your name?

253
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,016
Joe.

254
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,776
Elvis.

255
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,480
- You dance?
- Me?

256
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:08,960
I don't think so.

257
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,000
No? Well,

258
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,639
- Joe here, an amazing dancer.
- Really?

259
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,399
- She loves to dance.
- Are you serious?

260
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,679
- Sure.
- What do you want?

261
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:18,799
Definitely, handsome guy, go for it.

262
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,720
- Come on.
- Okay.

263
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,799
Teach me how to dance.

264
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,240
I'm going to have a drink.

265
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,279
- You're going to teach him dance here.
- Thank you.

266
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,912
Like this.

267
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,208
Like this.

268
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
Want to have a drink?

269
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:02,848
Sure.

270
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,544
Han.

271
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,240
You're here.

272
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,599
- Y-You are…
- Ella.

273
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,119
- Don't you remember me?
- No.

274
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:11,119
I was drinking there. Long time no see.

275
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,319
- No, I don't recognize you.
- Wait.

276
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,920
- Let's have a drink.
- Wait.

277
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,160
Come on, let's have a drink.

278
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,599
Wait, we don't know each other, right?

279
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,680
Of course, we know each other.
Don't you remember me?

280
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,200
Wait, I am Ella.

281
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,880
We have seen each other
in the server room last time…

282
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,559
- Have a drink. Come have a drink.
- Wait.

283
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,880
I'm a bit tired. I'm going back first.

284
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,000
- What about you?
- Leaving so soon? Don't go.

285
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,039
Don't stay out too late.

286
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,200
Got it.

287
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,359
Let me know when you get back, bye.

288
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,400
You don't recognize me?

289
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
I really don't recognize you.

290
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,160
I sat over there. Don't you recognize me?

291
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,359
Where are you going? Have a drink.

292
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,200
- Where are you going?
- How about this?

293
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,599
Join my friends for a drink.

294
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,920
Hello.

295
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,720
Ella. We're good friends.

296
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,119
Wait, what are you doing?

297
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
I'll take you home.

298
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,232
What's wrong?

299
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,279
You just want to have dinner with me, right?

300
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,536
You're not getting out of the car, are you?

301
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,519
If you don't go, I will. Okay?

302
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,759
Really? Don't go.

303
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,640
Wait, how do I open this car door?

304
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,000
Come back and open the door.

305
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,039
I'm getting off.

306
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,920
- I'm out, close the door.
- Okay.

307
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,456
What?

308
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,559
Wait, what do you want?

309
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,759
- Do you have to do so?
- Yes, I do.

310
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:49,880
Could you please get off now?

311
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,279
I'm going back.

312
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:52,352
Don't get mad.

313
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,936
Go.

314
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,000
Do you have to do so?

315
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,656
Yes.

316
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,559
I haven't felt this relaxed in a long time.

317
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,640
Didn't expect Macau to be this charming.

318
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,920
There are much more charming places

319
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,240
in Macau

320
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,272
waiting for you to discover.

321
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,559
Are you available tomorrow?

322
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,680
Tomorrow, I really need to stay in the hotel

323
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,680
to get the proposal done.

324
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,632
How about the day after tomorrow?

325
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,519
I'm going home the day after tomorrow.

326
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,448
Have a safe journey.

327
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,792
Your bag.

328
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:12,599
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

329
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,480
These are beverages and some food

330
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,039
I bought just now.

331
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,519
You can have them during your work overtime.

332
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,080
Thank you.

333
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,080
By the way,

334
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,160
do you remember

335
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,440
the water from Lilau you drank?

336
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:37,680
Then you will definitely come back.

337
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:51,039
I really have to go back.
I still have a meeting to attend.

338
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,079
Let's go. I'll send you there.

339
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,200
No, thanks. It's just around the corner.

340
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,480
Then be careful.

341
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,200
I'm glad to have met you in Macau.

342
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,240
Thank you for your help these past few days.

343
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,799
I'm also very glad to have met you.

344
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,400
- Bye.
- Bye.

345
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,960
Miss Mai, I've read the proposal

346
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,000
you worked on overnight.

347
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,279
Those photos from Macau are so beautiful.

348
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,920
Rui, hold on.

349
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,079
Mai, are we

350
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,400
just missing a slogan?

351
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,359
Do you find a suitable one that we sent?

352
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:05,359
Too conventional.

353
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,519
We need to…

354
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,680
We have to impress the clients

355
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,039
- once they see the slogan.
- Sorry to interrupt, Miss Mai.

356
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,799
Actually, it's too late to change now.

357
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,440
Ms. Maggie has already
sent the proposal to Director Tong.

358
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,079
- Alright.
- We're waiting for her feedback.

359
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:20,480
Then let's wait. We can only wait.

360
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
But Miss Mai, before the presentation tomorrow,

361
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,160
I think we still have time
to come up with a new slogan, right?

362
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:27,799
Then today, I can

363
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:28,799
touch up the pictures.

364
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,599
Anyway, we're waiting
for Director Tong's feedback.

365
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,319
No hurry. Once it's done,

366
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,960
let's celebrate tonight.

367
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:36,440
Director Tong said it's worth a try.

368
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,519
I knew it. Mai, this will surely work.

369
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,680
- I just think these photos…
- Okay, that's all for today.

370
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,279
Everyone, thank you. Thank you all.

371
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,119
- Thank you all.
- We can definitely use them tomorrow.

372
00:23:52,511 --> 00:23:54,496
[Xinghao Hotel invites you to a meeting
to discuss the promo proposal tomorrow.]

373
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,359
Wait.

374
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:35,359
Wait, take a break.

375
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,079
What's wrong with you today?

376
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,640
You usually can run a few laps with me.

377
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,960
Whose

378
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,359
age is bigger?

379
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,920
It has nothing to do with me.

380
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,519
I didn't sleep well last night,

381
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,839
so I'm not in good shape today.

382
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,720
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

383
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:57,408
No.

384
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,480
You usually fall asleep once you go to bed.

385
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,488
Except for those few years working
in Hong Kong, you had trouble sleeping.

386
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:05,400
You usually sleep quite well.

387
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,480
Don't make me like a jobless and carefree man.

388
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,880
You have no work trouble, so…

389
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:18,880
You're trapped in love.

390
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,680
I study philosophy.

391
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,680
Every day, I have to think about

392
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,480
how to pursue myself and something big.

393
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,680
Love has nothing to do with me.

394
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,640
Don't make me die laughing.

395
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,119
I'm your mom.

396
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,960
I understand you.

397
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,400
Who is it? Do I know her?

398
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:43,039
- Who is it?
- Nobody.

399
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,279
Tell me, who is it?

400
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,680
Nobody.

401
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,279
- Nobody?
- Nobody.

402
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,039
- Nobody.
- I'll interrogate you later.

403
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,104
Interrogate?

404
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,119
Take it slow.

405
00:26:03,808 --> 00:26:05,728
[Mai Youge]

406
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,512
What's wrong?

407
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,720
It's not just recently.

408
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,640
You know, the store is always busy,

409
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,720
from five in the afternoon
to five in the morning every day.

410
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,599
Your dad is always anxious,

411
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:50,920
has to worry about everything himself.

412
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,119
He's getting old.

413
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,440
So I advised him

414
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,400
to close the shop a bit earlier.

415
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,559
Every time I told him so,

416
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,200
he didn't take it seriously.

417
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,400
You knew him.

418
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,279
How could he let go?

419
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:07,799
You two have put all your effort

420
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:08,880
in Zhen Qiang Store.

421
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,400
Whenever he goes to the store,

422
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,839
he gets motivated,

423
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,200
beaming with joy.

424
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,720
Whenever he rests at home,

425
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,920
he hides in the study to drink tea.

426
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,279
So it's better to let him

427
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,160
do something that makes him happy.

428
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,960
I understand. Of course, I know him.

429
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,839
But I am worried

430
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:29,359
if one day he really can't hold on,

431
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:31,079
he would keep it from me.

432
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,440
Don't think about these. It's alright.

433
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,119
Don't worry. I have resigned and come back now.

434
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,960
I will put more effort

435
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,240
in the store.

436
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,248
Okay? I promise you.

437
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,480
From now on,
for trivial matters like grocery shopping,

438
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,359
just leave them to me.

439
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,880
Trivial matters?

440
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,200
Grocery shopping is a top priority.

441
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,720
The freshness of ingredients matters the most.

442
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,319
You must not be careless.

443
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,079
You sound like my dad now.

444
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,279
Really?

445
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,640
Why don't I feel it?

446
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,240
It's a waste if you don't be an actress.

447
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,559
You know what? Your acting is so good.

448
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,272
Miss Mai.

449
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,720
Let me introduce you.

450
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,880
This is our Senior Vice President, Mr. Xu.

451
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

452
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,720
She's Marketing Director, Amanda.

453
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,599
- Hello.
- Hello.

454
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,400
He's New Media Operations Manager, Chuck.

455
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,680
- Hello.
- Hello.

456
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,839
This is Mai Youge,

457
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:35,880
Customer Manager from EMG.

458
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,160
She's here to present the proposal today.

459
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,880
- Shall we get started then?
- Okay.

460
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,319
Hello everyone. I'm Mai Youge, Customer Manager

461
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,359
from EMG.

462
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,559
Our entire planning team

463
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:58,759
is also participating

464
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:00,319
in the meeting remotely online.

465
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:02,359
I will first present the proposal
on behalf of EMG.

466
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,960
After it,

467
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,759
if you have any questions,
please feel free to ask.

468
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:06,799
Then they will

469
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,119
provide some targeted elaboration online.

470
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,359
This is the theme

471
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,599
of our proposal.

472
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,720
Excuse me.

473
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,839
This theme of yours,

474
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:22,200
what does it have to do with our hotel?

475
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,599
Right, Mr. Xu. I understand your confusion.

476
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,559
But I hope you could be patient,

477
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,400
and I will explain it to you.

478
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,200
Undoubtedly,

479
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,839
Xinghao Hotel
is a top-tier hotel brand in the world.

480
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:41,200
However, with the booming tourism industry
in Macau in recent years,

481
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,920
in fact, among the top hotels,

482
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,279
there have also been

483
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:45,920
competitive situations.

484
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,160
Therefore, we believe

485
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,039
that Xinghao Hotel's promo

486
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,240
should not focus

487
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,039
on showcasing the hotel itself anymore,

488
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,200
instead,

489
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,799
through our promo,

490
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,559
letting the audience understand
that choosing Xinghao Hotel

491
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:00,799
means acquiring

492
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,119
a brand-new travel experience

493
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:05,000
and a type of

494
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,799
distinct lifestyle.

495
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,039
So in the promo, we decided

496
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:13,519
to combine the scenery, unique culture,

497
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,960
regional cuisine of Macau

498
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,960
and Xinghao Hotel.

499
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,119
We want to fully display

500
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,000
the fusion
between Eastern and Western cultures in Macau

501
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,519
and the coexistence of historic culture

502
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,000
and modern culture.

503
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,880
Our goal is

504
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,200
to strongly bind Xinghao Hotel

505
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,920
with Macau Culture and Tourism,

506
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,079
to let the audience feel

507
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,839
the unique charm of the Greater Bay Area.

508
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:33,960
The audience will then want

509
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,000
to travel to Macau.

510
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,920
And when they do come to Macau,

511
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,160
Xinghao Hotel will

512
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,599
become their top choice.

513
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:51,160
Everyone knows that it's an era

514
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,640
of short videos.

515
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,119
If a video can't capture its users

516
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,319
in the first three seconds,

517
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:59,440
meaning it has lost its users forever.

518
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,400
Therefore, we decided

519
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,200
to use the Macau Grand Prix GT Cup event

520
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,319
sponsored by Xinghao Hotel

521
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:06,519
as the opening scene.

522
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,759
We will turn the streets

523
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:10,519
into racing lanes,

524
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:11,640
and replace traffic lights

525
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,240
with racing start lights.

526
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,279
Excuse me.

527
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,119
Excuse me.

528
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,640
Can you give me a lift?

529
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:23,640
That is to say,
at the very beginning of the promo,

530
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,559
we should let the audiences feel

531
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:29,039
that Macau is a city full of the unknown,

532
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,000
making one

533
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,200
feel excited.

534
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,200
This is a kind of misattribution of arousal.

535
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,960
Through some

536
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,039
extreme situations,

537
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,599
we make everyone feel

538
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,960
a sense of excitement.

539
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,359
From now on, as long as you're in Macau,

540
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:48,759
I can take you to have tasty food every day.

541
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:54,759
You walk slower than during the day.

542
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,039
But after the excitement,

543
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:01,440
we will also unfold

544
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,839
the Macau's living atmosphere

545
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,799
and cultural heritage.

546
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,000
Macau is a city

547
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,839
with a slow pace, romance,

548
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,960
and the warmth of life,

549
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,319
where one can truly let their guard down

550
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:55,680
and enjoy the city at that very moment.

551
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,079
So when everyone

552
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:06,200
