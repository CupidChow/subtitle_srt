00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:30,824
<i>[Begin Again]</i>

2
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,079
Meng, Meng, what time is it?

3
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,120
It's almost 12 o'clock.

4
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,560
I remember I set an alarm.

5
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,439
I have an appointment at 12:30

6
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,719
with Xu, Xu what?

7
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,400
Xu what Hao?

8
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,760
Xu, Xu Minghao?

9
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,760
Chen Minghao.

10
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:03,079
Oh no, I'm going to be late.

11
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,840
Meng, I'm going to be late.

12
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,959
Take out my razor

13
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,199
from my toiletry bag.

14
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,248
It's Xu Junhao.

15
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,312
Xu Junhao.

16
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,639
That old chap must be 40 by now.

17
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,800
Our Jiajia is only

18
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,479
just over 20.

19
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,719
He wants to cheat

20
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,800
my daughter into his hands so soon.

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,960
Meng, take out my

22
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,319
bottle of wine for me.

23
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,159
You're bringing your own wine?

24
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,199
Of course.

25
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,199
Have you sobered up

26
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,439
from the wine you drank yesterday?

27
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,800
And you're drinking again today.

28
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,840
You know,

29
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,960
I can skip other wines,

30
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,759
but not this time.

31
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,639
Stop showing off.

32
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,360
Could you, help me wipe my glasses?

33
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,199
Yes, right, they are here.

34
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,039
You know, drinking reveals character.

35
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,319
I'll take out two bottles and give them to him.

36
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,240
I'll let him choose.

37
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,240
No, I'm really going to be late.

38
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,680
I'm out of time.

39
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,360
You've got to help me with my clothes.

40
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,960
Wear this one.

41
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,599
It's a bit stuffy here. This is cooler.

42
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,879
This, this outfit

43
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,400
is what I want to wear.

44
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,439
You can go shopping today.

45
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,719
Buy whatever you want.

46
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,080
Once I'm done with this old boy,

47
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,159
I'll come and join you.

48
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,719
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

49
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,719
Anyway, just handle this matter.

50
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,479
Let me know if you need anything else.

51
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,360
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Casey.

52
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,400
Your son, huh?

53
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,560
Yeah. Say hello.

54
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,759
Hello.

55
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,280
What are you doing?

56
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,400
Are you also here for the event?

57
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,480
Is that not allowed?

58
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,800
It's allowed.

59
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,919
Tian, slow down.

60
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,480
Johnny.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,400
Slow down, Tian.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,319
- Be careful. Are you okay?
- Thank you.

63
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,480
- Thank you, too. Are you here for the event?
- Yeah.

64
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,160
- Then let's go together.
- Okay.

65
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,920
There will also be many events

66
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,319
that you can participate in.

67
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,959
You can take a look.

68
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,920
- Thanks a lot.
- Not at all.

69
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,959
Is that your son?

70
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,720
No, he is my client.

71
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,279
I am the PR Manager at Xinghao.

72
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,680
My name is Casey.

73
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,160
- Let's play together later.
- Sure.

74
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,864
Casey.

75
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:45,279
You guys at Xinghao are well-informed.

76
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,480
I think you're also here
for Mrs. Liu's exhibition.

77
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,800
But that's no problem.

78
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,519
Afterwards, there are many
parent-child activities.

79
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,560
It will depend on how well

80
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,720
you and your partner get along.

81
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,744
We'll find out soon.

82
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,360
Tian, go for it!

83
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,120
Tian, go for it!

84
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,600
Tian, come here.

85
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Tian.

86
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,879
Okay, come to Mommy.

87
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,639
Be careful.

88
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,808
- Okay, okay.
- Tian.

89
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,839
Tian.

90
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,240
- Casey.
- What's wrong?

91
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,120
Tian's shoes do not fit well.

92
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,319
Are Tian's shoes

93
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,160
not fitting well?

94
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,279
Tian, tell Mommy,

95
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,560
are your shoes not fitting properly?

96
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,240
The shoes, the shoes are a bit small.

97
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,040
Mei, how did it happen?

98
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,759
- Come on, let's change them.
- Children grow fast.

99
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,759
Shoes, clothes,

100
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,560
these get small before you know it.

101
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,759
Thank you.

102
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,059
It's okay.

103
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:53,360
Once she changes her shoes,

104
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,920
she will perform better.

105
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,079
Let's try again. It's okay.

106
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,480
Quickly, let's go.

107
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,319
Slowly, slowly.

108
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,959
- Slow down.
- No.

109
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,480
Be careful.

110
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,648
Okay.

111
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,959
Great.

112
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,680
One, two, three.

113
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,000
Four, five, six.

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,160
Seven, eight, nine.

115
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,519
It's alright, come on.

116
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,519
One.

117
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,000
Five.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,079
Prefers the night over the day?

119
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,639
Three, two, one.

120
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,639
- No.
- Yes.

121
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,560
Okay, compared to going out to play,

122
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,959
prefers to stay at home?

123
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,560
No.

124
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,839
Yes, okay, next question.

125
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,279
Hello, Casey.

126
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,800
Chloe.

127
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,879
Thanks to you and Frank,

128
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,800
the event went smoothly.

129
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,399
No, we should thank you.

130
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,552
Where is Tian?

131
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,959
I told her to take a rest.

132
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,279
Are you worried about Tian

133
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,920
not being happy today?

134
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,639
You saw it just now.

135
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,279
When we were playing the game,

136
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,600
we were not as in tune as you and Frank were.

137
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,399
I've always felt

138
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,000
that I know my child quite well.

139
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,439
Actually, children are more
mature than we think.

140
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,480
I've only realized
while accompanying Frank recently

141
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,959
that they understand a lot.

142
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,680
They are sometimes
more thoughtful than us adults.

143
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,439
They don't need to talk

144
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,920
to know

145
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,079
how we feel

146
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,279
and if we're happy.

147
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,519
Yes, I've always felt

148
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,680
that those children from the stars
are very lonely.

149
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,279
They need care and understanding.

150
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,519
Yet, I have overlooked

151
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,480
the most important person by my side.

152
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,000
And my daughter is actually

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,319
taking care of my feelings.

154
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,480
I don't even understand my own child.

155
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,800
How am I qualified to hold this exhibition?

156
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,240
You came for the exhibition too, right?

157
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,839
Today, I did

158
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:23,199
come with a mission.

159
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,959
I have been thinking

160
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,079
if this exhibition

161
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,480
could invite some children

162
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,680
as volunteers

163
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,000
to share their feelings

164
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,440
about the paintings they see.

165
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,799
We can listen more to their voices.

166
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,519
That's a good idea.

167
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,000
I can also take Tian with me.

168
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,919
Yes, this way Tian can also know

169
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,960
what you are doing.

170
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,720
And she can also feel

171
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,399
she is a part of your life.

172
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,919
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

173
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,879
If you have time, let's have a good talk

174
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,399
about the art exhibition.

175
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,448
- You can contact me anytime.
- Okay.

176
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,480
Where is their rest area?

177
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
It seems to be up ahead.

178
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:16,320
This way, hurry.

179
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,799
What piece are you playing?

180
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,000
That's really impressive.

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,399
I wrote it myself.

182
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,120
It's so good.

183
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,240
Tian.

184
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,919
Mom, Frank wrote the piece himself.

185
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,000
That's really impressive.

186
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,559
Yes, Mom heard it.

187
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:02,360
It's very nice, Tian.

188
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,799
Mom, please have a seat.

189
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:55,600
Ms. Tang looks especially beautiful today.

190
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,080
It's not working.

191
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,399
I ordered the coffee you love.

192
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
Mom.

193
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,080
Mom, look.

194
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,759
This is a fine white cubilose.

195
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,399
You work so hard, always staying up late.

196
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:21,279
You should treat yourself better.

197
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,080
Jiajia, you are always rushing
around the world.

198
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,639
Today, you're facing cold
in the snow-capped mountains,

199
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,519
and tomorrow, you're getting
bitten in the tropical rainforest.

200
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,200
You've never brought me any local specialties.

201
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,488
You've changed, huh?

202
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,519
Actually, it was bought by Hao.

203
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,279
He knows you often stay up late.

204
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,879
So he went out of his way to buy it for you.

205
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,559
Hello, sir.

206
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,840
Xu.

207
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,600
Come, please take a seat.
Sorry for the long wait.

208
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,240
Not at all, I've just arrived.

209
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,320
Come on.

210
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:01,080
You've chosen a nice place.

211
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,360
I'm glad you like it, sir.

212
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,248
Come on.

213
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,472
Here.

214
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,759
- Which one do you like?
- It's up to you, sir.

215
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,279
I'm fine with anything.

216
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,328
You choose.

217
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:19,519
Then let's go with the white one.

218
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,799
After all, there will be opportunities
for foreign ones in the future.

219
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,200
Hello, hello.

220
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,840
Don't always talk about the future.

221
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,000
Let's talk about the present today.

222
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,679
Marriage is such a big deal.

223
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:35,840
And you're just informing me in person.

224
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,720
It's not informing. I'm reporting.

225
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,399
Begin your report, then.

226
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,000
How long have you known each other?

227
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,088
More than half a year.

228
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,759
Just over half a year?

229
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,600
And now you want to get married?

230
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,639
Tell me how you met.

231
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,000
Speaking of Jiajia,

232
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,200
actually, the first time I saw her,

233
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,080
I felt as if we hit it off
right from the start.

234
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,679
No, it's not an exaggeration at all, sir.

235
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,519
I'm serious, I always felt like I had
seen her somewhere before.

236
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,960
To be honest, the first time I saw him,

237
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,120
I had a really, really bad impression of him.

238
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,159
I wondered how someone could be so pretentious.

239
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,000
So I went over to ask her. I said,

240
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,240
have we met somewhere before?

241
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,440
This line

242
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,879
had been outdated

243
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,120
back in our time.

244
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,759
That's what your daughter said at the time.

245
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,120
Actually, that day was a business event

246
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,519
organized by the company.

247
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,799
Aside from investors,

248
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,000
I had no other intentions.

249
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,759
I just kept talking there.

250
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,320
But when it was time to go down the mountain,

251
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,440
Jiajia came over

252
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,399
and asked me, "Did you see the clouds
on the mountaintop just now?"

253
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,879
And I said, "What clouds?"

254
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:47,039
She said, of course, you didn't see them.

255
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,799
You were so busy talking.

256
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,200
That's her. Cheers.

257
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,000
So

258
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,759
that's what you said to him.

259
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:56,159
Did he get angry then?

260
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,799
I don't care whether he gets angry or not.

261
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,919
I just felt

262
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,000
"Since you have flown

263
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,120
halfway across the world,

264
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,840
can't you detach yourself
from those trivial matters

265
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,519
and properly enjoy the moment?"

266
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,559
And then?

267
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,200
Then, that night we were at the camp,

268
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,039
there was a campfire dinner.

269
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,840
When it was time to light the fire,

270
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,279
we actually had lighters prepared.

271
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,960
But he, for some reason,

272
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,679
must have had a wire cross wrong I guess,

273
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:21,639
insisted on trying to start a fire
by drilling wood.

274
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:23,240
So what happened then?

275
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,000
Then she came over to me with barbecue.

276
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,879
She asked if I was tired
after drilling all night.

277
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,639
Come on, have some barbecue.

278
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,519
The more she was like that,
the more enthusiastic I got.

279
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,159
I just had to drill and show her.

280
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,960
I remember I was saying something

281
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,799
about the physics behind it or something.

282
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,440
It's quite difficult to start a fire this way.

283
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,799
Yes, it actually is very tough.

284
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,279
If you couldn't get it lit in the end,

285
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,480
how embarrassing would it be?

286
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,679
That's so true. But she propped me up there.

287
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:47,480
So I drilled desperately, I had to.

288
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,440
In the end, did he manage to light it?

289
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,000
Of course not.

290
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,519
I'm still laughing at him to this day.

291
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,360
How could he be so silly?

292
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,840
He was so different

293
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,039
from his usual shrewd

294
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,240
and capable self.

295
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,240
Actually, if she had been ten seconds late,

296
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,440
I might have really given up.

297
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,440
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

298
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,039
However, that night,

299
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:23,360
that very night,

300
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:27,919
we sat under the star-filled Milky Way,

301
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,000
and we talked a lot, an awful lot,

302
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,519
Until the sun came up, that's when I realized

303
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,480
an entire night had already passed.

304
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,799
How romantic.

305
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,519
It's so nice to be lovers.

306
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,960
So why not

307
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,279
continue doing that?

308
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:56,039
It's only been half a year.

309
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,440
You still don't fully understand

310
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,519
his temperament and nature.

311
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,879
Mom, how well you know someone

312
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,759
doesn't necessarily correlate with time.

313
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:11,120
It mainly depends on what you have
experienced together, right?

314
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,480
But Jiajia, do you know?

315
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,559
Love and marriage

316
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,360
are two entirely different matters.

317
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,960
Dating is about living
in the moment without constraints,

318
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,120
but marriage is not.

319
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,039
Marriage is about the daily necessities.

320
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:30,720
The repetition day after day.

321
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,639
You'll be living with each other's flaws.

322
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:36,080
It's a kind of consumption.

323
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,879
And the age difference
between you is so significant.

324
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:40,240
You grew up in different environments,

325
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,600
even linguistically.

326
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,360
The way you deal with problems also differs.

327
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:49,919
So the decision you are making today,

328
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,360
have you thought it through?

329
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,984
Mom,

330
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,120
I'm talking to you today

331
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,120
because I want to tell you

332
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,879
that I've thought it through very clearly.

333
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,319
Actually, I've been traveling
all over the world these years,

334
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,359
leading groups on my own,

335
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,519
I had to face many challenges

336
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,519
and quite a few problems alone.

337
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:14,759
I'm no longer a child.

338
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,200
And you also know

339
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,440
my attitude toward marriage

340
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,559
has always been quite pessimistic.

341
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,960
I've never once thought that one day,

342
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,400
I would really want to get married.

343
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,000
But now, it is how I feel.

344
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,440
With Hao around,

345
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,839
I have this desire to take a risk.

346
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:33,839
I want to build

347
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:35,480
a home of our own with him,

348
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,240
a home just for the two of us.

349
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,240
I also want to try

350
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,519
to embark on a new challenge in life.

351
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,000
I've never felt this way before.

352
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,400
But I know it's very strong.

353
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,279
I see.

354
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,319
Jiajia, do you know?

355
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,640
This is the first time

356
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,079
in your life

357
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,799
that you've spoken

358
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,400
in such a serious manner to me.

359
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,760
I hear you.

360
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,079
As long as you have

361
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,440
thought it through and made up your mind,

362
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,400
Mom will support you unconditionally.

363
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,000
However,

364
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,680
it's hard to say the same about your dad.

365
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,920
Look at how he treated Hao yesterday.

366
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,559
All sorts of nitpicking.

367
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:38,519
The way he was acting, it's hard to tell.

368
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:40,119
I believe in Hao.

369
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,759
Uncle, this pot is a toast to you.

370
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:45,864
You…

371
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,160
Today, I've finally understood

372
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,000
why Jiajia always told me

373
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,759
that she admired you greatly.

374
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,599
What did she say?

375
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,279
She tells me that you are the kind of father

376
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,119
that not only cares

377
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,200
about grades.

378
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,279
You care about personality and charisma,

379
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,000
the kind of father who shapes character.

380
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,559
I keep thinking, in this era,

381
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,119
where can you find a girl who is both beautiful

382
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,880
and capable?

383
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,279
Turns out this is all because of your
teachings since her childhood.

384
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:32,079
Thank you, sir,

385
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:34,000
for raising

386
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,200
such an outstanding daughter.

387
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,880
Here's to a good father.

388
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,000
Come on.

389
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,720
Sir, I'm really…

390
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,599
I am very envious of Jiajia

391
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,799
to have a father like you.

392
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:11,816
I really…

393
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,839
If you were my dad, it would really be…

394
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,519
Excuse me.

395
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,000
Waiter.

396
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,024
Check, please.

397
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,688
Mr. Frank,

398
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,240
I have a meeting to attend today.

399
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,039
I'll pick you up after the meeting.

400
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,240
You don't need to come by again.

401
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,200
You can take a rest for a while.

402
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,480
Go ahead in.

403
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,039
The teacher should already be waiting for you.

404
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,799
<i>[Heart of Art]</i>
After speaking with Chloe last time,

405
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,519
<i>[Exhibition Introduction]</i>
I have revised the proposal. Please take a look.

406
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:26,839
You are a professional.

407
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:28,799
I completely trust you.

408
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,480
I have no objections.

409
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,759
However, if the deal is really settled,

410
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,640
we will invite children to be the interpreters.

411
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,640
That is to say, the order on-site

412
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,880
must be arranged very carefully.

413
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,160
We must ensure that the audience entering

414
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,519
has a good experience.

415
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:40,640
Rest assured about that.

416
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,079
We will personally interview the young guides.

417
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,720
The number will be controlled

418
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,799
at around five people.

419
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,319
Then, the more important parts

420
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:49,160
will be handled by our gallery staff.

421
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,240
Okay, no problem.

422
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,559
Then I will proceed with my part first.

423
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:53,280
- If there are any issues, I'll contact you.
- Okay.

424
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,880
- Okay, stay in touch.
- Bye.

425
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,400
Joe, there's a shoot here this afternoon.

426
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,480
Remember to clear the setting early.

427
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,440
I've instructed them. The setting
will be cleared in another hour.

428
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,599
How's your workshop going?

429
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,640
Got any inspiration yet?

430
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,599
Why do you look odd?

431
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:19,440
Did something happen?

432
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,240
No.

433
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,319
It's just that

434
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,839
I'm beginning to understand

435
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,880
what you told me before.

436
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,920
Whether it's art or love,

437
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,880
it requires full commitment.

438
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,119
Have you met someone

439
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,759
who makes you give your all?

440
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,960
Anyway, it seems a bit different from before.

441
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,640
Maybe you have awakened me.

442
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,640
I used to wrap myself up

443
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,119
too tightly.

444
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:46,799
I've never tried to face another person

445
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,319
without any reservations.

446
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,839
I feel that this time

447
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:53,039
is an opportunity for you to break through.

448
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,039
Joe, Joe, Joe.

449
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,119
You've got a package.

450
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,200
- What?
- What?

451
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
I don't know.

452
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,039
Take a look.

453
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,048
Who is it from?

454
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,519
There's a note.

455
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:09,400
Dear Joe, I would like to invite you tonight

456
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,599
<i>[Elvis]</i>
to join me at the dinner party.

457
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,640
Looking forward to your appearance.

458
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,568
Take a look.

459
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,960
Let's see what it is.

460
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,160
- Nice move.
- So flashy.

461
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,720
This person seems quite romantic.

462
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,880
It's my size.

463
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,039
Tonight, huh?

464
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,599
What about the shooting in the afternoon?

465
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:38,599
Don't worry, leave it to me.

466
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:41,039
Go to the event.

467
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,208
No problem at all.

468
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,960
It's not just me.

469
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,640
There's Wen.

470
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,359
That's also true, I'm relieved with Wen around.

471
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,599
Hurry, hurry.

472
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,920
Quickly, tell him you're going.

473
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,400
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

474
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,759
Go ahead.

475
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:03,000
Bye, got it.

476
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,759
Zu, have the car ready after work.

477
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,279
Deliver it to the inspection
area early tomorrow.

478
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,559
- Get ready for the pre-vehicle inspection.
- Okay.

479
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,160
Elvis, the administrative inspection

480
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,559
is also tomorrow morning.

481
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:16,759
Same place as before.

482
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,599
Bring your gear and vehicle permit.

483
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,880
- Go earlier.
- Okay.

484
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,480
Jeremy, any additions?

485
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,559
- Nothing more from me.
- Then let's adjourn.

486
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:28,720
- Okay.
- Okay, fine.

487
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,079
Go back and rest early.

488
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:31,680
- You too.
- Rest early.

489
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
Zu, remember to prepare the car.

490
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,799
Okay, no problem.

491
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,480
Let's just go out to eat tonight.

492
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,038
I don't want to cook.

493
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:41,864
<i>[See you tonight]</i>

494
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,960
Can we finish filming today on time?

495
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,160
Mr. Le.

496
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,440
Don't sit on the prop box.

497
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,720
Hope you won't deduct my pay, boss.

498
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,599
You look tired. You've got dark circles.

499
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:23,240
I'm working three jobs a day now.

500
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,279
Three jobs, and two bosses.

501
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,160
But only you, the boss, pay me.

502
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,200
The other two are volunteer work.

503
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,119
One is Mr. Qiang.

504
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:35,480
I'm in his Master Cooking Class

505
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,839
every week now.

506
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:40,920
Okay, and another one is Mr. Xu.

507
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,759
My brother and my dad

508
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:44,000
have had a falling out.

509
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,720
I have to play peacemaker every day.

510
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,880
Life is so hard.

511
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,279
I really can't handle it anymore.

512
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,799
I want to sleep.

513
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,160
Help me.

514
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,519
McMuffin.

515
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,799
So, you complain and grumble after all.

516
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,200
I thought you were like a perpetual motion
machine, like solar-powered.

517
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,640
You never get tired.

518
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,079
This doesn't count as grumbling, does it?

519
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,400
I'm just telling you

520
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,319
what's been happening to me lately.

521
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,599
It's okay to grumble, you know.

522
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,079
But I'm happy.

523
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,559
Happy because you grumbled?

524
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,680
No.

525
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,400
It's because when I grumble,

526
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,759
someone listens to me and comforts me.

527
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,599
If it weren't for you, maybe

528
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:29,759
I'd have no outlet for my emotions.

529
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:31,519
When others ask me, I'd only say

530
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:33,240
I'm okay. I'm fine.

531
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,680
I just didn't sleep well last night.

532
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,519
Are you feeling better now?

533
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,200
Much better.

534
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,359
Thank you.

535
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,400
For what? I didn't do anything.

536
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,240
You don't have to do anything.

537
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,200
All you have to do is show up.

538
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,400
Miss Mai, the gallery is asking us

539
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,279
how much longer it will take to wrap up.

540
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,039
Alright, I'll go talk to them.

541
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,240
Well done.

542
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,200
Director Qiang, what do you mean?

543
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,039
Mai

544
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,200
never chats with anyone.

545
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,960
You seem to chat with her just fine.

546
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,440
Director Qiang, Mai says
we can't sit on this box.

547
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,119
She discusses the box with you.

548
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,359
Why doesn't she discuss the box with me?

549
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,240
Is that all you talked about, the box?

550
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,319
No, we chatted

551
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:42,960
about some work matters.

552
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,039
Apart from work,

553
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,440
you should talk more about serious stuff.

554
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,400
Mai is good.

555
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,960
So beautiful.

556
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,720
Han and Yusheng.

557
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,119
A few guys are all chasing after her.

558
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,319
I think she and you

559
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,440
might have a chance.

560
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,440
So don't just talk about work.

561
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,559
- Talk about something serious.
- No Director Qiang. I want to concentrate

562
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,119
wholeheartedly on making this film with you

563
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,200
so that we can finish early.

564
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,000
They are already rushing us.

565
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,559
I really don't have any other time
to think about those.

566
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,119
Okay, fine.

567
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,319
Are you saying I'm shooting too slowly?

568
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,400
That I'm holding up your progress?

569
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,720
- Help!
- Right? I've held you up.

570
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,440
Alright, come on, guys, hurry up.

571
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,720
Let's go. We can't delay you, okay?

572
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,119
- No, guys, it has nothing to do with me.
- Quickly, let's shoot.

573
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:20,519
Start shooting.

574
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,640
Tong.

575
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,960
When will you come home for dinner?

576
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,119
I'll make you clay pot rice

577
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:26,359
and black bean sauce spare ribs.

578
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:28,160
Do you want soup?

579
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,000
I'll buy spare ribs from Uncle Hong

580
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,200
and make soup for you, alright?

581
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,000
Grandma, I've been very busy lately.

582
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,119
I might not be able to go any time soon.

583
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,279
No matter how busy work is,

584
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:40,000
do you not have time to go home?

585
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,039
Do you have to work 24 hours?

586
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:43,839
I will make time to go back.

587
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm very busy now. I can't talk more, bye.

588
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:10,120
What's wrong?

589
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,008
It's nothing.

590
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:24,400
Oh, right.

591
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,240
The piece you played today,

592
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,559
what's its name?

593
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,880
Do you like it?

594
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,359
Although the melody is simple,

595
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:35,880
it feels

596
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,559
very comfortable to listen to.

597
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,616
It's hard to forget.

598
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:50,759
I wrote it myself.

599
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,472
Really?

600
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,680
When did you write it?

601
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,640
A long time ago.

602
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,752
When I was a child.

603
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,720
May I ask how old you are this year?

604
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:16,920
I simply record feelings.

605
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:26,799
One day I sat on the seafront promenade.

606
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,200
The air carried a salty taste.

607
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:33,480
I closed my eyes to listen to the sound

608
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,839
of waves hitting the rocks,

609
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:39,720
as if they were breathing.

610
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,519
Then, in my mind,

611
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,319
I started playing the piano.

612
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:47,240
And as I played,

613
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,279
this melody came to me.

614
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:53,079
Even though you don't admit it,

615
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:56,000
you do like playing the piano.

616
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,056
Perhaps.

617
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:01,400
You just don't like meaningless repetition.

618
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,680
You dislike having to comply

619
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,480
with the teacher's demands.

620
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,799
Speed up here, and slow down there.

621
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,640
Actually, I do understand that.

622
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,359
It's just that these exercises

623
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:14,400
are necessary to become

624
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,880
an exceptional performer.

625
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,240
The existence of music

626
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,759
is for the free expression

627
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:21,079
of inner feelings.

628
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,640
When I take the stage,

629
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,960
I don't want to play those showy pieces.

630
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,079
If everyone plays the same,

631
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:29,799
what's the point of my playing the piano?

632
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,960
Do I sound like an old man

633
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,200
fretting over these things

634
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,960
that nobody cares about?

635
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,200
But you're right.

636
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:45,960
If you had played

637
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,319
Chopin's Nocturne for Tian today,

638
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,680
she might not have forgotten

639
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,599
her unhappiness so quickly.

640
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:54,160
Chopin is great.

641
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,400
But Mr. Frank,

642
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,400
the song you played

643
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,920
indeed made a girl

644
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,200
not sad anymore.

645
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,799
I just played a song.

646
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,960
Although, each person

647
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,200
has things

648
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,559
that they must do

649
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,240
besides what they want to do

650
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,160
You don't want to go back,

651
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,359
but you will, right?

652
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,704
I'll accompany you.

653
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,759
<i>Jiajia, sorry to disturb you.</i>

654
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,279
<i>I'd like to go out for a stroll,</i>

655
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,119
<i>but I'm unfamiliar with the place.</i>

656
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:49,559
<i>Do you have any recommendations?</i>

657
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,199
- Ms. Meng.
- Jiajia.

658
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,840
Sorry, I was stuck in traffic.

659
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,360
No problem, I just arrived as well.

660
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,800
Thank you for coming to go shopping with me.

661
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,960
Not at all, I haven't gone
shopping in a long time too.

662
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:47,199
- Let's go take a look over there.
- Okay, okay.

663
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,256
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

664
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,928
Come on.

665
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,360
Ms. Meng.

666
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,719
Is there anything in particular
you want to buy?

667
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:06,000
I want to buy a suit for your dad.

668
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,599
We'll attend your wedding, right?

669
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,679
We didn't prepare anything beforehand.

670
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:11,320
My dad, you see,

671
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,679
his usual clothes will be fine for him.

672
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,880
Besides, Hao and I don't require
formal attire for our wedding.

673
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,719
It's just everyone having a relaxed
and lively time together.

674
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:22,800
Think about it, is there
anything else you need?

675
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,639
Is there a place that sells
small household appliances here?

676
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,639
I'll buy an electric shaver for your dad.

677
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:29,199
Ms. Meng, I'm accompanying you shopping.

678
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,119
Think carefully if there's anything
you want for yourself.

679
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,599
Let me take this.

680
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,400
- Hello?
- Hello, Meng?

681
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,679
<i>Can you come down and pick me up?</i>

682
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:46,960
<i>I can't get up without the room card.</i>

683
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,119
I'm not at the hotel.

684
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:50,159
I'm at the mall with Jiajia.

685
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:52,519
<i>Why did you go out without telling me?</i>

686
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:54,440
<i>- Then, then…</i>
- Wait for me in the lobby.

687
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,679
I'll be right back.

688
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,960
Jiajia, I am really sorry.

689
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,199
Your dad didn't bring his room card,
and I have to go back.

690
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:04,264
Let me talk to him.

691
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,679
Dad, you're an adult.

692
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:08,639
Can't you figure out how to open
the door without your room card?

693
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:11,119
Just go downstairs and give your
ID number to the front desk,

694
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,239
and they will help you open it,
so don't bother us anymore.

695
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,440
We just started our shopping.

696
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,559
Stop calling, bye-bye.

697
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,639
Jiajia, maybe we should just call it a day.

698
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:27,320
No way, come on, I'll take you
to buy some clothes.

699
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,176
This is the place.

700
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,880
- Hello, welcome!
- Hi.

701
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,440
Come on in.

702
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,239
Would you two like some coffee
or to look at clothes?

703
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:44,360
We're just browsing.

704
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,960
- Thank you.
- Okay, please come in.

705
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,960
I love it here. They have all kinds of clothes.

706
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
Give it a try.

707
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,519
How about the denim outfit?

708
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:54,280
I don't think I can wear this, can I?

709
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,239
What's there not to wear? Anyone can wear it.

710
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:59,920
- How about this miniskirt?
- Come on, forget about it.

711
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,159
What's wrong? It's quite cute.

712
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:04,039
It's too short. Can I wear it?

713
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:06,159
This one looks good. Do you want to try it on?

714
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,480
This suits you.

715
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,199
Take a look at this one,
take a look. It suits you.

716
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:12,400
You should try it on too.

717
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,000
I think it should suit you as well.

718
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:18,400
It does look like something I would wear.

719
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,320
This one fits you well.

720
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,480
Do you want to give it a try?

721
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,559
This color is pretty nice.

722
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:31,320
This, no, no.

723
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,360
I can't go out wearing this.

724
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,760
This leaves the waist exposed here.

725
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,480
That's not my style.

726
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,559
Where does it show too much? It's very pretty.

727
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:38,679
You should wear these bright colors

728
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:39,880
when you're young.

729
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,880
No, no, Jiajia.

730
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,920
I am worried

731
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,800
that I won't have an occasion to wear it.

732
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,904
You're worried about my dad.

733
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,559
Jiajia, you know,

734
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:54,599
your dad, well,

735
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,000
is quite conservative.

736
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
He just fears others' gossip.

737
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,320
If I wear this when going out with him,

738
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,840
he will be unhappy.

739
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,000
He married you,

740
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,360
and he fears what others might say?

741
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,440
Besides, that shouldn't make you give up

742
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,239
wearing clothes you like.

743
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:10,599
It's not that serious.

744
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:12,679
We're just looking around, aren't we?

745
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:15,400
I don't really like that skirt
that much either.

746
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,199
Living together is about mutual understanding.

747
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,559
I know that he minds this.

748
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:21,320
Why should I deliberately upset him?

749
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,760
Mutual understanding?

750
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,199
Can't he be a little understanding towards you?

751
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:27,800
If he doesn't want you two
to look too far apart in age,

752
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,559
he could dress a bit younger himself.

753
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:31,239
Yes, I'll talk to him about it.

754
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:33,239
Next time, let him dress a bit younger.

755
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:35,039
It's just a piece of clothing.

756
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:37,159
I can wear anything.

757
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,599
<i>I brought a book over.</i>

758
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,639
<i>Where did you put it for me?</i>

759
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:47,280
<i>In the drawer of your bedside table.</i>

760
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,920
<i>I couldn't find it.</i>

761
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,280
<i>I might have packed it
in the suitcase. Look again.</i>

762
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,480
<i>Why did you pack it?</i>

763
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,920
<i>I still need to read it.</i>

764
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,888
Ms. Meng.

765
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,559
Are you happy with my dad?

766
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:11,159
Why?

767
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,400
I know from my position,

768
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,519
it might not be appropriate

769
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,639
to say these things.

770
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,280
But I believe the foundation
of being together is being happy.

771
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,599
It's about whether you

772
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,280
can be yourself freely in front of this person,

773
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,679
not feeling wronged,

774
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:28,559
and not having to pander or please the other.

775
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:30,599
When you cherish him,

776
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:33,159
he will cherish you in return.

777
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,960
Just like me and Hao.

778
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,119
To be honest, before I met him,

779
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,000
I never thought about getting married.

780
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:48,920
But after we got together,

781
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,639
I'm particularly happy,

782
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,679
because I can be myself,

783
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:54,079
and I also know

784
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,880
he likes me just the way I am.

785
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:00,440
So you see,

786
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,760
a relationship only lasts

787
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,559
if both people

788
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:08,159
feel comfortable.

789
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:09,199
But if it's always

790
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,559
one person making an effort,

791
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:12,719
one person sacrificing,

792
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:15,159
one day it will become tiresome,

793
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:17,679
right?

794
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:19,440
Your dad is quite good to me.

795
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,599
He loves me a lot, too.

796
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,800
How to put it…

797
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,679
When we first started,

798
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:41,320
it wasn't really like this.

799
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,679
Maybe as time went by,

800
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,159
I don't know from when,

801
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,239
it just became the way it is now.

802
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,280
I think

803
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,880
you've been too good to him.

804
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,039
You love him too much.

805
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,559
You spoil him too much.

806
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:05,239
Everything you do revolves around him.

807
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:06,840
After a while, wouldn't he just get used to it?

808
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,079
Then he'll just take it for granted.

809
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:10,280
Think about it.

810
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:14,360
When was the last time
he cared about your feelings?

811
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,920
That's just the way it is with people.

812
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,360
You advance, and he withdraws.

813
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,719
So next time,

814
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:27,039
you can also try

815
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:29,119
to take a step back.

816
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,079
You don't always have to be
so considerate and understanding,

817
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:33,239
always thinking about him.

818
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:35,800
Think about yourself for a change.

819
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,559
Care more about yourself.

820
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:39,592
Okay?

821
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,872
I'll try.

822
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,880
<i>Ms. Wei.</i>

823
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,239
Yu, when you get a chance, please…

824
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,920
Chen Shiyu?

825
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,360
Ms. Wei.

826
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,760
What a coincidence.

827
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,960
Chen Shiyu?

828
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,559
What are you doing here?

829
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:17,840
I'm here on vacation.

830
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,440
I booked the flight a long time ago.

831
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,440
On vacation, and you're staying

832
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,880
at the same hotel with your boss.

833
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,360
Aren't you afraid I'll give you work to do?

834
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,159
- It's a coincidence.
- Indeed.

835
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:28,199
We happened to bump into each other.

836
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:29,519
And also, we have a lot of

837
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:30,960
work to handle in Macau.

838
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,320
So I booked the same hotel.

839
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,679
It's convenient for coordination.

840
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:37,599
Okay, focus on your vacation, alright?

841
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,840
- Vacation.
- Alright.

842
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,719
Right, were you going to tell me something?

843
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:44,039
Almost forgot the important matter.

844
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:47,079
I asked you to send me
the list of alternate candidates

845
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:48,119
for the economics professor.

846
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:51,000
I'll see if there's anyone
more suitable than Professor Xu.

847
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,800
No problem, I'll send it to you
once I'm back in my room.

848
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,760
Okay, then you check in,
and I'll head upstairs.

849
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,000
I'll bring these to you in a bit.

850
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,992
