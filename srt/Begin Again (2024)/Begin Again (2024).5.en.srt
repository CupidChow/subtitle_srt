00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,904
Mr. Frank.

3
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,680
This is the best native
Portuguese restaurant in Macau.

4
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,599
You might like it.

5
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,120
Did you buy all of these?

6
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,359
I have confirmed

7
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,439
the dishes do not contain your allergens.

8
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,456
Is it tasty?

9
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,919
Help Mr. Frank place them on the dining table.

10
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,680
Mr. Frank, I have confirmed
with the Catering Department.

11
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,520
They will prepare a new menu for you.

12
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,960
Then I won't disturb you.

13
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,479
Take your time eating, see you tomorrow.

14
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,608

Well,

17
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,759
walking is a better way
to get to know Macau than driving.

18
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,199
The place you took me to today
is really quite beautiful.

19
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,759
But this is the city center, right?

20
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:05,240
What time is it? There's not a soul around.

21
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,720
There. Look.

22
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,808
Where?

23
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:10,199
Right there! Don't you see?

24
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,680
- There?
- Just kidding.

64
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,839
<i>The meeting venue remains the same:
large conference room.</i>

65
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,279
What's that?

66
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,704
Seems like a new colleague is coming.

67
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:37,720
New colleague?

68
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,839
Only saw the things, we didn't see the person.

69
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,639
Let me tell you something.

70
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,040
I heard the new colleague
is a relative of the vice president.

71
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,120
I don't know exactly
how closely related they are,

72
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,560
but definitely not ordinary.

73
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,584
Vice president?

74
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,639
That's your workstation. Over there.

75
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,560
- This one, right?
- Correct.

76
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,680
HR is giving her a tour.

77
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,399
How do you know so much insider information?

78
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,920
I've been here for many years,

79
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,279
so I have my connections.

80
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,040
Stop gossiping, it's almost time.

81
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,079
Gather your things. Time for the meeting.

82
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,400
Not inviting you for dinner tonight.

83
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,000
Come with me. I'll give you a brief rundown.

84
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,959
Isn't it in the large conference room?

85
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,000
Hello, Director Tong.

86
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,039
Where's Maggie? Hasn't she
finished her maternity leave yet?

87
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,000
Can anyone tell me
when she will return to work?

88
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,360
Ms. Maggie said

89
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,480
that she still has family things to attend to,

90
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,879
so she might return

91
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,480
a few days later than planned.

92
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,960
Your boss's not around,

93
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,440
need to be more proactive.

94
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
Understood.

95
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,840
Now let's get to the point.

96
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,360
We have secured the Xinghao project.

97
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,399
Legal Department is working on the contract.

98
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,759
Have you got your work visas for Macau?

99
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,159
Have they?

100
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:04,080
The agency said our documents
have already passed review,

101
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,240
and we might get the work visas
within these few days.

102
00:09:06,944 --> 00:09:07,960
In a few days.

103
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,159
Then which one of you can go to Macau first?

104
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,320
I can go right away.

105
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,039
Director Tong, well,

106
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,840
they had some problems

107
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,440
in the process
of submitting documents for review.

108
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,080
So, they had to resubmit it again.

109
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,679
Although it was approved,
the cards are still being made.

110
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,960
While I had a smoother process at that time.

111
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
I've already got my work visa,

112
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,440
so I can go there at any time.

113
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,488
Still making the cards.

114
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,240
That's fine, let's proceed in sync then.

115
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,039
Mai, if there's no other work,

116
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,120
you will set off tomorrow,

117
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,776
to finalize the cooperation proposal
with Xinghao as soon as possible.

118
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:48,879
Xu.

119
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,320
You are in charge of the customs declaration
for the filming crew's equipment.

120
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,440
Okay.

121
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,559
Lang and other colleagues,

122
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,799
stay behind on standby to provide support.

123
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,919
Don't worry, Director Tong.

124
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,960
We will certainly cooperate fully
with Mai's work.

125
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,848
Okay, get in touch anytime.

126
00:10:06,848 --> 00:10:07,904
Thank you.

127
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:08,960
- Okay.
- Director Tong.

128
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,039
- Thank you, Director Tong.
- Director Tong, we will get our work done.

129
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,128
Get to work.

130
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,440
Great.

131
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,600
We need to celebrate tonight, right?

132
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,639
Xu.

133
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:21,000
Check the flight and hotel for me.

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,639
Okay, I'll take a look at the flight for you.

135
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,399
We should have a dinner gathering tonight.

136
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,440
- That's a good idea.
- Right?

137
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,320
<i>Mai, you don't have
to work overtime tonight, do you?</i>

138
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,120
<i>Have you set the meeting place with that guy?</i>

139
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,840
<i>I didn't see the message
because of the meeting. It's been set.</i>

140
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,679
<i>Mai, come have dinner with us tonight.</i>

141
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,559
You're on a business trip tomorrow.
We could see you off.

142
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,279
Not tonight.

143
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,879
Although I'd really like to go,
you guys go ahead.

144
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,559
What are you going for? Do you have a date?

145
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,440
Do I have time for a date?

146
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,639
You don't have a date?

147
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,960
Do you have a blind…?

148
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,159
Alright, my mistake.

149
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,759
If you really don't want to go, just cancel it.

150
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,480
Or speed it up.

151
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,679

she said she didn't dare to go down.

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,399
Then, she just went down.

00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,639
She did the same with me, in this very place.

181
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,600
It wasn't her first time,
might not even be her second.

182
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,759
What do you see around here the most?

183
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,679
Water. What's water like?

184
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,000
It's always flowing.
It doesn't stop for anyone.

185
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,600
She's like that water,

186
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,919
won't stop for me, not even you.

187
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,320
So, bro, don't ever get too into it.

188
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,200
Once you get into it, you're a big fool.

189
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,240
I don't mean it.

190
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,039
I was that big fool back then.

191
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,080
Bro, you don't seem to care much.

192
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,919
That's right.

193
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:37,120
Don't ever get into it. It's useless.

194
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,919
Look how much I was into it back then.

195
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,024
I took a beautiful picture.

196
00:13:41,024 --> 00:13:43,759
It even won a gold award. Was it of any use?

197
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,679
Familiar with it? It's over there.

198
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:49,240
One day, she just told me she's tired of it.

199
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,399
That's it.

200
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,679
So, bro, take care.

201
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,960
Don't get into it too much.

202
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,120
Don't be a moth to the flame.

203
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,799
What's wrong?

204
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,759
Nothing. I just ran into an idiot
who talked nonsense at me.

205
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,840
Let's go take the ride.

206
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,039
Why aren't you spirited today?

207
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,840
I didn't win the first time either.

208
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,840
Are you angry?

209
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,864
Not at all.

210
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,520
What's wrong?

211
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,200
What's wrong?

212
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,320
Are you okay?

213
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:13,600
Okay, I got it.

214
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,752
Be right there.

215
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,559
Sorry, the team asked me

216
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,159
to go back now. Something urgent.

217
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:24,559
I may not be able
to watch the sunset with you today.

218
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,440
Can I walk to class today?

219
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,480
Walk?

220
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,640
You don't usually walk. Are you sure?

221
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,839
Of course. But you're wearing high heels.

222
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:33,960
If you can, so can I.

223
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,480
Yes!

224
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,279
Mike, take the car over first.

225
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:40,839
I'll walk with Mr. Frank.

226
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:43,016
Let's go.

227
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,920
Junhao is driving very aggressively,
especially going into the curves.

228
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,160
Though it might be faster,

229
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,480
it wears hard on the tires.

230
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,920
For the next few laps,

231
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,920
the grip of the tires is greatly affected.

232
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,079
So my advice is,

233
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,568
to go lighter on the throttle
when exiting the curves.

234
00:18:01,568 --> 00:18:03,520
<i>♫ I'm the child of your neighbor ♫</i>

235
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,672
<i>♫ Breaking the routine ♫</i>

236
00:18:04,672 --> 00:18:06,592
<i>♫ Just like I know how to ♫</i>

237
00:18:06,592 --> 00:18:08,480
<i>♫ It feels good to achieve a dream ♫</i>

238
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,568
<i>♫ Standing six feet tall ♫</i>

239
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:12,384
<i>♫ Ready to take back my place ♫</i>

240
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,720
<i>♫ They try to steal my heart ♫</i>

241
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,248
<i>♫ But I still running the show ♫</i>

242
00:18:17,248 --> 00:18:18,720
<i>♫ Don't put me in first place ♫</i>

243
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,064
<i>♫ The whole scene is intense ♫</i>

244
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:20,448
<i>♫ Because I'm ♫</i>

245
00:18:20,448 --> 00:18:22,888
<i>♫ Unstoppable ♫</i>

246
00:18:25,664 --> 00:18:27,944
<i>♫ I am unstoppable ♫</i>

247
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,416
Junhao is fine.

248
00:18:35,411 --> 00:18:37,544
<i>♫ Unstoppable ♫</i>

249
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,856
<i>♫ I am unstoppable ♫</i>

250
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:46,119
You need to pay attention to your tires.

251
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:50,279
Starting from the sixth lap,
tire degradation becomes more noticeable.

252
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,799
Losing 0.8 seconds per lap.

253
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:54,519
This indicates that your tire wear
was quite severe in the first five laps.

254
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:56,920
You need to keep the time loss
under 0.3 seconds.

255
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,319
Otherwise, you're losing
half a second to others every lap.

256
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:00,440
How will you catch up in the following laps?

257
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,240
I know.

258
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,839
The track is too hot today.

259
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,119
After just a couple of laps,

260
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,296
I felt the thermal degradation of the tires.

261
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:08,352
Alright, I'll take a look

262
00:19:08,352 --> 00:19:10,079
if I can find

263
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,480
a more tire-friendly setup.

264
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,519
No, no need.

265
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,960
I think you've got the settings quite good now.

266
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,400
It's my problem.

267
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,640
I'm worried that if you adjust it,
the speed in the corners will drop.

268
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,680
I want to maintain my cornering speed.

269
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:24,424
Okay.

270
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,799
Jeremy, check the car.

271
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,496
Not bad.

272
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,720
Just okay. I'm getting faster at least.

273
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,400
But I know where my problem is.

274
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,480
I'll make some more adjustments.

275
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,400
But don't worry, I'll save the tires for you.

276
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,720
I know you don't want to lose.

277
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,000
But the more you want to win,
the more you need to stay calm.

278
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,759
If there's something on your mind,
don't hide it.

279
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:02,319
You need to speak out,
otherwise it will affect your training.

280
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:04,039
What's something on my mind?

281
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:07,640
Justin told me you've been
pursuing a girl recently,

282
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,112
yet you got rejected.

283
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,599
Maybe we should call Mike over.

284
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,680
Are you tired from walking?

285
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:33,279
But it's easy to get stuck
in traffic around here.

286
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:35,880
I'm afraid we'll be late
if we wait for Mike to come.

287
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,799
Well, it's not that far.

288
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,440
Can you hold on?

289
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,759
Wait for me.

290
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,792
Mr. Frank.

291
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,559
Mr. Frank, where did you go?

292
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,839
I didn't know which one was good,
so I bought them all.

293
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:42,440
Thank you, Mr. Frank.

294
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,799
Sometimes, I really feel

295
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,960
that I quite understand how you feel.

296
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,119
You hope to grow up quickly,

297
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,960
feeling that once you've grown up,

298
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,559
you can get rid of parental control.

299
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,440
Some things can't be changed
once I've grown up.

300
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,848
Let's go.

301
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,039
<i>Why stop?</i>

302
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,880
Mr. Frank.

303
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,799
The schedule is full, so you're a bit tired?

304
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,759
Take a break.

305
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:25,920
It's meaningless.

306
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:29,759
When I practiced the piano as a little kid,

307
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:31,319
I would practice while crying.

308
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:36,079
Practicing one piece a hundred,
even a thousand times over.

309
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:38,119
I just didn't understand why my mom pushed me

310
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,240
so hard.

311
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,880
So how did you keep going?

312
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,039
After finishing grade ten,

313
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,799
I've never touched the piano again.

314
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,816
But I think you should keep going.

315
00:23:58,816 --> 00:23:59,880
Why?

316
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,240
It is rare for one to find their own talent.

317
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,200
Your mom must not want

318
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,759
your shining points to be buried,

319
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,000
so she put so much effort into nurturing you.

320
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,680
Perhaps.

321
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,759
Well, we'll do nothing tomorrow.

322
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:25,920
I'll show you around Macau.

323
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,072
Okay?

324
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,000
The front fork is leaking oil a bit.

325
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,680
It might need to be replaced.

326
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,336
The front fork? Then I'll replace this part.

327
00:24:38,336 --> 00:24:39,360
Does it look good to you?

328
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,160
See if there's any wrong.

329
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,192
Wen.

330
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:45,279
Le.

331
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,880
When will my motorcycles be ready?

332
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,039
I'll go check it out.

333
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:49,279
- Thank you.
- Alright.

334
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,359
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

335
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,544
Le.

336
00:24:52,544 --> 00:24:53,824
Elvis.

337
00:24:53,824 --> 00:24:54,880
Come on.

338
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,359
It's been a long time.

339
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,599
What are you doing here?

340
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,559
I live in Macau.

341
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:00,799
Aren't you from Hong Kong?

342
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,000
I was born in Macau.

343
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,160
I just went to work in Hong Kong
after graduation.

344
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,559
I wondered why.

345
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,279
I remembered we met in Hong Kong.

346
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,640
We did meet in Hong Kong.

347
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,680
Yes, whatever.

348
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,920
- Anyway, they all speak Cantonese.
- All part of the Greater Bay Area.

349
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,119
- Right.
- Take a seat.

350
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,960
What about you? What are you doing here?

351
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,440
I'm here in Macau for racing.

352
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,720
Yes. Once Macao Grand Prix is held,

353
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,559
it would cause a big traffic jam.

354
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,079
Don't you care about the race at all now?

355
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,160
I…

356
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,000
Do you two know each other?

357
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,880
We rode motorcycles

358
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,000
- while studying abroad.
- Yes.

359
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,832
We've known each other for a long time.

360
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:42,039
Then, you two chat.

361
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:44,039
But, you can't get your motorcycle today.

362
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,848
Vespa's original parts are out of stock.

363
00:25:46,848 --> 00:25:47,920
Oh no.

364
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,640
Yes.

365
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,880
It's okay, I'm not in a hurry anyway.

366
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,200
Call me when it's done.

367
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,720
Okay, just wait a couple more days.

368
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,799
I'll go get busy.

369
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,904
Thank you.

370
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,559
You're riding a Vespa now?

371
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,279
It's more convenient to ride a Vespa in Macau.

372
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,816
What's your next plan?

373
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,880
I have nothing to do.

374
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,040
Want to go out for a spin?

375
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,160
You take me?

376
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,480
On foot.

377
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,720
- On foot?
- My motorcycle is being repaired here.

378
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,776
- Let's go.
- I'll come back for it later.

379
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:16,896
Let's go.

380
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:18,952
Let's go.

381
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,440
<i>Have you arrived? Have you met him?</i>

382
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,440
<i>I've arrived, waiting for him.</i>

383
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,920
<i>Then, I won't disturb you anymore.</i>

384
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,920
<i>Have a good chat.</i>

385
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,039
Hello.

386
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,056
Over here.

387
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,680
- Hello.
- Hello.

388
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,880
Mu Xiulun, right?

389
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,759
My name is Mai Youge, call me Mai.

390
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:45,079
- Hello.
- Hello.

391
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:52,240
Take a seat.

392
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,960
Let me tell you, I've been
looking forward to this day for a long time.

393
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,072
I came very early today.

394
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,128
I've already ordered the meal.

395
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,640
Do you want to see if you need anything else?

396
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,759
Don't be shy.

397
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,920
It's okay, this meal is on me.

398
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,559
That's not necessary.

399
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:06,000
Could I have a glass of soda water? Thank you.

400
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,599
Alright, sir. Please wait a moment.

401
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,880
Well, don't be shy.

402
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,640
Let me tell you, I've been
looking forward to this day for a long time.

403
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,079
I can tell that.

404
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:18,208
What do you do for work?

405
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:19,240
I do industry research.

406
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,960
Industry research?

407
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
That is, industry analysis.

408
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
To provide business analysis for the company.

409
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,119
Then you must be very busy.

410
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:29,440
I basically work overtime every day.

411
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,839
Hello, excuse me.

412
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:31,960
Here is your meal.

413
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,992
- Okay.
- Thank you.

414
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,920
Okay, thank you.

415
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,400
Eat up, I've ordered in advance,

416
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,512
so it was served especially quickly.

417
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,559
Any other friends coming?

418
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:54,319
If not, wouldn't that be a bit too much?

419
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:58,079
Too much? This isn't even enough for me alone.

420
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,480
I eat quite a lot.

421
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,359
Sir, here's your soda water.

422
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:04,480
- Okay.
- Please enjoy.

423
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,519
Go ahead and eat.

424
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,808
Is it that delicious?

425
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:37,519
It's really quite delicious. Aren't you eating?

426
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:39,279
The way you look

427
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,920
seems like you haven't eaten for days.

428
00:28:44,352 --> 00:28:45,440
No.

429
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,160
Eating is the most relaxing time of the day.

430
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,039
Of course, I enjoy whatever I eat.

431
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:58,720
I agree on you on this.

432
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,759
I also like to eat alone.

433
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:01,759
Because

434
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,559
only when I'm eating
does the time belong to me.

435
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,216
Well…

436
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,640
You are also forced
to go on a blind date, aren't you?

437
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,920
You too?

438
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm sorry, it's a bit…

439
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,680
A bit too much.

440
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,119
These…

441
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:54,519
Never mind, I've used this trick before.

442
00:29:55,799 --> 00:30:00,559
Then let's have a meal.

443
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,000
Life in Hong Kong is too stressful,

444
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,279
not for me at all.

445
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:07,039
So I came back to Macau last year.

446
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,720
What for?

447
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,440
To idle about, living off parents.

448
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,599
No, just kidding.

449
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:15,400
I sometimes help out at my parents' restaurant.

450
00:30:19,936 --> 00:30:21,519
Not riding the motorcycle anymore?

451
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,720
Bro, let me tell you.

452
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,359
Maintaining a motorcycle
in Macau is really expensive.

453
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,599
And those roads
are not suitable for riding at all.

454
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:30,680
I am nothing like you, so cool,

455
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,559
being able to make racing a profession.

456
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:36,160
But it's a pity for you not to ride.

457
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,359
Back when we were in school,

458
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,400
we used to do so every day.

459
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,599
I couldn't catch up with you, remember?

460
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,160
With such talent like yours,

461
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,119
it would be a pity not to be
a professional motorcyclist.

462
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:52,839
Becoming a professional motorcyclist
isn't that easy.

463
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:54,359
Having talent alone is not enough.

464
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:56,359
One has to have capital,

465
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:58,400
and deal with interests between people.

466
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,520
I really can't handle it.

467
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,559
I just want to ride my motorcycle purely.

468
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,640
My life now seems very ordinary,

469
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,640
but at least I can do whatever I want,

470
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,960
and can choose not to do whatever I don't want.

471
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,680
I take control myself.

472
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,799
Okay, you're still
the same as you were in school,

473
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:28,240
always being easy-going and carefree.

474
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,799
Just be happy and content, right?

475
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,640
But life doesn't work out all the time.

476
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,920
There are things you want to have but can't.

477
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,599
But you don't want to give up either.

478
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,319
As if the world is telling you

479
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,039
that this is just a coincidence.

480
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,359
Why are you taking it so seriously?

481
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:55,000
Getting serious, bro?

482
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,759
What's wrong? Facing any difficulties?

483
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:59,240
Can I help you?

484
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,119
I can tell you,
but you mustn't tell anyone else.

485
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:04,640
Go ahead, what happened?

486
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:08,880
I've fallen for a girl,

487
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,200
but I might never see her again.

488
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,599
Sorry, no offense.

489
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:40,720
Then, what makes you

490
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,480
never see her again?

491
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,720
Why is she…?

492
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,559
What?

493
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,279
She went back to the mainland China for work.

494
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:53,240
What are you thinking?

495
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,759
Wait, I thought what you said

496
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:56,079
you liked a girl, but this girl…

497
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:58,240
Look at you, want to see
your expression just now?

498
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,960
I was wondering if this girl might be…

499
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,880
You made me panic, now I…

500
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,480
Oh my, if something really happened to her,

501
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,720
I'll beat you up.

502
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,119
I heard from your cousin
that you just came back from Macau.

503
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,119
How was it? Is it still quite hot?

504
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,559
Yes, it's quite hot.

505
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,720
But as long as work goes smoothly, it's fine.

506
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:19,519
True, working in advertising is indeed tough.

507
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,160
Busy. Everyone is quite busy.

508
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,720
And everyone works hard.

509
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,480
Nowadays, office workers
all put work before life, right?

510
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:33,599
Right, and the social circle is limited.

511
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:34,759
Just like the two of us.

512
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,680
Making new friends even depends on blind dates.

513
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,119
If I am on consecutive business trips,

514
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:41,039
I don't even have time
to take things out of the suitcase,

515
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,599
just toss a few new clothes in,

516
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,920
and then I have to leave again.

517
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,519
Every time, it's like preparing for battle.

518
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,279
<i>If I am on consecutive business trips,</i>

519
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,640
<i>then I'll find</i>

520
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,400
<i>my suitcase will always
stay in the living room,</i>

521
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,000
<i>and there's no need to even close it,</i>

522
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,400
<i>just toss a few clothes into it,</i>

523
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,799
<i>and then take it with you.</i>

524
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,160
<i>I think everyone has their right</i>

525
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,680
<i>to choose how to live their lives.</i>

526
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,719
<i>You should choose the life you want.</i>

527
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,760
And a couple of times,

528
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,480
I packed last month's clothes in.

529
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,440
When I put them on, I was stunned myself.

530
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,599
What do you usually do after work?

531
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,679
Nothing special, I just stay by myself.

532
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,280
Me too.

533
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,079
In fact, I really want
to find some time to travel.

534
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:45,000
Where do you want to go?

535
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,080
Altay, I guess.

536
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,440
<i>Although we don't have
a pink sunset like in Altay,</i>

537
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,199
<i>we have a golden sea.</i>

538
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:12,119
Are you a bit tired?

539
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:15,320
Maybe call it a day for now.

540
00:35:16,736 --> 00:35:17,920
Alright.

541
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,679
Let's meet again when we have time.

542
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:24,232
Are you available this weekend?

543
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:30,360
The weekend might not work.
I have to go on a business trip.

544
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,280
I haven't finished the project in Macau.

545
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,599
Okay, let's take a rain check.

546
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,639
I'll take you back?

547
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,880
No need, I can walk back myself.

548
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,679
Don't, it's too late now.

549
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:43,400
I need to explain to your cousin.

550
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,199
I'll go pay the bill.

551
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:46,519
Okay.

552
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,159
Hello, settle the bill, please.

553
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:50,239
Could you pack this for me?

554
00:35:53,408 --> 00:35:54,440
Okay, I see it.

555
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,840
I'll check it right now.

556
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:16,000
Someone looks worried.

557
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,559
What's wrong with me?

558
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:19,239
You've argued with your girlfriend?

559
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:21,000
I don't have a girlfriend.

560
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,800
Elvis, Elvis.

561
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,960
You can't fool me.

562
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,239
You can't hide anything from me.

563
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:28,639
Everything shows on your face.

564
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:30,760
Where is the girl you like now?

565
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,808
Macau.

566
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:32,880
I got you.

567
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,952
Are you sick?

568
00:36:33,952 --> 00:36:36,040
Stop acting.

569
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:39,119
She's in Macau, then what are you waiting for?

570
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,639
You're in Macau.

571
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:43,000
Go find her, I'm begging you.

572
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,400
Alright, I admit it.

573
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,760
What's wrong?

574
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,280
During my stay here in Macau,

575
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,840
I fell for a girl.

576
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:00,079
But today, something unpleasant happened.

577
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,119
Ridiculous.

578
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,960
You are in love, bro.

579
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,320
Is every day going to be happy?

580
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,800
Of course, I know, but…

581
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,639
So, are you thinking about her
all the time now?

582
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,920
See? So do you realize how lucky you are?

583
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,736
The person you like is right in front of you.

584
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:17,800
Go find her right now,

585
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,880
and then tell her "I care about you a lot".

586
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:24,360
Well,

587
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,760
I think the misunderstanding lies in

588
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,480
that I'm not sure
if the her I know is the real her,

589
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,119
or the her I heard about from others

590
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,159
is the real her.

591
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,800
Do you understand what I mean?

592
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,920
Come on, man.

593
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,639
- Don't care what others say.
- Yes.

594
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,639
Look at you, you're not being yourself.

595
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:46,800
Do you care about
what your teammates or coach say?

596
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,760
Now you care about what others think?

597
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,280
Trust your own instincts.

598
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,960
Think about it, after the race in Macau,

599
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,079
you need to prepare for the next race
and travel around the world.

600
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:00,559
Then you don't know

601
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:03,159
when you will see her again.

602
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:06,816
Don't leave any regrets.

603
00:38:06,816 --> 00:38:12,360
<i>♫ But everything has come to an end ♫</i>

604
00:38:13,472 --> 00:38:18,360
<i>♫ I didn't write a letter ♫</i>

605
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,519
Thank you.

606
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:23,239
Today went so smoothly, it sold out so quickly.

607
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:25,760
Almost there.

608
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,280
Kids, get me two servings.

609
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,432
Okay.

610
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:35,199
Okay.

611
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:37,256
Stick it here.

612
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,880
Okay, this is for you.

613
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,079
Thank you.

614
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,480
- Thank you.
- Bye.

615
00:38:53,971 --> 00:39:01,971
<i>♫ I remember when we had just met ♫</i>

616
00:39:02,816 --> 00:39:07,008
<i>♫ The trees were all in bloom ♫</i>

617
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:14,272
<i>♫ You held me in your arms ♫</i>

618
00:39:14,272 --> 00:39:23,712
<i>♫ That you said it was love at first sight ♫</i>

619
00:39:24,608 --> 00:39:34,496
<i>♫ With the stars shining bright, so bright ♫</i>

620
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:37,079
<i>It is now nine o'clock in the evening.</i>

621
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:39,559
<i>The radio traffic network informs you</i>

622
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:41,159
<i>of the city traffic conditions.</i>

623
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:42,239
<i>The previous period.</i>

624
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:44,639
<i>The congestion on the West Fourth Ring road
from north to south</i>

625
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:46,159
<i>has been alleviated.</i>

626
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:48,480
<i>The direction heading
out of the city on the highway…</i>

627
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:56,679
Can I ask you a question?

628
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:58,679
No problem. Go ahead.

629
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:01,960
Do you like your current life?

630
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,440
You know, the daily grind.

631
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,280
Life is all about work.

632
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,920
Can't say I like it,
but I've gotten used to it.

633
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,519
We work hard every day.

634
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:17,119
Isn't it all for a more decent life?

635
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,000
Whether we like it or not.

636
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,199
If we don't like it,

637
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:23,719
does it mean we don't have
to keep working hard?

638
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,920
We're all on a long production line.

639
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,159
Each of us plays a certain role.

640
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:43,199
We all have responsibilities to bear.

641
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:47,079
We all have to achieve
the goals we set for ourselves.

642
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:57,840
Yes, what does it matter if we don't like it?
