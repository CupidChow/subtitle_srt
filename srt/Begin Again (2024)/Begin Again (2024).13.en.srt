- Why not?

Why don't you give it to me?

00:05:56,088 --> 00:05:57,288
I thought you might say,

56
00:05:57,848 --> 00:05:58,887
"I have to work tomorrow,

57
00:05:58,887 --> 00:06:00,088

Be careful.

67
00:06:40,327 --> 00:06:42,408
Didn't we come to the lighthouse last time?

68
00:06:44,552 --> 00:06:45,567
- Hide here.
- Why?

69
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:46,768
Here.

70
00:06:46,768 --> 00:06:47,968
What?

71
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:49,887
Do you want to go up
this lighthouse and take a look?

72
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:51,487
Can we go up there?

73
00:06:52,007 --> 00:06:53,048
Just avoid the security,

74
00:06:56,288 --> 00:06:57,608
then it's okay.

75
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,927
I don't think it's appropriate.

76
00:07:00,927 --> 00:07:02,408
What if we get caught?

77
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:03,848
If you get caught, you'll be fine.

78
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:05,048
What if I get deported?

79
00:07:05,648 --> 00:07:07,127
I've already looked into it.

80
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,447
They patrol only once every three hours.

81
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:11,608
So after he leaves now,
we won't run into him again.

82
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:14,007
And I used to do this when I was a kid.

83
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:16,608
At worst, we'll get a warning.

84
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:18,088
You won't get deported. Don't worry.

85
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,528
Are we going? Let's go. Okay.

86
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,807
Go in.

87
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:37,127
Can we really come up here?

88
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:40,608
No, I snuck you up here.

89
00:07:40,608 --> 00:07:41,648
Hurry up.

90
00:07:41,648 --> 00:07:42,648
I cover you from behind.

91
00:07:42,648 --> 00:07:43,728
Let me carry your bag.

92
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:44,744
No need.

93
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:46,600
Should we go further inside?

94
00:07:56,728 --> 00:07:58,007
Be careful.

95
00:07:58,007 --> 00:07:59,288
I'll just take a look.

96
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:01,768
Be careful. What are you doing?

97
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:03,648
I just take a look. Come here.

98
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:04,927
Why should I come over?

99
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:06,247
I'm afraid of heights.

100
00:08:06,968 --> 00:08:08,528
Okay, don't come over.

101
00:08:08,528 --> 00:08:09,968
You asked me to come over
and then tell me not to move.

102
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:11,208
- Stop moving.
- Help!

103
00:08:16,048 --> 00:08:17,487
Forget it, I'm scared. Help!

104
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:19,127
It's alright, just take a look.
It's very beautiful.

He knows we are coming up.

108

This is fun.

110
00:08:44,648 --> 00:08:46,768
Haven't you always said you wanted
to see the night view of Macau?

111
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:51,087
I've thought it over. And I think this might be

112
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:52,232

Yes, due to some mistake

167
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:53,768
last year, I missed out on the championship.

168
00:12:53,768 --> 00:12:55,207

169

Having such a beautiful girlfriend,

183
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:21,248
yet you only introduce her to us now?

184
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,008
It is improper.

185
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:24,807
Yes, it's quite improper.

186
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:26,248
Mr. Qi, thank you for

187
00:13:26,248 --> 00:13:27,408
always supporting Elvis.

188
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:29,048
Actually, I saw DEVE's biannual exhibition

189
00:13:29,048 --> 00:13:30,488
in Paris before.

190
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:32,327
I really like your work.

191
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:34,207
You understand jewelry?

192
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:36,408
Of course, good jewelry

193
00:13:36,408 --> 00:13:38,288
can bring energy to people.

194
00:13:38,288 --> 00:13:39,368
Who wouldn't like it?

195
00:13:42,927 --> 00:13:45,288
Your girlfriend is much more charming than you.

196
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:47,727
Of course, my life is quite boring.

197
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:48,888
Unlike Josephine.

198
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,888
Mr. Qi has always been

199
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:52,168
very forward-thinking.

200
00:13:52,168 --> 00:13:53,807
Regarding this time's lover series jewelry,

201
00:13:53,807 --> 00:13:56,048
I believe we could
have more ways to collaborate.

202
00:13:57,648 --> 00:13:59,168
Mr. Qi, there is a phone call.

203
00:13:59,168 --> 00:14:01,288
- I'll take a call.
- Please, go ahead.

204
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:06,408
I really think it works this time.

205
00:14:06,408 --> 00:14:07,447
Bro, trust me.

206
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:08,847
Let's just…

207
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,048
Let things take their natural course, okay?

208
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:11,768
- I'll go talk.
- About the endorsement…

209
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,528
I'll go greet people, you two chat.

210
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:16,048
Hello, thank you.

211
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:20,087
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

212
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:21,967
I noticed today

213
00:14:23,048 --> 00:14:24,408
you're not quite the same as usual.

214
00:14:25,128 --> 00:14:27,128
Well, how do I put it?

215
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:29,528
Very humble.

216
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:31,927
Don't you get used to

217
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:32,936
such a humble me?

218
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:35,847
No.

219
00:14:35,847 --> 00:14:36,847
I think

220
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:38,447
that you racers are quite hardworking.

221
00:14:39,368 --> 00:14:41,128
Not only do you acquire skills,

222
00:14:41,128 --> 00:14:42,847
but also work hard to pull in sponsorships.

223
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:44,840
You've worked hard.

224
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:52,807
Racing, it's

225
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:54,528
a game of capital.

226
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:57,248
Without sponsorship,
it's very difficult for a team to operate.

227
00:14:57,807 --> 00:14:58,824
We had to do this.

228
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:01,480
Elvis.

229
00:15:03,888 --> 00:15:05,327
Go ahead, I'll wait for you here.

230
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,648
- Go ahead.
- Just a moment.

231
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:14,207
Excuse me, Miss.

232
00:15:15,288 --> 00:15:16,888
Are you Elvis's girlfriend?

233
00:15:17,447 --> 00:15:19,927
Yes, and you are?

234
00:15:19,927 --> 00:15:21,168
I'm Doumoto.

235
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:23,528
I am also a racer, just like Elvis.

236
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:27,008
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

237
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,888
So, are you here in Macau

238
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,447
to accompany him for racing?

239
00:15:32,128 --> 00:15:34,128
No, I live here.

240
00:15:34,128 --> 00:15:36,528
So you guys met in here?

241
00:15:37,207 --> 00:15:38,344
Yes.

242
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:42,408
You probably don't know him
that well, I assume.

243
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:44,248
Almost two weeks.

244
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:46,888
- Two weeks?
- Yes.

245
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:48,607
Two weeks.

246
00:15:51,288 --> 00:15:52,288
Interesting.

247
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:55,408
That makes sense.

248
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:02,288
I don't quite understand what you're saying.

249
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:05,607
They just said

250
00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:07,648
DEVE is about to promote

251
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:10,408
the lover series jewelry.

252
00:16:11,288 --> 00:16:14,607
If Elvis just starts dating recently,

253
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:18,528
it would indeed help
to enhance his public image.

254
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,168
Elvis is not that kind of person.

255
00:16:25,927 --> 00:16:27,408
You've only known him for two weeks.

256
00:16:28,327 --> 00:16:29,847
How well do you know about him?

257
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:35,327
You must have missed when his manager

258
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,528
made a point to talk to Mr. Qi

259
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,687
about the new series.

260
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,207
Just a

261
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:47,248
friendly reminder.

262
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:50,288
I hate to see you become a victim.

263
00:16:51,008 --> 00:16:52,008
That's all.

264
00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:55,927
Thanks for reminding me.

265
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:57,687
Please mind your own business.

266
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:02,048
It's okay. I think the competition…

267
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:05,048
- Jiahui.
- Are you okay?

268
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:06,056
I'm fine.

269
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:09,407
Right, Mr. Qi just mentioned

270
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:10,768
I shouldn't be photographed with a model

271
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:12,167
for the lovers series jewelry.

272
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:13,167
It should be the two of us.

273
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,584
Yes.

274
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,887
You two have a very good vibe.

275
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:21,008
Only a real couple

276
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:23,288
can show such a natural love.

277
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:26,248
- Isn't it?
- Of course.

278
00:17:26,807 --> 00:17:28,008
I'm very willing to.

279
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:29,208
But I need to respect

280
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,288
my girlfriend.

281
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:33,367
After all, she's not a public figure.

282
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:35,647
So I think she has

283
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:37,576
the final decision.

284
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:45,248
Such a professional matter,

285
00:17:45,248 --> 00:17:46,248
I think it should be left to

286
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:48,008
the professionals.

287
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:50,528
Don't rush.

288
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,008
After his race,

289
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:53,488
let's discuss it then, okay?

290
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:55,607
Right. Races come first.

291
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:58,008
- Of course.
- Focus on the race first.

292
00:17:58,008 --> 00:17:59,567
You'd chat, I'm leaving.

293
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,127
Goodbye. Come on. I'll see you out.

294
00:18:06,688 --> 00:18:07,887
There's hope this time.

295
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,008
Well done, Jiahui.

296
00:18:09,008 --> 00:18:10,968
Wait, that's enough, right?

297
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:12,327
My task is done, okay?

298
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:13,528
Okay.

299
00:18:13,528 --> 00:18:15,248
Let me take you to the marketing department

300
00:18:15,248 --> 00:18:16,248
to meet people.

301
00:18:16,248 --> 00:18:17,327
Just five minutes.

302
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:18,567
- Okay? Come on.
- Okay.

303
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:19,647
Wait, what?

304
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:21,887
Go meet the marketing department guys. Come on.

305
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:23,008
- Then wait for me.
- Go ahead.

306
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:24,688
Come on, let's go.

307
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:25,688
Haven't we all met already?

308
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,647
Hello, Elvis.

309
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:29,167
Can I take a photo with you?

310
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:30,448
- Okay, come on.
- Thank you.

311
00:18:31,008 --> 00:18:32,008
Here.

312
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,376
Done.

313
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:40,087
I'll take one for you.

314
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:41,256
Thank you.

315
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:47,647
You want a photo too? Okay, just a moment.

316
00:18:49,688 --> 00:18:51,087
- What you said is no problem
- Investor.

317
00:18:56,087 --> 00:18:58,367
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

318
00:18:58,367 --> 00:18:59,728
Come here, Elvis.

319
00:18:59,728 --> 00:19:01,127
Let me introduce you to this person here.

320
00:19:03,288 --> 00:19:04,328
Where is Jiahui?

321
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:07,528
Where's Jiahui?

322
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:08,928
- She went out.
- Just went out.

323
00:19:09,528 --> 00:19:10,528
Why?

324
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:11,688
I don't know.

325
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:14,088
What's wrong?

326
00:19:25,448 --> 00:19:26,728
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

327
00:19:26,728 --> 00:19:27,807
<i>You keep socializing.</i>

328
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:30,407
<i>Hope you can successfully
secure the endorsement.</i>

329
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:32,367
<i>The race is about to start.</i>

330
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:35,488
<i>- Let's not meet again.</i>
- Take care, sir.

331
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:37,688
<i>Focus on your race.</i>

332
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:12,968
I might have been

333
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:15,488
unable to control myself just now.

334
00:20:16,728 --> 00:20:18,567
I hope it won't bother you.

335
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:19,847
It's fine, let's go.

336
00:20:19,847 --> 00:20:20,904
Wait.

337
00:20:29,407 --> 00:20:30,407
I have something

338
00:20:31,928 --> 00:20:33,128
to tell you.

339
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,127
Because once you leave Macau,

340
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:37,208
I don't know when

341
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,528
I will have the chance to see you again.

342
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:40,647
But I don't want to leave any regrets.

343
00:20:40,647 --> 00:20:41,768
Stop it.

344
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:44,768
It's late. Let's go back to rest.

345
00:20:44,768 --> 00:20:46,647
Wait, why do you reject me?

346
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:51,087
I just want to talk.

347
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:53,367
I don't require a definite answer or anything.

348
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,167
I think you should feel

349
00:20:59,288 --> 00:21:00,528
that I really like you.

350
00:21:05,968 --> 00:21:07,887
And I can also feel from your responses

351
00:21:07,887 --> 00:21:10,647
that you feel the same.

352
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:16,616
So,

353
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:18,647
I think we can…

354
00:21:23,807 --> 00:21:25,127
But so what?

355
00:21:30,847 --> 00:21:33,288
It's not going to work.

356
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,567
Right now, I can foresee

357
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:36,607
our end.

358
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:38,208
What is there to talk about?

359
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,248
Aren't we just talking now?

360
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,647
We haven't even started,

361
00:21:42,647 --> 00:21:44,807
why must you condemn it to death?

362
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:46,127
Then what are you worried about?

363
00:21:46,728 --> 00:21:47,912
Long distance?

364
00:21:50,528 --> 00:21:51,647
Can't see each other?

365
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:52,647
More than this.

366
00:21:52,647 --> 00:21:53,647
What else?

367
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,167
I'm here on a business trip.

368
00:21:55,887 --> 00:21:57,248
Once my project is finished
and the proposal is complete,

369
00:21:57,248 --> 00:21:59,367
I'll leave, I'll have to go back.

370
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:00,768
I never expected

371
00:22:00,768 --> 00:22:03,087
I would meet someone here,

372
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:04,167
I might like someone,

373
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:05,352
I might…

374
00:22:06,288 --> 00:22:09,008
I might start a relationship.

375
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:10,288
All of these are

376
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,887
out of my plan and my imagination.

377
00:22:12,528 --> 00:22:13,528
If we start

378
00:22:13,528 --> 00:22:15,248
just like you said, and then?

379
00:22:15,248 --> 00:22:17,167
We'll return to our busy

380
00:22:17,688 --> 00:22:19,887
and complicated lives.

381
00:22:19,887 --> 00:22:21,288
We can't meet for a long time.

382
00:22:21,288 --> 00:22:23,087
We'll keep in touch by phone.

383
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:24,688
And every day, we'll just say

384
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:28,008
"Good morning. Good night. I miss you."
And then?

385
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,647
Then those love feelings

386
00:22:31,647 --> 00:22:33,768
will all be gone.

387
00:22:33,768 --> 00:22:35,248
In the end, we

388
00:22:35,248 --> 00:22:36,528
won't even be friends.

389
00:22:45,728 --> 00:22:47,327
I can understand your worries.

390
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,367
But what if I tell you

391
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:53,887
that none of what you just said will happen?

392
00:22:57,968 --> 00:22:59,248
I can go to your place.

393
00:23:02,768 --> 00:23:03,848
What about Zhen Qiang?

394
00:23:05,887 --> 00:23:06,920
Abandon it?

395
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,087
I'm talking about us.

396
00:23:16,087 --> 00:23:18,768
We are no longer

397
00:23:18,768 --> 00:23:20,567
of the age to do as we please.

398
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:23,567
Our lives now are about more than love,

399
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,448
we also have many responsibilities.

400
00:23:25,448 --> 00:23:27,048
We have families, we have jobs,

401
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:28,607
and we have our own lives.

402
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,327
I can't possibly ask you

403
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:31,647
to completely give up
everything you have in Macau

404
00:23:32,488 --> 00:23:34,688
for our relationship.

405
00:23:34,688 --> 00:23:36,847
Why do you think so extreme?

406
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:38,488
I'll go to you, it doesn't mean

407
00:23:38,488 --> 00:23:40,087
that I won't come back to Macau.

408
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:41,127
Isn't love between two people simply

409
00:23:41,127 --> 00:23:42,968
about mutual tolerance and acceptance?

410
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:49,288
Can you just live in the present?

411
00:23:49,288 --> 00:23:51,528
Can you put aside your worries?

412
00:23:51,528 --> 00:23:53,488
You don't need to consider how I feel.

413
00:23:53,488 --> 00:23:55,008
Nor should you think about the future

414
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:56,208
whether it's good or bad.

415
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:57,728
Don't worry about my family.

416
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,367
Just ask yourself.

417
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:00,768
Even if you tell me

418
00:24:01,887 --> 00:24:04,008
that you don't like me at all, I can accept it.

419
00:24:07,728 --> 00:24:09,647
I just want you

420
00:24:09,647 --> 00:24:11,167
to ask yourself

421
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,887
what you feel

422
00:24:15,647 --> 00:24:16,728
and what life you most want

423
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:17,768
right now.

424
00:24:35,448 --> 00:24:37,367
Let's just be friends.

425
00:24:57,488 --> 00:24:58,647
We can't.

470
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,647
Why are you here?

471
00:29:10,647 --> 00:29:12,127
Just got off work.

472
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:13,647
Every time I see you, it's at night.

473
00:29:15,248 --> 00:29:16,296
Thanks to the fate.

474
00:29:19,647 --> 00:29:21,087
What about you? Where have you just been?

475
00:29:21,087 --> 00:29:22,088
Dressed so smart.

476
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:24,688
Just finished socializing.

477
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:28,688
Can you racers do something serious?

478
00:29:29,488 --> 00:29:31,008
It was the sponsor's social event, bro.

479
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,448
I know.

480
00:29:32,448 --> 00:29:33,607
What about the race?

481
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:34,928
How's the preparation going?

482
00:29:34,928 --> 00:29:36,327
It's alright, okay.

483
00:29:38,327 --> 00:29:40,367
Doesn't sound okay, bro.

484
00:29:46,607 --> 00:29:48,407
What about that girl you mentioned?

485
00:30:04,327 --> 00:30:05,384
Forget it.

486
00:30:06,048 --> 00:30:07,112
What about you?

487
00:30:07,928 --> 00:30:09,407
Any news?

488
00:30:10,288 --> 00:30:11,688
She's back.

489
00:30:11,688 --> 00:30:12,928
That's good.

490
00:30:12,928 --> 00:30:14,024
But I got rejected.

491
00:30:21,288 --> 00:30:22,504
She thought

492
00:30:26,688 --> 00:30:27,807
long-distance love

493
00:30:28,807 --> 00:30:29,968
won't work out.

494
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,920
<i>[I want to say]</i>

495
00:30:55,336 --> 00:30:56,872
<i>[I hope you]</i>

496
00:31:10,008 --> 00:31:13,488
What is love exactly?

497
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:23,008
I'll drink one.

498
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:24,087
Don't.

499
00:31:24,087 --> 00:31:25,327
You have to race.

500
00:31:25,327 --> 00:31:26,968
It's okay, just one can.

501
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,528
Your coach will blame me.

502
00:31:28,528 --> 00:31:29,607
He couldn't find you anyway.

503
00:31:30,607 --> 00:31:32,248
Two men trapped by love.

504
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:34,728
- Here.
- Just a bit, it's okay.

505
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:35,880
Don't worry.

506
00:31:43,928 --> 00:31:45,000
Love.

507
00:31:45,728 --> 00:31:47,488
I once heard a story

508
00:31:48,288 --> 00:31:49,688
about love.

509
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:53,607
One day, Plato asked Socrates,

510
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:55,248
"Master.

511
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:56,248
What is love?"

512
00:31:57,407 --> 00:31:58,488
Socrates told him,

513
00:31:59,008 --> 00:32:00,567
"You walk into a wheat field,

514
00:32:01,407 --> 00:32:04,008
then you pick a wheat ear out,

515
00:32:04,008 --> 00:32:05,208
and you must not look back."

516
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:07,768
Plato went, but after just a short while,

517
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:09,887
he came back empty-handed.

518
00:32:10,488 --> 00:32:11,688
Plato said,

519
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:13,887
"Master,

520
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:19,367
I got to the wheat field
and I found a very beautiful

521
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,567
and full wheat ear.

522
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:23,688
But I did not pick it.

523
00:32:24,248 --> 00:32:25,288
Because I thought

524
00:32:25,288 --> 00:32:27,367
I would find a better one.

525
00:32:29,528 --> 00:32:30,688
As I kept walking,

526
00:32:30,688 --> 00:32:31,807
and went almost the end,

527
00:32:31,807 --> 00:32:33,607
I found that on my way,

528
00:32:33,607 --> 00:32:35,048
every single ear I came across

529
00:32:35,048 --> 00:32:37,208
was not as good as the first one.

530
00:32:38,488 --> 00:32:39,887
So I came back empty-handed."

531
00:32:42,688 --> 00:32:43,688
Bro.

532
00:32:44,968 --> 00:32:46,248
You just got rejected.

533
00:32:48,087 --> 00:32:49,288
Never give up.

534
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,647
- Never give up.
- Never give up.

535
00:32:59,327 --> 00:33:00,488
Never give up.

536
00:33:30,807 --> 00:33:31,807
Come on.

537
00:33:31,807 --> 00:33:33,288
- Be careful.
- Be careful ahead.

538
00:33:33,288 --> 00:33:34,688
Be careful.

539
00:33:34,688 --> 00:33:35,784
No problem.

540
00:33:37,087 --> 00:33:39,968
- Miss Mai, your coffee.
- Okay, thank you.

541
00:33:39,968 --> 00:33:41,096
Here, this one.

542
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:43,407
Take them to the Director and others.

543
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:44,647
Okay.

544
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,768
Right.

545
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:47,008
Have the external partners arrived?

546
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,607
I just saw Fish.

547
00:33:48,607 --> 00:33:50,127
It seems that Mr. Le didn't come.

548
00:33:51,847 --> 00:33:53,968
Okay, got it. Go busy yourself. Thank you.

549
00:33:53,968 --> 00:33:55,080
Okay.

550
00:34:01,127 --> 00:34:02,448
- Here, Mr. Qiang.
- Ask her later.

551
00:34:02,448 --> 00:34:03,448
- Coffee.
- Thank you.

552
00:34:03,448 --> 00:34:04,968
- It's okay.
- Thank you. Put it here.

553
00:34:04,968 --> 00:34:06,056
Okay.

554
00:34:12,528 --> 00:34:13,928
Good morning, Miss Mai.

555
00:34:14,808 --> 00:34:15,808
Good morning, Fish.

556
00:34:16,408 --> 00:34:19,368
Today we have ample time for shooting.

557
00:34:19,368 --> 00:34:21,647
We can take our time. There's no need to rush.

558
00:34:21,647 --> 00:34:24,360
- Great, thank you for communicating.
- I should.

559
00:34:24,968 --> 00:34:26,056
Right.

560
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:28,048
Is Le not coming today?

561
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:30,008
Right, I forgot to tell you.

562
00:34:30,008 --> 00:34:31,848
Tomorrow, we are going to shoot

563
00:34:31,848 --> 00:34:33,008
the restaurant.

564
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:34,488
We need to

565
00:34:34,488 --> 00:34:36,488
shoot the dishes at that restaurant
within ten minutes after they being served.

566
00:34:36,488 --> 00:34:39,328
After ten minutes, they'll remove the dishes.

567
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:41,207
Ten minutes? How are we supposed to do so?

568
00:34:41,207 --> 00:34:44,127
That chef is worried about
if we don't shoot the dishes

569
00:34:44,127 --> 00:34:45,127
in ten minutes,

570
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:46,207
the dishes wouldn't look good

571
00:34:46,207 --> 00:34:47,567
after ten minutes.

572
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:49,767
So I had Le go communicate with them.

573
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:54,008
Okay, I see. Thanks.

574
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,144
Okay.

575
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,488
Pour me a glass of water, please.

576
00:35:33,928 --> 00:35:35,080
Meng.

577
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,992
Meng.

578
00:35:45,207 --> 00:35:46,216
Meng.

579
00:35:52,008 --> 00:35:53,096
Right.

580
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:56,928
- Don't move. Raise your hands.
- How do my legs look?

581
00:36:00,888 --> 00:36:02,727
Take a video for me.

582
00:36:03,488 --> 00:36:05,528
- A video, okay.
- Right.

583
00:36:05,528 --> 00:36:07,008
I'll walk over from this side.

584
00:36:07,008 --> 00:36:08,008
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

585
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:12,607
- Can you help us take a group photo?
- Sure.

586
00:36:12,607 --> 00:36:14,127
Okay, thank you.

587
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:19,408
- Is it okay?
- Take a look.

588
00:36:19,408 --> 00:36:21,167
It's pretty.

589
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:22,607
Want us to take one for you?

590
00:36:22,607 --> 00:36:24,048
My husband is very good at taking photos.

591
00:36:26,448 --> 00:36:27,727
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

592
00:36:39,287 --> 00:36:41,048
Meng, where have you gone?

593
00:36:41,048 --> 00:36:42,368
Why didn't you tell me?

594
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,968
I-I was looking for that razor.

595
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,287
I can't find it.

596
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:46,968

Why? Why can I only see your shoes?

Where are my shoes?

603
00:36:59,848 --> 00:37:02,687
Why do you always have to put my things away?

604
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,008
Y-You put them away so quickly.

605
00:37:04,008 --> 00:37:05,607
You should tell me.

You're finally back.

614
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:16,328
Who is this boy?

615
00:38:17,127 --> 00:38:18,127
His name is Frank.

616
00:38:18,767 --> 00:38:19,928
He is my client.

617
00:38:19,928 --> 00:38:21,287
He can only understand Mandarin.

618
00:38:23,048 --> 00:38:25,167
Hello, Frank.

619
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:26,287
Come in.

00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:49,832
Come on.

00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,167
Your dad hasn't come back yet,
let's wait for him.

00:38:58,368 --> 00:39:00,808
Frank, what do you like to eat?

627
00:39:00,808 --> 00:39:02,127
Biscuits?

628
00:39:02,127 --> 00:39:04,008
He's allergic to wheat bran,
can't eat biscuits.

629
00:39:05,488 --> 00:39:07,448
Then have some fruit.

630
00:39:07,448 --> 00:39:08,520
Here.

631
00:39:09,928 --> 00:39:10,928

Grandma, what are you doing?
