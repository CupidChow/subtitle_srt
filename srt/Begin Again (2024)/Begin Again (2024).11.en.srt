00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,519
Hello, Shaohui.

3
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,120
Why is there
so little information on Chloe Liu?

4
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,319
Nothing else?

5
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,319
You can take a look

6
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,599
what events she would attend.

7
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,632
You can…

8
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,159
Parent-child sports day?

9
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,359
Send me the information. Thanks.

10
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,239
Want to have some chocolate?

11
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,040
Hello, Howard. I'm Casey.

12
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,920
Chloe Liu will participate in
a parent-child sports day next.

13
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,319
I plan to go take a look.

14
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,280
It's a good chance to meet her.

15
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,120
Get a child?

16
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,479
I'll arrange it.

17
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,768
I can do it.

18
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,800
- What?
- Take me with you.

19
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,680
Where to?

20
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,960
Parent-child sports day.

21
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,879
You must be joking.

22
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,000
Is there anyone more suitable than me?

23
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,840
Tell me the time.

24
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:07,208
<i>[Episode 11]</i>

25
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,719
Over there. Jianming.

26
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,840
Dad, Ms. Meng.

27
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,599
Jiajia, you have grown up into a pretty lady.

28
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,199
You're becoming more beautiful.

29
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,680
Ms. Meng, you haven't changed a bit.

30
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,919
I saw you once you came out.

31
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,400
Dad, where is mom?

32
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,879
Didn't you arrive together?

33
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,439
Look at you.

34
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:37,000
Running all over the world after graduation.

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,680
It's been a long time not seeing me.

36
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,879
Now you see me,

37
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:42,120
yet you don't even ask how I am.

38
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,159
No need.

39
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,639
Your face is radiant

40
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,680
and your stature is tall and straight.

41
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,759
I can tell

42
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,280
Ms. Meng must have taken good care of you.

43
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,879
You are good at fooling me.

44
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,800
Jiajia.

45
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,400
Mom.

46
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,879
Jiajia.

47
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,599
I've missed you so much.

48
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,000
Alright.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,479
Don't keep your dad and aunt waiting.

50
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,560
- Let's go over there.
- I'll get it.

51
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,560
Let's go.

52
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,159
Where's your boyfriend?

53
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,080
He is still working.

54
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,399
Besides, we haven't seen each other
for such a long time.

55
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,399
I want to spend more time with you guys.

56
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,360
Right, Mom?

57
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,800
Yes, it's Hao, right?

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,920
If he is here,

59
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,360
how do I have some private talk with Jiajia?

60
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,399
- Let's go.
- Go.

61
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:30,480
- Let's go.
- Go.

62
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,720
Thank you.

63
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,199
Hello, these two. Thank you.

64
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,160
Wait. There are four of us,
and you've ordered two cars?

65
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,439
I was afraid that there wouldn't
be enough space for all your luggage.

66
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:49,839
This is not appropriate.
You're too extravagant.

67
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,920
Jianming, let Jiajia accompany her mom.

68
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,879
You go after her.

69
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,560
Let's take one car. Come on.

70
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,560
You guys get on the car.

71
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,720
Let's go.

72
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,720
- See you then, Jiajia.
- Okay.

73
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,279
Look, I led my first trip

74
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,279
to Mont Blanc last month.

75
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,040
- Various landforms.
- Oh my.

76
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,560
It's so attractive.

77
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,800
Nice.

78
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,439
If you want to go, I'll go with you.

79
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,000
How about I give you a discount?

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,120
Sure.

81
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,519
Then you should settle

82
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:27,720
the money for raising you first, okay?

83
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:31,720
You're quite a slick talker now.

84
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,399
So usually,

85
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,680
you've been travelling around,

86
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,959
how do you find time to date a boyfriend?

87
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,800
Finally?

88
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,959
You must be holding it in so hard.

89
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,560
Hurry up and tell me. Don't change the subject.

90
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,319
You told me he's

91
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,160
in hotel management.

92
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,399
And you are a tour guide.

93
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,399
How did you two start

94
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,839
dating?

95
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,560
Is he handsome?

96
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,120
Show me some photo.

97
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,480
What for?

98
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,800
You'll see him in person.

99
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,560
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

100
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,120
Could you please help us with the luggage?

101
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,920
- Dad, Ms. Meng.
- Okay.

102
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,079
I've got you the room keys.

103
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,240
Dad's.

104
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,800
- Mom's.
- Good.

105
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,480
You guys go upstairs and rest for a bit.

106
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,536
See you at the restaurant.

107
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,759
Then I'll go upstairs.

108
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,040
See you later.

109
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,120
Dad, you should go rest too.

110
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,480
You go in first. Go in and wait for me.

111
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,176
What's wrong, Dad?

112
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,192
You've got a tan.

113
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,439
This is fashionable now. It looks good.

114
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,440
It looks good.

115
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:05,096
Healthy, right?

116
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:11,079
- If you need anything, go to me.
- Okay.

117
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:13,319
You…

118
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,800
You are living well, right?

119
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,920
No, Dad. You go upstairs and rest.

120
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,560
You go keep Ms. Meng company.

121
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,720
- See you tonight.
- Okay, 6:30 PM.

122
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
6:30 PM.

123
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,759
Hurry up.

124
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,240
That's impressive.

125
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,920
You're watching racing?

126
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,879
Why are you suddenly so interested in racing?

127
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,000
Not really.

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,879
I've recently met a handsome guy.

129
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,839
He's a race car engineer.

130
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,920
I thought to know more about his interests.

131
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,000
Then, we would share the same interests.

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,519
You

133
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,279
are going on dates again?

134
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,336
Who is it?

135
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,720
The last time we went to the bar…

136
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,839
The time we danced?

137
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes, that time.

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,879
After that, we've had meals
together a few times.

139
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,480
But I think he's not the kind

140
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,000
of flirty guy.

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,560
I think

142
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,879
he's quite special.

143
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,600
So this time, keep your eyes wide open

144
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,919
and be discerning.

145
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,000
Got it?

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,840
I will. Don't worry.

147
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,919
The Europeans are good at racing.

148
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:49,600
So much faster.

149
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,799
Who said it?

150
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,240
It's just because car racing is

151
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,120
a sport that started in Europe.

152
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,320
And over the years,

153
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,320
they already have a very mature method

154
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,559
to train racers.

155
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,000
And they have professional teams.

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,360
Chinese racing is

157
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,919
just a late starter.

158
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,799
It doesn't mean we aren't fast enough.

159
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,639
And I think the Chinese racers,

160
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,960
whether in terms of talent,

161
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,159
or the effort put in,

162
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,320
are in no way inferior to them,

163
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,919
and working even harder than them.

164
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,440
It's just a matter of time.

165
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,472
Sooner or later, we will surpass them.

166
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,480
Are you okay?

167
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,120
I just said,

168
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,879
"The Europeans are good at racing."

169
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,559
I get it.

170
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,879
You're nervous about Elvis.

171
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:32,240
- Who is Elvis?
- Are you?

172
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,919
That racer Elvis.

173
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,559
Han Junhao?

174
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:40,080
- What's wrong?
- He's dating Joe.

175
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,240
No way.

176
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,440
My client Han Junhao is dating Joe.

177
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,720
How could I not know? That's crazy.

178
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,399
It's true, Casey.

179
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,399
You've been so busy lately,

180
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,960
so you have no time to care about us.

181
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,000
It's true.

182
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,240
- They are dating.
- Wait, wait.

183
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Joe, is what she said true?

184
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,440
More than true,

185
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,600
she's too cute.

186
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,120
I just said,

187
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,759
"The Europeans are good at racing."

188
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,679
And Joe had a big reaction.

189
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:08,039
- I was just stating a fact.
- So was I.

190
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,080
What's up? Looking for me?

191
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,639
I think, wait, I want…

192
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,720
Let me digest this first.

193
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,200
What's the situation here?

194
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,600
You are dating Han Junhao.

195
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,360
No, don't listen to her.

196
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,759
She said you're in love.

197
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,879
You know her.

198
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:20,960
She's such a drama queen.

199
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,120
That's true. She is.

200
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,039
Right. What's the matter?

201
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,639
I'm here because…

202
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,960
- You are.
- Stop it.

203
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,120
I'm here because

204
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,759
- the company is organizing an auction.
- Okay.

205
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,159
We're talking about business here.

206
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,639
- Chloe Liu will be coming to Macau to organize
- Forget it.

207
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,080
a charity art exhibition

208
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,559
- related to children's autism.
- Cool.

209
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,080
And the company wants to collaborate with her,

210
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,240
so I'm here to discuss with you

211
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,320
on how to promote this. Do you have time?

212
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,360
Yes.

213
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,639
- Let's go inside and talk.
- Sure.

214
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,240
Where are you guys going? Wait for me.

215
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,200
No gossiping during working hours.

216
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,679
Then we'll talk after work.

217
00:11:09,556 --> 00:11:15,080
<i>[Macau Grand Prix]</i>

218
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,679
Ryan.

219
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,120
Charles, long time no see.

220
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,159
- You guys came quite early.
- Right.

221
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,799
Elvis.

222
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,559
- Hello.
- What's up, bro?

223
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,679
- Hello.
- Hey, bro.

224
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,799
Uno and the others said

225
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:34,320
Elvis has been on the upswing lately.

226
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,639
How is it?

227
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,240
- Any chance to win against Doumoto this time?
- Definitely.

228
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,759
Let me tell you,
just wait and watch the good show.

229
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,919
Elvis will definitely nail it.

230
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,360
You too. Do your best.

231
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,519
Don't let that kid win.

232
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,000
Look at him.

233
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,960
- He's even filming a documentary.
- Great race.

234
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,519
Being so high profile.

235
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,080
Young guy.

236
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,279
Having some achievements,

237
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,799
it's only right to be showy.

238
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,919
Nice to see you, man.

239
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,039
I hope you'll get a good position

240
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:08,159
at the qualifying draw.

241
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,279
Otherwise,

242
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,480
you'll never catch up with me.

243
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,279
You are so confident.

244
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,759
Of course, my opponents

245
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:23,240
usually are confident.

246
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,879
And I'm happy to give them some hope.

247
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,720
After the race is over,

248
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,240
I'll then give them despair.

249
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,039
Everyone, please take your seats.

250
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:34,120
- Go for it.
- The sign-in starts now.

251
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,759
Racers' meeting is about to begin.

252
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,799
This spot.

253
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,720
This spot on the turn back is crucial.

254
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,679
- Okay, come on.
- Come on.

255
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,200
Justin.

256
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,480
- Go back first.
- Okay, got it.

257
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,320
What's wrong?

258
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,120
About what Doumoto said just now,

259
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,480
did you take it to heart?

260
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,600
I just ignore him.

261
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,720
- I'm going.
- See you on the track.

262
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,559
- Cheer up.
- Cheer up.

263
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,759
- Cheer up.
- Cheer up.

264
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,768
I'm off.

265
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:17,200
Okay, then I'm relieved.

266
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,679
That's it for today. Rest well.

267
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,159
I have a meeting with Jeremy.

268
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,559
- I'll go ahead then.
- Then I'm leaving.

269
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,159
- Okay.
- Bye.

270
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,840
<i>Where do you go when you're in a bad mood?</i>

271
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,976
<i>[Chen Jiahui]
I'll take you there.</i>

272
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,919
<i>Sure, see you later.</i>

273
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,759
When you usually clear your mind,

274
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:43,960
you'd come here?

275
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,720
Scared?

276
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,159
I came into here on my walk.

277
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:50,720
It's very quiet here, very poetic.

278
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,440
It's wonderful to pass by

279
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,679
these little monuments.

280
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,759
It allows me to momentarily

281
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:59,320
detach from the reality.

282
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,480
And every time I see the inscriptions
on these monuments,

283
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,759
I would feel

284
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:04,840
like I'm reading

285
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,000
a miniature novel.

286
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I would think about

287
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,639
what these people did in life,

288
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:12,039
and what kind of lives they went through.

289
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,399
When they were in Macau,

290
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:15,799
which places they had been to.

291
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:17,519
And I would wonder

292
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,799
who wrote these loving inscriptions

293
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,879
for them.

294
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,480
Every time I feel upset, I would come here.

295
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,720
If you stand at the end of life,

296
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,600
looking back in life,

297
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,240
you might

298
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,080
let go many things

299
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,200
you can't figure out.

300
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,159
All the monuments here
date back to the 19th century.

301
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,320
Two months six days.

302
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,879
So he only

303
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,840
existed in this world

304
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,960
two months and six days.

305
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,200
He was a little baby.

306
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,039
When I first saw him, I was feeling sad

307
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,639
just like you.

308
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,320
I can't help worrying about him.

309
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,679
He's so small, so soft,

310
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,200
lying here all alone.

311
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,720
Must be feeling scared.

312
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,519
So every time I come here,

313
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,320
I'd stand here for a while

314
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,360
to talk to him.

315
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,384
Let's go.

316
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,240
George Chinnery.

317
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,840
You know this person?

318
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,840
He had a great impact on Chinese oil painting.

319
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,320
He is also one of the descendants

320
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,919
who brought oil painting to China.

321
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:01,279
Really?

322
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,399
Compared to Giuseppe Castiglione's paintings.

323
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,640
Because Giuseppe Castiglione

324
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,039
focused on depicting noble life,

325
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,079
but his paintings

326
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,119
are all of ordinary people among the masses.

327
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,279
All from

328
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,480
the ordinary life,

329
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
very touching.

330
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,640
Because of him,

331
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,000
the customs and culture of the coastal areas
of 19th-century China

332
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,440
could be recorded.

333
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,920
He kept a record of this land

334
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,440
until he died.

335
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,720
What do you think

336
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,799
was the reason

337
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,960
he stayed in Macau?

338
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
Maybe

339
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,920
he felt a sense of belonging here.

340
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,039
There were ties that bound him

341
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,160
or people he couldn't bear to leave.

342
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,720
So, what's

343
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,200
the story behind it?

344
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,960
It must be a very beautiful love story.

345
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,680
After staying here for a little while,

346
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,960
I've really calmed down.

347
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,119
As you slowly walk around here, you'll realize

348
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,559
that those things we long for

349
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,799
don't seem that important anymore.

350
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,359
Everyone is born to die.

351
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:21,079
So when we are alive,

352
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:23,559
let's enjoy and be unrestrained,

353
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,160
considering our lives to be

354
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,079
a huge amusement park.

355
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,599
Don't expect us to be perfect

356
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:30,519
at everything we do.

357
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:34,200
After all, life is all about experience.

358
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,200
Sometimes, just

359
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,680
look down to watch the ants moving house,

360
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,440
or look up at

361
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,599
the birds flying across the sky.

362
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,119
And feel the moment, that's enough.

363
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,720
<i>After reading this,</i>

364
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,839
<i>if she had only suspected</i>

365
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:18,119
<i>that Mrs. Xun's death in her previous life</i>

366
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:19,880
<i>was related to her husband…</i>

367
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,359
Meng.

368
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,319
Can you lower the volume

369
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:28,319
of your phone?

370
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:30,680
Sorry for disturbing you.

371
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,799
Why are you listening to this now?

372
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,119
Just for fun.

373
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:38,599
I find it quite interesting.

374
00:19:44,192 --> 00:19:45,720
Stop what you're doing for now.

375
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,720
We're going out to eat later tonight.

376
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,279
Take your time to pack when we get back.

377
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:51,480
- Okay?
- Okay.

378
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,160
You're going out to eat dressed in

379
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,519
this?

380
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:05,799
What's wrong? Do you think it's not suitable?

381
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:08,319
It's just

382
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,319
a little plain.

383
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,119
Then I'll change into something else.

384
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,039
How quickly time passes.

385
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,279
Last time I saw Jiajia,

386
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,680
she was just a junior in college.

387
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,799
Now she's bringing her boyfriend
to meet the parents.

388
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,440
I even brought a gift for Jiajia.

389
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,160
When do you think
is the right time to give it to her?

390
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,000
Hello, okay. I'll come down right away.

391
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,960
She just got a boyfriend.

392
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,680
Don't take it that seriously.

393
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,279
What happens in the future is still uncertain.

394
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,559
Alright, Jiajia is here.
I'm going down first, you hurry up.

395
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,519
I'm not ready yet, just wait for me.

396
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,960
- Jiajia.
- Mom.

397
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,799
I'll do it myself, thank you.

398
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,079
Did you rest well?

399
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,759
Very well.

400
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,440
Over there, Dad, Ms. Meng.

401
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,456
This way.

402
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,160
How should we sit?

403
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,192
Mom, sit here.

404
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:16,759
Dad, Ms. Meng.

405
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,720
Well, Jiajia.

406
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,920
Sit between me and your mom.

407
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,359
Hao will sit here. He'll be here soon.

408
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,440
He…

409
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,359
We've come all the way from Beijing.

410
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:39,400
He didn't come to pick us up at the airport,

411
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,559
and he's being late for dinner.

412
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:42,839
No, Dad.

413
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:45,119
He took leave to pick you up,

414
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,759
but something came up at the last minute

415
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,359
and he really couldn't come.

416
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,960
He's probably still busy right now,

417
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,359
should be arriving soon.

418
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,839
He will be here soon.

419
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,599
Xu, are you in such a hurry?

420
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,599
Now that we're here,

421
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,720
we can wait a bit longer.

422
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,599
Then, waitress, bring me the menu.

423
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:04,960
I'll order some dishes first.

424
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,240
Mr. Xu has already
ordered the dishes for today.

425
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,079
If needed, we can serve the dishes at any time.

426
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,839
- Mr. Xu?
- Hao.

427
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,000
Then what did he order?

428
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,079
- What did he order? Let me take a look.
- This is the menu.

429
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,759
- I won't disturb you anymore.
- Dad is still the same,

430
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:27,960
acting like a scholar.

431
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,359
Being meticulous in everything.

432
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:31,599
He's been this way since his youth.

433
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,640
So boring.

434
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,000
Sorry, sorry.

435
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,240
Sorry I'm late.

436
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,880
Really sorry, Aunt.

437
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,160
Xu Junhao.

438
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,119
Just call me Hao.

439
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,799
Hao.

440
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,440
Jiajia, you didn't tell me
your mom is so young and beautiful.

441
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,200
I thought you were sisters.

442
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,319
Nice, Hao. You are really a sweet talker.

443
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,519
This is Jiajia's dad.

444
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:01,039
Hello, uncle. I'm Hao.

445
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,240
This is Jiajia's aunt.

446
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,359
Hello, hello.

447
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,440
Uncle, I'm truly very sorry
for being late today.

448
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,000
I've been working the whole day today,

449
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,400
and really couldn't come.

450
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,559
I sincerely apologize to you. I'm sorry.

451
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,960
Xu, is the menu that funny?

452
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,000
Greet him.

453
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:52,440
- Waitress.
- Waitress, come on.

454
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:07,480
Uncle, nice to meet you.

455
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,880
Tired of standing? Have a seat.

456
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,880
Take a seat.

457
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:23,160
Well, your surname is Xu, right?

458
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,680
- Yes.
- Then I'll call you Xu.

459
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,480
That's fine.

460
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,160
What do you do for work?

461
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,720
Actually, I am in charge of

462
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,039
this hotel management.

463
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:36,559
For entertainment, public relations,
or any aspect, I'm in charge.

464
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,279
Your Mandarin is quite good.

465
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,480
Thank you.

466
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,519
How many people in your household?

467
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,039
How many people are there in your family?

468
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:48,799
Well, apart from my parents,

469
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,119
I am the eldest son,

470
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,920
and I have a younger brother,

471
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,920
who has just entered society

472
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,240
and has started working.

473
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,039
And I have a sister
who just started sixth grade.

474
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,000
What do your parents do?

475
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,759
When my parents were young,

476
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:04,559
they started a restaurant.

477
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,559
And they have been running it for decades.

478
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,799
Now in Macau, it is somewhat

479
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,119
renowned.

480
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:13,880
Are you still living with your parents now?

481
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,960
Uncle, don't be kidding.

482
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
I have moved out a long time ago.

483
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,160
I rented a house.

484
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,759
That means

485
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,119
you still don't have your own house.

486
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:24,640
If getting married, I would buy a house.

487
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,000
Wherever Jiajia likes to live,
that's where I will buy.

488
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,480
That easy?

489
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,599
You are young, yet not modest at all.

490
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,200
Uncle, I am not that young anymore.

491
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,920
I am already thirty-seven.

492
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,960
Actually, I know

493
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,400
that many people say

494
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,920
that marriage is not about money,
just being in love is enough.

495
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,440
But I know

496
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,839
that Jiajia is your precious one.

497
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,960
If she is with me,

498
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,279
she should not suffer.

499
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:57,160
Anyone can say sweet words.

500
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,119
But it may not be the case
when it comes to the real thing.

501
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,319
Xu, you are here in Macau

502
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,880
to check on his family background?

503
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,200
- No, no.
- Hao, don't take it to heart.

504
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,319
Jiajia's dad

505
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,319
is always like this,

506
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,640
having been

507
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,359
a teacher all his life.

508
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:16,400
He's quite

509
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,920
serious.

510
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,480
No, not serious at all.

511
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,960
If I had such a beautiful

512
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,359
and outstanding daughter

513
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,440
like Jiajia,

514
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,440
I would ask the same.

515
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,319
It's quite normal, right?

516
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,680
- A senior manager…
- No.

517
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,640
- really knows the techniques in talking.
- Not at all.

518
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,000
Dad, it's been so long.

519
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,960
Today, let's just have a meal.

520
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,480
Let's serve the dishes.

521
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:48,000
Come on, let's eat.

522
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,599
- Waitress, serve the dishes.
- Alright.

523
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:57,384
Hurry up.

524
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
This is our hotel's specialty dish,

525
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,400
Yuan Yang mixed rice.

526
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,599
Please enjoy.

527
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:18,119
- Yuan Yang mixed rice.
- Right.

528
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,240
Eat up.

529
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,640
Uncle, are you feeling unwell?

530
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,640
The weather in Macau

531
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,160
really isn't like Beijing.

532
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,519
Too humid, right?

533
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,920
If you need a dehumidifier

534
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,872
or aromatherapy, or you don't like the pillow,

535
00:27:35,872 --> 00:27:38,119
you can tell me.

536
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,559
No. I'm from Shanghai,

537
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:42,519
so I'm pretty used to it.

538
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:44,240
Don't overthink it.

539
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,319
We are here

540
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:47,519
to come see you,

541
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,680
and also visit Macau.

542
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,480
Macau is really nice for travel.

543
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,960
Actually, Macau has a lot

544
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,640
of sightseeing spots and scenery

545
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,079
that you can explore.

546
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,519
Like Macau Tower.

547
00:27:58,519 --> 00:27:59,799
The Macau Tower is great.

548
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:01,000
It's romantic to go there at night.

549
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,400
You can overlook
the entire night view of Macau,

550
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
which I really like.

551
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,119
- And the world-famous bungee jump.
- What?

552
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,136
Bungee jump.

553
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:16,400
Jumping from height, Mom.

554
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,720
I've seen it on the internet.

555
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
I want to go.

556
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,720
I-I can arrange it.

557
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,319
Let's go together.

558
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:26,480
I really can't do this with you.

559
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,720
I can't do bungee jumping either.

560
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,000
Once I stand in that height,

561
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,559
I want to find a place to hold on to.

562
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,960
I always feel like I'm going to fall.

563
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
I can't go.

564
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,839
Indeed, the view is just so-so.

565
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:39,519
Actually, there are many other
beautiful places in Macau.

566
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:40,839
Do you like desserts?

567
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,839
How about the egg tarts?

568
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:44,000
Let's eat first.

569
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,279
The dishes are getting cold.

570
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,160
Right, let's eat first.

571
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,319
Hao ordered these

572
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,799
specialty dishes.

573
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,319
Please try.

574
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:55,480
Since we have so many dishes
perfect with drinks,

575
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,119
let's have a drink.

576
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,839
Don't.

577
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,240
Okay.

578
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,519
Uncle, what kind of alcohol
do you like to drink?

579
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:09,359
We have all kinds of foreign liquors here.

580
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:11,359
Whiskey, brandy, cocktails,

581
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,440
and liquor as well.

582
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,960
What do you like to drink?

583
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,119
Xu, don't be anxious.

584
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:19,400
We've just arrived in Macau today.

585
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,279
I want to go out for a walk later this evening.

586
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,359
Maybe another day.

587
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,039
Hao, so you are

588
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,279
a local born and bred in Macau.

589
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:37,480
Yes, I am

590
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,279
a local born and bred in Macau.

591
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,480
But during high school,

592
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,319
- I went to America.
- Just like you.

593
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,359
After finishing university,
I worked a few years and then came back.

594
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:47,680
You've had quite rich experiences.

595
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,079
Jianming, don't just talk, have some food.

596
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,480
Actually, Xu

597
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,440
is not that talkative.

598
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,759
Seeing you, he's really talkative now.

599
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,960
Meng, you eat some.

600
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,920
Don't just look after Xu.

601
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,119
- Dad, try that Wagyu beef.
- Right.

602
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,680
Hao knows you like Wagyu beef,

603
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,279
so specially chose this restaurant.

604
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,920
Eat while it's warm, uncle.
It's A5 Wagyu beef, you'll definitely like it.

605
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,160
Authentic.

606
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,039
Thank you, daughter.

607
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,720
It has Wagyu beef that dad loves to eat,

608
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,839
mom is not that important.

609
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,079
- How could that be?
- Aunt.

610
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,960
Jiajia told me

611
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,680
you like eating Cantonese cuisine,
especially sweet and sour pork.

612
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,559
This is made with black-haired pigs.

613
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,640
Try it.

614
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,000
Hao, you are nice.

615
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,319
You've thought everything through.

616
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,039
This chef's cooking is impressive.

617
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:06,799
Right? I particularly appreciate this chef too.

618
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,799
Our group recruited him back from Guangzhou,

619
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:09,799
just thinking

620
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:12,319
to alter the style

621
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:13,319
of the dining experience.

622
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,559
His color adjustment

623
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,680
and the seasoning are precise.

624
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,759
Then I'm relieved. If you like it,

625
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:21,160
we'll have this chef for the wedding.

626
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,752
Wedding?

627
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:31,960
What did you just say?

628
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,799
The wedding between me and Jiajia.

629
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:37,839
It's next Wednesday.

630
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,048
Got it.

631
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:01,000
Eat up, it's getting cold.

632
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,680
<i>[Chen Shiyu]
Ms. Wei, the proposal for Tianqin Entertainment</i>

633
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,400
<i>has been sent to your email.</i>

634
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,000
Okay, I'll take a look.

635
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:09,248
<i>[Proposal for Tianqin Entertainment]</i>

636
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:13,800
<i>[Chen Shiyu]</i>

637
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:17,480
<i>[The Art of Game Theory:
Life Is Full of Art of Game]</i>

638
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,880
<i>- Hello, Ms. Wei.</i>
- Has the new guest candidate

639
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,039
settled yet?

640
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,599
<i>Of course.</i>

641
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:24,920
<i>But it seems they are being discussing.</i>

642
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,984
<i>Professor Xu.</i>

643
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,519
Which Professor Xu?

644
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,039
<i>I think his name is Xu Jian…</i>

645
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:34,559
<i>What was it?</i>

646
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,839
Xu Jianming?

647
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:38,480
<i>Yes, that's Xu Jianming.</i>

648
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,319
<i>Ms. Wei, you know him?</i>

649
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:49,240
Kind of an acquaintance.

650
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,160
Okay, leave this to me.
You don't have to worry about it.

651
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,400
<i>Right,</i>

652
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,640
<i>are you adapting well in Macau?</i>

653
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:03,400
I'm doing quite well.

654
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,319
<i>Okay.</i>

655
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,319
<i>Then enjoy your vacation.</i>

656
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:10,159
<i>If you need anything, just contact me.</i>

657
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,119
<i>- Good night.</i>
- Okay, thank you.

658
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,559
Wait, let me tell you. I really can't get it.

659
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,199
How old is he?

660
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,039
Then how old is Jiajia?

661
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,239
Then why did she fall for this old folk?

662
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,224
Give me the coat.

663
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,360
You were fine during the meal.

664
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,559
What's wrong with you now?

665
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,119
At dinner, didn't you see?

666
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,960
He talked so sweet.

667
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,840
What a slick talker.

668
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,920
I really don't understand it.

669
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,000
He must have fed Jiajia
some sort of love potion.

670
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,159
They haven't known each other long,
and they're already preparing for the wedding.

671
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,559
If she really marries him,

672
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:57,440
then Jiajia will be doomed.

673
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,639
Okay, take your medicine first.

674
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,680
What?

675
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,000
Jiajia is not a child anymore.

676
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
She must have picked this guy for a reason.

677
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,880
She's your daughter. Don't you know her?

678
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,840
During dinner tonight,

679
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,079
the two of them seemed to get along well.

680
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:20,599
As the saying goes,

681
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,920
children have their own blessings.

682
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,360
If you get anxious and upset,

683
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,480
might just get your blood pressure raised.

684
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,599
Okay.

685
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:30,280
She's not your daughter.

686
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,039
It's easy for you to say so.

687
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,800
<i>[Xu Jianming]
Are you there?</i>

688
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,199
<i>I'll come over for a chat?</i>

689
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:49,000
- Where are you going?
- Me?

690
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,679
I'm going to find Tang Wei.

691
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:54,360
I need her to be on my side.

692
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,800
She's her mom, right?

693
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,559
She can't be irresponsible.

694
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:02,199
If you're tired, go to bed early.

695
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,424
- Another one, please.
- Right away, sir.

696
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,960
- Sir, your drink.
- Thank you.

697
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,440
- Hello.
- A glass of lemonade, please.

698
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,199
Alright.

699
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:04,159
Don't you have a drink?

700
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:06,480
Let's talk business first.

701
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,159
About Jiajia getting married,

702
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:15,199
did you know in advance?

703
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,159
Wait, why are you looking at me…?

704
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:21,000
Do you think I knew all along,

705
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,679
and deliberately kept it from you?

706
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:26,360
Jiajia has been with you since we divorced.

707
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,440
Whatever happens,
it's always been just the two of you

708
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,599
discussing.

709
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,599
I don't believe

710
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:31,679
she didn't give you the slightest hint

711
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:33,639
for getting married.

712
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,960
Jiajia is also your daughter.

713
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,976
Don't you know her?

714
00:37:38,976 --> 00:37:40,039
Right.

715
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:41,360
She'd talk to me

716
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,920
about those trivial things.

717
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,079
But when it comes to choose a major,

718
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:46,199
decide on a school,

719
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,320
and the job to take on after graduation,

720
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,679
she would only tell us

721
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:51,840
after figuring it all out on her own

722
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,039
and making up her mind. Right?

723
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,840
Maybe you should ask her more often,

724
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,039
and care more about her.

725
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:02,039
As a mom, maybe you should know
what she's busy with

726
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,480
and whether she's dating or not.

727
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,239
Don't just work all day.

728
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:08,840
Of course, Jiajia wouldn't dare to bother you.

729
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,440
Professor Xu, I am not here

730
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,840
to argue with you.

731
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,599
My daughter suddenly said to get married,

732
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,440
I was also very surprised.

733
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,480
And my concern

734
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,880
is no less than yours.

735
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,079
I-I'm not trying

736
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,119
to blame you.

737
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,679
Jiajia wants to have a lightning marriage.

738
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,719
As parents,

739
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:38,360
we are completely in the dark.

740
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,519
We know nothing about

741
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:40,679
who the man is

742
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,800
and how his family is.

743
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,119
Are we just going to…

744
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:47,800
Are you okay with it?
Just marry our daughter off like that?

745
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:49,960
I always feel

746
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,639
Jiajia has grown up.

747
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:53,400
She has her own opinions

748
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,800
and her own thoughts.

749
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,719
If she has already determined to get married,

750
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:59,840
that means she has already thought it through.

751
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,079
The child is not our accessory,

752
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,280
nor is she your student.

753
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,639
So, don't impose your prejudices

754
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:07,559
upon her

755
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:10,880
and doubt Jiajia's judgment.

756
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:16,000
So, what should we do now?

757
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
She has already made an appointment with me.

758
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,920
Tomorrow, I will have a good chat with her.

759
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,079
If there is any result,

760
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,199
I will tell you.

761
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:28,384
So I wasn't in again.

762
00:39:28,384 --> 00:39:29,960
Wait.

763
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,159
See the way you talked
to her boyfriend tonight,

764
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:33,360
and that sarcastic tone.

765
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,840
How could she dare to invite you

766
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,840
to talk with her?

767
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
When you see her,

768
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,920
you must criticize her right away.

769
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,119
Professor Xu, you calm down.

770
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,920
Hold back your desire to control.

771
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,039
Don't say

772
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:45,480
anything unpleasant

773
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,480
to the child.

774
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,360
You make it very difficult for her.

775
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,432
Tang Wei.

776
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,119
Jiajia is not only your daughter.

777
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,480
She is also my daughter.

778
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,519
You may think that everything I do is wrong.

779
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:01,000
You may think
I am both childish and ridiculous.

780
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,960
You may think I am good for nothing.

781
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,000
But on this matter,

782
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,519
you can't side with the outsider.

783
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:18,199
You drink less and rest early.

784
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,559
Jianming.

785
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,840
Why did you drink so much?

786
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,320
Alright, let's go back.

787
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,320
Let's go, take it slow.

788
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,079
No need.

789
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,639
- I didn't drink much.
- What? Hurry up.

790
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:32,679
No. No need to support me.

791
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:34,360
I-I can walk on my own.

792
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,599
- Alright.
- Don't support me, I can do it.

793
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:42,239
Such a grown-up
and you are still so silly when drinking.

794
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,079
All these years,

795
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:48,840
you are still the same,

796
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,079
haven't changed at all.

797
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,960
Okay, stop it. Let's go back.

798
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,000
You are nice.

799
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,280
You've always been nice.

800
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,840
Okay, okay.

801
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,079
But I'm not bad either.

802
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:10,639
Why are you always right?

803
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:17,400
No matter whatever I do or say,
I'm always wrong.

804
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:23,159
Well,

805
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:26,760
in your eyes, I'm always

806
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,199
like a child, right?

807
00:43:00,148 --> 00:43:04,980
