00:01:26,248 --> 00:01:30,749
[Begin Again]

2
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:41,783
Joe, your admirer

3
00:01:41,783 --> 00:01:42,943
has sent another bouquet.

4
00:01:42,943 --> 00:01:44,464
Do you want me to throw it away or what?

5
00:01:44,464 --> 00:01:46,223
Throw it? No, don't throw it.

6
00:01:46,223 --> 00:01:47,703
It'll be a waste. Just put it in the office.

7
00:01:47,703 --> 00:01:49,503
Okay.

8
00:01:49,503 --> 00:01:50,984
All the arrivals today are unpacked, right?

9
00:01:50,984 --> 00:01:52,503
Yes, they are.

10
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:53,863
Each item must be double-checked

11
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,464
to see whether it's our piece of work.

12
00:01:55,464 --> 00:01:56,832
In the same series, there are many items

13
00:01:56,832 --> 00:01:58,024
that look quite similar.

14
00:01:58,024 --> 00:01:59,783
But the content of each
is completely different.

15
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:02,703
- Don't get them wrong.
- Okay, I will be careful.

16
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,824
Is this spot reserved for Gish?

17
00:02:06,824 --> 00:02:08,824
Is there anything that needs to be adjusted?

18
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:11,023
Is there an amber light here?

19
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:12,344
Actually, there isn't.

20
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:14,423
But yesterday, I changed it to cold light

21
00:02:14,423 --> 00:02:15,743
as the artist requested.

22
00:02:15,743 --> 00:02:18,623
No, it must be adjusted back to amber light.

23
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:19,743
For this work of Monte,

24
00:02:19,743 --> 00:02:21,984
he wants to completely restore
the feel of natural light.

25
00:02:21,984 --> 00:02:24,623
A tiny bit off can make a big difference.

26
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:27,664
Okay, I understand.

27
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:30,023
Yvonne, you're here.

28
00:02:30,743 --> 00:02:32,104
- Almost done, right?
- Yes.

29
00:02:32,104 --> 00:02:33,824
All these things have been unpacked.

30
00:02:33,824 --> 00:02:36,423
Another batch will arrive tomorrow afternoon.

31
00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:40,384
By the way, has Marlena

32
00:02:40,384 --> 00:02:42,303
responded?

33
00:02:42,303 --> 00:02:43,303
She refused.

34
00:02:43,303 --> 00:02:45,504
She did?

35
00:02:45,504 --> 00:02:47,104
Did she say why?

36
00:02:47,104 --> 00:02:48,303
Is it because my proposal

37
00:02:48,303 --> 00:02:49,344
isn't clear enough?

38
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:50,664
She said your proposal

39
00:02:50,664 --> 00:02:51,784
has no problem,

40
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:53,504
and the idea is quite innovative.

41
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:55,504
However, she said she wants
to collaborate with someone

42
00:02:55,504 --> 00:02:58,463
who truly understands Marlena's work.

43
00:02:58,463 --> 00:02:59,784
She thinks I don't?

44
00:02:59,784 --> 00:03:02,664
Joe, I know you've invested a lot of time.

45
00:03:02,664 --> 00:03:04,824
So I spoke to the team over there.

46
00:03:04,824 --> 00:03:06,583
They will give you another chance.

47
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,583
Now you have two weeks' time.

48
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,344
Thanks a lot.

49
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:12,784
I will put more effort into it.

50
00:03:12,784 --> 00:03:14,903
I think only efforts aren't enough.

51
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,944
You need to understand

52
00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:17,303
the meaning

53
00:03:17,303 --> 00:03:18,583
behind each piece of work.

54
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,863
They have set

55
00:03:19,863 --> 00:03:21,944
the only Asian exhibition in Macau.

56
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:23,183
If you can secure it,

57
00:03:23,183 --> 00:03:24,623
I believe many artists

58
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:26,384
will want to collaborate with you.

59
00:03:26,384 --> 00:03:28,583
I will not miss this opportunity.

60
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,856
Go for it.

61
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:33,264
Where is Isabella?

62
00:03:33,264 --> 00:03:35,743
Why haven't I seen her?

63
00:03:35,743 --> 00:03:36,863
It seems that last night,

64
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:39,264
she talked with an artist until late.

65
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:41,743
I think she should be here soon.

66
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:44,264
She was drunk again?

67
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:45,504
Call her back immediately.

68
00:03:45,504 --> 00:03:48,903
- She has a VIP guest to meet.
- Okay.

69
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:52,544
Where are you?

70
00:04:08,393 --> 00:04:10,472
Isa?

71
00:04:11,616 --> 00:04:13,832
What happened?

72
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,584
Didn't you go to see Stephen last night?

73
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:21,104
Why did you drink so much by yourself?

74
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:24,224
Last night, Stephen said

75
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:26,024
he doesn't want me.

76
00:04:26,024 --> 00:04:28,664
He said we're not suitable,

77
00:04:28,664 --> 00:04:31,423
and he wants to break up with me.

78
00:04:31,943 --> 00:04:33,224
Passion and other things in this world

79
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:34,584
are the same.

80
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:37,104
They all have an expiration date.

81
00:04:37,104 --> 00:04:38,984
Once the time is up, they will spoil.

82
00:04:38,984 --> 00:04:39,984
As for people,

83
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:42,743
it's even more so.

84
00:04:42,743 --> 00:04:44,623
You should be like me next time

85
00:04:44,623 --> 00:04:46,303
and have the right expectations.

86
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:47,784
Don't take it too seriously.

87
00:04:47,784 --> 00:04:50,784
If you don't take it seriously,
it won't hurt so much.

88
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:57,623
Look how nice the weather is today.

89
00:04:57,623 --> 00:04:59,544
Come on. Get up and take a shower.

90
00:04:59,544 --> 00:05:01,904
And then change into something nice
and go to work.

91
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:03,743
You have a VIP guest in the afternoon.

92
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:05,303
Have you forgotten?

93
00:05:05,303 --> 00:05:06,943
You can always find another man.

94
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,743
But if a VIP guest gets angry,

95
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:10,024
it won't be so easy for you

96
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:11,224
to coax them back.

97
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:13,303
I can't go today.

98
00:05:13,303 --> 00:05:14,704
I need to stay here.

99
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:16,544
- Are you sure?
- I can't go.

100
00:05:16,544 --> 00:05:17,984
Are you really not going?

101
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,063
I can't go.

102
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:21,263
- Are going or not?
- I can't go.

103
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:22,623
Are you going or not?

104
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:23,904
Are you going or not?

105
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:26,104
I will go.

106
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:27,823
Hurry and get up.

107
00:05:27,823 --> 00:05:30,544
You good piggy.

108
00:05:32,584 --> 00:05:33,664
How can there be a girl

109
00:05:33,664 --> 00:05:36,144
crying so beautifully?

110
00:05:36,144 --> 00:05:38,544
Don't lie to me.

111
00:05:38,544 --> 00:05:41,224
When have I ever lied to you?

112
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:46,984
Alright, stop crying.

113
00:05:46,984 --> 00:05:49,144
I'm right here.

114
00:05:49,904 --> 00:05:51,784
Go take a shower quickly. It's time.

115
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,664
You'll be late if you don't hurry.

116
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:57,544
Get up quickly. I'll give you some nice makeup.

117
00:05:57,544 --> 00:06:00,344
That's right.

118
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:03,144
Alright, good piggy, just go.

119
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:12,160
[Episode 2]

120
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:16,464
Is this Monte's solo exhibition

121
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:18,943
or a joint exhibition?

122
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:22,303
This one is his solo exhibition.

123
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:24,704
Actually, his works

124
00:06:24,704 --> 00:06:26,743
have been selling very well.

125
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:33,464
Then

126
00:06:33,464 --> 00:06:34,544
what relation does his creation

127
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:37,904
have to his personal experience?

128
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:40,623
Actually,

129
00:06:40,623 --> 00:06:42,344
he's… Have a sip of water first.

130
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:43,984
- Take your time.
- Thank you.

131
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:45,984
Thank you.

132
00:06:48,303 --> 00:06:50,704
Actually, Monte is currently a rising star

133
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:52,664
in the French art scene.

134
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:54,423
This series of his works

135
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:56,063
received high praise at an auction

136
00:06:56,063 --> 00:06:57,423
in Paris last week

137
00:06:57,423 --> 00:06:58,943
and set his personal record.

138
00:06:58,943 --> 00:07:00,183
I've heard of him before.

139
00:07:00,183 --> 00:07:01,784
However,

140
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:02,823
this is the first time

141
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,383
I am seeing this series of his works.

142
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:06,383
I heard he saw the crushed grapes

143
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:07,664
when he previously worked

144
00:07:07,664 --> 00:07:09,183
in a vineyard

145
00:07:09,183 --> 00:07:10,584
and got the inspiration.

146
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:11,784
So he created this series,

147
00:07:11,784 --> 00:07:13,704
which are works with a grape fragrance.

148
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:15,544
We hope the visitors to the exhibition

149
00:07:15,544 --> 00:07:17,904
can all feel the kind of relaxed atmosphere

150
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,104
of the southern French countryside.

151
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:21,503
So we've specially prepared

152
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:23,303
a cup of Darjeeling fruit tea,

153
00:07:23,303 --> 00:07:24,904
which is the one you're holding now.

154
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:26,784
Taste it and see
if there's a hint of fruitiness

155
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:29,024
and the flavor of fresh grass.

156
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:39,584
Alright, I'll take this painting.

157
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,984
Okay, please wait a moment.

158
00:07:40,984 --> 00:07:43,383
We have prepared afternoon tea over there.

159
00:07:43,383 --> 00:07:45,584
No need. I want to taste this tea first.

160
00:07:45,584 --> 00:07:47,863
- We appreciate that.
- This way, please.

161
00:07:47,863 --> 00:07:49,943
That's fantastic!

162
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,104
Joe, you're really amazing.

163
00:07:53,104 --> 00:07:54,464
Look at you.

164
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:56,584
You can handle anyone.

165
00:07:56,584 --> 00:07:57,823
Not really.

166
00:07:57,823 --> 00:08:00,823
There are also mountains that I can't conquer.

167
00:08:00,823 --> 00:08:02,863
Nothing from Marlena yet?

168
00:08:02,863 --> 00:08:05,000
Nope.

169
00:08:05,743 --> 00:08:06,823
How about

170
00:08:06,823 --> 00:08:09,344
we go out and relax tonight

171
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:12,024
and call Casey to join us for some fun?

172
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,144
No.

173
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:15,144
As a person with a broken heart,

174
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:16,784
I worry the most about being alone.

175
00:08:16,784 --> 00:08:18,183
If I have to go home by myself

176
00:08:18,183 --> 00:08:20,344
and cry at home alone,

177
00:08:20,344 --> 00:08:21,943
what should I do?

178
00:08:21,943 --> 00:08:24,623
Okay, stop.

179
00:08:36,824 --> 00:08:38,263
If we walk down from here, we'll see…

180
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:40,584
Calçada da Igreja de S. Lázaro.

181
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:44,543
Thank you. I'll just take some photos

182
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,663
and send them to my colleague.

183
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:47,720
Then I'll return this to you.

184
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:50,663
Go forward.

185
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,663
You want to… Go ahead. Sorry.

186
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:55,623
There's a nice café up ahead.

187
00:08:55,623 --> 00:08:59,023
They sell Green Grapefruit Vinegar Soda.

188
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:00,543
- It's quite tasty.
- What?

189
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:02,743
Green Grapefruit Vinegar Soda.

190
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,304
A drink?

191
00:09:04,304 --> 00:09:06,704
Yes.

192
00:09:06,704 --> 00:09:08,944
- Okay, I'll note it down.
- Aren't you drinking?

193
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:10,623
I want to see the sights first. I'm in a hurry.

194
00:09:10,623 --> 00:09:12,104
I'll drink it when I have time.

195
00:09:12,104 --> 00:09:13,944
Are there

196
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:16,503
any other special places nearby?

197
00:09:16,503 --> 00:09:18,504
Albergue 1601.

198
00:09:20,263 --> 00:09:23,663
It was formerly a shelter for the poor.

199
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:27,503
Later it became a nursing home for women.

200
00:09:27,503 --> 00:09:28,503
And now it hosts

201
00:09:28,503 --> 00:09:31,304
cultural and creative events,
exhibitions, and the like.

202
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,344
This is Tai Fung Tong.

203
00:09:32,344 --> 00:09:35,104
Now it does cultural and creative projects,

204
00:09:35,104 --> 00:09:38,743
calligraphy courses, and exhibitions.

205
00:09:40,263 --> 00:09:42,623
St. Lazarus Church.

206
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,344
Is it okay to take photos here?

207
00:09:44,344 --> 00:09:46,824
Of course, you can.

208
00:09:46,824 --> 00:09:48,023
Do you need me to take photos for you?

209
00:09:48,023 --> 00:09:49,663
No need. Thank you.

210
00:09:49,663 --> 00:09:51,944
Let's go to the next place.

211
00:09:52,503 --> 00:09:55,944
- This way.
- That way? Okay.

212
00:09:56,984 --> 00:09:58,944
Aren't you thirsty?

213
00:09:58,944 --> 00:10:01,143
I'm fine. Are you thirsty?

214
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:03,240
I'm also fine.

215
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:07,743
I want to take photos
of the architecture below.

216
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,224
I'll wait for you down below.

217
00:10:09,224 --> 00:10:11,304
Okay.

218
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:17,663
- Hello.
- You're here.

219
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:20,064
See you next time. Bye.

220
00:10:24,903 --> 00:10:26,184
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

221
00:10:26,184 --> 00:10:28,143
- What's this?
- Lilau Water.

222
00:10:28,143 --> 00:10:29,503
What is Lilau Water?

223
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,184
Lilau spring water with lemon.

224
00:10:31,184 --> 00:10:33,584
It's something one must drink here.

225
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:35,184
So where are we going next?

226
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:37,104
Won't you sit down and take a break?

227
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,263
No. Where are we headed next?

228
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:41,863
Travessa da Paixão, also known as Love Lane.

229
00:10:41,863 --> 00:10:44,503
Right. Travessa da Paixão. Love Lane.

230
00:10:45,143 --> 00:10:47,176
Let's go.

231
00:10:49,263 --> 00:10:50,424
Okay.

232
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:52,863
This is Junhao's competition data
from yesterday.

233
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:54,184
Since it was an exhibition match,

234
00:10:54,184 --> 00:10:56,623
he was relatively relaxed.

235
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,104
There was a clear improvement in his lap speed.

236
00:10:58,104 --> 00:10:59,263
If that continues,

237
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:00,503
his chances of winning against Doumoto in Macau

238
00:11:00,503 --> 00:11:01,543
are pretty high.

239
00:11:01,543 --> 00:11:03,304
Although it was an exhibition match,

240
00:11:03,304 --> 00:11:04,863
I think he was too aggressive.

241
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:06,944
In a formal competition,
he would easily make mistakes like this.

242
00:11:06,944 --> 00:11:08,663
About this matter,

243
00:11:08,663 --> 00:11:10,304
you should talk to him.

244
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:12,104
Anyway, in the next few days,

245
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,280
I will have a good talk with him.

246
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:16,992
- You're here.
- Jeremy.

247
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:18,623
Elvis hasn't arrived yet?

248
00:11:18,623 --> 00:11:20,608
- I'm here.
- Elvis.

249
00:11:20,608 --> 00:11:21,664
How's it going?

250
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:23,064
Today is the first day. We do regular training.

251
00:11:23,064 --> 00:11:25,903
The main goal is to familiarize yourself
with the venue, find the rhythm,

252
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:28,263
bed in the brake discs
for the race, and have no pressure.

253
00:11:28,263 --> 00:11:29,344
Okay.

254
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:31,400
Dismount.

255
00:11:38,304 --> 00:11:43,624
[Han Junhao]

256
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:01,984
Junhao,

257
00:12:01,984 --> 00:12:04,263
let's follow the procedure
and start with two laps at low speed.

258
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:06,280
Roger that.

259
00:12:55,143 --> 00:12:56,224
Junhao,

260
00:12:56,224 --> 00:12:59,304
don't rush. Run two laps first.

261
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:17,800
Sorry.

262
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:24,503
Junhao, you didn't cool down
in that last lap, did you?

263
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:25,743
Why is the lap speed so fast?

264
00:13:25,743 --> 00:13:27,424
Pit in.

265
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:29,544
Sorry.

266
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,304
Take it off for me.

267
00:13:57,824 --> 00:13:59,663
What on earth was that?

268
00:13:59,663 --> 00:14:01,863
I have no idea what you were doing.

269
00:14:03,064 --> 00:14:05,224
Bedding the brake discs
is such a basic operation.

270
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:06,464
You should have decelerated at 300 meters.

271
00:14:06,464 --> 00:14:07,783
But you started decelerating at 100 meters.

272
00:14:07,783 --> 00:14:09,263
You didn't cool down on the sixth lap either.

273
00:14:09,263 --> 00:14:10,424
You told me you're a professional driver.

274
00:14:10,424 --> 00:14:12,023
Is this how a professional driver drives?

275
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:13,104
More than 20 of us are here with you.

276
00:14:13,104 --> 00:14:15,503
For what? For you to have fun?

277
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:18,023
Take a look for yourself.

278
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,224
- Which one is the throttle?
- This one.

279
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:22,623
- Which one is the brake?
- This one.

280
00:14:41,743 --> 00:14:43,783
Sorry about that, bro.

281
00:14:47,848 --> 00:14:49,608
I was indeed rushing it just now.

282
00:14:49,608 --> 00:14:51,208
What's the rush?

283
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,008
The race is still two weeks away.

284
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:55,047
Today is the first day of the training camp.

285
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:57,687
The aim today is for you to warm up
and regain your condition.

286
00:14:57,687 --> 00:14:58,728
So the most important thing

287
00:14:58,728 --> 00:15:00,008
for you now is to adjust your mindset.

288
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:01,728
Don't think about anything else.

289
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:03,647
We'll all go through
the bedding-in process with you.

290
00:15:03,647 --> 00:15:05,608
Don't rush.

291
00:15:05,608 --> 00:15:07,807
I'm not rushing. I'm just…

292
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:13,687
Congratulations!

293
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:19,527
Alright.

294
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:23,368
Your score and performance
will fall behind his.

295
00:15:32,407 --> 00:15:34,447
Since we're already here,

296
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:36,888
forget everything that happened.

297
00:15:36,888 --> 00:15:38,047
Consider this race

298
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:39,767
as a fresh start.

299
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:40,888
Start from the ground up

300
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:42,488
and complete each training

301
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:44,328
step by step.

302
00:15:44,328 --> 00:15:46,728
And adjust your mindset.

303
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,927
Okay?

304
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:51,943
Okay.

305
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:11,888
Mandy,

306
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,008
something is going on at my home.

307
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:14,167
I need to go back for two hours.

308
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,088
Can you keep an eye on things for me?

309
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:18,368
You're leaving now?

310
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:20,167
- It's not time yet.
- No, it isn't.

311
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:23,167
Do you want to ask for a leave from Casey?

312
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:27,167
I'll ask for a leave when she comes back.

313
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:29,223
Shaohui.

314
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:32,128
Mandy, please contact
the housing, customer service,

315
00:16:32,128 --> 00:16:33,167
and marketing departments for me.

316
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:34,488
And ask about the director's time.

317
00:16:34,488 --> 00:16:36,647
The event the day after tomorrow
will be held inside the hotel.

318
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:37,848
We'll have a meeting tomorrow

319
00:16:37,848 --> 00:16:40,208
to synchronize the usage time of all venues

320
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,088
and the precautions, okay?

321
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:43,968
Ming, go over to the gallery

322
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:45,968
and confirm the invitation list
for the banquet guests.

323
00:16:45,968 --> 00:16:47,927
Remember to check all the names.

324
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:49,407
- Shaohui.
- Casey,

325
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,968
I would like to ask for two hours off.

326
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:54,927
Why are you asking for a leave suddenly?

327
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:56,447
It's my grandpa's
80th birthday celebration tonight.

328
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:59,047
I promised to go back and accompany him.

329
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:04,328
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

330
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:07,647
Did you just find out today
that it's your grandpa's 80th birthday?

331
00:17:08,447 --> 00:17:10,647
Actually, it was originally set for noon today.

332
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:13,407
But I've been working overtime since noon.

333
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,888
As you know, my grandpa is old.

334
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:17,568
I don't want him to wait
until I get off work tonight.

335
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:18,848
I'm going back to offer him a cup of tea.

336
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:20,207
I only need two hours, Casey.

337
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:23,247
Mandy has already agreed
to watch over things for me.

338
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:25,255
Can you make an exception?

339
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:31,647
Mandy has her own work to do.

340
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,288
If you abandon your own work,

341
00:17:33,288 --> 00:17:34,768
that means your colleagues

342
00:17:34,768 --> 00:17:36,088
will have to work overtime

343
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,128
to finish your work.

344
00:17:37,128 --> 00:17:38,568
It's not that serious, right?

345
00:17:38,568 --> 00:17:40,247
Well, how about this?

346
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:42,207
I'll work overtime tonight to catch up.
Everyone else can finish up.

347
00:17:42,207 --> 00:17:44,088
The point is you should have told me earlier

348
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:45,447
so I can make arrangements.

349
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:46,888
Work comes first at all times.

350
00:17:46,888 --> 00:17:48,128
You completely disregard
other people's feelings

351
00:17:48,128 --> 00:17:50,407
and walk away.

352
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:54,088
At the end of the year, I have no choice
but to deduct from your performance.

353
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,088
Fine. Whatever.

354
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:07,128
You think work comes first

355
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,568
and family and friends
are not important to you. Okay.

356
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:11,647
But apart from work and performance,
we also have our own lives.

357
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:12,888
Not everyone is like you,

358
00:18:12,888 --> 00:18:14,967
eager to be transferred
to the headquarters in the USA every day.

359
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:16,568
Cut it out. Why bring up something else again?

360
00:18:16,568 --> 00:18:17,888
What's the matter? Everyone here knows

361
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,007
that she was transferred here
for messing up in Hong Kong.

362
00:18:20,007 --> 00:18:21,207
She's on our backs every day for performance,

363
00:18:21,207 --> 00:18:23,528
and it's all for herself.

364
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:43,751
You can go.

365
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:46,687
I approve your leave request.

366
00:19:02,848 --> 00:19:04,768
Casey, don't be mad.

367
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,007
We've all been very busy lately.

368
00:19:06,007 --> 00:19:07,727
So none of us are in the best state.

369
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:08,967
Don't take it to heart.

370
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:10,967
We all know you're not that kind of person.

371
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:13,167
It's okay.

372
00:19:13,967 --> 00:19:15,768
I'll follow up on Shaohui's work.

373
00:19:15,768 --> 00:19:17,888
Just do your own jobs well.

374
00:19:17,888 --> 00:19:19,975
Get back to work.

375
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:46,888
Let me treat you to a glass of iced lemon tea.

376
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:48,487
It's okay. I'm not hungry.

377
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,855
Well, I'm asking if you want a drink.

378
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,888
I'm not asking if you want to eat anything.

379
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:52,407
Is the Ruins of St. Paul's this way?

380
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:54,288
This way.

381
00:19:54,288 --> 00:19:56,391
The Ruins of St. Paul's are here.

382
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:00,207
This lane looks great.

383
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:03,528
[Travessa da Paixão]
This alley is called Travessa da Paixão.

384
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:06,407
This is Travessa da Paixão?

385
00:20:14,128 --> 00:20:17,528
We're here. This is it.

386
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:23,967
Do you know why it's called Travessa da Paixão?

387
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:26,687
I might have to go back and ask my parents.

388
00:20:26,687 --> 00:20:29,167
It's okay. Let's go.

389
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,568
I'll let you know if I get the answer.

390
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:35,967
Do you know why this place
is called the Ruins of St. Paul's?

391
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,088
Although there is only this wall here,

392
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:39,687
it was originally a complete church

393
00:20:39,687 --> 00:20:41,888
called St. Paul's Church.

394
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:43,247
It suffered from a fire,

395
00:20:43,247 --> 00:20:44,647
and then only this wall remained,

396
00:20:44,647 --> 00:20:46,447
standing perfectly and undaunted.

397
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:48,167
And why is it called Da San Ba in Chinese?

398
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:50,368
It's because the name St. Paul's

399
00:20:50,368 --> 00:20:53,328
in Portuguese is São Paulo.

400
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:55,768
If you pronounce it very quickly,
it'll be like…

401
00:20:57,368 --> 00:20:59,687
It sounds like Da San Ba.

402
00:20:59,687 --> 00:21:01,727
Or San Ba.

403
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,808
- I also feel it's very…
- You have a phone call.

404
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:08,447
Hello, Jin.

405
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:12,288
Thank you. I know. I'll go to pick it up later.

406
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:13,768
Okay, I'll definitely treat you to a meal.

407
00:21:13,768 --> 00:21:16,487
Rest assured. Bye-bye.

408
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:19,007
Your phone is almost fixed.

409
00:21:19,007 --> 00:21:21,048
You can pick it up later.

410
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:23,088
Thank you.

411
00:21:23,088 --> 00:21:24,888
You're welcome.

412
00:21:24,888 --> 00:21:28,768
So that's it for today?

413
00:21:28,768 --> 00:21:29,768
That's enough for today.

414
00:21:29,768 --> 00:21:32,328
No more work-related places to go.

415
00:21:32,328 --> 00:21:35,687
Just one last place to go to.

416
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:37,328
To eat.

417
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:39,167
Let's go together. My treat.

418
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:41,278
- Together?
- Let's go.

419
00:21:41,278 --> 00:21:43,568
- What to eat?
- I'll lead the way.

420
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,247
- Come with me.
- Okay.

421
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:56,447
You have good taste. This restaurant is good.

422
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:59,288
Right? I bookmarked it especially
before I came.

423
00:21:59,288 --> 00:22:00,927
- Le.
- Jun.

424
00:22:00,927 --> 00:22:03,167
Come over. Hurry.

425
00:22:03,808 --> 00:22:06,447
- Another acquaintance?
- A neighbor.

426
00:22:07,407 --> 00:22:09,328
- Have a glass of water first.
- Thanks.

427
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,568
Here. For you.

428
00:22:10,568 --> 00:22:11,608
Where's the menu?

429
00:22:11,608 --> 00:22:13,368
What would you like to eat?

430
00:22:13,368 --> 00:22:14,848
I've done my homework.

431
00:22:14,848 --> 00:22:17,888
- I'll have… the oxtail soup.
- Okay, oxtail soup.

432
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:20,967
Then, P-Portuguese chicken rice.

433
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:23,128
Portuguese chicken rice.

434
00:22:23,128 --> 00:22:26,487
- Macanese-style meatballs.
- Portuguese-style clams.

435
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:27,967
The usual, right? Just this much?

436
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:29,888
- Hurry up. Don't dawdle.
- Alright.

437
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,247
That dish you just mentioned is…

438
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:34,048
Portuguese-style clams.

439
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:35,288
Portuguese-style clams.

440
00:22:35,288 --> 00:22:37,447
Over there.

441
00:22:53,647 --> 00:22:56,687
- Right?
- Yes.

442
00:23:19,447 --> 00:23:21,687
Right, add some curry.

443
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:39,247
This soup is just too delicious.

444
00:23:40,848 --> 00:23:42,848
Do you want to order another one?

445
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:45,607
No.

446
00:24:06,888 --> 00:24:09,063
Is it tasty?

447
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:16,295
Yes.

448
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,247
I should have eaten something
like this last night.

449
00:24:22,248 --> 00:24:23,569
Last night, I…

450
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:26,169
Last night, after I arrived,

451
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:28,288
my case was rejected,

452
00:24:28,288 --> 00:24:29,728
and I didn't see anyone.

453
00:24:29,728 --> 00:24:31,048
I'm in a terrible mood.

454
00:24:31,048 --> 00:24:32,248
In that moment, I felt

455
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:33,369
I should have seen

456
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:34,409
a table of food like this,

457
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:37,048
and I should have been able
to eat food like this.

458
00:24:37,048 --> 00:24:38,809
I went to a restaurant, but it was closed.

459
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:39,889
I wanted to order takeaway.

460
00:24:39,889 --> 00:24:41,129
But I didn't know how to order takeaway here.

461
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:42,569
There wasn't…
there wasn't any takeaway I could order.

462
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:43,609
Then I thought, "Fine.

463
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:45,008
No takeaway to order. What should I do then?

464
00:24:45,008 --> 00:24:46,008
I have to go out to eat."

465
00:24:46,008 --> 00:24:47,649
So, with no other choice, I went out.

466
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:48,688
And then, I gave you

467
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:50,728
the last 200 yuan I had.

468
00:24:50,728 --> 00:24:52,208
I didn't have the money. And then my phone

469
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,768
fell into water and broke.

470
00:24:53,768 --> 00:24:57,056
I just couldn't get the food I wanted
no matter what.

471
00:24:57,056 --> 00:25:03,456
♫ The sky today remains ever so blue ♫

472
00:25:03,456 --> 00:25:07,849
♫ Just like yesterday, it's a total replica ♫

473
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:09,409
Sorry. I shouldn't complain
about all this to you.

474
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:12,409
I don't… I don't want…

475
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:15,040
I don't want to complain.

476
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,129
I don't want to complain.

477
00:25:16,129 --> 00:25:18,768
I just want to say

478
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:22,448
that sometimes I really need

479
00:25:22,448 --> 00:25:26,208
a meal as delicious…

480
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:28,561
as tonight's.

481
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:31,089
♫ Everything seems all too ordinary ♫

482
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:33,089
I just really need

483
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:34,768
to have a meal like the one tonight.

484
00:25:34,768 --> 00:25:36,609
Maybe then, I'll feel…

485
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:38,089
Everything is awful.

486
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:39,849
Work can be awful.

487
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:41,169
Life can be chaotic.

488
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:44,248
But at least this meal can comfort me.

489
00:25:44,248 --> 00:25:47,288
It makes me feel like I can do it.

490
00:25:47,288 --> 00:25:48,728
In the next second, I can do it.

491
00:25:48,728 --> 00:25:52,129
I can still solve a lot of things.

492
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:55,248
♫ Trapped in the sea, unable to find an exit ♫

493
00:25:55,248 --> 00:25:56,448
Didn't you just ask me

494
00:25:56,448 --> 00:25:58,809
if I think it's tasty?

495
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:01,089
I want to say

496
00:26:01,089 --> 00:26:03,728
this meal is very tasty. Thank you.

497
00:26:05,376 --> 00:26:11,288
♫ That can take me to the shore ♫

498
00:26:11,288 --> 00:26:13,809
From now on, as long as you're in Macau,

499
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:17,376
I can take you to have tasty food every day.

500
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:19,908
♫ But, baby ♫

501
00:26:19,908 --> 00:26:23,712
♫ Life is more than this ♫

502
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:25,792
♫ We are in this world ♫

503
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,129
♫ To feel the sunshine ♫

504
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:30,312
Well,

505
00:26:31,768 --> 00:26:33,008
why don't you take this? Just in case.

506
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,649
No, that's not what I meant.

507
00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:35,649
My card can be used now.

508
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:39,008
I have data now. I can… I can pay.

509
00:26:39,776 --> 00:26:43,391
Then tell me when you have no data.

510
00:26:43,391 --> 00:26:44,448
♫ I know you well ♫

511
00:26:44,448 --> 00:26:45,472
Okay.

512
00:26:45,472 --> 00:26:49,152
♫ You are already strong enough ♫

513
00:26:49,152 --> 00:26:51,395
♫ You're a bit nervous occasionally ♫

514
00:26:51,395 --> 00:26:55,392
♫ But luckily, you haven't surrendered ♫

515
00:26:55,392 --> 00:26:57,532
♫ Release your uneasiness ♫

516
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:02,535
♫ Feel free to have a beautiful dream ♫

517
00:27:02,535 --> 00:27:06,488
♫ You've always had wings ♫

518
00:27:06,488 --> 00:27:08,337
You walk slower than during the day.

519
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:11,048
♫ Little fish also have their own ocean ♫

520
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:13,096
Really?

521
00:27:23,448 --> 00:27:25,288
You said you'd keep me company.

522
00:27:25,288 --> 00:27:26,768
But you're sending messages now.

523
00:27:26,768 --> 00:27:29,248
Where is the company?

524
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:30,849
It's that artist in Paris.

525
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:31,929
To talk about cooperation,

526
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:34,169
I have to accommodate other people's schedules.

527
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:36,169
- It's been a long time.
- Just five more seconds.

528
00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:38,968
- Four, three.
- Okay.

529
00:27:40,488 --> 00:27:44,248
Miss, may I have the honor
of buying you a drink?

530
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:47,649
Smile a bit.

531
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:50,728
But why?

532
00:27:50,728 --> 00:27:52,089
Every time I date someone,

533
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:53,728
they end up breaking up with me.

534
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,248
Is it because I'm not good enough?

535
00:27:55,248 --> 00:27:57,248
His failure to appreciate you is his problem.

536
00:27:57,248 --> 00:27:58,528
What does it have to do with you?

537
00:27:58,528 --> 00:28:00,048
You don't know how good you are.

538
00:28:00,048 --> 00:28:02,288
You're beautiful and hot, with a great figure.

539
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:03,488
And you're cute too.

540
00:28:03,488 --> 00:28:05,448
Everyone who sees you likes you, right?

541
00:28:05,448 --> 00:28:07,129
If I were a guy, I'd want to pursue you too.

542
00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:08,849
But I really like him.

543
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:11,609
Also, I've been wanting
to say this for a long time,

544
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:13,329
- Stephen is not right for you.
- Sorry.

545
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:15,968
Casey, you got off work so late today.

546
00:28:15,968 --> 00:28:17,528
There's so much to do with the racing.

547
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:19,008
Whiskey. Thank you.

548
00:28:19,008 --> 00:28:20,008
Look.

549
00:28:20,008 --> 00:28:21,929
Even Casey is here.

550
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:23,089
But think about it.

551
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:25,048
If I send him a message now,

552
00:28:25,048 --> 00:28:26,929
- will he reply to me?
- Are you talking about Peter?

553
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:29,849
What Peter?

554
00:28:30,528 --> 00:28:32,169
It's Stephen.

555
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,488
What happened?

556
00:28:33,488 --> 00:28:35,649
She's already broken up with Peter.

557
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:38,889
Yes, a while ago.
And there have been two others ever since.

558
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:44,089
- Let's have a drink first, shall we?
- Okay. Let's drink.

559
00:28:48,849 --> 00:28:51,929
Maybe I should go and tell him,

560
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:54,329
"I miss you so much."

561
00:28:54,329 --> 00:28:56,768
He should want
to get back together with me, right?

562
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,169
If you don't even love yourself,

563
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,288
how can he respect you?

564
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,208
Moreover, in this world,

565
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,929
there are plenty of good men.

566
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:07,448
You have plenty of choices.

567
00:29:07,448 --> 00:29:09,288
Just take a look.

568
00:29:09,288 --> 00:29:10,809
Do you see?

569
00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:13,048
There are no handsome guys.

570
00:29:13,048 --> 00:29:15,528
But I really want to go to his place.

571
00:29:15,528 --> 00:29:16,649
Do you know?

572
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:17,728
The first time I saw him

573
00:29:17,728 --> 00:29:18,728
was in a garden.

574
00:29:18,728 --> 00:29:19,889
I felt

575
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:21,809
that he was my destiny.

576
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:23,208
When I looked into his eyes,

577
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:25,169
I already felt

578
00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:26,889
that he was a really good person.

579
00:29:26,889 --> 00:29:29,008
Also, I called him every night.

580
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:30,369
- Stop.
- Even at past three, he would…

581
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:32,849
Stop. Stop.

582
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:34,968
If he truly loved you that much,

583
00:29:34,968 --> 00:29:37,889
you wouldn't be sitting here so heartbroken.

584
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:41,728
No one can control love.

585
00:29:41,728 --> 00:29:43,809
You can only control yourself

586
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:45,488
and change yourself.

587
00:29:45,488 --> 00:29:48,208
It's useless even if you cry a river.

588
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:54,609
Alright.

589
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:55,728
Enough.

590
00:29:55,728 --> 00:29:57,849
Stop talking.

591
00:29:57,849 --> 00:29:59,569
I know it hurts.

592
00:29:59,569 --> 00:30:01,968
Alright, stop crying.

593
00:30:20,329 --> 00:30:22,528
Elvis.

594
00:30:22,528 --> 00:30:25,849
Elvis. Elvis. Over here.

595
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:27,912
Come. Sit here.

596
00:30:29,448 --> 00:30:30,809
Elvis, sit down.

597
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:32,079
Elvis.

598
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,129
Nice to meet you

599
00:30:34,129 --> 00:30:36,488
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

600
00:30:36,488 --> 00:30:38,089
- Cheers.
- Come on. Keep them company.

601
00:30:38,089 --> 00:30:40,136
Cheers.

602
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:43,248
Why haven't Jeremy and Zu come?

603
00:30:43,248 --> 00:30:45,409
They're adjusting the car.

604
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:48,409
You seem off today.

605
00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:50,472
You didn't sleep well?

606
00:30:55,569 --> 00:30:56,649
So, the sponsorship thing

607
00:30:56,649 --> 00:30:58,688
is real, right?

608
00:31:01,448 --> 00:31:03,688
Well, don't worry

609
00:31:03,688 --> 00:31:05,528
about the sponsorship.

610
00:31:05,528 --> 00:31:07,129
This year's competition in Macau

611
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:08,649
is very crucial

612
00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:10,208
for your annual points.

613
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:11,528
Just focus your attention

614
00:31:11,528 --> 00:31:12,528
on the competition.

615
00:31:12,528 --> 00:31:13,569
Just focus on the competition.

616
00:31:13,569 --> 00:31:15,968
I know.

617
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,728
But if they don't sponsor us,

618
00:31:17,728 --> 00:31:19,880
who will they sponsor?

619
00:31:22,528 --> 00:31:24,488
Doumoto.

620
00:31:24,488 --> 00:31:26,129
Who?

621
00:31:26,129 --> 00:31:28,288
Doumoto.

622
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:35,849
I know you have a lot on your mind.

623
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:37,089
That's why I didn't tell you.

624
00:31:37,089 --> 00:31:38,089
Now that it's been mentioned,

625
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:39,528
let's clarify it.

626
00:31:39,528 --> 00:31:41,889
So you can get over it.

627
00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:43,929
Alright, I understand.

628
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:46,528
Their jewelry brand won't renew

629
00:31:46,528 --> 00:31:47,849
the endorsement with me.

630
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:50,448
They went to him instead, right?

631
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,528
About the endorsement, the truth is,

632
00:31:53,528 --> 00:31:56,929
they're planning
to launch a lovers' collection this year.

633
00:31:56,929 --> 00:31:58,288
As you know, Doumoto

634
00:31:58,288 --> 00:31:59,968
and his wife were childhood sweethearts.

635
00:31:59,968 --> 00:32:02,369
He always sets himself up as a loving husband,

636
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:03,528
which matches their target group

637
00:32:03,528 --> 00:32:05,768
of buyers.

638
00:32:05,768 --> 00:32:07,169
As for you, we all know

639
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:09,129
you don't have any stable relationship.

640
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:11,409
So, the public image of you

641
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:12,569
is that you're a playboy.

642
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:13,768
That's what people think.

643
00:32:13,768 --> 00:32:15,208
I'm a playboy?

644
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:16,528
Just hear me out.

645
00:32:16,528 --> 00:32:17,929
How could I possibly think that way?

646
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:18,968
And in this day and age,

647
00:32:18,968 --> 00:32:20,169
a significant number of people

648
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:21,528
believe whatever public opinion says.

649
00:32:21,528 --> 00:32:25,008
I'm a racer.
Do I have to care about public sentiment?

650
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:30,649
How about this? In two weeks,

651
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:32,329
the brand is hosting a cocktail party.

652
00:32:32,329 --> 00:32:33,609
Bring a girlfriend with you.

653
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:34,688
Bring a long-term one

654
00:32:34,688 --> 00:32:35,728
that can't be replaced.

655
00:32:35,728 --> 00:32:37,409
Just announce it officially in front of them.

656
00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:40,849
It'll immediately dispel the rumors about you.

657
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:42,169
I'm trying to come up with a solution for you.

658
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:43,929
Well, here is my advice.

659
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,409
Don't pay attention to anything

660
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:46,609
that's not related to the competition.

661
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:47,688
Focus all your attention

662
00:32:47,688 --> 00:32:49,248
on the competition.

663
00:32:49,248 --> 00:32:50,288
Rest assured.

664
00:32:50,288 --> 00:32:54,169
I'm trying to figure out something.

665
00:32:55,008 --> 00:32:56,208
Come on.

666
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,889
Cheers. Let's drink.

667
00:32:57,889 --> 00:33:00,040
Cheers.

668
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:04,104
Justin, come on.

669
00:33:04,728 --> 00:33:05,968
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

670
00:33:05,968 --> 00:33:08,609
Come on. Cheers.

671
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:24,929
What are you looking at?

672
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:27,129
Nothing.

673
00:33:31,288 --> 00:33:33,688
Casey has known you for over a decade.

674
00:33:33,688 --> 00:33:35,288
She only said that because she cares about you.

675
00:33:35,288 --> 00:33:37,528
Yeah. Look. I have hundreds
of emails I haven't replied to.

676
00:33:37,528 --> 00:33:38,528
And I still came to see you.

677
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:40,169
Did you hear that? Hundreds of them.

678
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:43,072
When have you ever heard
of Casey neglecting hundreds of emails

679
00:33:43,072 --> 00:33:44,169
just to keep someone company?

680
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:45,889
You don't know how important you are.

681
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:47,369
Look at you.

682
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:49,649
I guess I'm pretty special.

683
00:33:50,649 --> 00:33:53,768
- Cheers.
- Come on. Cheers.

684
00:33:58,649 --> 00:34:00,889
Get up now.

685
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:02,968
Early to bed and late to rise. Hurry up.

686
00:34:02,968 --> 00:34:04,208
It's you again, you little rascal.

687
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,728
Are you in a rush to close the shop?

688
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,488
- The phone is fixed.
- Thank you.

689
00:34:09,488 --> 00:34:11,249
Take a look for yourself.

690
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,409
- Okay. Show it to her.
- No problem.

691
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:15,929
Alright.

692
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,289
Check it out.

693
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,329
He wants you to check it out.

694
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:22,329
- Is it fixed?
- It's all good now.

695
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:23,448
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

696
00:34:23,448 --> 00:34:24,528
How much is it? I'll scan to pay you.

697
00:34:24,528 --> 00:34:26,528
No need. You're Le's friend.

698
00:34:26,528 --> 00:34:27,528
Don't mention it.

699
00:34:27,528 --> 00:34:29,128
I must pay you.
I even requested an expedited service.

700
00:34:29,128 --> 00:34:30,409
- I definitely have to pay.
- No, you don't.

701
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:32,488
Le often invites me for meals.

702
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:34,008
It's alright. No need to be polite.

703
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:35,608
- Okay, you guys go now.
- Thank you.

704
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:37,008
- Alright. Bye.
- Let's meet up some other day.

705
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,448
- Thank you, sir.
- I'll treat you.

706
00:34:38,448 --> 00:34:39,568
Remember to tell me.

707
00:34:39,568 --> 00:34:42,008
- Remember. Lobster risotto.
- Got it.

708
00:34:42,008 --> 00:34:43,648
- Thanks.
- Okay, go ahead.

709
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,409
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye. Rest early.

710
00:34:48,528 --> 00:34:50,889
- Thank you for what you did today.
- You're welcome.

711
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,849
Can you send me a copy of the photos
we took during the day?

712
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:54,088
I'll make a backup.

713
00:34:54,088 --> 00:34:56,568
Okay.

714
00:34:56,568 --> 00:34:58,728
Sent.

715
00:35:08,249 --> 00:35:11,088
- Set you at the hotel at 8 AM tomorrow.
- Okay.

716
00:35:11,088 --> 00:35:13,689
But I'll arrange the itinerary for tomorrow.

717
00:35:13,689 --> 00:35:16,409
You just need to think
about what you want to eat.

718
00:35:17,128 --> 00:35:18,689
Okay. I'm off.

719
00:35:18,689 --> 00:35:20,744
Good night.

720
00:35:47,008 --> 00:35:49,128
Thank you.

721
00:36:12,209 --> 00:36:14,312
Let me help you.

722
00:36:24,008 --> 00:36:26,024
Thank you.

723
00:36:52,968 --> 00:36:55,128
It was going to burn your hand.

724
00:36:56,769 --> 00:36:58,769
What wish did you make?

725
00:36:59,729 --> 00:37:01,832
The wish I make?

726
00:37:05,568 --> 00:37:07,688
What a waste.

727
00:37:14,648 --> 00:37:17,689
Have you ever heard of The Little Match Girl?

728
00:37:20,128 --> 00:37:23,369
I needn't wait for New Year's or birthdays.

729
00:37:23,369 --> 00:37:27,448
Whenever I want, I can make a wish.

730
00:37:28,088 --> 00:37:30,729
For wishes that you've made in this way,

731
00:37:30,729 --> 00:37:32,329
have many come true?

732
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:34,329
It depends.

733
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:35,769
Some wishes are quite difficult.

734
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:37,448
For example,

735
00:37:37,448 --> 00:37:40,448
"I want to grow another five centimeters."

736
00:37:45,689 --> 00:37:46,889
This wish of yours

737
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:49,000
is quite interesting.

738
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:51,889
Let me throw it away for you.

739
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:53,968
Sorry that I bothered you.

740
00:37:59,448 --> 00:38:01,809
Bye.

741
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:03,880
Bye.

742
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:13,448
It's for you.

743
00:38:30,346 --> 00:38:33,064
♫ I can't think of smiling ♫

744
00:38:34,336 --> 00:38:38,792

00:38:41,017 --> 00:38:45,082

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,520
♫ But honey now it seems ♫

748
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,928
♫ That our love affair is through ♫

753
00:39:47,249 --> 00:39:49,320
Joe.

754
00:39:51,209 --> 00:39:52,648
I'm scared to death.

755
00:39:52,648 --> 00:39:54,016
Me too.

756
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,209
I'm scared to death.

757
00:39:56,209 --> 00:39:58,088
Who sent you flowers so early in the morning?

758
00:39:58,088 --> 00:39:59,088
They're not for me.

759
00:39:59,088 --> 00:40:01,008
They are for you.

760
00:40:01,008 --> 00:40:03,369
You've been broken up for months now.

761
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:04,769
Why is he still chasing after you?

762
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,608
Men have the hardest time letting go

763
00:40:06,608 --> 00:40:08,568
of what they can't have and what they've lost.

764
00:40:08,568 --> 00:40:10,240
It's normal to not give up.

765
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,568
What about you, then?

766
00:40:11,568 --> 00:40:13,369
You are completely over him?

767
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,088
I not only moved on.

768
00:40:15,088 --> 00:40:16,528
I don't want to remember anything

769
00:40:16,528 --> 00:40:17,689
associated with him.

770
00:40:17,689 --> 00:40:19,968
You know how ridiculous he was.

771
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,008
He checked my phone

772
00:40:21,008 --> 00:40:23,648
and demanded my phone never be on silent mode.

773
00:40:23,648 --> 00:40:24,849
He even threw a fit

774
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:26,048
when I talked to men.

775
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,329
And he made things up.

776
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:29,809
But do you know why?

777
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:31,488
I think on an artistic side,

778
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,409
you guys are such a good match.

779
00:40:33,409 --> 00:40:34,648
Just maybe not lovers.

780
00:40:34,648 --> 00:40:37,249
So, that's the point.

781
00:40:37,249 --> 00:40:39,289
Some people are only meant to be partners,

782
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:40,648
not lovers.

783
00:40:40,648 --> 00:40:41,929
So you need to cut your losses in time.

784
00:40:41,929 --> 00:40:44,448
Otherwise, you're the one who gets drained.

785
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:48,689
Why did you come so early today?

786
00:40:48,689 --> 00:40:49,889
I was worried

787
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:52,209
that it'd be hard for you alone.

788
00:40:52,209 --> 00:40:55,168
Look at the dark circles under your eyes.

789
00:40:55,168 --> 00:40:56,528
You hardly slept last night, did you?

790
00:40:56,528 --> 00:40:59,809
Yeah, I've been working on that proposal.

791
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:01,809
I know all of Marlena's works

792
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:03,528
from the beginning

793
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:05,008
to the end.

794
00:41:05,008 --> 00:41:06,289
Why do they always think

795
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:07,608
that I don't know her well?

796
00:41:07,608 --> 00:41:09,729
I know what you need.

797
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,088
Coffee.

798
00:41:12,088 --> 00:41:14,648
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

799
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:18,128
I don't think looking at these materials

800
00:41:18,128 --> 00:41:19,968
every day will help.

801
00:41:19,968 --> 00:41:21,409
As someone who's into the arts,

802
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:23,088
you've become like an academic.

803
00:41:23,088 --> 00:41:25,608
What you need is some inspiration.

804
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,008
You should hang out with me

805
00:41:28,008 --> 00:41:29,488
and get some fresh air.

806
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:31,249
You need to relax a bit

807
00:41:31,249 --> 00:41:32,729
to let it back in.

808
00:41:32,729 --> 00:41:34,048
I get it.

809
00:41:34,048 --> 00:41:36,329
You want me to join you for a drink, don't you?

810
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:37,448
Yes.

811
00:41:37,448 --> 00:41:39,289
You know me too well.

812
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,448
Do you know?

813
00:41:40,448 --> 00:41:41,608
There's a saying that goes

814
00:41:41,608 --> 00:41:43,769
that if you have a problem,

815
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:44,769
having a drink

816
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:45,809
can solve it.

817
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:48,769
And if that's not enough, drink for two nights.

818
00:41:48,769 --> 00:41:49,809
I can't believe you.

819
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:51,289
You are such a drunkard.

820
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:54,528
Come and hang out with me, okay?

821
00:41:54,528 --> 00:41:56,048
Go to work.

822
00:41:56,048 --> 00:41:57,809
Fine. I'm off.

823
00:41:57,809 --> 00:41:59,889
Go ahead.

824
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:09,128
You didn't come back yesterday.

825
00:42:09,128 --> 00:42:11,168
Did you take a girl home?

826
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,608
What happened afterwards? Any development?

827
00:42:14,608 --> 00:42:16,409
Any further contact?

828
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,209
We talked a bit, and then she left.

829
00:42:18,209 --> 00:42:19,209
No?

830
00:42:19,209 --> 00:42:21,448
You didn't get any contact information?

831
00:42:22,329 --> 00:42:24,488
What about her phone number?

832
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:27,809
No.

833
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:29,928
Really?

834
00:42:30,488 --> 00:42:32,608
Then what was the point in following her out?

835
00:42:32,608 --> 00:42:35,289
What about the party in two weeks?

836
00:42:36,689 --> 00:42:38,329
It's not often you find someone you like.

837
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:39,689
You can have the best of both worlds.

838
00:42:39,689 --> 00:42:41,488
Win her over within two weeks

839
00:42:41,488 --> 00:42:44,008
and take her to the party.

840
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:48,249
Let's go back to that bar tonight.

841
00:42:48,249 --> 00:42:49,369
Macau is a small place.

842
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:51,769
You might run into her again.

843
00:42:55,929 --> 00:42:57,960
A chance encounter.
