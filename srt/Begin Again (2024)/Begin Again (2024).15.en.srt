<i>[Begin Again]</i>

2
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,079
Is it done, Jian?

3
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,560
Mr. Qiang, I kept two

4
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,840
nice pig trotter bones for you.

5
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,719
It's perfect for the soup.
See what else you want.

6
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:40,200
- A half portion of pork cartilage.
- Okay, half a portion of pork cartilage.

7
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,760
I heard you're hosting guests today.

8
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,439
Who told you that?

9
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,200
Who are the guests?

10
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,239
Today's guests

11
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,719
could be our future in-laws.

12
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,959
Le is getting married?

13
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,799
Hao.

14
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,799
He's preparing to get married
without telling us in advance.

15
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,719
Now the bride's parents are already here.

16
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,480
With such short notice,
we don't know how to receive them.

17
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,640
Look at you,

18
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,959
complaining,

19
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,159
yet feeling so happy.

20
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,159
When will you hold the wedding?

21
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,680
Remember to let us know.

22
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,840
No problem.

23
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,840
But whether this matter can succeed,

24
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,240
depends on his performance tonight.

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,344
Let's go.

26
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,159
What's wrong? Did I say anything wrong?

27
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,560
I know.

28
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,800
Last time Jiajia came,

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,039
I didn't perform well.

30
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,280
It won't happen this time.

31
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:31,304
<i>[Episode 15]</i>

32
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,360
Shrimp shouldn't be cooked too long.

33
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,479
I know, will turn off the heat in a bit.

34
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,400
Have you prepared the hot pepper soy sauce?

35
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,240
- I'm back.
- They're here.

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,719
Come on.

37
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,039
Over here.

38
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,319
Over here.

39
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,639
Welcome.

40
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,639
Come on.

41
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,159
Please come in.

42
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,280
Welcome.

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,120
I am Jiajia's mom, Tang Wei.

44
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,240
You are Jiajia's dad.

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,400
How should I address you?

46
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,039
If you don't mind, call me Mr. Xu.

47
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,159
Mr. Xu?

48
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,719
I am also Mr. Xu.

49
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,120
Xu, you're Mr. Xu.

50
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,879
- Mr…
- Xu.

51
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,000
Xu.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,560
It's close.

53
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,080
Hello, uncle and aunt.

54
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,199
Hello.

55
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,368
No way. We should call you in-laws.

56
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:19,456
- Don't, don't.
- Right.

57
00:03:19,456 --> 00:03:22,080
It's still too early to call so.

58
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,319
Call us whatever you want.

59
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,120
- It's okay.
- Okay.

60
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,439
- Come on.
- Okay.

61
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,319
- Please sit.
- Have a seat.

62
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,919
Okay.

63
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,919
Come on.

64
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,000
Sorry for the long wait.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,400
This is the second child?

66
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,479
Junle.

67
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,719
Today's meal

68
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,919
was prepared by our youngest son.

69
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,479
The last time Jiajia came to eat,

70
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,319
she has tried Qiang's cooking skills.

71
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,560
This time our youngest son, Junle,
is in charge of the cooking.

72
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,479
We can eat and chat more.

73
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,520
In your family,

74
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,599
men are in charge of cooking.

75
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,280
Yes.

76
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,360
What Qiang likes the most

77
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,759
is cooking.

78
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,439
So, after we got married,

79
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,879
I really had no chance to cook anymore.

80
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,000
That's so fortunate, really.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,280
- Eat up.
- Come on.

82
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,919
I've got a soup still cooking.
You guys go ahead and eat.

83
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,639
- Don't, come join us.
- Very soon.

84
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,319
There's a slow-cooked soup.

85
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,360
Come on, let's not wait for him.

86
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,080
If the food gets cold, it won't taste right.

87
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,280
We must eat it while it's hot.

88
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,639
What do you mean?

89
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,480
He means if the dishes get cold,

90
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,600
and won't taste good.

91
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,759
Dishes.

92
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,160
Right.

93
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,519
My Mandarin is okay, right?

94
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,839
His Mandarin is wonderful.

95
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,639
Come on.

96
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,160
Well, then I'll start eating.

97
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,200
Okay.

98
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,879
- Jiajia's mom, try this cucumber.
- Thank you.

99
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,120
Try this cucumber.

100
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,360
Try this.

101
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
We'll help ourselves.

102
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,639
It's still very green.

103
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,879
Is it okay?

104
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,120
Excellent. It not just looks good,

105
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,279
but also tastes good.

106
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,720
It is perfect.

107
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,399
Amazing.

108
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,399
The two of you are really blessed.

109
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,560
Look at your girl, so pretty and adorable.

110
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,279
And both of your sons have their strengths
and are so excellent.

111
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,759
You are really blessed.

112
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:09,000
Jiajia is also very outstanding.

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,839
Look at her, a girl,

114
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:13,000
running around the whole world guiding tours.

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,040
I really envy this kind of lifestyle.

116
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,439
Right, Jiajia asked me to entrust a friend

117
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,759
to bring some Tibetan medicine from Tibet.

118
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,759
It's specifically

119
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,920
for back and lumbar pain.

120
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,160
It's for Mr. Qiang. Remember to get it later.

121
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,600
Jiajia, you did it?

122
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,319
How did you know my back hurts?

123
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:34,839
Hao told me this.

124
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,639
He said when you first opened the restaurant,

125
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,720
you did all the restocking
and moving of goods by yourself,

126
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,560
and you accidentally strained your back,

127
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,759
and didn't have time to treat it.

128
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,519
Over time, it's become a chronic problem.

129
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,759
Actually, so as my mom.

130
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,079
- She always sits for long periods.
- Yes.

131
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,600
This medicine is quite effective for her.

132
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,120
So, I want you to try it as well.

133
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:58,560
Thank you, Jiajia. You're so considerate.

134
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,279
Qiang, look.

135
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,120
How considerate Jiajia is.

136
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,639
A daughter is truly a treasure.

137
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,720
So considerate.

138
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,920
Are you okay, Le?

139
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,040
I'm fine.

140
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,040
Come and eat, don't be busy.

141
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,240
Be careful.

142
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,600
So careless.

143
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,360
Sorry, I'm under a lot of pressure.
I'm being nervous.

144
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,560
Did you put sliced sea whelks in it?

145
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,279
- Forgot it.
- What about southern and northern apricots?

146
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,360
Yes.

147
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,839
It's okay then.

148
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,279
It's not a big deal.

149
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,240
The sea whelks are used
to enhance the flavor of the soup.

150
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,399
Without them, it won't taste good.

151
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,560
- Even without, it's still tasty.
- Mom.

152
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,040
Speak Mandarin.

153
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,839
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

154
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,519
We forgot for a moment,

155
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,560
and said

156
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,480
Cantonese that you don't understand.

157
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,720
- Sorry.
- We can't understand.

158
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,439
But don't worry.

159
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,480
When Jiajia is here,

160
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,360
when she is here, we will definitely not say

161
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,560
something she doesn't understand.

162
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,399
Mandarin and Cantonese

163
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,720
are both Chinese.

164
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,800
- Right, you're so right.
- Yes.

165
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,120
We don't understand,

166
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,680
but we can occasionally
feel the ancient charm of the language.

167
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,216
Do you understand what they're saying?

168
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:10,240
A little bit.

169
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Professor Xu, a toast to you.

170
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,600
A little bit, then how

171
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,759
do you communicate with them?

172
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,399
Do you want Hao to translate everything?

173
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,720
It's okay. I'll understand it gradually.

174
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,560
I'm smart, no problem.

175
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,519
Since we are all here,
let's raise our glasses to celebrate.

176
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,279
- Okay.
- Welcome.

177
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,439
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

178
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,680
Thank you all for coming today.

179
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,360
Hope you could understand our family

180
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,560
more

181
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,480
and trust Hao more.

182
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,672
One.

183
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,680
- Two.
- Two.

184
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,519
Le, you've worked hard today.

185
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,519
Every dish you made

186
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,160
was especially delicious.

187
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,279
You flatter me. My dad taught me well.

188
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,519
Right.

189
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,680
Men in your family cook

190
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,199
really well.

191
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,279
Hao.

192
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,639
You cook well too, right?

193
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:13,720
- I…
- Yes.

194
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,879
- Yes.
- Yes.

195
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,079
If Jiajia says it's delicious,
then it must be good.

196
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,000
- Of course, I can't compare to my dad.
- Right.

197
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,319
Right, he can't compare.

198
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:33,360
Zhen.

199
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,879
Didn't you say you had a gift

200
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,639
for Jiajia?

201
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,159
Right, I forgot it.

202
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,840
She's getting old and forgetful.

203
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,200
- Come on, eat up.
- Yes.

204
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,440
Don't be shy.

205
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,039
Jiajia, take a look.

206
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:06,200
Well, this is too precious.

207
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Jiajia, although I

208
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,000
don't know you well,

209
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,879
I really like you.

210
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,240
I know

211
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,480
you and Hao have made the decision
to get married

212
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,240
after careful consideration.

213
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,519
Both of us are very supportive.

214
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,320
This ring is our statement of support.

215
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,360
It looks a bit old.

216
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
But it's something

217
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,399
my mother-in-law passed on to me

218
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,559
when I got married.

219
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:34,879
Today, I want to pass it on to you.

220
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,639
Mr. Qiang.

221
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,639
Zhen.

222
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,799
Actually, today it's

223
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:50,159
- the first time we are meeting.
- Yes.

224
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,159
Before we came to Macau,

225
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,519
we had no idea that the two of them

226
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,759
had made such a big

227
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:55,759
decision.

228
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,039
Actually, her dad and I

229
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,519
were quite…

230
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,759
- Caught off guard.
- Exactly.

231
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,720
We are caught off guard.

232
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,840
But today,

233
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,039
you invited us

234
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,440
to your house,

235
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,840
and we can feel

236
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,440
the great family atmosphere here.

237
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,559
And you've put so much effort

238
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,159
into preparing such a big table of dishes.

239
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:18,000
We're very touched.

240
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,279
Well, Jiajia,

241
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,279
since the parents of Hao

242
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,799
are that sincere,

243
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,360
then you should

244
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,559
accept it.

245
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,159
- Okay.
- Okay.

246
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,320
- Let's…
- Come on.

247
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,679
- Make a toast.
- Make a toast.

248
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,679
For Jiajia and Hao.

249
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,320
Wish you good health.

250
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,360
Be happy.

251
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,399
Wish you good health.

252
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,039
Thank you.

253
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,200
Have a drink.

254
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,720
<i>We've checked the photos.</i>

255
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,799
<i>The frame has already been completely deformed.</i>

256
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,240
<i>According to the assessment,</i>

257
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,320
<i>there is only a twenty percent chance.</i>

258
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,720
<i>And you're less than 18 hours away</i>

259
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,279
<i>from the race.</i>

260
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,679
<i>The parts are incomplete.</i>

261
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:18,039
<i>So, it's no longer about if this car</i>

262
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:20,200
<i>can still race or not,</i>

263
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,559
<i>but this car is basically already scrapped.</i>

264
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,759
<i>Our suggestion is…</i>

265
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,759
<i>Don't waste your time.</i>

266
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,519
<i>Just give up the race this time.</i>

267
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,240
Alright, I know. That's it.

268
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,320
Do we fix it

269
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,368
or not?

270
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,960
Yes.

271
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,559
Fix it.

272
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,679
We have put in so much effort.

273
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:21,639
Even if there is only a twenty percent chance,
we'll still fix it.

274
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,679
Dismantle it.

275
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,704
Come on.

276
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,496
What are you thinking about?

277
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,200
Nothing.

278
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,120
Going to Hao's house today,

279
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,039
what do you think?

280
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:06,759
I think

281
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:08,559
it's quite good.

282
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:11,399
Once I met his parents,

283
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,759
I felt at ease.

284
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,720
What? Do you think it's not good?

285
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,879
No, no way.

286
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,600
Of course not.

287
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,799
Hao and his family

288
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:26,559
are really very nice.

289
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:29,039
I just think

290
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,559
the environment they grew up in was different.

291
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:35,919
They would speak Cantonese by accident,

292
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,120
but Jiajia

293
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,759
doesn't understand it at all.

294
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,279
Indeed.

295
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,480
I worry that over time,

296
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,399
Jiajia will feel

297
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,279
like an outsider.

298
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:59,120
You're right to worry about it.

299
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,320
Maybe

300
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,720
we should

301
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,000
interact with them more these few days.

302
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,200
Okay.

303
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,504
What do you think?

304
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,799
Jiajia is indeed a nice girl.

305
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,559
And her parents are quite well.

306
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,639
Jiajia is really nice, and I like her.

307
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,480
She is tall, beautiful,

308
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,440
and kind.

309
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,159
However,

310
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:33,240
her mom…

311
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,519
Her mom is really worried.

312
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:37,919
But it's not surprising.

313
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,240
If my daughter suddenly

314
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,639
were to marry off to a distant place,

315
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,600
I wouldn't agree either.

316
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,704
That's true.

317
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,639
Maybe we ask her parents out tomorrow

318
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,120
to have a talk.

319
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,279
Their daughter is marrying far off to our son.

320
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:56,720
We must reassure them.

321
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,240
Okay.

322
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,919
Perhaps it's better to talk separately.

323
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,039
It's hard to talk things over
with too many people.

324
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,656
Okay.

325
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,759
By the way,

326
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,360
a few days ago, Le came to me,

327
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,960
saying to learn cooking from me.

328
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:24,120
He told you so?

329
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,240
Yes.

330
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,559
He said that although the restaurant has chefs,

331
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,879
he doesn't need to do much cooking.

332
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,399
However,

333
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,559
he also wants to learn cooking from me.

334
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,639
About tonight's meal,

335
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,879
what do you think?

336
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,600
Not bad.

337
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Then you teach him patiently.

338
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,480
Tell him that apart from focusing on cooking,

339
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,559
he also needs to understand

340
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,159
the story behind every dish.

341
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:52,039
If Le is really that thoughtful,

342
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,600
our retirement plan

343
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,080
can be realized.

344
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,192
Really?

345
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,919
Then when I retire,

346
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,759
I can go travel around

347
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,080
with you

348
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,039
and enjoy the pleasures of life.

349
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,240
Exactly. Think about it.

350
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,960
Back when we were young,
we were always traveling

351
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,320
around

352
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,039
and having delicious food.

353
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,159
When we came back,

354
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:16,360
you'd study, integrate, and improve it,

355
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,480
then we had so many specialty dishes.

356
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,000
Enough.

357
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,080
It's been decades.

358
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,240
While

359
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,879
we can still handle it,

360
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:31,879
I want to go enjoy life.

361
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,080
Okay, let me think about it.

362
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,159
The first stop we'll go to

363
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:39,440
Africa, to see the great animal migration.

364
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,840
At the end of the year, we'll go to

365
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,360
Xinjiang to see the snow.

366
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,279
Then we can go

367
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,840
- see the aurora. I don't want to see pictures.
- Okay.

368
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,919
- I want to see it live.
- Okay.

369
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,279
You always say so.

370
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,399
Are you fooling me?

371
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:57,416
No.

372
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,640
You said you had something to tell me.

373
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,880
What is it?

374
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,279
If I tell you this,

375
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:27,119
it might be a bit awkward.

376
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,400
Awkward? You'd be awkward?

377
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,000
Or me?

378
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,960
Wait, what…

379
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,599
What is it about?

380
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,200
It's probably about your…

381
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
No.

382
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,519
To be precise, it should be about

383
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,720
our future.

384
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,712
Tang Wei.

385
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,720
Are you serious?

386
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,160
Of course.

387
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,480
I've been thinking about this for a long time.

388
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,000
I think, for you and for me,

389
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,839
- it's a good thing.
- Wait, I…

390
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,680
I suggest you not to tell me for now.

391
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,039
I haven't said it yet.

392
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,920
No, you know this…

393
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,200
This is not a small deal.

394
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,680
You suddenly bring it up like this,

395
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
how do you expect me to answer you?

396
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,880
I haven't said anything, how would you know
if it's a big deal or a small one?

397
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,559
Wait, listen to me.

398
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,839
Just don't say it, okay?

399
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,160
It's not good for any of us.

400
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,440
Xu Jianming, do you want
to hear what I want to say?

401
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,160
You… Calm down.

402
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,079
I am very calm, Xu Jianming.
It's you who need to calm down.

403
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,160
- You, calm down.
- Wait.

404
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,240
- I'm very calm.
- Me too.

405
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,839
- Tang Wei, listen to me.
- Go ahead.

406
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,599
Swallow what you wanted to say.

407
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,759
I didn't say it, how can I swallow it?

408
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,920
Go back and take a cold shower.

409
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,720
- I'll take a shower when I get back.
- To cool yourself down.

410
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,079
If you really want to talk,

411
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,319
you can find Jiajia, or you can…

412
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,599
go and talk to Li Meng.

413
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,079
I don't want to talk to Jiajia or Li Meng.
I can't chat with them.

414
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,440
I do linger on you.

415
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,720
But a remarriage is impossible.

416
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,680
What did you just say?

417
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,440
Wait, you…

418
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,559
Wait, you…

419
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:06,720
I didn't hear you clearly

420
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,400
what you said. Repeat it.

421
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,240
I just wanted to invite you
to participate in that

422
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,319
entertainment company's variety show.

423
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,960
That's what you wanted to tell me?

424
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,079
Then what did you think

425
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,720
I wanted to tell you?

426
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:25,000
I-I know that entertainment company

427
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,440
has called you,

428
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,240
but you turned them down.

429
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,480
Xu Jianming, you don't have
to answer me right now.

430
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,559
Just think about it.

431
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,519
These past few days,

432
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:52,440
I think Li Meng has been acting a bit strange.

433
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,200
Are you guys okay?

434
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:58,359
Who? Li Meng?

435
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:00,000
Why are you mentioning her suddenly?

436
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Li… Wait, right.

437
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,559
She indeed acts quite strange.

438
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:07,000
She's been indifferent to me these days.

439
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,359
Xu Jianming.

440
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,519
You haven't changed all these years.

441
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,720
You focused solely on academia,

442
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,400
yet not understanding women at all.

443
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,000
What do you mean?

444
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,079
What I mean is

445
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,519
you should treat Li Meng nicely.

446
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,359
- I…
- Look at you.

447
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,000
Your beard has gone white,

448
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,079
how can you still act like

449
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,880
a child, Xu Jianming?

450
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
What do you mean?

451
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Wait, haven't I treated Li Meng nicely?

452
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,119
Haven't I treated her nicely?

453
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:31,359
Whether a woman is happy or not,

454
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,480
you can tell

455
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,880
by her smile.

456
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
She smiles every day.

457
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,400
That's because she's pleasing you.

458
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,240
Pleasing me? You…

459
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,720
Look at your attitude towards Li Meng.

460
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,160
You are being so domineering.

461
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,440
Li Meng is patient. She indulges you

462
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,359
and has been taking care of you.

463
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:52,240
If it were me, I…

464
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,599
It has nothing to do with me.

465
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,480
I remember when Li Meng

466
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,720
married you,

467
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,480
she was only about Jiajia's current age, right?

468
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,960
Back then,

469
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,799
she insisted on marrying you.

470
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,119
Xu Jianming.

471
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,839
You were so lucky

472
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,880
to marry Li Meng.

473
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:25,680
So, what should I do now?

474
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,744
I…

475
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,160
You're asking me

476
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,799
how to please your wife?

477
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,864
No…

478
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,000
Hold her close.

479
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,064
Give her a hug.

480
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,680
Go do

481
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,240
whatever she loves to.

482
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,240
If this move won't work,

483
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,599
then change another one.

484
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,480
There's always a move

485
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,680
she will like it.

486
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,000
Keeping her in your heart,

487
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,240
and she can sense it.

488
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,240
Women

489
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,256
are very sensitive.

490
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,075
<i>♫ Grandfather's watch ♫</i>

491
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,361
<i>♫ Still keeps the time ♫</i>

492
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:22,280
<i>♫ Can't feel the breeze ♫</i>

493
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,320
<i>♫ See the trees that it shook ♫</i>

494
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:44,920
Your dad praised you

495
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,480
that you cooked the meal very well.

496
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,568
Thanks, Dad.

497
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,799
Why are you drinking?

498
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:04,279
Just keeping you company.

499
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,279
Cooking is all about thoughts.

500
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:14,319
Don't be that stressful.

501
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,200
- Understand?
- Yes.

502
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,519
Anyway, if I need help,

503
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:20,920
I will ask you.

504
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,680
And your dad.

505
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,839
Okay.

506
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,119
Even if I will get scolded.

507
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:36,799
Did the shooting go smoothly?

508
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,640
Yes.

509
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,599
- Is that all?
- That's all. What else?

510
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,680
So, you and Mai

511
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,359
are not going smoothly.

512
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,279
There's nothing between us.

513
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:54,960
I don't know.

514
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,440
I've made so many dishes today, I'm so tired.

515
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,240
I'm going to take a shower and go to sleep.

516
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,960
Would you like to hear what I think?

517
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,680
I've grown up.

518
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,079
No need.

519
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,400
But I'm so tired.

520
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,799
I want to sleep.

521
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,039
Why hit me?

522
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:14,400
In this age, hitting your son
can land you in jail.

523
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,640
Do you know?

524
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,880
You're my son.

525
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,839
If you are upset,

526
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,520
tell me.

527
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,400
Nothing, I just feel a bit sorry for her.

528
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,880
Her life seems to be all about work.

529
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,519
I hope she can do whatever she enjoys.

530
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:43,640
Sing if she wants to.

531
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,240
Just be carefree

532
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,400
and enjoy life.

533
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,039
No matter what I say to her,

534
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,319
it seems she doesn't accept it.

535
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,440
It's like talking to a wall,

536
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,559
casting pearls before swine.

537
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:02,079
I've tried my best.

538
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,519
Do you realize, the two of you,

539
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,240
have been growing up and living your lives

540
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,079
in different places?

541
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:12,039
So the way you two think is different.

542
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:14,839
Even if what you say is right,

543
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:18,240
I think she still needs time
to gradually accept it.

544
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,839
You have to understand

545
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,839
that change is really not easy.

546
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:24,960
Just look at your dad.

547
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,759
So I think you should

548
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,640
be more understanding of Mai,

549
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,400
and give her more space.

550
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:42,279
My son.

551
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,400
Timing

552
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,079
is crucial in love.

553
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:50,359
Too early or too late won't work.

554
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,440
Perhaps,

555
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,880
the timing between you two hasn't arrived.

556
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,440
Don't force it.

557
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,920
Take it slow and be more patient.

558
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:11,592
Okay.

559
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,319
It's alright.

560
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,799
Anyway,

561
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,880
she's going back.

562
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,880
That soon?

563
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,160
How about this?

564
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,759
Invite her to your brother's wedding.

565
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:30,759
No way.

566
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:33,079
If you don't invite her, I will.

567
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:37,279
- That's decided then.
- What?

568
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,440
Don't expect anything.

569
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,400
If it were a farewell,

570
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,880
you should properly

571
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
say goodbye to her.

572
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,559
When?

573
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,000
T-Tomorrow morning.

574
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,960
No way.

575
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,079
Alright, I'm hanging up.

576
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,440
Do you have a welding machine?

577
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,488
Right now.

578
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,599
Where are you delivering it to?

579
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:20,640
To Zhuhai?

580
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,039
I'm in Macau.

581
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,440
- Who has one?
- I am Charles.

582
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,359
I need to ask you for a favor.

583
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:29,960
Please help me, okay?

584
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,720
I'm currently missing
a suspension and the half shaft.

585
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,119
I know it's quite late now.

586
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:37,880
But I'm out of options.

587
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,039
Last time you were missing parts,

588
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,519
and I helped you, right?

589
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,319
Right, I helped you.
Now it's your turn to help me.

590
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:46,359
We help each other out.

591
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,680
I know, but it's too late for tomorrow morning.

592
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,559
I need it tonight.

593
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,680
Tonight, help me find it.

594
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,519
You know so many parts suppliers,
ask around for me.

595
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,319
Alright?

596
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,480
After the race tomorrow, I'll treat you.

597
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,680
I'll treat you drinks, okay?

598
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,680
Sure, no problem.

599
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,240
Whatever you say, I'm okay.

600
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,319
Just help me find it, okay?

601
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:13,319
Help me find the suspension and the half shaft.

602
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,400
No problem.

603
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,799
I'll pay.

604
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,920
Raise the price? Sure, no problem.

605
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,839
Just help me find it.

606
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,200
I need it urgently.

607
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,200
Otherwise, I wouldn't call you.

608
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,839
- It's the middle of the night.
- it's all broken.

609
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:26,720
I know it's difficult.

610
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,480
It's a bit damaged, but can still be repaired.

611
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:35,720
It's usable, just stick it on.

612
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,319
Stick it with tape.

613
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:39,119
I told you to go back and rest.
Why are you still here?

614
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,880
I thought you had left already.

615
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,200
How can I go back
with the car in this condition?

616
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,039
What does it have to do with you?

617
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,160
Can you fix it or what?

618
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,839
You come change the suspension.
You do the welding.

619
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:48,720
You change the tire. And I'll drive tomorrow.

620
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,519
What do you mean? I will be the one driving.

621
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:52,480
Then why are you being here?

622
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,960
- How can I sleep?
- What are we doing?

623
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,640
- We are fixing the car.
- What are you saying?

624
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,920
- Of course, I'll drive.
- Your job is to go back and have a good rest.

625
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:07,039
- Are you okay?
- Okay.

626
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,319
Why is Elvis still here?

627
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:11,160
Shouldn't he have gone back to rest by now?

628
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,799
I told him to, but he refused.

629
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,599
Everyone is talking about Elvis

630
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,079
online right now,

631
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:18,720
saying he can't race tomorrow.

632
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,079
Don't let him check the news.

633
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,759
Get him back to the hotel to sleep.

634
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,880
The longer he stays here,
the worse his mentality gets.

635
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
Okay, I got it. Thanks.

636
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,160
I'll hand out water.

637
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,519
Thanks.

638
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:30,240
Zu, here, have some water.

639
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,359
Elvis.

640
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,599
Here, come over to have some water.

641
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,664
Are you okay?

642
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,992
Still fixing it.

643
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:40,559
Keep it up.

644
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,200
We're leaving, just next door.

645
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,480
If you need anything, just tell us.

646
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,920
- Alright.
- See you tomorrow, okay?

647
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,119
See you tomorrow, okay?

648
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,039
Thank you.

649
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,240
Thanks, take care.

650
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,880
Go back.

651
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,496
Can our car

652
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:35,400
be fixed by tomorrow?

653
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,488
Yes.

Any new radiator?

691
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,639
Get one for me.

692
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,760
Hello, still fixing it.

693
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,159
Got a second-hand one.

694
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,559
Not sure if it works.

695
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:02,960
Just use it for now.

696
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,360
I'm still asking to see if there's a new one.

How's the radiator?

701
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,440
The old parts are leaking a bit.

702
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,639
The new one is on the way.

703
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:19,800
Just weld it on for now.
The new one might not arrive in time.

Hurry up.

705
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,800
Why are you here?

706
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,824
I want to see you.

707
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,039
But you don't want to hear me explain.

719
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,880
- you can definitely do it?
- I might fail you.

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,480

00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:39,440
See, right now, no one knows

723
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,639
whether it can be fixed or not.

724
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:42,400
What are you scared of?

725
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,280
So what if you lose?

726
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,199
I'm not scared of losing at all.

727
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:47,800

00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,896

00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:54,440

730
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,719
Almost, it can barely work.

731
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:59,840
They've been here 17 hours since last night.

I'm with you.

740
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:31,280
Let's face it together.

741
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,320
Okay?

742
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,480
It's fixed.

743
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:52,559
- How is it now?
- Almost ready. It could race.

744
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:53,599
Let's do the final check.

745
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,599
- Almost done.
- It's your turn now.

746
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,039
Go, push the car.

747
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:59,000
Come on, wrap it up.

748
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,119
Make sure everything's checked.

749
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:01,360
If there's no problem, install it.

750
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,920
Get ready.

751
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,000
The hood doesn't fit.

752
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,199
Use the strong glue.

753
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:08,480
The suspension can't be adjusted,
and there's a problem with the steering gear.

754
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,719
What's wrong with the steering gear?

755
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:12,119
Not sure, we need
to take it all apart to check.

756
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,159
Then hurry up.

757
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,320
There's no time.

758
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,760
It's borrowed, not brand new.

759
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,880
Trust me.

760
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,039
Everyone.

761
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:22,119
You've all been up for over thirty hours.

762
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:23,840
I know it's not easy.

763
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,239
There's not enough time.

764
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:27,159
You've done your best.

765
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,239
If this car is scrapped,

766
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,280
I'll accept it.

767
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,304
Come on.

768
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:51,079
One, two, three.

769
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,079
Go for it!

770
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,280
- Go for it!
- Push the car.

771
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,480
Come on.

772
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,488
Hurry.

773
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,416
Go for it!

774
00:39:16,852 --> 00:39:19,084
<i>[1 Min]</i>

775
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:20,360
<i>Welcome to the Macau Grand Prix</i>

776
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,559
<i>GT Cup</i>

777
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:23,559
<i>finals.</i>

778
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:24,599
<i>The audience here today</i>

779
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,360
<i>is really excited.</i>

780
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,519
<i>The No. 33 car
starting from the pole position today</i>

781
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:30,400
<i>is the Japanese racer Doumoto.</i>

782
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,880
<i>Next to him, the No. 95 car</i>

783
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,960
<i>is his old rival,</i>

784
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,639
<i>our Chinese racer, Han Junhao.</i>

785
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:38,679
<i>I wonder if he can bring us miracles today.</i>

786
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:39,760
<i>Let's look forward to it.</i>

787
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,400
<i>Cheering for Han Junhao.</i>

788
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,480
<i>This upcoming</i>

789
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,599
<i>Macau Grand Prix GT Cup race</i>

790
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,039
<i>is about to start.</i>

791
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:46,559
<i>I wonder what exciting battles</i>

792
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:48,960
<i>these two will bring us today.</i>

793
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,360
<i>Let us wait and see.</i>

794
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:53,639
<i>The race starts after the lights out.</i>

795
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:55,199
<i>Racers are rushing out.</i>

796
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:57,039
<i>It's clear that Doumoto
wanted to take the middle line,</i>

797
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:59,079
<i>but thus lost the initiative.</i>

798
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,440
<i>Han Junhao did not maintain</i>

799
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,639
<i>his usual steady style, being quite proactive</i>

800
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:03,880
<i>and becoming the first.</i>

801
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,320
<i>The two cars are only 0.4 seconds apart.</i>

802
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,800
<i>It's a long straight road
and I wonder if Doumoto can catch up.</i>

803
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,119
<i>They are about to enter the Lisboa Bend.
They are braking and turning.</i>

804
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,960
Junhao, hold steady, don't rush.

805
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,199
<i>Successfully overtaking.</i>

806
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,760
<i>Han Junhao takes the lead.</i>

807
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,000
<i>Han Junhao's performance coming out of the bend</i>

808
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
<i>is excellent.</i>

809
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,280
<i>Yesterday's severe accident</i>

810
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,440
<i>seems to have not affected Han Junhao,</i>

811
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,239
<i>and he has been maintaining a good speed.</i>

812
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:26,119
<i>His cornering is very smooth.</i>

813
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:28,159
<i>All racers today are acting well.</i>

814
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:30,599
<i>This race will be fantastic.</i>

815
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:32,000
<i>Han Junhao is still leading,</i>

816
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,719
<i>and Doumoto is in second place.</i>

817
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:35,519
<i>But the two are gradually
pulling away from each other.</i>

818
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:37,360
<i>It feels like the gap
is now more than a second apart.</i>

819
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,400
<i>If Doumoto doesn't find an opportunity</i>

820
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,639
<i>to overtake Han Junhao, then this lap,</i>

821
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:41,159
<i>he will continue to be pressured by Han Junhao.</i>

822
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,840
<i>Han Junhao's performance
coming out of the bend is amazing.</i>

823
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,440
<i>He's going to have the edge
in the next couple of bends.</i>

824
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,719
<i>Doumoto has also caught up,</i>

825
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:48,400
<i>trying hard to find an opportunity to overtake.</i>

826
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,239
<i>The race is getting more and more exciting.</i>

827
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,840
<i>After the Lingnan Bend,
Han Junhao starts to accelerate.</i>

828
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,119
<i>Entering the Melco Bend.</i>

829
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,599
<i>Coming out of the Melco Bend…</i>

830
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:10,199
Elvis, go, go!

831
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:12,079
<i>He has won an advantage for himself.</i>

832
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,400
<i>I hope today, in this twelve-lap race,</i>

833
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,440
<i>he will achieve good results.</i>

834
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,639
<i>Now, all the racers</i>

835
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:21,920
<i>enter the fourth lap.</i>

836
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,119
<i>Doumoto closely follows Han Junhao,</i>

837
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,039
<i>continuing to look for opportunities
to overtake.</i>

838
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:30,079
<i>The time gap between them is one second.</i>

839
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,039
<i>Terrible, we can now see</i>

840
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:40,559
<i>Han Junhao's No. 95 car</i>

841
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,000
<i>is starting to smoke.</i>

842
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,639
<i>I think some malfunction has occurred.</i>

843
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:44,960
<i>I wonder if it will affect</i>

844
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,280
<i>Han Junhao's</i>

845
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,119
<i>performance.</i>

846
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:49,119
<i>We now see</i>

847
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,239
<i>the racers are about to enter the next bend.</i>

848
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:53,840
<i>Han Junhao, hold on!</i>

849
00:43:00,224 --> 00:43:05,056

850
00:43:05,056 --> 00:43:10,504
