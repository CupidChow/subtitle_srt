1
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,728
[Begin Again]

2
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,439
Please, a small portion of beef offal.

3
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,040
Okay, a small portion of beef offal.

4
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,560
- Wait, make it a medium portion.
- Alright, medium portion it is.

5
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,159
- Is this place really good?
- Of course, you must try it.

6
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,120
Every time I stay late

7
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,200
in the studio,

8
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,480
I would especially come here
when I get hungry at night

9
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,599
to have a portion of beef offal.

10
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,000
Alright, alone?

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
- Alone?
- What did you expect?

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,656
I'll accompany you next time.

13
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,840
My friend's gallery is opening tomorrow.

14
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,719
Would you like to go with me?

15
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,840
Tomorrow, huh?

16
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,599
Do you have training?

17
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,479
Can I accompany you after my training?

18
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,080
Of course, it's in the evening.

19
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,568
Alright, no problem then.

20
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,520
But I have a question.

21
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,879
What will be my identity if I go?

22
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,319
Professional racer Han Junhao,

23
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,240
amateur exhibition enthusiast.

24
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,879
What kind of identity is that?

25
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,919
At the very least, I should be

26
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,199
your date, right?

27
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,439
At least something like a friend, right?

28
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,159
Yes, just a friend.

29
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,000
Didn't you say so? A friend.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,879
Well, friend it is then.

31
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,680
But there are ordinary friends,

32
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,520
good friends, and boyfriends.

33
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,560
So which kind of friend am I?

34
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,240
You are…

35
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
the kind of friend in the song.

36
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,280
Still the usual?

37
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,560
- I want both shrimp and crab.
- Okay.

38
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
[Zhen Qiang]
Bring two screws along.

39
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,639
She's back. Le, sit over here, come on.

40
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:08,159
Doesn't she have to queue?
You don't have to queue?

41
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,360
I've made a reservation with Mr. Qiang.

42
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,960
You should make reservations
for me in the future.

43
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,479
I've never made a reservation
here my whole life.

44
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,840
- Okay.
- Please.

45
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,479
They accept reservations?
Is this still my family's restaurant?

46
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,840
Alright, you recognize me, don't you?

47
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,120
Where's Mr. Qiang?

48
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,159
He's in the kitchen.

49
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,280
Mr. Yong is here.

50
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,759
He's going to cook for him.

51
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,000
Order first. He's our regular customer.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,199
I'll go say hello.

53
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,280
Please order some dishes for me.

54
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,039
Okay.

55
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,520
Sorry.

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,319
Mr. Yong.

57
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,479
- Le.
- Long time no see.

58
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,840
Why didn't you ask me to pick you up?

59
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,759
Qiang picked me up.

60
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,879
While I can still move around,

61
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,439
I'll come to eat a few more times

62
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,680
the meals your dad makes.

63
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,080
Thank you for your support.

64
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,439
But you've been eating it for 20 years.

65
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,080
Don't you get tired of it?

66
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,759
I could eat it for another 30 years
without getting tired of it.

67
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:57,680
Sit here and have a drink with me. Let's chat.

68
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,919
I'll have a drink with you in a bit.

69
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,080
I brought a friend along.

70
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,240
I'll come to you after accompanying her.

71
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,840
- Alright, you go ahead.
- Let me know if you need anything.

72
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,120
- Okay, okay.
- Sure, sure.

73
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Mr. Yong, a long-time customer of our place.

74
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,400
He's made a special trip from Hong Kong

75
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,680
to eat the dishes my dad cooks.

76
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,079
He came in a wheelchair.

77
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,319
He really loves to eat here.

78
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,160
He used to do business around here,

79
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,000
and he ate his way through all of Macau.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,399
But then one day,

81
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,120
he came to our restaurant,

82
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,000
and he just raved

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,079
about the dishes my dad made.

84
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,279
And from that day,

85
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,160
they talked until the next morning

86
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,240
and became good brothers.

87
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
You are becoming more and more beautiful.

88
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,480
You're flattering me.

89
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,079
Mr. Yong knows how to make people happy.

90
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,839
No, I always speak my mind.

91
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,120
It's the truth.

92
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,399
However,

93
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:50,240
was today's dish made by an apprentice?

94
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,639
It's a bit salty.

95
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,279
I'm not sure.

96
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,480
Mr. Yong, let me try it.

97
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,639
It's fine, it's fine.

98
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,160
Perhaps there are too many people here today.

99
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,519
You were busy.

100
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,519
I understand.

101
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,680
Sorry about that, Mr. Yong.

102
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,720
I'll take care of it for you.

103
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,759
I'll get a new one.

104
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,000
- Thank you so much.
- I'm sorry.

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,319
Okay, okay, take it slow.

106
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,920
- Do you want to go take a look?
- Wait for me a second.

107
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,399
Jay.

108
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,439
Do another portion of this.

109
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,184
What's wrong?

110
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,879
It's nothing.

111
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,959
How many people are waiting now?

112
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,279
Five or six tables.

113
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,720
Don't give out any new waiting numbers for now.

114
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,120
- Your order has arrived.
- Thank you.

115
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,199
Tomorrow Hao is bringing his girlfriend
home for the first time.

116
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,120
- Treat the guests well and be polite.
- Okay.

117
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,639
Speak nicely to the guests.

118
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,399
It's not easy for people to come and queue up.

119
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,464
Don't worry.

120
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,480
Mr. Yong.

121
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,560
It's great that you cooked the dishes yourself.

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,399
I know you're busy with business.

123
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,639
But the skill of your apprentice

124
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,240
really falls short of yours.

125
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,839
Even a good horse needs a guide.

126
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:11,040
You should give them more training.

127
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,360
I'm sorry, Mr. Yong,
I didn't meet the standards today.

128
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
No problem at all.

129
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,720
Go ahead. I won't keep you.

130
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,160
- Thank you, Mr. Yong.
- Okay, okay.

131
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,440
Mr. Qiang.

132
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,879
Where's Le?

133
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,288
He's gone downstairs with his mom.

134
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,639
You've worked hard.

135
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,720
It's okay.

136
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,519
I just stood for too long,

137
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,160
and my back is a bit sore.

138
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,160
You've been standing too long,
even young people can't bear it.

139
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,600
Take care of your health, don't overdo it.

140
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,680
I don't mind at all.

141
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,519
I just look at these old employees.

142
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,639
They have watched

143
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,399
Le grow up since he was young.

144
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,000
They've stayed in the shop all these years?

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,439
Yeah.

146
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,199
And also these neighbors.

147
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,240
It is because of the support

148
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,720
from these neighbors
that Zhen Qiang can keep going.

149
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,720
Did you know?

150
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,600
There are also a few people in Hong Kong

151
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,800
who say they want to buy Zhen Qiang.

152
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,360
The price they gave me was pretty good.

153
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
But it didn't tempt you?

154
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,519
Of course, it did.

155
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,319
But I want to run this store.

156
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,199
When people come to eat at my place,

157
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,600
if they're happy, I'm happy.

158
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,879
When you get older, you talk more.
Enjoy your meal.

159
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,759
You're fine.

160
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,319
That's right.

161
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,720
Comparing today's dishes with those before,

162
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,759
how are they?

163
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,040
They are good.

164
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,199
Just as delicious as before.

165
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,920
Tell me the truth, don't lie to me.

166
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,319
I'm not lying to you. It's the truth.

167
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,319
And my coming here to eat
isn't just because it's tasty.

168
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,360
It's because I truly feel at home here.

169
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,639
- That's good to know. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

170
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,272
Come here, beautiful.

171
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,160
You haven't come in a long time.

172
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,480
Good, go on, drink.

173
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,632
Drink up.

174
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,879
- If you need anything, call me.
- Okay, sure.

175
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,639
- Take your time eating, Mr. Yong.
- Alright, alright.

176
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,199
- Thank you very much.
- What you've made is different from before.

177
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,000
Beginning to drink.

178
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,040
Just a little.

179
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,920
- I'll come to keep you company in a bit.
- Good, good, come on.

180
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,960
I'm so tired, I want to go home to sleep.

181
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,224
Do you want to leave first?

182
00:08:40,224 --> 00:08:41,320
Have something to eat first.

183
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,159
- Do you want some rice?
- Okay.

184
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,919
Otherwise, how can we eat this?

185
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,960
Yeah, order some.

186
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,159
A portion of white rice.

187
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,399
Ze.

188
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,039
White rice, alright?

189
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,168
- Okay.
- Two bowls.

190
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,360
Eat more if you like it.

191
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,399
But don't eat too much because it's late.

192
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,584
It's bad for digestion.

193
00:09:12,672 --> 00:09:13,840
Hello, Ms. Maggie.

194
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,440
Mai, how did it go today?

195
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,679
We had a smooth shoot today. It's already over.

196
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,879
The thing is, Mai,

197
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,519
it's getting late now,

198
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,919
so I'll just cut to the chase.

199
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,799
The company project team
has made some new adjustments.

200
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,919
As for the Xinghao project,

201
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,679
Wu Anmei will take over.

202
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,559
She will go to Macau with Xu tomorrow.

203
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,799
Please complete the work handover
with her as soon as possible.

204
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,360
Ms. Maggie.

205
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,080
I was always responsible

206
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,759
for this project, from planning

207
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,320
to proposal, and to execution,

208
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,879
including the shooting of our
daily progress details now.

209
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,159
I believe no one understands

210
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,879
the director's style better than I do.

211
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,960
Changing personnel temporarily like this now

212
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,440
might not satisfy everyone's needs.

213
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,919
This is an adjustment made by the company.

214
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,600
I have no choice.

215
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,320
Moreover, the proposal
has already been approved.

216
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,559
You have also made
preparations well in advance.

217
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,480
Just make sure to clearly explain
the important matters to her.

218
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,600
But Ms. Maggie, this project
is really quite special.

219
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,200
The filming conditions in Macau

220
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,240
are really very strict.

221
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,720
What we're dealing with is not only indoor,

222
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,000
but also many outdoor scenes.

223
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,519
We need to work with many departments,

224
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,799
to communicate and negotiate.

225
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,559
If there is even a slight
mistake in this process,

226
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,960
it's very likely that the entire project
will have to be shut down.

227
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,440
Alright, alright, just ensure
a smooth handover for tomorrow.

228
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,720
We'll talk about the rest later.

229
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,080
Wait, Ms. Maggie, I…

230
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:21,240
What happened?

231
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,919
I heard something about a personnel change.
What does that mean?

232
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,639
The company said they would have
a new colleague take over the project tomorrow.

233
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,799
This is so sudden, the shooting
has already started.

234
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,120
Suddenly you're being replaced.

235
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,279
Is there no reason?

236
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,159
They just said it was the company's decision.

237
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,559
The shooting just started.
What kind of decision is that?

238
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,799
This is unreasonable, right?

239
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,000
Besides, you have put in
so much for this project.

240
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,600
We have scouted so many locations.

241
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,759
We contacted so many people

242
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,919
to make it happen.

243
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,080
Maybe you should talk to your boss again.

244
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,840
And I believe that Casey
and the others will not agree.

245
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
We have just started.

246
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,120
Suddenly changing to another person in charge,
how can they manage it well?

247
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,399
They are not familiar with the situation.

248
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,360
Let's go back for today, we'll see
the situation on-site tomorrow.

249
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,799
Sorry, I don't mean to intrude,

250
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,000
but I just feel

251
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,200
that this is very unreasonable.

252
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,960
Alright, after I finish up
at the store tomorrow,

253
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,600
I, I will come over to help immediately.

254
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,519
In case you need anything, just let me know.

255
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,208
Thank you.

256
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,559
Hello, Zhen, what's up?

257
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,840
Dr. Zhong, I need to ask you something.

258
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,879
Has Qiang come to see you recently?

259
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,919
No, he hasn't.

260
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:35,440
Is he not feeling well?

261
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,519
I'll send you a photo, and can you help me
check what medicine it is?

262
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,840
Okay.

263
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,120
Zhen.

264
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,600
This medicine is for treating taste disorders.

265
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,279
Is this Mr. Qiang's medicine?

266
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,159
See when Mr. Qiang has time,

267
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,039
ask him to come to my clinic.

268
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:03,360
- I'll take his pulse for him.
- Thank you, Dr. Zhong.

269
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,440
Mr. Qiang, you've been very tired recently.

270
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,759
Worrying about me?

271
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:44,360
I'm fine.

272
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,480
You're my husband.

273
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,000
Of course, I care about you.

274
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,799
Hey,

275
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,279
if you've got any discomfort in the future,

276
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,879
you have to tell me, you know?

277
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,960
My body is great.

278
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,960
Don't worry.

279
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,720
Why aren't you going to sleep yet?

280
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,559
Can't I come over to check on you?

281
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:08,879
Don't keep looking at your phone.

282
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,679
It's not good for your eyes.

283
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,639
It hurts so much.

284
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,919
I don't know if I have

285
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:21,399
pulled some muscle

286
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,720
at the yoga studio the other day.

287
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,759
In a couple of days,

288
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,159
accompany me to see Dr. Zhong

289
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,904
and have him check on your back as well.

290
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,960
Does it hurt here?

291
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,200
If you've pulled a muscle, don't do yoga.

292
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,559
You keep saying I won't admit I'm getting old.

293
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,279
Aren't you the same?

294
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,600
How is that the same?

295
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,639
Haven't you heard the saying

296
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,799
that life lies in sports,

297
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,000
and sport is life?

298
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,840
Okay, okay.

299
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
How about

300
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,639
we close the shop for a few days

301
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,000
and take a trip?

302
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,320
Haven't you always wanted to go to Africa?

303
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,960
No.

304
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,360
We don't have enough staff in the store.

305
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,879
If we go out, who will mind the store?

306
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,480
I know

307
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,799
you have feelings for Zhen Qiang,

308
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,679
and you can't let go.

309
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:20,240
But I don't want a store

310
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,679
to ruin your health.

311
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,240
I worry about you like this.

312
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,399
And I get scared.

313
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,720
What are you scared of?

314
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,879
I promised you.

315
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:35,039
I won't go before you.

316
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,799
I won't leave you alone in this world.

317
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,600
Don't you remember?

318
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,879
I do.

319
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:46,399
Then you must keep your promise.

320
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,000
Well, ask yourself.

321
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,399
Over these decades,

322
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:53,720
when have I ever

323
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,080
not kept my promises?

324
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,472
Have I?

325
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,399
Well, promise me.

326
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,320
Don't push yourself too hard.

327
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,320
Tell me if there's something wrong.

328
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,240
Just go easy on me.

329
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,200
Is it strong enough?

330
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,279
Too soft, put more force.

331
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,559
That's too strong!

332
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:23,000
You complain when it's too heavy and too light.

333
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,360
Miss Mai. Miss Mai.

334
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,480
They gave me feedback

335
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,919
that today's set meal was too salty.

336
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,159
- Too salty?
- Yes.

337
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,000
Sis, can you talk to the restaurant about it?

338
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,879
Go try our restaurant's
secret recipe lunchbox.

339
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,000
Char siu rice, it's delicious.

340
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,519
Le, Le.

341
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:55,919
What's wrong?

342
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,080
Did Zhen Qiang change chefs?

343
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Today's meal

344
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,720
tastes a bit off.

345
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,559
No, Mr. Qiang made them himself.

346
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,559
It is indeed a bit salty.

347
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:19,320
Sorry, bro, I'll, I'll go check on it.

348
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,960
Hello, Xu.

349
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,639
Miss Mai, I've landed with Amy.

350
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:32,440
Okay, I've sent a car to pick you up.

351
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,048
See you in a bit.

352
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:53,200
Our training goal today

353
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,120
is to find the most perfect racing line.

354
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,480
Only by fully utilizing the racetrack

355
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,960
can we achieve the highest cornering speed,

356
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,960
especially in street races like those in Macau.

357
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,664
Got it.

358
00:17:01,664 --> 00:17:04,288
♫ I want to make you a believer ♫

359
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:07,885
♫ My team is invincible ♫

360
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:10,432
♫ Always the best achiever ♫

361
00:17:10,432 --> 00:17:15,008
♫ Do not doubt, we'll meet at the finish line ♫

362
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:16,736

375

My fan is broken.

376
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,858
It's too hot, I can't take it.

377
00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:44,619
Pit in, pit in.

378
00:18:15,338 --> 00:18:17,939
Director, I only have
two hours left on this site.

379
00:18:17,939 --> 00:18:19,539
- Hurry up.
- Okay, okay.

380
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:20,858
I still have two shots to take.

381
00:18:20,858 --> 00:18:21,898
They will be done quickly.

382
00:18:21,898 --> 00:18:23,818
- Miss Mai, Miss Mai.
- Alright.

383
00:18:23,818 --> 00:18:25,259
You made it.

384
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:26,779
This is Miss Amy.

385
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:28,499
I'm Amy, Wu Anmei.

386
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:29,818
Hello, Mai Youge.

387
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,138
I've heard great things about you.

388
00:18:31,138 --> 00:18:32,459
You're so pretty.

389
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:33,618
That day when I went to the company,

390
00:18:33,618 --> 00:18:35,138
I wanted to meet you.

391
00:18:35,138 --> 00:18:38,618
But it turned out you had
just left and I missed you.

392
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,979
Yes, because I had to rush over the next day.

393
00:18:40,979 --> 00:18:42,658
It must have been tough, but it's okay.

394
00:18:42,658 --> 00:18:44,179
Didn't we meet eventually anyway?

395
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:46,259
- It's all fate.
- Yes, yes.

396
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:48,418
Tired? Do you want to rest for a bit first?

397
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,138
Why would I be tired?
You've been working hard for so long.

398
00:18:51,138 --> 00:18:54,058
Hurry up and sync the work with me.

399
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:55,939
What's the progress of our shooting now?

400
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:58,138
- Tell me about it.
- Okay.

401
00:18:58,898 --> 00:19:00,459
We shot the exterior scenes yesterday.

402
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:02,098
Today we are shooting the interior scenes.

403
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:05,338
Here's the thing, because I had just
received the notice from Maggie.

404
00:19:05,338 --> 00:19:07,019
Should we find a place

405
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:10,019
and I'll sync up our
current progress with you, okay?

406
00:19:10,578 --> 00:19:12,658
You know what, Mai, I think

407
00:19:12,658 --> 00:19:13,658
there's no rush on these.

408
00:19:13,658 --> 00:19:14,898
We can wait until the work is done

409
00:19:14,898 --> 00:19:16,459
and have a good talk when we go back at night.

410
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:20,378
The pressing matter is to introduce
me to the Director, okay?

411
00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:22,979
Okay, Director.

412
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:24,818
This is the new colleague sent by our company,

413
00:19:24,818 --> 00:19:26,658
my coworker Wu Anmei, Amy.

414
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:27,858
Director Qiang.

415
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:30,138
- Hello, I've long admired your work.
- Pleasure.

416
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:31,699
I have seen many of your works,

417
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:34,459
- and I really appreciate your creative style.
- You flatter me.

418
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:35,499
This time,

419
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:37,539
I will take over the work from here on.

420
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:39,378
What about Mai?

421
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,138
The company has other arrangements for Mai.

422
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,618
She has other work to do.

423
00:19:42,618 --> 00:19:43,939
- Okay, okay.
- Please, have a seat.

424
00:19:43,939 --> 00:19:45,658
Okay.

425
00:19:45,658 --> 00:19:47,499
Director Qiang, although
it's our first meeting,

426
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:48,658
I hope that you can

427
00:19:48,658 --> 00:19:49,858
fully trust me.

428
00:19:49,858 --> 00:19:50,939
Because I am very

429
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,219
professional in production.

430
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:53,539
We can certainly create

431
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:54,618
a perfect piece of work.

432
00:19:54,618 --> 00:19:56,459
Alright, okay, come on.

433
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:58,818
We'll continue over here.

434
00:19:58,818 --> 00:20:00,818
Director Qiang, you know,

435
00:20:00,818 --> 00:20:02,058
before I came here,

436
00:20:02,058 --> 00:20:03,979
I actually did a lot of homework

437
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:06,138
on this project's proposal.

438
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,378
I have some ideas

439
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:09,578
that I would like to discuss with you.

440
00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:10,818
Discuss?

441
00:20:10,818 --> 00:20:11,979
What do you think?

442
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:14,138
This implementation plan and shooting plan

443
00:20:14,138 --> 00:20:16,939
had already been settled by Mai and me.

444
00:20:18,338 --> 00:20:21,858
Amy, this scene of mine

445
00:20:21,858 --> 00:20:23,499
is a bit tight on time,
and we're almost running late.

446
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:25,378
So let's not disturb the Director for now.

447
00:20:25,378 --> 00:20:27,219
There are a lot of regulations,

448
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:28,858
requirements and restrictions
for shooting in Macau.

449
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:30,459
Let me get you up to speed first.

450
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:31,618
Dear, here's what I think.

451
00:20:31,618 --> 00:20:33,219
All these are matters for later.

452
00:20:33,219 --> 00:20:35,299
We're short on time, right?

453
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:36,658
So we must adjust the script

454
00:20:36,658 --> 00:20:39,939
right now, right?

455
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,299
Come on, is the set ready?

456
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:43,658
If it's ready, let's go. Come on, action.

457
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:46,138
Director, regarding the script for our shoot…

458
00:20:46,138 --> 00:20:47,699
Script?

459
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:49,618
Just two more setups and I'll be done shooting.

460
00:20:49,618 --> 00:20:51,179
Script at this time?

461
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:53,378
That's funny, come on.

462
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,618
Yusheng, are you ready?

463
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:56,818
Let's shoot, start rolling!

464
00:20:56,818 --> 00:20:57,939
Miss Mai.

465
00:20:57,939 --> 00:21:01,699
Miss Mai, tomorrow we are
shooting in the public area.

466
00:21:01,699 --> 00:21:03,578
The venue hopes to finalize

467
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:05,618
the shooting time for each area.

468
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:06,858
And they asked us to go over

469
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:08,499
and have a coordination meeting.

470
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:11,259
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.

471
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:12,858
Amy.

472
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:15,138
There's a coordination meeting

473
00:21:15,138 --> 00:21:16,818
about the venue in external relations now.

474
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:19,259
Do you think you should go or should I?

475
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:21,098
I think

476
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:22,699
you have been here for a longer time,

477
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,299
and you are also more familiar.

478
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:25,739
So it's more appropriate for you to go.

479
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:27,499
I'll keep an eye on the site.

480
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:29,499
- Okay.
- Rest assured.

481
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:31,858
- Okay, it's fine.
- Thanks for your hard work.

482
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:34,138
Xu.

483
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:36,179
Miss Mai.

484
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,058
Help me keep an eye on the scene.

485
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:39,219
Let me know immediately if anything happens.

486
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:42,251
Okay, no problem.

487
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:48,299
We just received a complaint
from a VIP customer.

488
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:49,338
They said you're occupying the corridor,

489
00:21:49,338 --> 00:21:50,858
affecting their normal passage.

490
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:52,779
Our deputy CEO of the group just passed by

491
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:53,939
saying that your noise is too loud,

492
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:55,338
which damages our hotel's image,

493
00:21:55,338 --> 00:21:57,378
requesting you to withdraw
completely within 30 minutes.

494
00:21:57,378 --> 00:22:00,259
But please don't worry, we will
try to finish as quickly as possible.

495
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:01,259
- But…
- Miss, we're not shooting anymore.

496
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:02,739
We're not shooting anymore,
you have to leave right now immediately.

497
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:04,979
Please, we must try to understand
each other, wouldn't you agree?

498
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:05,979
- Shaohui.
- So we must…

499
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:07,658
- Shaohui.
- Miss Mai, thank God you're here.

500
00:22:07,658 --> 00:22:09,138
- Look at the venue…
- Sorry, I'm really sorry.

501
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:10,338
We have disturbed you today.

502
00:22:10,338 --> 00:22:11,739
I will have them clear
this corridor immediately.

503
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:13,019
And Mr. Xu is coming.

504
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:14,378
We can't show him the current situation.

505
00:22:14,378 --> 00:22:15,418
Okay, no problem, I will fix it.

506
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:16,618
I will fix it.

507
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:18,138
Have them resume filming right now, quickly.

508
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:19,219
- What's going on?
- Hurry.

509
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:21,858
Mr. Xu, I just talked to Miss Mai,
and they will do it as soon as possible.

510
00:22:21,858 --> 00:22:24,098
Mr. Xu, I'm really really sorry.

511
00:22:24,098 --> 00:22:25,259
But, here,

512
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:26,378
we need another half an hour.

513
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:27,658
Another half an hour?

514
00:22:27,658 --> 00:22:29,378
The deputy CEO of the group has
already posted in the group chat,

515
00:22:29,378 --> 00:22:31,587
requiring you to evacuate immediately.

516
00:22:31,587 --> 00:22:32,658
I really don't get it.

517
00:22:32,658 --> 00:22:34,179
We had previously gone over

518
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:35,378
all the shooting standards meticulously.

519
00:22:35,378 --> 00:22:37,058
Why is it still so chaotic today?

520
00:22:37,058 --> 00:22:38,179
Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

521
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:39,299
Today,

522
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,058
today was indeed my oversight.

523
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:43,499
But I still want to ask you to give me
the chance to finish shooting this scene.

524
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:46,539
I also did it to not
affect the filming schedule.

525
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,779
Do you think I should
compromise the guests' experience

526
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:50,979
for the hotel's promotional film?

527
00:22:50,979 --> 00:22:52,618
I assure you that this will absolutely

528
00:22:52,618 --> 00:22:54,219
not happen again in the future.

529
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:55,779
Today, as long as you are
willing to give me this half hour,

530
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:57,098
I will have them shoot quietly throughout.

531
00:22:57,098 --> 00:22:58,499
I will definitely not
affect any guest experience.

532
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:01,418
This is not just a question
of whether it is quiet or not.

533
00:23:01,418 --> 00:23:02,898
Mr. Xu, here's the thing.

534
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:05,138
If I don't shoot today and pull out,

535
00:23:05,138 --> 00:23:07,578
I will definitely need to find another
time to come back and shoot.

536
00:23:07,578 --> 00:23:10,098
But if I give up, I don't shoot,

537
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,058
I may ultimately not be able
to present the Xinghao

538
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,138
you have in mind.

539
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:19,019
Thirty minutes, okay?

540
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:21,338
At most, in an orderly manner
without disturbing others.

541
00:23:21,338 --> 00:23:23,138
No problem, 30 minutes is enough.

542
00:23:23,138 --> 00:23:24,179
- Thank you, Mr. Xu.
- Hurry.

543
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:25,699
Thank you, thank you.

544
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:27,138
Shaohui, go to another department

545
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:28,739
and ask for some people to come over and help.

546
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:31,418
You personally go and pick
a few reliable colleagues, okay?

547
00:23:31,418 --> 00:23:32,138
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

548
00:23:32,138 --> 00:23:34,058
- Alright, I know…
- Mai.

549
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:35,539
I've already resolved the issue
with the lunchbox.

550
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,187
- Le?
- This is our…

551
00:23:37,187 --> 00:23:38,858
- Hao.
- What are you doing here?

552
00:23:38,858 --> 00:23:40,019
What are you doing here?

553
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,418
I work here.

554
00:23:41,418 --> 00:23:45,019
I know, I've been working on
this project with Fish recently.

555
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:47,499
- I'm doing the outreach…
- This project?

556
00:23:47,499 --> 00:23:49,219
Why didn't you tell me
you took on the Xinghao project?

557
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,058
You are Mr. Xu, after all.

558
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:52,418
How would I know you would come

559
00:23:52,418 --> 00:23:54,979
to such a small project?

560
00:23:55,578 --> 00:23:58,818
Let me introduce you, my boss, Mai.

561
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:03,418
She's your boss?

562
00:24:03,418 --> 00:24:04,858
Yes.

563
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:06,378
Okay, okay, okay.

564
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:07,818
Is Le in a relationship?

565
00:24:07,818 --> 00:24:08,939
Almost.

566
00:24:08,939 --> 00:24:11,539
With his boss.

567
00:24:12,898 --> 00:24:14,658
Mai.

568
00:24:14,658 --> 00:24:16,378
Will you look at that?

569
00:24:16,378 --> 00:24:19,179
I am your client, and you are
my younger sibling's client.

570
00:24:21,979 --> 00:24:24,267
Fate.

571
00:24:26,138 --> 00:24:29,539
Let me introduce, this is Mr. Xu,
who is also my elder brother.

572
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:31,179
Do you remember the day we ate at Zhen Qiang?

573
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,618
The photo on that table?

574
00:24:32,618 --> 00:24:33,618
That handsome young man is him.

575
00:24:33,618 --> 00:24:35,699
- She even visited Zhen Qiang?
- She likes it there very much.

576
00:24:35,699 --> 00:24:37,818
That's pretty good.

577
00:24:38,658 --> 00:24:40,939
You don't recognize him?

578
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:45,179
Sorry, it's hard to imagine you are brothers.

579
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:46,858
Really? We look so alike.

580
00:24:46,858 --> 00:24:48,858
When we stand together,
you can see that we are brothers.

581
00:24:48,858 --> 00:24:51,338
Yes, yes, yes.

582
00:24:52,338 --> 00:24:54,459
Well,

583
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,418
my younger brother's
work capability is okay, right?

584
00:24:57,418 --> 00:24:59,058
He's doing great.

585
00:24:59,058 --> 00:25:01,299
- That's good to know.
- Thank you, Boss.

586
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,818
Sometimes he looks a bit, you know, offbeat.

587
00:25:04,818 --> 00:25:07,939
But he is still very reliable.

588
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,539
No, no, he, he's very dependable.

589
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,578
In Macau, I rely on him for a lot of things.

590
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:13,219
Thank you, Boss.

591
00:25:13,219 --> 00:25:16,699
Then I'll leave the site
to the two of you, okay?

592
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:19,699
Remember to come home for dinner tonight.

593
00:25:19,699 --> 00:25:22,338
I know, your girlfriend is coming.

594
00:25:23,058 --> 00:25:25,658
- See you tonight.
- Okay, see you tonight.

595
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:28,075
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

596
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:31,179
No, no, don't look at me like that.

597
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:35,019
I really didn't know he
was related to our project.

598
00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:36,378
Okay, I admit it.

599
00:25:36,378 --> 00:25:38,378
I admit that I know everyone in Macau, okay?

600
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:40,578
What's the situation with Amy?

601
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,098
They're not really replacing you, are they?

602
00:25:43,098 --> 00:25:44,459
I heard she caused a lot of trouble today.

603
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,147
How do you plan to handle it?

604
00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:51,098
Let's get through today first.

605
00:25:51,098 --> 00:25:53,058
Take it one step at a time.

606
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:54,618
No, if you really get replaced,

607
00:25:54,618 --> 00:25:55,939
I won't accept it.

608
00:25:55,939 --> 00:25:57,138
You don't accept it?

609
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,378
Do workers have a say in matters?

610
00:25:58,378 --> 00:26:00,578
Workers only obey orders.

611
00:26:00,578 --> 00:26:02,499
Then you should resign first.

612
00:26:02,499 --> 00:26:04,779
Is resigning that easy?

613
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:06,658
Then I'll resign.

614
00:26:06,658 --> 00:26:08,098
Anyway, if you get replaced,

615
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:10,891
I don't want to work here anymore either.

616
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:15,658
As for the lunchbox matter, our store

617
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:17,858
will take responsibility for it.

618
00:26:17,858 --> 00:26:19,499
Tomorrow we will

619
00:26:19,499 --> 00:26:22,378
provide you with lunch for free.

620
00:26:22,378 --> 00:26:23,739
Okay, thank you.

621
00:26:23,739 --> 00:26:25,931
Okay.

622
00:26:52,939 --> 00:26:54,138
Boss, two portions, please.

623
00:26:54,138 --> 00:26:56,779
Kids, the portions we serve are quite generous.

624
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:58,699
A large portion for you two will be enough.

625
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:01,299
Why would you want to eat this?

626
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:03,179
Because you want to eat it.

627
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:04,739
I want to eat it?

628
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:06,779
You said it in your dream.

629
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:09,179
What did I say in my dream?

630
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:11,418
You said you wanted to eat
pig's trotter with ginger.

631
00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:15,858
Here, take it.

632
00:27:15,858 --> 00:27:18,138
[Three Lamps Pig's Trotter with Ginger]
Can you even understand sleep talk?

633
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:20,338
I had Mike translate it.

634
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:25,299
- How much?
- Fifty.

635
00:27:29,658 --> 00:27:30,779
The pig's trotter with ginger
is sweet-flavored.

636
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,898
Are you okay with it?

637
00:27:36,618 --> 00:27:38,818
It's quite unique.

638
00:27:38,818 --> 00:27:40,739
Is it very complicated to make this?

639
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:41,898
Extremely.

640
00:27:41,898 --> 00:27:45,699
And it really tests one's patience.

641
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:48,179
When I was little and lost
my appetite when I was sick,

642
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:51,779
my grandma would make this for me.

643
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:54,138
That ginger and vinegar flavor

644
00:27:54,138 --> 00:27:55,739
was sour and spicy.

645
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:57,578
It's very appetizing.

646
00:27:57,578 --> 00:28:01,618
So even though it's a hassle to make,

647
00:28:01,618 --> 00:28:03,378
every time I got sick,

648
00:28:03,378 --> 00:28:06,098
my grandma would be in the kitchen

649
00:28:06,098 --> 00:28:07,979
for a whole afternoon

650
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:09,098
to make it for me.

651
00:28:09,098 --> 00:28:11,138
What about your mom?

652
00:28:11,138 --> 00:28:13,459
Didn't she keep you company?

653
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,259
Better not.

654
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:17,618
Otherwise, even if I got sick,

655
00:28:17,618 --> 00:28:20,378
I still had to study and practice the piano.

656
00:28:20,378 --> 00:28:22,898
Of course,

657
00:28:22,898 --> 00:28:24,858
every child hopes that their mother

658
00:28:24,858 --> 00:28:27,219
can hug them more.

659
00:28:28,699 --> 00:28:30,699
That she can pull me

660
00:28:30,699 --> 00:28:33,539
into her arms and stroke me

661
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:35,259
at the toughest times.

662
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:36,338
Actually, whether or not I get married

663
00:28:36,338 --> 00:28:37,378
or have children

664
00:28:37,378 --> 00:28:41,179
isn't that important to me.

665
00:28:49,219 --> 00:28:51,875
Why aren't you eating?

666
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:52,979
Isn't it tasty?

667
00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:55,211
Nope.

668
00:28:57,658 --> 00:29:00,098
Actually, compared to being a mother,

669
00:29:00,098 --> 00:29:03,019
I would rather be a kid again,

670
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:05,419
just like you.

671
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:10,299
My mom also likes this kind of hairstyle.

672
00:29:28,338 --> 00:29:29,858
So cute.

673
00:29:29,858 --> 00:29:31,499
Jiajia, look at these photos.

674
00:29:31,499 --> 00:29:34,138
Guess which one is Hao.

675
00:29:34,138 --> 00:29:36,739
Hao?

676
00:29:38,058 --> 00:29:40,739
It's really hard to tell.

677
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:42,418
This shouldn't be it, right?

678
00:29:42,418 --> 00:29:43,578
Why are you so amazing?

679
00:29:43,578 --> 00:29:44,658
But I know this one is your sister.

680
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,658
Come on, it's time to eat.

681
00:29:46,658 --> 00:29:47,779
Bring a cushion over here.

682
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:48,939
- Coming.
- So beautiful.

683
00:29:48,939 --> 00:29:51,098
Right? I bought it in Brazil.

684
00:29:51,098 --> 00:29:53,618
- It's so special.
- You have good taste.

685
00:29:53,618 --> 00:29:56,011
Thank you.

686
00:29:58,459 --> 00:30:00,578
This dish is great.

687
00:30:00,578 --> 00:30:02,898
This smells so good, what dish is this?

688
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:04,259
Bamboo fungus and mutton stew.

689
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:06,219
It's Mr. Qiang's specialty dish.

690
00:30:06,219 --> 00:30:08,098
Let me tell you, you're really
in for a treat today.

691
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,378
- Normally, you have to queue for this.
- Really?

692
00:30:10,378 --> 00:30:11,779
And you might not even be able to get it.

693
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:13,338
- Right, we don't get to eat it often.
- For real.

694
00:30:13,338 --> 00:30:14,338
Come on.

695
00:30:14,338 --> 00:30:16,539
- Dig in.
- Let our honored guest have the first taste.

696
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:17,618
Exactly, exactly.

697
00:30:17,618 --> 00:30:21,499
I'm telling you, the key is to make sure
to get some of this sauce.

698
00:30:21,499 --> 00:30:24,459
- I'm telling you, it's so good.
- Okay.

699
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:26,499
I won't be polite, it's been
so long since I've had this.

700
00:30:26,499 --> 00:30:29,338
Because you haven't been home
for meals for a long time.

701
00:30:29,338 --> 00:30:31,578
Okay, I promise you.

702
00:30:31,578 --> 00:30:34,019
- It's so good.
- I know, right?

703
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:35,338
I never used to eat mutton.

704
00:30:35,338 --> 00:30:38,739
But this soup doesn't have the taste of mutton.

705
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:41,098
That's impressive.

706
00:30:41,098 --> 00:30:42,259
Have a few more.

707
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:44,338
Dad, did you put too little salt?

708
00:30:44,338 --> 00:30:46,539
It seems a little bland.

709
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:48,259
Don't you think it's a bit bland?

710
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:52,098
Not at all, I think it tastes quite fresh.

711
00:30:53,098 --> 00:30:54,138
- Hao.
- Pretty good.

712
00:30:54,138 --> 00:30:55,259
I'd like to offer a toast to Mr. Qiang.

713
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:56,418
Do you want to add some soy sauce?

714
00:30:56,418 --> 00:30:57,779
No need, it's fine.

715
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:59,459
Mr. Qiang, let me toast to you.

716
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:00,939
You've put in so much work

717
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:02,138
preparing so many dishes.

718
00:31:02,138 --> 00:31:04,179
And thank you, Le, for helping out.

719
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:05,378
It's really delicious.

720
00:31:05,378 --> 00:31:08,179
- Thank you, Mr. Qiang.
- It's my pleasure.

721
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:10,179
Thank you, Bao.

722
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:11,418
Come and eat at our house
more often in the future.

723
00:31:11,418 --> 00:31:13,179
- I will. It's really good.
- Come over more often.

724
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:15,435
Please.

725
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:18,578
- Eat more. Don't be shy.
- Alright.

726
00:31:18,578 --> 00:31:20,299
- Okay.
- Dig in.

727
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:21,658
It's been a long time
since I had a meal at home.

728
00:31:21,658 --> 00:31:24,618
- I'm really, really happy.
- Happy, huh?

729
00:31:24,618 --> 00:31:26,939
I don't know how long it's been
since someone had a meal at home.

730
00:31:26,939 --> 00:31:28,259
I know, I know, it's my fault.

731
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:30,338
Do you understand?
When you come home for a meal,

732
00:31:30,338 --> 00:31:31,818
you must bring Jiajia along.

733
00:31:31,818 --> 00:31:33,138
I got it, I got it.

734
00:31:33,138 --> 00:31:34,699
Just tell us what you want to eat.

735
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:37,138
Mr. Qiang will make it for you,
and it will be tasty.

736
00:31:37,138 --> 00:31:38,378
- He can cook anything.
- Mr. Qiang is really skilled.

737
00:31:38,378 --> 00:31:39,219
- Right.
- So blessed.

738
00:31:39,219 --> 00:31:41,618
So now if you want to have a meal
at my house, just let me know.

739
00:31:41,618 --> 00:31:42,939
Because if you don't come,
I'll have no meal to eat.

740
00:31:42,939 --> 00:31:44,539
You must come now.

741
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:46,179
- It's okay.
- You can not come.

742
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:47,459
She alone will be fine.

743
00:31:47,459 --> 00:31:48,699
Did you hear that?

744
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,618
I have to rely on you, Jia.

745
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,779
We need to entertain our honored guest.

746
00:31:54,058 --> 00:31:55,939
Now that everyone is here

747
00:31:55,939 --> 00:31:57,299
eating so happily, huh?

748
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:59,787
I have an announcement.

749
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:04,539
Jiajia and I

750
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:06,891
are getting married.

751
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:12,907
Getting married?

752
00:32:25,618 --> 00:32:27,418
Is she pregnant?

753
00:32:27,418 --> 00:32:28,939
No, Dad.

754
00:32:28,939 --> 00:32:31,098
Don't worry.

755
00:32:31,898 --> 00:32:34,898
Why is everyone so nervous?

756
00:32:34,898 --> 00:32:36,299
Actually, there's really
no need to worry about us.

757
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,939
We have everything arranged.

758
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:41,019
The process, the venue and all that

759
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:42,979
have all been very properly arranged.

760
00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:44,539
Next week, all you need to do

761
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:45,939
is to dress up sharp,

762
00:32:45,939 --> 00:32:47,019
come looking gorgeous,

763
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:49,539
and simply enjoy yourselves.

764
00:32:50,418 --> 00:32:51,618
- Next week?
- Next week?!

765
00:32:51,618 --> 00:32:53,867
Yes.

766
00:33:05,138 --> 00:33:06,739
Next week?

767
00:33:06,739 --> 00:33:09,451
Yes, Dad.

768
00:33:14,818 --> 00:33:17,418
I think you're being very irresponsible.

769
00:33:23,058 --> 00:33:25,699
You suddenly brought a girl home.

770
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:28,098
Except for the fact

771
00:33:28,098 --> 00:33:29,939
that her name is Jiajia,

772
00:33:29,939 --> 00:33:32,138
I don't know anything else.

773
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:35,618
And now you suddenly tell me

774
00:33:35,618 --> 00:33:37,779
that you have arranged everything.

775
00:33:38,858 --> 00:33:43,019
So you're just informing me now, right?

776
00:33:48,858 --> 00:33:50,459
Dad.

777
00:33:50,459 --> 00:33:52,019
I really don't know what you're upset about.

778
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:54,259
- I'm not upset.
- But you're clearly showing that.

779
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:56,019
And I'm not just informing you.

780
00:33:56,019 --> 00:33:57,858
How could I be irresponsible?

781
00:33:57,858 --> 00:33:59,898
Didn't I bring her home today?

782
00:33:59,898 --> 00:34:02,739
- I was thinking…
- Alright, alright.

783
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:11,818
How long have you two known each other?

784
00:34:11,818 --> 00:34:13,898
Okay, okay.

785
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:16,018
We've known each other for six months.

786
00:34:16,018 --> 00:34:17,739
I know that in your generation,

787
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,259
getting married after knowing each other
for six months might be called impulsive.

788
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:20,779
Are you talking back to me now?

789
00:34:20,779 --> 00:34:22,619
You two talk it out nicely, don't get agitated.

790
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:25,219
- Shut up.
- What does this have to do with you?

791
00:34:29,378 --> 00:34:31,619
Dad, I hope you understand

792
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:33,099
that the two of us are very serious

793
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:34,779
and we respect marriage.

794
00:34:34,779 --> 00:34:37,619
I'm also very serious when I say to you

795
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:40,299
that marriage

796
00:34:40,299 --> 00:34:42,579
is not child's play.

797
00:34:43,858 --> 00:34:45,418
Marriage is a lifetime commitment.

798
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:46,779
Dad, I'm in my thirties.

799
00:34:46,779 --> 00:34:48,139
Would I not know that marriage

800
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,259
is for life?

801
00:34:49,259 --> 00:34:50,739
Of course, I am very clear about it.

802
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:53,018
Okay, okay, okay.

803
00:35:01,538 --> 00:35:03,739
You want to get married, right?

804
00:35:07,938 --> 00:35:09,898
Go ahead and marry enough.

805
00:35:09,898 --> 00:35:11,978
Qiang.

806
00:35:11,978 --> 00:35:14,458
I have no problem with it.

807
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,811
Sorry about that.

808
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:22,259
It's fine, it's fine.

809
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:34,099
Hao.

810
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,538
Jiajia.

811
00:35:36,538 --> 00:35:38,579
As for the matter of marriage, well,

812
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:41,338
it's actually a matter between the two of you.

813
00:35:41,978 --> 00:35:43,898
If you two feel it's okay,

814
00:35:43,898 --> 00:35:46,099
then it's okay.

815
00:35:49,139 --> 00:35:50,779
Jiajia.

816
00:35:50,779 --> 00:35:52,458
His father

817
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:53,818
hasn't been feeling well lately,

818
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,699
so his temper has been a bit bad.

819
00:35:55,699 --> 00:35:56,858
you must not

820
00:35:56,858 --> 00:35:59,418
take it to heart.

821
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:01,779
I can understand that, madam.

822
00:36:01,779 --> 00:36:03,579
Mom, what do you mean

823
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:07,179
when you said he hadn't been feeling well?

824
00:36:07,179 --> 00:36:09,619
I found him taking

825
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:13,938
the medicine for treating taste dysfunction.

826
00:36:18,978 --> 00:36:20,779
I think we should take him to see a doctor.

827
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,338
He went to see a Western doctor.

828
00:36:22,338 --> 00:36:24,659
But he doesn't want us to know.

829
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:27,699
So just pretend not to know.

830
00:36:27,699 --> 00:36:28,898
Why?

831
00:36:28,898 --> 00:36:30,259
He doesn't want us to know.

832
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:31,579
This matter is very serious.

833
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:33,619
Just listen to me.

834
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:35,938
So I said it early in the morning.

835
00:36:35,938 --> 00:36:37,858
He works too hard.

836
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:40,059
Why can't he just sell Zhen Qiang,

837
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:41,378
put the money in his own pocket,

838
00:36:41,378 --> 00:36:42,739
and enjoy his blessings properly?

839
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:44,299
Don't you know his personality?

840
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:45,659
How could he possibly sell Zhen Qiang?

841
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:47,219
Now the focus is on his health.

842
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:48,219
We need to take him to see a doctor.

843
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:49,538
Without rest, how can he be healthy?

844
00:36:49,538 --> 00:36:51,139
That's why we need to take
him to see a doctor, right?

845
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:53,458
Stop arguing. He'll hear you.

846
00:36:54,858 --> 00:36:57,355
We'll talk about it later.

847
00:36:57,978 --> 00:37:00,099
He won't sell it.

848
00:37:09,818 --> 00:37:12,459
Ms. Maggie.

849
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:17,179
Ms. Maggie.

850
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:19,458
The Xinghao project was not easy to secure.

851
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:20,619
My entire team worked hard

852
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:22,059
for several months to get it.

853
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:23,458
And it wasn't easy to get

854
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:24,659
such a filming team.

855
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,938
I think we all did our utmost

856
00:37:25,938 --> 00:37:27,538
trying to complete this project well.

857
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:28,978
None of us would want any mistakes

858
00:37:28,978 --> 00:37:30,139
or misunderstandings

859
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:31,219
in this process

860
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:32,299
that could lead the client

861
00:37:32,299 --> 00:37:33,779
to lose trust in us

862
00:37:33,779 --> 00:37:34,898
or

863
00:37:34,898 --> 00:37:37,699
reassess our capabilities.

864
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:39,818
Is it that serious?

865
00:37:39,818 --> 00:37:41,219
At the end of the day,

866
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:43,139
you're unwilling for Amy
to lead the project, aren't you?

867
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:44,978
No, Ms. Maggie, I am not

868
00:37:44,978 --> 00:37:46,579
speaking from a personal standpoint.

869
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:48,699
From the shooting plan to the script,

870
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,739
to the entire team and the environment
I am currently filming in,

871
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:54,579
I'm the one who's most familiar with things.

872
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:56,378
I also hope you can trust me.

873
00:37:56,378 --> 00:37:58,018
I believe that, in the end,

874
00:37:58,018 --> 00:37:59,018
a good result will be achieved,

875
00:37:59,018 --> 00:38:01,139
which should also be what
the company wants to see, right?

876
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:03,978
Mai, of course, I trust you.

877
00:38:03,978 --> 00:38:06,378
But replacing you with Amy
was the company's decision.

878
00:38:06,378 --> 00:38:07,699
Since you're more familiar with things,

879
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:10,699
you should be able to work well with Amy.

880
00:38:10,699 --> 00:38:12,099
Amy is also very experienced.

881
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:13,619
As long as your communication is in place,

882
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:15,099
she will surely do fine.

883
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:17,099
I'm busy here, so let us
leave it at that, alright?

884
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:19,915
I…

885
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:41,659
- Michelle.
- Joe.

886
00:38:42,299 --> 00:38:45,458
- Congratulations, Senior sister.
- Thank you.

887
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:47,338
Do you still remember when you graduated?

888
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:49,018
You told us that within ten years,

889
00:38:49,018 --> 00:38:50,099
you would have

890
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,779
- your own gallery.
- Yes.

891
00:38:51,779 --> 00:38:53,579
Today, you've done it.

892
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:54,858
And it's also thanks to Yvonne

893
00:38:54,858 --> 00:38:55,938
and your help

894
00:38:55,938 --> 00:38:57,619
that I was able to open my gallery.

895
00:38:57,619 --> 00:38:59,299
Hello.

896
00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:00,179
- This is…
- Hi.

897
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:01,259
My name is Elvis,

898
00:39:01,259 --> 00:39:02,579
I'm Joe's friend.

899
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:03,619
I'm also an

900
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:05,259
amateur art enthusiast.

901
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,978
Thank you for your support.

902
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:09,538
These are from Joe,

903
00:39:09,538 --> 00:39:11,858
wishing you great success
on your grand opening here.

904
00:39:11,858 --> 00:39:13,338
Joe, that's kind of you.

905
00:39:13,338 --> 00:39:15,259
I forgot to introduce, this is Yvonne,

906
00:39:15,259 --> 00:39:16,378
my boss,

907
00:39:16,378 --> 00:39:17,898
who usually gives me a lot of help.

908
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:20,099
Nice to meet you.

909
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:21,619
If I remember correctly,

910
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:23,259
you are the first guy that Joe brought

911
00:39:23,259 --> 00:39:25,579
to an event.

912
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:26,978
- I'm the first?
- The first.

913
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:28,659
Is that so?

914
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:29,938
Of course not.

915
00:39:29,938 --> 00:39:33,018
- You believed that?
- I did.

916
00:39:33,018 --> 00:39:36,059
Hello, my dear.

917
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:38,179
Long time no see.

918
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:41,155
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

919
00:39:41,155 --> 00:39:42,378
Thank you.

920
00:39:42,378 --> 00:39:44,498
- You look gorgeous today.
- Really?

921
00:39:44,498 --> 00:39:46,219
I barely recognized you
when I passed by just now.

922
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:48,619
Is that so?

923
00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:51,259
Let me introduce everyone.

924
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:52,338
This is Matthew.

925
00:39:52,338 --> 00:39:54,219
He is an art critic.

926
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:55,299
This is Yvonne.

927
00:39:55,299 --> 00:39:58,179
She is the manager of Xinghao Art Gallery.

928
00:39:58,179 --> 00:39:59,779
- Hello.
- Hi.

929
00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:02,378
Joe is the curator of the Yvonne Art Gallery.

930
00:40:02,378 --> 00:40:04,498
Nice to meet you.

931
00:40:04,498 --> 00:40:07,018
Elvis, Joe's friend.

932
00:40:10,938 --> 00:40:13,451
Pleasure to meet you.

933
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:16,659
I visited an exhibition at Xinghao a while ago.

934
00:40:16,659 --> 00:40:19,458
You did the planning
for the Monte's exhibition, didn't you?

935
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,699
Yes.

936
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:22,498
It's so artistic.

937
00:40:22,498 --> 00:40:24,018
I loved it.

938
00:40:24,018 --> 00:40:26,851
You are also very good at telling stories.

939
00:40:26,851 --> 00:40:28,059
Thanks.

940
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,179
I have friends waiting for me over there.

941
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:31,018
You guys have fun, alright?

942
00:40:31,018 --> 00:40:33,299
- We will talk later, goodbye.
- Okay.

943
00:40:34,538 --> 00:40:36,219
We'll go inside for a visit.

944
00:40:36,219 --> 00:40:37,378
Please.

945
00:40:37,378 --> 00:40:37,938
- Take your time looking.
- Let's go.

946
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:39,378
See you in a bit.

947
00:40:39,378 --> 00:40:41,059
- See you later.
- See you later.

948
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:42,579
These current exhibitions

949
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:44,938
lack depth.

950
00:40:44,938 --> 00:40:47,699
They are like children's doodles.

951
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:48,858
The gallery I visited

952
00:40:48,858 --> 00:40:52,699
at Xinghao a while ago was the same.

953
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:53,858
Those works, well,

954
00:40:53,858 --> 00:40:55,538
truly are ordinary.

955
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:59,739
But the curator oversells
the stories to the skies.

956
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:02,739
This person

957
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:04,139
is so two-faced.

958
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:06,498
Does he hear himself?

959
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:08,099
Don't take it to heart.

960
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,299
Of course, I won't.

961
00:41:10,299 --> 00:41:12,858
This person is a typical art circle hustler.

962
00:41:12,858 --> 00:41:14,179
Arguing with such people

963
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:15,299
is a waste of time.

964
00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:17,139
That curator from Xinghao

965
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:18,619
brought a date.

966
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:20,378
He has quite a background,

967
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:21,739
a GT racer.

968
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:23,299
I even went to watch

969
00:41:23,299 --> 00:41:24,898
this racer's final race last year.

970
00:41:24,898 --> 00:41:26,378
At that time, the media

971
00:41:26,378 --> 00:41:27,739
kept promoting him,

972
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:32,018
claiming he was a rising star.

973
00:41:33,418 --> 00:41:34,818
But unexpectedly in the end,

974
00:41:34,818 --> 00:41:36,818
he lost to a Japanese.

975
00:41:40,059 --> 00:41:43,139
All the hope placed on him

976
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:45,938
- turned to bubbles.
- Exactly.

977
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:49,818
Indeed,

978
00:41:49,818 --> 00:41:53,938
last year, I lost to a Japanese racer.

979
00:41:53,938 --> 00:41:56,378
This year, he will also be there.

980
00:41:58,858 --> 00:42:00,699
Do you think he trains regularly?

981
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:02,139
Let's go and look at something else.

982
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:03,259
I agree.

983
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:04,259
Are racers

984
00:42:04,259 --> 00:42:06,099
always so idle?

985
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:08,018
Why are you at an exhibition

986
00:42:08,018 --> 00:42:09,858
when you should practice your skills well?

987
00:42:09,858 --> 00:42:11,579
What's his actual purpose?

988
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,579
To pick up girls.

989
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:15,818
I think you are the idle one.

990
00:42:15,818 --> 00:42:17,579
If you're invited to an exhibition,
just focus on that.

991
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,538
But all you do is gossip. What the heck?

992
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:21,059
- No…
- Elvis is here today

993
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:22,458
not because he's idle,

994
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:25,818
he's here with his girlfriend.
Do you have a problem with that?

995
00:42:27,139 --> 00:42:29,619
Are you familiar with him?
Do you even know him?

996
00:42:29,619 --> 00:42:31,219
If you don't know him, don't talk nonsense.

997
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:32,498
Who gave you the right?

998
00:42:32,498 --> 00:42:34,699
True, there's a saying, what is it?

999
00:42:34,699 --> 00:42:36,818
Judge others by oneself.

1000
00:42:36,818 --> 00:42:38,338
I've really never seen such a gossip.

1001
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:40,538
You're eye-opening.

1002
00:42:40,538 --> 00:42:42,259
Oh my, I just can't stand
people with foul mouths.

1003
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:44,259
Makes you want to throw up.

1004
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:45,858
Let's move to a place with fresher air.

1005
00:42:45,858 --> 00:42:48,043
Okay.

1006
00:42:49,338 --> 00:42:51,498
Michelle, we're leaving first.

1007
00:42:51,498 --> 00:42:53,498
I'll ask you out when I have time.

1008
00:42:53,498 --> 00:42:56,018
- Sure, no problem, there's always time.
- Okay.

1009
00:42:56,018 --> 00:42:56,779
- See you.
- Let's have a meal someday.

1010
00:42:56,779 --> 00:42:58,818
- Bye.
- Leaving so soon?

1011
00:42:59,517 --> 00:43:04,349
