One more question. You won today,

266
00:14:59,537 --> 00:15:01,257
is it because Doumoto Toma,
last year's champion,

267

didn't participate in today's performance race?

268

According to what we know,
in this year's competition,

269
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:06,096
if the two of you were to compete each other,

270

00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:14,681
Sorry for being late today.

359
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:15,720
It is my fault.

360
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,520
I know that many companies
would like to work with you.

361
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,040
But still,

362
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,520
please take a look at this proposal.

363
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,080
Let's discuss this next time we meet. Okay?

364
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,040
I have a very important client to attend to.

365
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,441
Sorry, sorry.

366
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:27,000
Just take a moment of your time.

367
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,401
I rushed over this morning,

368
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:29,441
just to show

369
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:30,520
that EMG really values

370
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,720
the cooperation with you.

371
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,201
Well, take this proposal

372
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:34,280
and take a look at it with Casey, okay?

373
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,080
Sorry for canceling the meeting.
It was Casey's decision.

374
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,040
Once she confirms the time, I'll notify you.

375
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,641
If you have any problem here,

376
00:20:39,641 --> 00:20:40,681
you can ask me for help.

377
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:44,040
But I do have work to do. Excuse me.

378
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:49,161
I'm really sorry.
It's my fault for being late today.

379
00:20:49,161 --> 00:20:50,361
But that was my personal fault.

380
00:20:50,361 --> 00:20:52,441
Our company is very capable

381
00:20:52,441 --> 00:20:55,320
and sincere in undertaking this project.
But because today…

382
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,401
How about this? I know you are very busy.

383
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:59,361
Tell me, when will Casey finish her work?

384
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:01,361
Then I could come for another visit.

385
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:02,520
Or I could wait until you finish work.

386
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,401
I could wait until you are available.

387
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:05,560
Junhao, look here.

388
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,121
Junhao, look over here. Junhao.

389
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:09,201
Look at the camera, Junhao.

390
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:13,040
Junhao, Junhao.

391
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,480
Thank you.

392
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,841
Good afternoon, Mr. Han.

393
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:19,480
I am the PR coordinator, Mandy.

394
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,601
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

395
00:21:20,601 --> 00:21:22,280
- Mandy.
- Sorry, are you okay?

396
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,320
Excuse me.

397
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,000
- Mr. Han, this way please.
- Please feel free to contact me.

398
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,441
- Mandarin is fine.
- Excuse me, please let me through.

399
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:27,752
- Okay, Mr. Han.
- Mandy.

400
00:21:27,752 --> 00:21:29,601
It's an honor that you choose
to stay in Xinghao Hotel.

401
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,760
If you have any problems during your stay,
please let me know.

402
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,840
Don't push.

403
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,760
The reason he changed the hotel
is that it was too noisy before.

404
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,681
He's a light sleeper, so…

405
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:54,800
Make sure the room is on the high floor,

406
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,881
not facing the street.

407
00:21:56,881 --> 00:21:58,560
And,

408
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,040
prepare two latex pillows,

409
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,240
and two goose down pillows.

410
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,401
Besides,

411
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:05,961
do not place any aromatherapy in the room.

412
00:22:05,961 --> 00:22:07,240
As for breakfast,

413
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,641
it must be delivered to the room.

414
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:10,560
- That's all.
- Okay.

415
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,040
The room is ready.

416
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,401
Housekeeping will send up the pillows later.

417
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:15,601
Okay, thank you.

418
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,240
Mr. Han.

419
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,441
Mr. Han.

420
00:22:18,441 --> 00:22:20,520
The room is ready.

421
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,576
Okay.

422
00:22:26,961 --> 00:22:28,961
- We can do it ourselves.
- We can do it ourselves. Thank you.

423
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:30,480
- Okay.
- Do you know the room number?

424
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,528
Yes.

425
00:22:31,528 --> 00:22:34,401
Mr. Han, wish you a pleasant night.

426
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,240
Mandy, Mandy.

427
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,881
Give me one more chance, okay?

428
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:42,161
I'm sorry to delay the meeting.

429
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,201
If I don't do anything,

430
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:45,800
I can't explain to the company.

431
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,121
You and Casey just take a look at the proposal.

432
00:22:47,121 --> 00:22:48,240
Okay? Just take a look at it.

433
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,441
Consider it as an option.

434
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,921
Okay.

435
00:22:54,921 --> 00:22:58,401
Thank you.

436
00:23:03,835 --> 00:23:13,576
♫ Remember when everything was bright and new ♫

437
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:22,681
♫ Then walk to the little park ♫

438
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:25,040
I just gave the proposal to Mandy.

439
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,560
I was just about to report to you.

440
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,760
What did she say?

441
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,520
Did she schedule a meeting time?

442
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,401
Casey has not yet responded yet.

443
00:23:32,401 --> 00:23:34,800
But tomorrow morning,
their PR department will come downstairs,

444
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,000
to meet a group of racers.

445
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,800
So I plan to go down early and wait.

446
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,040
I'll find a way to meet with Casey.

447
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,641
Alright, stop crying. Alright.

448
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:45,520
Mai, I entrusted you with the project

449
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,961
because I trust you.

450
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:48,681
But now you haven't even met the person,

451
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:50,361
and you don't know how to proceed,

452
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:51,641
can only wait in the lobby.

453
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:53,560
How can I trust you?

454
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,201
I'm sorry.

455
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:58,280
It's all my fault.

456
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,161
Alright. It's useless to say so.

457
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:02,401
Anyway, whatever results you get,

458
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:04,080
let me know first thing.

459
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,560
I'll also try to make some contacts.

460
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,800
- Okay.
- That's it for now.

461
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,961
Okay, I…

462
00:24:19,016 --> 00:24:20,016
Hello, Mom.

463
00:24:20,016 --> 00:24:22,536
Hello, Mai, have you eaten yet?

464
00:24:22,536 --> 00:24:24,496
I'm working right now. I'll eat in a bit.

465
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,256
Did you add that person on WeChat yet?

466
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:28,536
What?

467
00:24:28,536 --> 00:24:31,577
The guy your cousin introduced to you.

468
00:24:31,577 --> 00:24:33,577
It seems

469
00:24:33,577 --> 00:24:35,617
there is such a thing.

470
00:24:35,617 --> 00:24:38,617
I'm too busy today to deal with it.

471
00:24:38,617 --> 00:24:40,496
You are not sincere.

472
00:24:40,496 --> 00:24:42,137
I know you want to focus on your career,

473
00:24:42,137 --> 00:24:43,937
don't want to get married so early.

474
00:24:43,937 --> 00:24:45,177
But I am not that

475
00:24:45,177 --> 00:24:46,976
conserved, right?

476
00:24:46,976 --> 00:24:49,736
I'm not forcing you to get married.

477
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:53,377
Or you can get a man to marry into our family.

478
00:24:53,377 --> 00:24:56,097
Hey, Mai.

479
00:24:56,097 --> 00:24:58,216
I know, Mom. I I'll deal with it when I'm free.

480
00:24:58,216 --> 00:24:59,337
Once I have a moment, I will…

481
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:01,337
I will get back.

482
00:25:01,337 --> 00:25:02,496
At the very least,

483
00:25:02,496 --> 00:25:04,177
when you work all night,

484
00:25:04,177 --> 00:25:05,976
there's someone to pour you a glass of water,

485
00:25:05,976 --> 00:25:07,857
to take care of your meals and daily life.

486
00:25:07,857 --> 00:25:10,097
- And when you get sick, he can give you a towel.
- Yes.

487
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:11,417
Mom, I could

488
00:25:11,417 --> 00:25:13,776
hire a housekeeper to do all that.

489
00:25:13,776 --> 00:25:16,456
- You've found one?
- I mean,

490
00:25:16,456 --> 00:25:17,657
when I finish work,

491
00:25:17,657 --> 00:25:19,657
I will definitely add his WeChat.

492
00:25:19,657 --> 00:25:20,696
And when I go back,

493
00:25:20,696 --> 00:25:22,296
I will definitely ask him out for dinner.

494
00:25:22,296 --> 00:25:23,657
Alright. Let me tell you…

495
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:25,056
Mom, are you tired?

496
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,736
Aren't you going to sleep this late?

497
00:25:26,736 --> 00:25:28,377
- I'm not tired.
- You need to rest more.

498
00:25:28,377 --> 00:25:30,776
Health is important. Don't exhaust yourself.
Hurry up and go to sleep.

499
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:32,456
I dance every day. I'm in good health.

500
00:25:32,456 --> 00:25:34,937
Good night, Mom. Bye.

501
00:25:34,937 --> 00:25:37,000
I haven't finished.

502
00:25:53,657 --> 00:25:54,817
Hello, Miss Mai.

503
00:25:54,817 --> 00:25:56,736
I've sent the proposal to Casey this afternoon,

504
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,976
yet there is no respond yet.

505
00:26:02,817 --> 00:26:04,137
Thank you.

506
00:26:04,137 --> 00:26:05,216
May I ask if you'll be in the lobby

507
00:26:05,216 --> 00:26:06,456
at ten tomorrow?

508
00:26:06,456 --> 00:26:07,857
I'd like to apologize in person.

509
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,417
I hope you can give us one more chance.

510
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:23,577
In this year's competition,

511
00:26:23,577 --> 00:26:25,177
if you two were to compete each other,

512
00:26:25,177 --> 00:26:26,177
your scores and performance

513
00:26:26,177 --> 00:26:27,177
would fall behind his.

514
00:26:27,177 --> 00:26:28,817
If he comes, do you have the confidence

515
00:26:28,817 --> 00:26:30,897
to win today's race?

516
00:26:30,897 --> 00:26:32,857
Doumoto has won the championship!

517
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:35,097
Han Junhao has ranked second.

518
00:26:35,097 --> 00:26:36,817
Once again, Han Junhao

519
00:26:36,817 --> 00:26:38,577
has lost to the young Doumoto.

520
00:26:38,577 --> 00:26:39,776
He has done so

521
00:26:39,776 --> 00:26:41,577
in a number of events this year.

522
00:26:41,577 --> 00:26:43,056
Now the age problem

523
00:26:43,056 --> 00:26:44,696
has become the biggest difficulty

524
00:26:44,696 --> 00:26:46,177
that Han Junhao is facing.

525
00:26:46,177 --> 00:26:48,417
And it's still hard at this point to determine

526
00:26:48,417 --> 00:26:51,657
if he will perform well in the next game.

527
00:27:24,532 --> 00:27:26,657
[Mr. Chen]

528
00:27:26,657 --> 00:27:29,817
Training tomorrow at 7 AM. Go to bed early.

529
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:32,736
Got it. See you tomorrow.

530
00:27:41,377 --> 00:27:43,617
Sir, hello. I called the cab.

531
00:27:43,617 --> 00:27:45,577
I'd like to go to this restaurant.
Do you know it?

532
00:27:45,577 --> 00:27:47,736
Miss, do you have cash?

533
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:48,976
My e-payment isn't working.

534
00:27:48,976 --> 00:27:50,137
Cash?

535
00:27:50,137 --> 00:27:51,456
I don't have any cash on me.

536
00:27:51,456 --> 00:27:53,456
Neither WeChat nor Alipay works?

537
00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:54,592
Sorry.

538
00:27:54,592 --> 00:27:55,976

and all other customers
need to maintain absolute quiet.

643
00:37:09,857 --> 00:37:11,176
However, the hotel's occupancy rate

644
00:37:11,176 --> 00:37:12,417
has already exceeded 80 percent.

645
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:14,217

00:37:15,616 --> 00:37:17,976
can meet such demands?

648
00:37:20,217 --> 00:37:21,777
But we must achieve it.

649
00:37:21,777 --> 00:37:25,016

to get him the rear room

651
00:37:27,257 --> 00:37:28,496
First, seal off the isolation room.

652
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:32,056
- Let me know if the occupancy rate is almost full.
- Okay.

653
00:37:32,056 --> 00:37:34,656
Besides, share the accommodation demands

654
00:37:34,656 --> 00:37:36,056
of other racers to the housing department.

655
00:37:36,056 --> 00:37:38,697
- Satisfy them if the requests are not too much.
- Okay.

656
00:37:38,697 --> 00:37:40,016
Remind the staff in the housing department

657
00:37:40,016 --> 00:37:41,976
to remember the customers' service requirements

658
00:37:41,976 --> 00:37:43,937

661
00:37:46,217 --> 00:37:48,417
- remember them all clearly.
- Okay.

662
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:49,857
Do not disturb customers unless necessary.

663
00:37:49,857 --> 00:37:51,976
- Okay?
- Okay, Casey.

664
00:37:51,976 --> 00:37:53,656
We have already contacted three hotels,

665
00:37:53,656 --> 00:37:55,297
but they have not given us

666
00:37:55,297 --> 00:37:56,656
a proper response to our proposal.

667
00:37:56,656 --> 00:37:58,697
So, we are still…

668
00:37:58,697 --> 00:37:59,857
There are three rooms left.

669
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:00,857
Right, three rooms.

00:38:00,857 --> 00:38:03,056
- But among them…
- Hello, you are Casey, right?

I am Mai Youge, Customer Manager from EMG.

672
00:38:05,737 --> 00:38:07,456
I won't take up too much of your time.
I just wanted to confirm with you

673
00:38:07,456 --> 00:38:09,257
whether you have received that proposal.

674
00:38:09,257 --> 00:38:11,616
I've read it. It's nothing new,

00:38:11,616 --> 00:38:12,656

If there is an opportunity in the future,

678
00:38:15,217 --> 00:38:17,857
- I hope we could work together.
- Excuse me.

679
00:38:17,857 --> 00:38:18,857
I wonder if you have ever seen

00:38:18,857 --> 00:38:21,136
the Aman Hotel's promo.

681
00:38:21,136 --> 00:38:22,377
Go ahead.

682
00:38:22,377 --> 00:38:23,897
The reason they are different from other hotels

683
00:38:23,897 --> 00:38:25,817
is that they have integrated
the essence and elements

684
00:38:25,817 --> 00:38:26,976
of each city

685
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:28,857
into their own promo.

686
00:38:28,857 --> 00:38:30,377
I wonder if the Xinghao Hotel's promo

687
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:31,377
can also be

688
00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:32,897
no longer focus on

689
00:38:32,897 --> 00:38:35,056
introducing the hotel itself,

690
00:38:35,056 --> 00:38:36,576
but instead tie the city of Macau

691
00:38:36,576 --> 00:38:39,176
closely with the Xinghao Hotel.

692
00:38:39,176 --> 00:38:40,297
That means,

693
00:38:40,297 --> 00:38:41,456
the final impression this city leaves on people

694
00:38:41,456 --> 00:38:43,016
is the impression that Xinghao Hotel

695
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:44,056
will leave

696
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:46,176
on people.

697
00:38:46,897 --> 00:38:49,136
It sounds great.

698
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:52,536
But the key is how to implement it.

699
00:38:54,136 --> 00:38:55,937
I admit that our current understanding of Macau

700
00:38:55,937 --> 00:38:57,337
is still quite superficial.

701
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:59,337
But I hope you could trust us
and give us some time.

702
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,496
We will definitely take time

703
00:39:00,496 --> 00:39:02,496
to explore Macau and understand Macau.

704
00:39:02,496 --> 00:39:04,496
Based on our own understanding,
we will distill the highlights

705
00:39:04,496 --> 00:39:05,737
and create a new and improved proposal for you.

706
00:39:05,737 --> 00:39:07,976
So, how much time do you need?

707
00:39:09,576 --> 00:39:10,817
Three days.

708
00:39:10,817 --> 00:39:12,616
Give me the new proposal in three days.

709
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:13,777
By then,

710
00:39:13,777 --> 00:39:15,976
I hope you could impress us.

711
00:39:18,304 --> 00:39:19,897
Thank you.

712
00:39:19,897 --> 00:39:22,217
I will certainly not let you down.

713
00:39:24,136 --> 00:39:25,536
In three days,
we have to hand over the proposal.

714
00:39:25,536 --> 00:39:27,576
So you have to work overtime these two days.

715
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:28,857
It might be a bit tough.

716
00:39:28,857 --> 00:39:30,257
And I need a local guide here in Macau.

717
00:39:30,257 --> 00:39:34,056
Please hire one for me
and claim the fee to the company.

718
00:39:34,737 --> 00:39:37,496
Hello?

719
00:39:38,897 --> 00:39:40,904
Can you hear me?

720
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:49,160
Morning.

721
00:39:50,217 --> 00:39:53,697
Thank you. It's good that I met you yesterday.

722
00:39:53,697 --> 00:39:55,857
Can I ask you where I can fix my phone?

723
00:39:55,857 --> 00:39:58,616
My phone is broken.

724
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:01,320
It's broken?

725
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,592
I'll take you there.

726
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:13,496
Okay.

727
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:16,136
Don't worry, it can definitely be fixed.

728
00:40:17,297 --> 00:40:20,456
I've just already contacted the boss.
He's there.

729
00:40:31,377 --> 00:40:33,257
Jin.

730
00:40:33,257 --> 00:40:35,257
Le, what's wrong?

731
00:40:35,257 --> 00:40:37,257
My friend's phone is broken.

732
00:40:37,257 --> 00:40:39,857
Please help check it out.

733
00:40:41,016 --> 00:40:43,016
What happened to it?

734
00:40:44,377 --> 00:40:46,377
He said, what happened to it?

735
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:47,897
Last night,
it accidentally fell into the water.

736
00:40:47,897 --> 00:40:49,176
But last night, it's still working.

737
00:40:49,176 --> 00:40:52,616
But this morning,
it's dead and couldn't turn on.

738
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,297
You should dry it with a hairdryer last night.

739
00:40:55,297 --> 00:40:57,016
Now it must be the main board that's broken.

740
00:40:57,016 --> 00:40:58,337
Water got inside,

741
00:40:58,337 --> 00:40:59,576
and it stopped working.

742
00:40:59,576 --> 00:41:01,576
- It needs to be taken apart.
- What?

743
00:41:01,576 --> 00:41:03,417
The main board got wet,
and it needs to be taken apart.

744
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,176
How long will it take?

745
00:41:05,176 --> 00:41:06,576
Tomorrow. My worker just

746
00:41:06,576 --> 00:41:07,656
- Tomorrow?
- went to Zhuhai to get stock.

747
00:41:07,656 --> 00:41:09,777
Tomorrow is a bit too late.
Can you get it faster?

748
00:41:09,777 --> 00:41:11,576
- Tomorrow.
- I can pay extra.

749
00:41:11,576 --> 00:41:14,048
- No, no.
- Hold on.

750
00:41:14,048 --> 00:41:15,656
Do me a favor.

751
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:17,136
You can do it quick.

752
00:41:17,136 --> 00:41:18,656
Can I come pick it up tonight?

753
00:41:18,656 --> 00:41:20,417
I have to meet someone for tea this afternoon.

754
00:41:20,417 --> 00:41:21,697
She is in a hurry to get work done.

755
00:41:21,697 --> 00:41:25,096
You can go drink tea every day.

756
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:26,136
I'll treat you to a meal some other day.

757
00:41:26,136 --> 00:41:27,616
Have something tasty, okay?

758
00:41:27,616 --> 00:41:29,176
Okay, it's settled.

759
00:41:29,176 --> 00:41:31,257
You can take it tonight.

760
00:41:31,257 --> 00:41:32,576
What?

761
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:34,176
- Tonight?
- Okay. Lobster risotto.

762
00:41:34,176 --> 00:41:35,937
- Got it. No big deal.
- You promise me.

763
00:41:35,937 --> 00:41:37,616
- Lobster risotto.
- Let's go.

764
00:41:37,616 --> 00:41:38,616
Thank you.

765
00:41:38,616 --> 00:41:40,377
- I can pay extra.
- Come to get the phone at seven.

766
00:41:40,377 --> 00:41:42,217
- Seven.
- Okay, got it.

767
00:41:42,217 --> 00:41:44,257
This brat!

768
00:41:46,257 --> 00:41:48,360
Where are you off to next?

769
00:41:48,897 --> 00:41:51,937
Next, I need to go scout the location
and work on the proposal.

770
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,257
Then your phone won't be fixed that soon.

771
00:41:54,257 --> 00:41:55,817
How do you scout the location?

772
00:41:55,817 --> 00:41:57,937
Without a phone,
then I can't contact the local guide.

773
00:41:57,937 --> 00:41:59,857
But I've actually done my research
on where I'm going.

774
00:41:59,857 --> 00:42:01,056
And I have drawn the map.

775
00:42:01,056 --> 00:42:03,297
So do you need a local guide?

776
00:42:03,817 --> 00:42:06,337
Yes. There are so many places to scout,

777
00:42:06,337 --> 00:42:09,096
I think having a local guide
would definitely be more efficient. But now…

778
00:42:09,096 --> 00:42:11,337
I can be your local guide.

779
00:42:12,136 --> 00:42:14,184
You?

780
00:42:14,697 --> 00:42:16,136
Anyway, I have nothing to do.

781
00:42:16,136 --> 00:42:18,257
I can take you around.

782
00:42:18,257 --> 00:42:21,176
- Don't you have to work?
- No.

783
00:42:22,217 --> 00:42:24,296
Expensive?

784
00:42:25,697 --> 00:42:27,257
I think you can handle.

785
00:42:27,257 --> 00:42:28,496
Anyway, you can

786
00:42:28,496 --> 00:42:31,697
- pay extra.
- Can you issue an invoice?

787
00:42:33,576 --> 00:42:35,737
Money doesn't matter. Alright?

788
00:42:35,737 --> 00:42:37,016
Alright.

789
00:42:37,016 --> 00:42:39,377
- How about you treat me to a meal?
- No way.

790
00:42:39,377 --> 00:42:41,096
I should still pay you
the fee for a local guide.

791
00:42:41,096 --> 00:42:42,897
Otherwise, I wouldn't dare hire you.

792
00:42:42,897 --> 00:42:44,897
- Okay, that's settled then.
- Okay.

793
00:42:44,897 --> 00:42:46,136
So, where do you want to go first?

794
00:42:46,136 --> 00:42:48,544
All the places I need to go today are here.

795
00:42:48,544 --> 00:42:51,528
[Roadmap]

796
00:42:53,777 --> 00:42:55,777
Classic.

797
00:42:56,337 --> 00:42:57,616
I'm familiar with it. I'll take you there.

798
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:00,148
- Let's go.
- Okay.
