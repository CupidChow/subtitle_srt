<i>[Begin Again]</i>

2
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,976
Come in.

3
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,040
Ms. Tang, why are you looking for me
in the dead of night?

4
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,719
Miss Xu Jiajia, you aren't getting
married until tomorrow.

5
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:54,319
And I can't look for you now?

6
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,959
You're unpredictable.

7
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,480
What if you suddenly change your mind

8
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,760
and take me back to Shanghai?

9
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,464
If you keep this up, I'm leaving.

10
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,640
Don't disturb anyone, come in quickly.

11
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,959
I want to have a quick chat with you.

12
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
Being so reluctant.

13
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,168
Ouch.

14
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:15,840
<i>[Episode 17]</i>

15
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,024
What is this?

16
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,808
Open it.

17
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,879
Although you advocate for a simple wedding,

18
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,159
I think this tradition of combing the hair

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,280
is something I don't want to let go of.

20
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,319
Did you also have this ceremony
when you married Dad?

21
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,712
Of course.

22
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,759
So did Grandma comb your hair?

23
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,800
Speaking of which, it's really a shame

24
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,599
that your grandma

25
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,479
didn't get to see you in your bridal attire.

26
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,360
Otherwise, she'd definitely be grinning

27
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,719
with her toothless mouth.

28
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,000
But it's fine.

29
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,919
She can see it all from heaven.

30
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,800
Right, she can see it from above.

31
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,360
Enough talk, or we'll miss the auspicious time.

32
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,448
Come on, put down your bag.

33
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,360
First brush to the end.

34
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:19,800
Second brush to the brows white as snow.

35
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:30,079
Third brush for children
and grandchildren all around.

36
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:46,639
In the blink of an eye,
my daughter has grown so much.

37
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,079
My daughter is getting married tomorrow.

38
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,319
Why suddenly so sentimental?

39
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
I thought about it carefully.

40
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:11,959
The last time I combed your hair,

41
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:15,639
you were probably only
seven or eight years old.

42
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:17,160
Every day, you asked me

43
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,920
to tie your hair full of little braids.

44
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,079
Because it's pretty.

45
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,104
Yeah.

46
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,439
It doesn't seem like a few years have passed,

47
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,360
but how have you grown so big?

48
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,192
Mom.

49
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,680
No matter how much I grow,
I'll always be your daughter.

50
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,879
Nothing will change.

51
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,879
Two crybabies.

52
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,560
Who's that? Bad timing.

53
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,959
Come on, wipe your face.

54
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,024
So ugly.

55
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,128
Who is it?

56
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:16,439
- Come on.
- Ms. Wei.

57
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,560
Come on in.

58
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,959
I brought a gift for Jiajia.

59
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,800
Could you give it to her for me?

60
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,120
If you've brought a gift for Jiajia,

61
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,959
you should give it to her in person.

62
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,600
- She's inside.
- Oh, she's in your room.

63
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,959
- Jiajia.
- Jiajia.

64
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,639
I heard there's a gift. Is it for me?

65
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,839
- Of course.
- Of course, it's for you.

66
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,040
You are the most important person today.

67
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,439
- Thank you.
- Go ahead and open it.

68
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:52,360
I mean you should treat Li Meng nicely.

69
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,519
Whether a woman is happy or not,

70
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,560
you can tell by her smile.

71
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,839
But she smiles every day.

72
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,360
That's because she's pleasing you.

73
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,480
Another cup of pure drink, please.

74
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,568
Alright, sir.

75
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,112
Okay, thank you.

76
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,439
Professor Xu, what a coincidence.

77
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:43,519
Do you still remember me?

78
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,608
Chen.

79
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,368
Hello, hello.

80
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,079
Hello, could I have the same drink, please?

81
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,079
Sure.

82
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,136
Thank you.

83
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,648
Cheers.

84
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,544
Thanks.

85
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,079
Professor Xu, I wonder if it's convenient
for me to take up some of your time.

86
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:22,800
Go ahead.

87
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,240
I've heard that the variety show 'Game Theory'

88
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
has invited you to be a guest.

89
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,639
And you seem to have declined them.

90
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,639
Chen, what does this have to do with your job?

91
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,159
Well, to be frank with you,

92
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,440
Ms. Wei has invested in Tianqin Entertainment.

93
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,320
Their annual report is related to me.

94
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,712
So this is what she meant
when she said "our future".

95
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:53,399
What?

96
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,000
Nothing. Well,

97
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,159
So if I…

98
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,240
If I go, their performance

99
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,000
this year will improve.

100
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,159
That's for sure.

101
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,480
That variety show now

102
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,639
is missing someone like you who is

103
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,039
both refined and proper,

104
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,559
authoritative and witty,

105
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,480
with good image and great temperament.

106
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,519
To be honest with you,

107
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,440
we've looked through the professors
from universities all over the country,

108
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,480
you're the most suitable one.

109
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,639
The unparalleled choice, you know?

110
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,639
You're the only option.

111
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,159
Chen, Chen, you, you…

112
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,279
You, you, you're such a smooth talker.

113
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,480
Let me give you a proper introduction.

114
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,559
It's a talk show variety program,

115
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,879
and they want your perspective as an economist

116
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,200
to interpret modern young people's
emotional lives.

117
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,879
Okay.

118
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,240
I'm very happy to hear
the praise you just gave me.

119
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,352
But,

120
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,159
as for the topic of relationships,

121
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,840
to go exchange and discuss them, right?

122
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,519
I'm really not cut out for that.

123
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,679
Professor Xu, young people these days

124
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,120
don't like to be preached to.

125
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,519
But if there's someone like you

126
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,879
a professor of economics
with a fulfilled emotional life

127
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,320
to share views with them…

128
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,519
Fulfilled…

129
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,159
Many young people would love to have that.

130
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,360
Young people these days
don't necessarily have to experience

131
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,080
dramatic ups and downs in relationships.

132
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,080
The quiet and ordinary is also real.

133
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:34,120
But even the quiet life has its troubles.

134
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,799
As long as it's someone you care about deeply,

135
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,639
worries are just on the surface.

136
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,480
Deep inside, you're still happy.

137
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,440
<i>Most importantly, keep her in your heart</i>

138
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,399
<i>so that she can feel it.</i>

139
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,816
Chen.

140
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,559
Actually, Tang Wei talked to me

141
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,919
about this variety show yesterday.

142
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,799
I hadn't thought it through at the time.

143
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,799
But now I have an answer.

144
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,784
Please.

145
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,312
I can do it.

146
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:36,879
That's amazing.

147
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:40,559
Professor Xu, I'd like to toast to you
on behalf of Ms. Wei.

148
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,399
Actually, Tang Wei also said
some things to me yesterday.

149
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,120
I think she is right.

150
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,720
Sometimes, I neglect the most
important people around me.

151
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,039
I take their kindness toward me

152
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,360
for granted.

153
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:18,919
Chen, have you read Eluard's poetry?

154
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
Eluard says

155
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,639
that men only grow old but never grow up.

156
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,679
Tang Wei is right.

157
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,440
After so many years, I am

158
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,679
still a child.

159
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,519
Professor Xu, please don't joke about me.

160
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,639
I'm the child in front of you.

161
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,072
I'm the child.

162
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,840
Come on, cheers to being a child.

163
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,912
A child.

164
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,000
Let's ask the little bride. How do you feel?

165
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,519
I'm a little excited,

166
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,440
but also a bit scared.

167
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,120
How about you? Were you the same
before you got married?

168
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,720
We have all been through it.

169
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,039
It's not a big deal.

170
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,759
If it's wrong, it's wrong, right?

171
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,200
If you feel that being together with someone

172
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,840
is not as good as being happy alone,

173
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,960
just split up.

174
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,480
Your mom is doing quite well now, isn't she?

175
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,608
Jiajia.

176
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:55,840
Just listen to your own heart.

177
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,159
There are so many choices in life.

178
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,600
How can one think so far ahead?

179
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,919
Being happy in the moment
is the most important thing.

180
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,159
Just like what your mother said,

181
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:06,440
even if you choose wrongly, it's not
the end of the world.

182
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,759
But there is one thing that I do hope to see.

183
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,320
You are Xu Jiajia.

184
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:17,879
You should be yourself.

185
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:23,840
- To Mom.
- Come on.

186
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,879
Come on.

187
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:26,039
To Ms. Meng.

188
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,639
I have something I want to talk to you about.

189
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,559
Hao told me

190
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,279
that if I didn't want to work
after getting married,

191
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,080
I could be a full-time housewife.

192
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,360
What do you say?

193
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,200
How much money does he give you a month, huh?

194
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:08,720
The offer is quite generous.

195
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,856
No.

196
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,000
No matter how good the conditions are,

197
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,080
you cannot be a housewife.

198
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,320
Once you become a housewife,

199
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,519
you'll lose your own space, you know?

200
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,480
At least, you must have a job of your own.

201
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,279
Aren't I the most typical case of failure?

202
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,279
No, Meng.

203
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,480
I don't think you are entirely correct.

204
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,240
Work is also very time-consuming and laborious.

205
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,559
I feel that I'm under a lot of pressure.

206
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,679
Think about it, after Jiajia gets married,

207
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:39,159
she will have to manage her family, while
taking care of the children and her career.

208
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:41,440
Won't that be exhausting?

209
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,528
So I think

210
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,080
career-oriented girls are not
suitable for marriage.

211
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,759
I still insist that being
a housewife is not an option.

212
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,279
Jiajia, I insist that…

213
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:53,759
It's really not what you think.

214
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,279
If Jiajia became a housewife,

215
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,440
her world would be confined.

216
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,320
She'll be entering a cage, you know?

217
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,352
How could it be?

218
00:16:00,352 --> 00:16:01,600
How is being a career woman better?

219
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,080
When working, she'll be busy every day.

220
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,600
Don't go out to work.

221
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,679
I see.

222
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:09,320
You two are just jealous

223
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,440
of the path you didn't choose.

224
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,120
It seems like it.

225
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,840
But Jiajia, let me tell you,

226
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,440
no matter which path you take,

227
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,399
I will always be there
supporting you from behind.

228
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,000
So will Meng.

229
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,679
You have to be happy.

230
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,879
I'm blissfully happy.

231
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,879
Come on, let's have a drink.

232
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,880
Why are you always right?

233
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,576
Meng.

234
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,352
Meng?

235
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,000
Meng, what's wrong? Meng.

236
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,759
Xu Jianming.

237
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:26,640
Meng, what happened?

238
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,079
Let's break up.

239
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,112
What did you say?

240
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:31,872
I said,

241
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,359
let's break up.

242
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
How… how many drinks did you have?

243
00:18:41,024 --> 00:18:42,079
You… Wait.

244
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,200
Are you sober right now?

245
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,839
I know what I'm saying.

246
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,440
It's been over a decade.

247
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,440
I've never been as sober as I am now.

248
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,319
Xu Jianming, I love you.

249
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,880
But in your eyes,

250
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,680
there's never been me.

251
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,039
Never.

252
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,880
Meng, Meng.

253
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,359
I'm sorry.

254
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:26,799
I didn't say all this

255
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,079
to accuse you.

256
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:31,039
- I know, I know.
- I understand.

257
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,200
I didn't do well enough.

258
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,312
I know.

259
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,799
You just don't love me anymore.

260
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
You just don't.

261
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,872
No.

262
00:19:53,248 --> 00:19:54,319
Meng, I…

263
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,160
It's just that I don't want
to continue living like this.

264
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,880
I don't want it to continue.

265
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,960
Let's just end it here.

I can't remember when was
the last time I tied a tie.

273
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,759
When we married? No, no, no.

274
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:44,359
It should be for Le's college graduation.

275
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,319
College graduation. It's been many years.

276
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,960
Time does fly.

277
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,920
You really have to accept getting old.

278
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,759
I haven't tied one in decades. Give me a hand.

279
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:55,872
Let me do it.

280
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,599
Let me do it.

281
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,559
You even got the left and right wrong.

282
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,920
Life is just like that.

283
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,319
One stage ends,

284
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,079
and a new stage begins.

285
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,480
You've said something true.

286
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,960
Only this time?

287
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,559
Now we must welcome a new stage,

288
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,880
becoming parents-in-law now.

289
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,904
Hearing you say that,

290
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,960
we've aged quite a bit,
haven't we, Father-in-law?

291
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
What's wrong, Mother-in-law?

292
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:27,200
Come on, hurry up.

293
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,200
We're late.

294
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,960
You are really excited today.

295

We are the hosts. We can't be late.

296
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,319
Yes, the hosts can't be late.

297
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,448

Okay, you look good.

Great, nice! Strike another pose.

Wait till you get married
and we'll see how you do.

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,880
So here I go.

370
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,728
Xu Jiajia.

371
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,319
I've always felt that life is a lonely journey.

372
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:00,279
In this vast world,

373
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,119
the relationships between people are all

374
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,248
temporary.

375
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,880
But then I met you.

376
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:14,640
When I was very confused, when I

377
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,000
didn't even want to face myself,

378
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,039
you were always there by my side.

379
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,559
In front of you, I have no
concealment and no disguise.

380
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,519
We can be ourselves sincerely.

381
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,839
Love actually requires a lot of courage

382
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:39,599
and a little bit of madness.

383
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,160
Love does not hesitate.

384
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,839
Love does not back down.

385
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,920
So I am very grateful

386
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,359
that at every crossroad

387
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:55,680
that might change our relationship,

388
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,480
we chose each other without hesitation.

389
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,759
So I really want to thank you.

390
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:07,519
Thank you for making me as brave as you.

391
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
Okay, that's it.

392
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,720
Great!

393
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,752
Well said.

394
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,480
Hao, do you remember that day?

395
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:32,680
I was leading a tour in Brazil,
and you were working in Macau.

396
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:36,519
I told you, I really wanted to eat that cake

397
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:38,440
you took me to eat in Macau.

398
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,240
And this person, with the cake I wanted,

399
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:47,279
flew across half the world to be by my side.

400
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,559
The cake melted.

401
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:53,680
And so did I.

402
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:06,599
You know that what I'm most nervous
about for the wedding is the vows.

403
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:10,079
I truly revised them over and over again.

404
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,960
One day, I fell asleep while writing them.

405
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,920
When I woke up the next day,

406
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,200
I found that he had crossed out what I wrote,

407
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,720
'I will be a good wife',

408
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:26,839
and he wrote,

409
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,519
'I hope you are not bound
by the identity of a wife,

410
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,559
to be forever free, and to always be yourself'.

411
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,799
So today, here, I also want to tell you

412
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,559
that I hope that in love,

413
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:47,480
you can freely be yourself.

414
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,839
And I will always protect you.

415
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:01,839
Awesome!

416
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:26,592
<i>♫ No safety net ♫</i>

417
00:30:26,592 --> 00:30:29,536

Okay, I hereby announce

421
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,759
that Xu Junhao and Xu Jiajia

422
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,000
are now officially pronounced husband and wife.

423
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,536

<i>♫ Into the depth ♫</i>

432
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,039
Would you like to go for a walk together?

433
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,688
Okay.

434
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,319
I am leaving tomorrow.

435
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,608
I know.

436
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,240
I feel like these few days in Macau

437
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,599
are so unreal, like a dream.

438
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,119
Who would have thought in just these few days,

439
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:42,440
I could meet such a group of people

440
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,240
and on the last day, to attend such a wedding?

441
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,784
Thank you for coming.

442
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,519
I also feel it's so surreal.

443
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,240
It feels like just yesterday, I was helping you
pick up your phone by the fountain.

444
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,480
And yet it also feels like we've known
each other for a very, very long time.

445
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,319
It's quite magical.

446
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,519
I don't want to leave here with regrets.

447
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,160
So I feel there are some things
that still need to be said.

448
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,224
Zhenzhen told me

449
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,480
that people need the right timing.

450
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:48,160
Earlier or later won't work.

451
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:53,519
About all those things you said
and the concerns you have,

452
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,680
I understand them all.

453
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,119
Perhaps, we both need to have more patience

454
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,319
to wait for our right moment to come.

455
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,960
I believe I will definitely see you again.

456
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,079
And when that time comes,

457
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,000
I won't let you leave.

458
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,960
- Cheers.
- Sure!

459
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,559
- Come on.
- Let's go.

460
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,976
Come on.

461
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:56,239
Casey.

462
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,760
The racers are checking out consecutively now.

463
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,559
It won't be very busy after this.

464
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:02,480
You all can finally finish work earlier now.

465
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,599
Casey, stop making fun of me.

466
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:07,000
You're going to America soon. Take care.

467
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,800
- You too.
- Cheers.

468
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:19,039
Did he leave too?

469
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,239
I don't know, maybe.

470
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,639
Are you two just going to leave it at that?

471
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,320
Actually, I don't get it.

472
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,119
If there's a misunderstanding,
why not clarify it?

473
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,320
Isn't it quite simple?

474
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,000
I don't know how to say it.

475
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,159
I've already messed it up.

476
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,719
And you know,

477
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,480
my intentions were not pure either.

478
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:45,000
Actually, our biggest problem now

479
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,599
is that our life rhythms are too different.

480
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:49,159
Temporarily speaking, neither
can accommodate the other.

481
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:52,256
Maybe in the future,

482
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,039
if fate allows, we'll meet again.

483
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:58,240
But not now.

484
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,280
I really think you're overthinking it.

485
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,199
If you love each other, stay together.
If not, then part ways.

486
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,400
You're clearly so in love,

487
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,239
why deny it?

488
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,392
Ladies and gentlemen.

489
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:15,559
The new father-in-law has
something to say, come on.

490
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,719
Yeah!

491
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,840
Yes!

492
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,679
I'm very grateful to everyone today

493
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,039
for taking the trouble to come
to Hao and Jiajia's wedding,

494
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,280
and together with us,

495
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,719
to share the most important day of their lives.

496
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:39,039
Hao's words earlier moved me deeply.

497
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:43,000
The most important thing in life
is not the result,

498
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,280
nor the process.

499
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:47,776
It's the companionship.

500
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,079
It's having someone by your side

501
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,239
right now, at this moment.

502
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,639
Whether it's the person you love,

503
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:04,440
a friend, or your partner.

504
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:07,639
Today, this toast

505
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,199
is to thank you for your companionship
right now, thank you.

506
00:37:12,736 --> 00:37:13,880
Thank you all.

507
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,039
Thank you.

508
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:16,119
Come, cheers.

509
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,816
Cheers.

510
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,360
You can really hold your liquor.

511
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,880
I hope everyone has an awesome night.

512
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,239
Mr. Xu said it well.

513
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,599
Then let me say a few words as well.

514
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:33,760
Okay, come on.

515
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,816
Yeah! Great.

516
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,960
Today, as a man

517
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,840
with some extra marriage experience,

518
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,639
I'd like to share a little tip of mine

519
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:50,880
with Jiajia and Xu.

520
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,320
Love begins with passion

521
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,880
but fails with monotony.

522
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:03,159
So never stop dating, no matter what.

523
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:06,039
Good! Great.

524
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:07,079
Yes, that's right.

525
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,400
Don't get hung up on what's right
or wrong in a marriage.

526
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,840
Because in life,

527
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,239
many things don't have clear-cut answers.

528
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:20,880
Instead, listen more.

529
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,760
You can act silly.

530
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,119
You can embarrass yourselves
by doing foolish things,

531
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,960
doing things that make the other person laugh.

532
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,280
Hug each other every day.

533
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:38,280
And finally, I'd like to tell
you one last thing.

534
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,679
Marrying Jiajia today,
you've really hit the jackpot.

535
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:43,920
Yes, that's true.

536
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,639
If I hear that Jiajia

537
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,519
has been wronged by you here,

538
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,719
it takes only three hours
to fly from Beijing to Macau.

539
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,232
I will come over to have tea with you.

540
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,320
Alright, alright.

541
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,599
Yeah!

542
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,599
Come on, the tea is here.

543
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,464
Thank you, thank you.

544
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,176
Come on, have a seat.

545
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:07,280
Rest assured.

546
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,639
If he does anything wrong to Jiajia,

547
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:11,800
I will be the first not to let him off.

548
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,639
- Mr. Qiang.
- Don't worry.

549
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,432

563
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,072

Congratulations, congratulations.

568
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,360
How long has it been since we last danced?

569
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:10,199
So sweet.

570
00:40:11,712 --> 00:40:18,272
<i>♫ You're in love with me ♫</i>

571
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:21,440

574
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,400
Meng.

575
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:43,639
May I have a dance with you?

576
00:40:45,664 --> 00:40:57,984
<i>♫ Loving you is a part of me ♫</i>

577
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,920
You spoke really well today.

578
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,320
Ironically, I failed to do any of them.

579
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,520
Meng.

580
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,559
Are you still willing to trust me?

581
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,480
Are you still worthy of my trust?

582
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:23,320
Cheers.

583
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,039
Good evening, everyone.

584
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:28,119
First of all, thank you very much
for taking the time to come

585
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,400
to this epic wedding
of Xu Junhao and his spouse.

586
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,000
Today, a good friend of mine

587
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,679
had promised to come to this wedding

588
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:39,679
but was busy with work.

589
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:42,239
So he made it at the last moment.

590
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:44,960
Let's welcome him with warm applause.

591
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,592
Shall we call it a day?

592
00:41:46,592 --> 00:41:47,648
Let's go.

593
00:41:47,648 --> 00:41:48,679
- Let's go.
- Okay.

594
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,920
- Okay, okay, come on.
- Okay.

595
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,639
Everyone can gather over here

596
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:56,760
to enjoy this sincere song
he has dedicated to us.

597
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,199
