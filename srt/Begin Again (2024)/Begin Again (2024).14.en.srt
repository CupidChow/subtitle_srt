<i>[Begin Again]</i>

2
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,839
Joe, you're early.

3
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,600
Dismantling the exhibition,
there's a lot to take care of, no?

4
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,759
How was last night?

5
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,880
You didn't reply to me.

6
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,640
I was very nervous.

7
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,000
What were you nervous about?

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,440
I don't know.

9
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,800
Maybe he had some big surprises,

10
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,039
like taking you to compete all over the world.

11
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,440
You're overthinking it.

12
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,520
He didn't.

13
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,319
What happened, did you guys have a fight?

14
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,160
No.

15
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,080
Did he do something wrong

16
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,600
that disappointed you?

17
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
If so, I'll go find him.

18
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,159
I won't let him bully you.

19
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:17,856
What's wrong?

20
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,472
Actually,

21
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,640
it's not purely sadness.

22
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,760
But,

23
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,559
it's a bit complicated.

24
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,984
What's wrong?

25
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,839
Didn't Yvonne say before

26
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,999
that I wrap myself up,

27
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:53,040
so I wouldn't get hurt?

28
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:56,999
I know now.

29
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,960
I know what pain is.

30
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,119
Actually, the hardest part is not splitting up.

31
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:08,864
It's one day,

32
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,960
when I've never tried being so impulsive,

33
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,200
and tearing open the inside

34
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,640
of my own heart,

35
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,200
only to hit a wall on the outside.

36
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,200
The most realistic problem now is

37
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,879
that neither of us

38
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,640
can give up everything we have now

39
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,480
for the sake of each other.

40
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,839
And I don't think we should.

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,559
Maybe at least I can make it

42
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:02,760
a bit easier for him,

43
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,080
relieving his pressure.

44
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,679
But that's not fair.

45
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,159
There's no such thing as being fair

46
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,279
in relationships.

47
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,479
I didn't understand that before,

48
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:19,520
but now I do.

49
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,200
I really can't

50
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,239
treat relationships

51
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,279
like performance art.

52
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:38,159
So I'll make the decision first.

53
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:11,616
<i>[Episode 14]</i>

54
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:18,799
I was chatting with Frank just now,

55
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:21,760
and I realized his mom was so formidable.

56
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,320
Tong must be highly valued

57
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,960
by her boss at the company

58
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,159
so that her boss

59
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,320
lets her take care of Frank.

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,640
Frank, what did you say

61
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,799
that your mom did?

62
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:38,320
Mom, Frank is a guest.

63
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,880
Please respect his privacy.

64
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,479
I'm not an outsider.

65
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,560
Can't I ask a question or two?

66
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,039
Sorry, Mom. It doesn't matter anymore.

67
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:51,560
After all, I'm about to leave Macau.

68
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:53,960
I've already applied for a transfer.

69
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,960
What do you mean? It sounds like

70
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,799
I forced you to leave.

71
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,039
What did I do wrong?

72
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,159
I raised and nurtured you with hard work.

73
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,560
Doesn't your conscience hurt
when you say these things?

74
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,719
Enough, mom. All these things
you keep talking about,

75
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:06,359
I've been listening to them for many years.

76
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:08,000
You are the hardest working,
you are the greatest,

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,216
and everything you say is correct,

78
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,328
okay?

79
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,880
Good that you know it.

80
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,000
You haven't seen your dad for such a long time.

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,120
Now that you're back,

82
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,599
did you care to ask about him?

83
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:25,359
Did you ask if he's had a hard time?

84
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:33,799
Mom.

85
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,719
In this home, apart from Dad,

86
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:37,799
there are other people too.

87
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,200
I hope you can care about me too.

88
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,640
Ask how I've been doing,

89
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,599
instead of whether I've won any awards

90
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:48,039
or whether I've gotten a promotion or raise.

91
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:49,520
You're not in a relationship,

92
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,839
apart from work,

93
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,200
what else can I ask?

94
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,760
Do you know why I broke up with Ryan?

95
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,296
I don't know.

96
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,064
A few years ago,

97
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,799
I was diagnosed with cancer.

98
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,352
I had surgery

99
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,000
to have my uterus removed.

100
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:17,279
I won't be able to have children anymore.

101
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,839
I can't give Ryan a family.

102
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,656
Dad.

103
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,599
Are you pretending not to hear us again?

104
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,640
When you don't scold me,

105
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,760
you can also comfort Mom.

106
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:53,728
What did you say?

107
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,960
It's this silence of yours,

108
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,168
this disdain,

109
00:08:08,435 --> 00:08:09,880
this attitude of dissatisfaction towards us

110
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,479
that has made Mom feel

111
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:15,239
she's not good enough for so many years.

112
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:18,359
Do you know what Mom worries about every day?

113
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,680
She worries about what time you'll come home

114
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,799
and whether you'll come home.

115
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:26,359
She's fearing day in and day out

116
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,520
that you won't come home
because of some woman outside

117
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,704
and abandon us.

118
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,119
So she takes her stress

119
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,239
and her unhappiness

120
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,960
and vents it all out on me,

121
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:44,928
forcing me to do everything,

122
00:08:44,928 --> 00:08:46,879
to do my best, to always
come first in everything.

123
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:51,759
Because she hopes that in this family,

124
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,839
at least one person,

125
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:58,080
at least one person makes you feel
it's worth coming home to.

126
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,519
But you just don't care.

127
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,632
What can I do?

128
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,920
What does it have to do with me
if you two can't get along?

129
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,680
Shut your mouth.

130
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,920
Do you want to agitate your father?

131
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,608
Thank you.

132
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,912
You're here, too.

133
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,016
You're here.

134
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:23,879
I have an appointment with a client.

135
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:28,560
I… I have an appointment with my student.

136
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,080
We agreed to meet here, but it seems
he hasn't arrived yet.

137
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,160
What a coincidence, Macau

138
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,160
is a small place.

139
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,999
Yes, it's such a coincidence.

140
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,160
Homecoming? Is this the wine you ordered?

141
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,400
I brought it.

142
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,639
It's quite a niche

143
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,160
domestic winery, from Yunnan.

144
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,519
Not bad, Professor Xu.

145
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,119
You even know about such a niche winery now.

146
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:51,040
I, yes.

147
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,200
I brought this for a client.

148
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,400
There's one extra bottle.

149
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Take it and give it a try.

150
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:58,239
Is that okay?

151
00:10:58,239 --> 00:10:59,800
Of course, don't be polite.

152
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,839
Thank you.

153
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:04,719
After all these years, you still remember
this preference of mine, huh?

154
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:08,224
Well,

155
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,479
I won't bother you anymore.

156
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,040
Well, you,

157
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,400
are you talking about this wine in a moment?

158
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,200
Yes, yes.

159
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,400
Tell me if you need anything.

160
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,280
Okay. I see, thank you, Mr. Wang.

161
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,560
Okay, I know, thank you.

162
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,960
I know nothing about business.

163
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,359
You won't need any help from me.

164
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,680
Mr. Zhao.

165
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,160
I barely recognized you.

166
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,680
You look much younger than in the photos.

167
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,879
You're also dressed like you're on vacation.

168
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,879
Hello, hello.

169
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,440
- Please take a seat.
- Okay.

170
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,080
We've scheduled many times in Beijing.

171
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
But we never met.

172
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,680
Have you been quite busy lately?

173
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,280
- Thank you.
- Waiter.

174
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,680
This place's pour-over coffee is quite special.

175
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,839
You can try it.

176
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,800
Sorry, I don't drink coffee

177
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,976
in the afternoon.

178
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:05,320
Apologies.

179
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,759
But I know you like wine,

180
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,320
so I brought you a special type

181
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,200
of Yunnan red wine.

182
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,519
You can try it.

183
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,960
So this is what we're going
to talk about today,

184
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,920
the winery you want me to acquire.

185
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,200
Yes, here's the thing.

186
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,040
It's a relatively niche

187
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,119
winery in Yunnan.

188
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:30,639
We've learned that you intend

189
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,719
to build a winery in Yunnan.

190
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,680
The scale of the winery's cellar is not large,

191
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,359
approximately around 1,000 square meters.

192
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,479
But it has one of the most

193
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:41,599
professional plantations domestically.

194
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,119
And its annual production

195
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:45,639
is about around 5,000 cases.

196
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,160
- So…
- 5000 cases?

197
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,040
That's not much.

198
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,680
Yes, yes, yes, its scale is relatively small.

199
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,080
But I have already done
the calculations for you, Mr. Zhao.

200
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,200
If you were to build

201
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,040
a new winery from scratch.

202
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,920
The cellar,

203
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,519
the different plantations,

204
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,920
and the equipment

205
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,519
will take quite a bit of energy

206
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,719
and time.

207
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:08,320
Are you feeling uncomfortable, your neck?

208
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,759
It's okay, continue.

209
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,519
Alright, alright, I will continue.

210
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,119
You see, once you sign a contract

211
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:17,560
and stick your factory label on it,

212
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,960
you can begin to sell wine immediately.

213
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,599
This way, you will save
a lot of energy and time

214
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:22,599
- invisibly.
- I see.

215
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:23,920
So you're saying,

216
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
I want to invest in a factory

217
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,999
in Yunnan.

218
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:27,680
But if I invest by myself,

219
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,160
- it would take both time and energy.
- Yes.

220
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,920
But if I acquire this factory,

221
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,839
I can directly apply my liquor brand

222
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,599
- to this liquor.
- Yes, yes.

223
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:36,999
I can skip all that.

224
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:38,440
Save time and sell it directly.

225
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,520
Yes, exactly.

226
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,119
Well,

227
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,280
that's what I meant to say.

228
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
But we are talking business here.

229
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,599
We still hope

230
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:53,280
to maximize your

231
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,999
profits, Mr. Zhao.

232
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,800
Well, that, I am currently in Macau.

233
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,400
And I can't leave for a while.

234
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,359
However, I will go to Shanghai on the 28th.

235
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,680
Let's meet in Shanghai, shall we?

236
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,752
<i>Do you need help?</i>

237
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,519
You are going to Shanghai?

238
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,519
I reside there regularly.

239
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,200
I know a private kitchen that's very tasty.

240
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,920
Maybe I can treat you to a meal.

241
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,440
There's no need for that.

242
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,599
I think today,

243
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:12,800
we've had a clear conversation.

244
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,280
Thank you, respect.

245
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,639
See you next time.

246
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,320
Mr. Zhao, please wait.

247
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,759
Did I fail

248
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,680
to explain some parts clearly

249
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,160
- that caused any misunderstanding for you?
- No.

250
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,280
Everything was explained very clearly.

251
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,599
I have no misunderstanding about you.

252
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:29,680
But I feel that you seem to have

253
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,759
a little misunderstanding about me.

254
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,040
I've got something else to do.
We'll meet again next time.

255
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:42,680
- Check out, check out.
- Okay.

256
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,999
- Professor Xu,
- Mr. Zhao.

257
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:52,200
You're inside, huh?
I was just looking for you outside.

258
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,280
Greetings.

259
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,759
- Long time no see.
- We haven't seen each other in ten years.

260
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,200
Don't call me Mr. Zhao, call me Linsen.

261
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,440
You can't address me formally.

262
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,759
I will always be your student.

263
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,200
You still have such a good figure.

264
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,239
You haven't changed at all, still so dashing.

265
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:04,560
- You're getting more and more handsome.
- I've gained too much weight.

266
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,599
I get fatter than the year before, every year.

267
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:07,280
- Come, come, have a seat.
- What are the odds of meeting here?

268
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,479
Yeah, Macau is an

269
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:10,800
interesting place, I've noticed.

270
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,160
People I can never run into in Beijing,

271
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,248
I've seen them all.

272
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,999
<i>[Why didn't you say earlier he was your student?]</i>
You make a lot of sense.

273
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,759
- Since we're here…
- Yes.

274
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,999
So, what are you doing?

275
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:20,200
What brought you here?

276
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,680
Well, it's…

277
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,719
family matters.

278
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:24,288
My daughter

279
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,359
<i>[Professor Xu, please help me…]</i>
has found a boyfriend in Macau.

280
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,160
So we came over to have a look.

281
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,239
That's a good thing.

282
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,400
You're here to meet your future in-laws.

283
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:50,999
Yes, well…

284
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,160
Waiter, could you please
add another red wine glass?

285
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,400
Contributing my effort.

286
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,639
I didn't expect Miss Tang

287
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:12,719
and Professor Xu to know each other.

288
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:13,719
Old acquaintances.

289
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:15,599
I also didn't expect the student

290
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,879
that Professor Xu was waiting for was Mr. Zhao.

291
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,359
If we're so familiar, there's no need
to call me Mr. Zhao.

292
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:20,440
Just call me Linsen.

293
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,680
- Okay. Thank you.
- Well, since we are

294
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,599
all talking here,

295
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,239
Miss Tang, please send me the contract.

296
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,479
The acquisition contract for Homecoming Winery.

297
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,719
Mr. Zhao, do you want

298
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:38,119
to talk about the business details?

299
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:39,759
There's no need.

300
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,800
Actually,

301
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,119
I don't really care about these things.

302
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:43,680
Since it's our first meeting,

303
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,119
Miss Tang might not understand me very well.

304
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:47,879
- But Mr. Xu does understand me.
- Yes.

305
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,719
Here's how Linsen is.

306
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:52,440
In the face of interests and ideals,

307
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,800
he definitely favors the latter.

308
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:56,239
I'm not that noble either.

309
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:58,119
- Sorry, I need to take a call.
- Sure.

310
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,319
Hello? Yes, Ziquan, right.

311
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,479
I'll arrive in Shanghai on the 28th.

312
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,519
Um, I have a merger contract
to deal with in a bit.

313
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:12,600
Can you handle it for me?

314
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,920
I trust you fully. I'll leave it to you.

315
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,559
Alright.

316
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,680
Bye-bye.

317
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,200
Okay.

318
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,840
You guys can continue talking.
I'll take my leave first.

319
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,279
No, you, you're not staying?

320
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,319
Let's have a meal together.

321
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,600
I have something to do later.

322
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,479
However, I am very, very
happy to see Professor Xu.

323
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,400
- Come on, Miss Tang.
- Mr. Zhao.

324
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,960
I wish us a pleasant collaboration.

325
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,600
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Zhao.

326
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,360
- Don't thank me, thank Mr. Xu.
- Yes.

327
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,319
Mr. Xu, we should get together
more often in the future too.

328
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,840
Whether in Beijing or Shanghai,

329
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,360
- whenever we have time, let's meet up.
- Yes, sure.

330
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,840
Let's have a meal in Shanghai.

331
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,999
Of course, in Shanghai,

332
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:51,160
- we'll sit together again.
- Okay, okay.

333
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,680
Alright then, I'll go first, bye-bye.

334
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,960
- Goodbye, goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

335
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,400
You still laugh so foolishly
after all these years.

336
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,864
Thank you.

337
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:14,999
You're being too formal.

338
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,376
Are you okay?

339
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,039
I'm just angry at myself.

340
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,960
Clearly, I shouldn't

341
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,120
hold any expectations for them,

342
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,039
but when I hear what they say,

343
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,696
it still

344
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,079
it still hurts a lot.

345
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,200
When I stand before them,

346
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,239
I am still that

347
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,840
helpless little girl.

348
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,440
It's not your fault.

349
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,880
Don't be mad at yourself.

350
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,248
Come with me.

351
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,264
Where to?

352
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,559
If we're unhappy, let's go crazy.

353
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:20,032
<i>♫ I've been waiting for a long time ♫</i>

354
00:20:20,544 --> 00:20:23,936
<i>♫ Just hoping you would glance at me ♫</i>

355
00:20:25,216 --> 00:20:29,568
<i>♫ Having the chance to see those eyes ♫</i>

356
00:20:29,568 --> 00:20:32,416
<i>♫ I don't know what I would do ♫</i>

357
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:38,528
<i>♫ At the time of meeting, you have looked ♫</i>

358
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,856
<i>♫ The feeling couldn't be better ♫</i>

359
00:20:43,264 --> 00:20:47,424
<i>♫ At that moment, it felt so good ♫</i>

360
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:50,784
<i>♫ I want to know why you noticed me ♫</i>

361
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:56,186
<i>♫ If you could give me some time ♫</i>

362
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,799
Imagine you have superpowers.

363
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,559
Are we really doing this?

364
00:21:02,912 --> 00:21:04,320
<i>♫ Don't tell me ♫</i>

365
00:21:05,074 --> 00:21:08,999
<i>♫ That you're not the same as before ♫</i>

366
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:14,840
Three, two, one.

367
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:22,848
Lift it higher.

368
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
Three.

369
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,736
Two.

370
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,416
One.

371
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
Who is it?

372
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,440
It sounds like my mom.

373
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:43,039
Let's run!

374
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,279
It's my mom.

375
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,104
<i>♫ Don't tell me ♫</i>

376
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:49,056
<i>♫ Don't tell me ♫</i>

377
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:53,408
<i>♫ It's the feeling of being high and mighty ♫</i>

378
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,479
How did you get here?
Is your car parked in the parking lot?

379
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:00,759
No, I took a taxi here.

380
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:02,079
Then, I'll give you a ride back.

381
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,360
Okay.

382
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,960
I'll just hitch a ride with Miss Tang's car.

383
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,120
No need to be so polite.

384
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,360
I was lucky to have you today.

385
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,680
So I'm not completely useless.

386
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Xu Jianming.

387
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:25,719
I remember

388
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,719
I've only said that once, right?

389
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:31,120
And it was many years ago.

390
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,279
You still remember it now.

391
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,479
You are not a stingy person.

392
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,120
Let me tell you, sometimes a single sentence,

393
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,279
just one sentence,

394
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:40,440
can hurt enough.

395
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,200
I remember back in college,

396
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,880
you were the talented guy in our department.

397
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,920
At the time of graduation,

398
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,840
you stayed at the university
as an outstanding student.

399
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,319
- Back then, a lot of people envied you.
- Yes.

400
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Later on, everyone went into business,

401
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,279
saying they wanted to go out
and make their way.

402
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,519
But you didn't. You just stayed in the school.

403
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,640
I remember we had
quite a few arguments over this.

404
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:08,279
Back then, I called you weak,

405
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:09,479
useless,

406
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:12,079
wanting to hide away in your ivory tower
and do your own thing,

407
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,279
entertaining yourself,

408
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,799
actually, it was all to provoke you.

409
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,799
I didn't really think that way at the time.

410
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,799
I'm quite surprised you were
willing to help me today.

411
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:35,200
You know me.

412
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,799
I hate trouble

413
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,680
and I'm not good at socializing,

414
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,559
even less fond of social obligations.

415
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,200
Anyway,

416
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,512
I'm glad I could help you.

417
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,912
Thank you.

418
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,120
How have you been all these years?

419
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,519
I'm alright, being alone.

420
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,759
Sometimes, I wonder

421
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,799
if the two of us

422
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:23,160
hadn't divorced,

423
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,440
would I have already learned

424
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,079
the Guqin I've always wanted to learn?

425
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,279
Perhaps I can play
'The Lament of the Xiang Consort'

426
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,680
really well now.

427
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,600
If we hadn't divorced,

428
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:39,079
would I be different from how I am now?

429
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,040
Over all these years,

430
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,519
I've always wanted to ask you,

431
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,999
did you regret it?

432
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:10,304
Ms. Wei.

433
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:13,079
Yu, what are you doing here?

434
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,960
I figured you were finished,
so I came to pick you up.

435
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,440
Let me introduce you, Xu,

436
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,920
this is my assistant, Chen Shiyu.

437
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,039
This is Professor Xu Jianming in Economics,

438
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,120
from the University of Finance and Economics.

439
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,128
Hello, Professor Xu.

440
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,479
- Chen.
- Yes, Chen.

441
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:27,552
Hello, Chen.

442
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,799
The car is up ahead. Let's go.

443
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:45,440
This young man

444
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,559
is really quite handsome.

445
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,360
With someone like him,

446
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,840
are the girls

447
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,279
lining up behind him?

448
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,952
Nope.

449
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,640
He's a workaholic.

450
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,719
He's always on his phone,

451
00:25:58,719 --> 00:25:59,880
on standby 24 hours.

452
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,400
He takes calls anytime.

453
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,559
Yes, most of the time,

454
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,680
I'm with Ms. Wei.

455
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,920
My marriage depends on Ms. Wei.

456
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:12,680
That's not something I can manage.

457
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,960
What's your type, Chen?

458
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,079
There are young teachers in our school

459
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,200
who have been asking me
to introduce them to someone.

460
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
His type

461
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,799
seems to be hard to find

462
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:26,880
in this world.

463
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,559
This kid's been with me for five years.

464
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:30,719
Anyway, from what I see,

465
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,559
I haven't seen him interested
in any particular type of girl.

466
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:38,079
If he's never shown interest in anyone else,

467
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,960
he most likely likes you.

468
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,392
What did you say?

469
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,792
Nothing.

470
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,448
Okay, cut.

471
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,079
That's a wrap for today.

472
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:55,999
Thank you, Director.

473
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:57,640
Thank you, everyone.

474
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,999
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you, Director.

475
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:00,120
- Thank you.
- Mai.

476
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,400
I noticed you're not quite yourself today.

477
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,120
Go back and rest early. About that meeting,

478
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,719
- I'll convey it for you.
- It's alright.

479
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:06,719
I'll definitely attend the meeting.

480
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:08,319
Tomorrow's scene is too important.

481
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:09,319
Don't push yourself.

482
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,519
Rest assured, I'll definitely
be there for the meeting.

483
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,632
Are you alright?

484
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,279
When did you come?

485
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,640
I've-- I've been here all along.

486
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,200
Listen to Mr. Qiang

487
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,239
and get some good rest.

488
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:37,600
Otherwise, your body won't be able to take it.

489
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,840
Oh right, as for the restaurant
we're shooting at tomorrow,

490
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,120
I've already arranged everything.

491
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,600
So, don't worry.

492
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,360
Thank you.

493
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,680
It's what I should do.

494
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,719
If there's nothing else, I

495
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,808
will leave now.

496
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,432
Le.

497
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:10,519
The filming scene tomorrow,

498
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:11,559
the car race,

499
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:14,160
I think it might be a bit complicated to shoot.

500
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,200
It could involve communication
with many departments.

501
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,479
So, I hope if possible,

502
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,504
you can still come.

503
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,776
I will definitely be there.

504
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,279
No matter what,

505
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,479
I will complete my work.

506
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
Thank you.

507
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,288
Good night.

508
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,176
Good night.

509
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,960
- Are you okay?
- Are you alright?

510
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,759
I'm okay.

511
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,319
- I'm fine.
- Ms. Wei.

512
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,960
There are some documents to review upstairs.

513
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,840
- I'll go up first.
- Okay.

514
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:33,840
- I, I will…
- I'll take it myself.

515
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,880
Go back early.

516
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,160
Professor Xu, a pleasure to meet you.

517
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:39,519
Chen.

518
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,376
Bye-bye.

519
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,799
You received the message from Jiajia, right?

520
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,200
I did.

521
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
Should we go?

522
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,400
Jiajia is not a child anymore.

523
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,680
She and Hao love each other,

524
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,840
what reason do we have

525
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,400
to stop their marriage?

526
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:02,239
Yes, but, I mean,

527
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:04,319
marriage is a big deal.

528
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,719
As parents,

529
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:08,680
it's necessary to investigate
the other family's background.

530
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,319
Yes, we should go.

531
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,999
But when we go,

532
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:14,120
it's a gesture in itself.

533
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,200
Li Meng.

534
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,680
- Ms. Wei.
- Li Meng.

535
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,799
I was talking to Xu about…

536
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,559
So Jiajia sent us a message,

537
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:24,719
saying Hao's parents

538
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:26,719
are hosting a family banquet
tomorrow and inviting us to go.

539
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:30,319
I won't go, Ms. Wei.

540
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,400
I feel a bit unwell.

541
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,440
Could you please send them my regards?

542
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,319
Okay, I understand.

543
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:37,079
Wait, what's wrong with you?

544
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:38,279
Let Xu take you to the hospital.

545
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,479
No, I'll just go up and rest for a bit.

546
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,360
- Alright then…
- Wait, Meng, are you…

547
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,160
Well, then…

548
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,480
See you tomorrow night.

549
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:08,319
Meng.

550
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,360
I sent you so many WeChat messages today.

551
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,799
Did, did you see them?

552
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,440
Is your phone out of battery again?

553
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,584
You know what?

554
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,079
You should develop a good habit in life

555
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,160
to charge your phone every night before bed.

556
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,640
So you'll definitely have battery the next day.

557
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:26,920
This power bank is made for people like you

558
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,600
who don't like to charge their phones.

559
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,400
Right, about the suitcase…

560
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,448
What?

561
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,200
I mean,

562
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,600
is the suitcase's lock code
your birthday or mine?

563
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,160
Did you change it again?

564
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,759
I can't open it with either.

565
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,440
Did you change it again?

566
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,616
I'm a bit tired.

567
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,728
I'll go take a shower first.

568
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,608
Okay.

569
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,200
Hey, where is the water?

570
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:36,800
Hello?

571
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,008
Okay, I will get him.

572
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:41,759
Mr. Wei, Ms. Lam's phone call.

573
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:51,552
Mom.

574
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,519
<i>Frank.</i>

575
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,600
<i>How are you feeling today?</i>

576
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:56,999
Not bad.

577
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:58,960
<i>I know you've been working hard lately.</i>

578
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,479
<i>But due to work, I can't</i>

579
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,719
<i>be with you on your birthday.</i>

580
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,079
<i>I've asked Mike to prepare a gift for you.</i>

581
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,840
<i>You need to prepare well for the solo recital.</i>

582
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,872
<i>Okay?</i>

583
00:33:08,544 --> 00:33:09,600
Okay.

584
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,160
<i>However, even though I can't
attend your birthday,</i>

585
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,400
<i>I promise to be there</i>

586
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,840
<i>for your recital.</i>

587
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,544
<i>I will be with you.</i>

588
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:20,239
<i>Any problems, Frank?</i>

589
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,559
No.

590
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,920
<i>Then I look forward to your performance.</i>

591
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,160
<i>Don't slack off.</i>

592
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,120
<i>Make the most of the time and practice
the performance pieces more, okay?</i>

593
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,920
Okay.

594
00:33:30,784 --> 00:33:31,799
Ms. Lam.

595
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,640
<i>I need Frank's schedule, send me a copy.</i>

596
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,960
<i>And his progress, report to me at any time.</i>

597
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,680
My mom is coming to Macau.

598
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,759
Is she coming specifically
to see your performance?

599
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,712
Aren't you happy?

600
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,440
You do like playing the piano.

601
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,640
But you don't like

602
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,679
playing those formulaic pieces, right?

603
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,960
If you truly don't like it,

604
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,999
we can find a solution

605
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,720
together

606
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,679
or play some

607
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,079
pieces you like.

608
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,559
Right, that piece you wrote yourself back then,

609
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,159
I'm still looking forward
to hearing the full version.

610
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:31,999
My mom thinks that piece

611
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:32,999
isn't worth much.

612
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,199
You are the performer.

613
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,559
Your feelings

614
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:39,159
and the emotions you express on stage

615
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,479
are the most important.

616
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,760
What if the audience doesn't like it?

617
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,280
I don't want to disappoint my mom.

618
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,519
The piano has been around for about 300 years.

619
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:01,679
Even now, there are still people
who play the piano

620
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:03,159
and there are still people
who are willing to listen.

621
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,240
It's because, no matter the era or time,

622
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,519
everyone needs music

623
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:09,639
and emotions.

624
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:13,400
As long as you truly express
your emotions in your playing,

625
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,960
you won't disappoint the audience.

626
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:20,280
Really?

627
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,360
Trust me.

628
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,119
Just like how you feel better

629
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,199
after eating chocolate.

630
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,960
Music is

631
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,639
like the spiritual chocolate for mankind.

632
00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:41,039
Should I really eat it?

633
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,320
It's so bitter.

634
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,440
Don't you find it bitter?

635
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:07,168
<i>[Welcome to Macau]</i>

636
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,280
Mr. Qiang, are you sure this is the best spot

637
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,679
we can find?

638
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:37,240
This location was specially chosen by Le.

639
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,039
I think this is the best spot.

640
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:43,240
Miss Mai, if we have to film the cars

641
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,240
sprinting to the finish line,

642
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,800
apart from the official
filming spot which is the best,

643
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,840
this is the next best one.

644
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:50,039
I see, okay.

645
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,079
Alright, shoot here then.

646
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:53,360
- Okay, okay. Mr. Qiang.
- Only three people are allowed.

647
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,360
- Alright.
- Xu, let's go.

648
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,960
- Don't worry, don't worry.
- Alright, shoot here.

649
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,960
- Set up the camera.
- Let's go.

650
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,112
Go.

651
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,159
Mr. Xing, do you need a tripod?

652
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,360
- No need for it now, thanks.
- No need yet.

653
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,472
Do you think it's okay?

654
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,039
It's fine, I guess.

655
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,039
<i>Okay, the first round</i>

656
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:30,119
<i>of the Macau GT Cup has officially started.</i>

657
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:31,760
<i>Han Junhao and Doumoto</i>

658
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,920
<i>are now in the lead.</i>

659
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,199
<i>Now we see them charging
towards the Eastern Bend together.</i>

660
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:39,639
<i>Everyone is very cautious
in handling the Eastern Bend</i>

661
00:37:42,479 --> 00:37:43,920
Elvis.

662
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,039
Come on!

663
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,800
<i>Junhao, the twelve laps tomorrow</i>

664
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,079
<i>are the main event.</i>

665
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,400
<i>Be steady today.</i>

666
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,479
<i>Don't collide</i>

667
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,519
<i>- with the opponent's vehicles.</i>
- I know.

668
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:56,720
<i>We see Doumoto maintaining the lead,</i>

669
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,440
<i>with Han Junhao closely following behind.</i>

670
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:00,360
<i>We can see Doumoto</i>

671
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,800
<i>is currently in the leading position,</i>

672
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,519
<i>with Han Junhao closely following behind.</i>

673
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:05,720
<i>They are coming to the most concentrated
series of bends in this section of the track.</i>

674
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,760
<i>Let's see how the racers will handle it.</i>

675
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,559
<i>After this bend,</i>

676
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,039
<i>there is a narrow road.</i>

677
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,039
<i>Following the narrow road, we arrive
at this section of the track</i>

678
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:15,760
<i>with the most concentrated series of bends.</i>

679
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,039
<i>Let's see how the racers will handle it.</i>

680
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,280
<i>The lead group of cars</i>

681
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,240
<i>has already entered the hairpin turn.</i>

682
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,079
<i>Unsurprisingly, everyone is handling
it very cautiously.</i>

683
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,119
<i>Han Junhao has been following
closely behind Doumoto.</i>

684
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:31,519
<i>It seems Doumoto is trying very hard</i>

685
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:33,240
<i>to shake off Han Junhao,</i>

686
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,519
<i>but has not succeeded.</i>

687
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:37,800
<i>After the Fisherman's Bend,
it's the long straightaway.</i>

688
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,840
<i>The positions of the leading cars
have not changed.</i>

689
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:42,119
<i>It's possible on the straight</i>

690
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,079
<i>Doumoto's car might perform a bit better.</i>

691
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,240
<i>But in the end, who will win</i>

692
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,440
<i>depends on the last bend.</i>

693
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,679
<i>Car number 63</i>

694
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:53,920
<i>seems to have some malfunction,
emitting thick smoke,</i>

695
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,800
<i>and there is a leak of oil.</i>

696
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,479
<i>Other racers need to be careful.</i>

697
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:59,960
<i>This might affect the road conditions later on.</i>

698
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:04,400
<i>Han Junhao is too close to Doumoto.</i>

699
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,599
<i>This is very dangerous.</i>

700
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,320
<i>Doumoto made an emergency brake.</i>

701
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,079
<i>Han Junhao seems to have slipped.</i>

702
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,559
<i>No, this is bad.</i>

703
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,920
<i>Directly crashed into the safety barrier.</i>

704
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,639
<i>He directly crashed into the safety barrier.</i>

705
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,119
<i>We can see the car on site</i>

706
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,720
<i>has already fallen apart.</i>

707
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,840
<i>It seems that an early withdrawal
from the race is imminent.</i>

708
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,960
<i>How unlucky,</i>

709
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,440
<i>missing out on the championship
again this year.</i>

710
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,479
<i>We can see the car of the racer Han Junhao</i>

711
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:46,760
<i>has suffered a quite severe crash.</i>

712
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,320
<i>The condition of the racer</i>

713
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,479
<i>is currently unknown.</i>

714
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:51,039
<i>As to whether he can participate
in tomorrow's race,</i>

715
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:52,559
<i>the team manager could not give</i>

716
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:53,800
<i>a definite answer.</i>

717
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,599
<i>We will continue to follow up with reports.</i>

718
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:58,360
Hello, can you provide us
with more information?

719
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,552
We can't say too much.

720
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,805
Excuse me, I would like to ask,

721
00:41:01,805 --> 00:41:03,360
was there a crash in the race just now?

722
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,519
- Sorry, sorry.
- How are things now?

723
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:07,320
- Are you talking about Han Junhao?
- Yes.

724
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,720
Did he get injured?

725
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,720
His car was indeed badly smashed.

726
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,920
But we haven't received

727
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,519
any news about drivers being injured.

728
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:14,592
He should be fine.

729
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,960
Okay, thank you.

730
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:21,240
Here's the thing.

731
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,240
I am the sponsor of this race.

732
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,039
I want to ask if there's any way

733
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:27,199
for me to get in and see him.

734
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,599
I am from Xinghao.

735
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:29,960
I really can't do anything about it.

736
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,199
Besides the staff of the race

737
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:32,519
and the team personnel,

738
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,320
I can't let anyone else in.

739
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,328
Sorry.

740
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:37,600
Okay, I understand.

741
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,488
Thank you.

742
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,896
Sorry, can we go over there to take pictures?

743
00:41:44,896 --> 00:41:45,952
It's just over there, sorry.

744
00:41:45,952 --> 00:41:47,360
We really can't let you in.

745
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,079
- Please don't make it difficult for us.
- We're just going to take two pictures.

746
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:50,519
- It's really not possible.
- Is there any news?

747
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:52,360
Sorry, unrelated personnel, please step away.

748
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,408
All right.

749
00:42:30,272 --> 00:42:34,176
