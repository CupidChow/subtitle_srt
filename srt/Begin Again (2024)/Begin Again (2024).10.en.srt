00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:30,599
<i>[Begin Again]</i>

2
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,128
Isn't it amazing?

3
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,439
Senna, right?

4
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,439
He

5
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:41,760
is the true racing god in my heart.

6
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,959
In the first Macau F3 race,

7
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,640
he was the champion.

8
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,400
Not long after that race,

9
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,599
he officially entered Formula 1.

10
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,640
I remember there was one race

11
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,439
that was particularly exciting.

12
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,000
It was the Monaco race.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,519
Not long into the race,

14
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,599
it started to rain.

15
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,920
All the drivers

16
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,319
slowed down.

17
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,680
He was the only one

18
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,120
who did not slow down but sped up instead,

19
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,560
as if he wanted to smash the accelerator.

20
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,000
He went from the 16th place,

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,759
all the way to the second place.

22
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,400
The then-reigning champion, I guess,

23
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,639
felt threatened,

24
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,120
so he used the excuse of safety

25
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,120
and stopped the race.

26
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
Otherwise, I believe

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,280
he would have been the champion that day.

28
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,439
That trophy would have been his.

29
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:27,112
Such a pity.

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,879
Would you do the same?

31
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,360
Not caring about safety during the race

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,704
and only wanting to win?

33
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,039
How should I put it?

34
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,240
I think it's instinct.

35
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,264
Instinct?

36
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,520
What happened later?

37
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,439
A case of a bright flame burning quickly.

38
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,000
A car accident

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,719
took his life.

40
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,919
On the day of his funeral,

41
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,120
millions of Brazilians

42
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,000
took to the streets for his funeral procession.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,719
I still distinctly remember
the words of an old man.

44
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,960
Brazilians need

45
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,840
food and joy,

46
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,280
but today,

47
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,719
their joy is gone.

48
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,000
Actually, I really understand Senna.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,599
I understand his desire to win every time.

50
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,800
It wasn't just for his own glory.

51
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
It was more

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,719
for his country behind him.

53
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,840
So, every victory

54
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,159
gave the Brazilians

55
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,319
who were in the dark

56
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,919
hope for the future.

57
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,280
He is truly great.

58
00:03:54,784 --> 00:04:00,159
<i>[Episode 10]</i>

59
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,560
On the list

60
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,960
of past champions back there,

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,439
there were only two Chinese names.

62
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,576
Yes.

63
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,280
The home field of racing is in Europe.

64
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,759
So, in the past, Chinese drivers

65
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,560
were not allowed to participate.

66
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,720
I get it.

67
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,360
If I were you, I would also
find it hard to accept.

68
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,800
Haven't I told you before?

69
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,279
When I was racing abroad,

70
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,360
those foreign drivers

71
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,120
didn't really know me.

72
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,319
Then they mocked and ridiculed me,

73
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,240
saying 'Do Chinese drivers

74
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,240
really know how to race?'

75
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,279
Because of this comment,

76
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,800
I swore to myself

77
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,800
that I would beat every single one of them.

78
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,079
So on the race track,

79
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,160
I show no mercy.

80
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,199
I just want to let them know

81
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,439
that in Chinese motorsports,

82
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,079
we started late,

83
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,560
but we can drive fast.

84
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,439
What's the matter?

85
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,639
The way you spoke just now.

86
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,120
You were so arrogant.

87
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,319
Was I?

88
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,399
But it's cute.

89
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,319
Only cute?

90
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,096
Handsome.

91
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,519
Next time we come here,

92
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,000
the name Han Junhao

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,040
will appear on that list.

94
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,560
Do you really have

95
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,959
so much confidence in me?

96
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,920
Yes, I told you I have
a very accurate sixth sense.

97
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,319
Why do the clothes here seem a bit old?

98
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,720
This is a vintage store.

99
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,759
They sell things that are no longer

100
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,399
produced in the market.

101
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,720
What is this?

102
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,319
A TV set.

103
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,920
Is this what you watched as a child?

104
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,079
This TV set

105
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,360
is older than you and me combined.

106
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,439
It's so small I thought it was a bread maker.

107
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,480
There's a hairstyle

108
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,480
that I think suits you well.

109
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,839
Take a look.

110
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,759
And glasses too.

111
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,872
Come on.

112
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,024
Three.

113
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,879
This one looks pretty good.

114
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,319
A bald head, huh?

115
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,399
Oh my God.

116
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,856
Do you like it?

117
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,720
- Is it okay?
- So-so.

118
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,439
Why such a low neckline?

119
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,600
Isn't it too low?

120
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,800
- Come on, give a twirl.
- Why?

121
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,920
This suits you.

122
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,800
Having known you for so long,

123
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,480
this is your best look.

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,079
Sorry, sorry, ma'am.

125
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,560
We've been trying for so long.

126
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,800
We'll take these two sets.

127
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,160
It's all right, watching you
change clothes is fun.

128
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,319
You're so stylish, why don't I
take a photo for you?

129
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,439
Sure.

130
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,839
Come on, look at the camera.

131
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,879
Come on, look over here.

132
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,560
Cheese.

133
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,759
Qiang.

134
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,959
Today I asked Junhao to come back

135
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,319
and have a good chat with you.

136
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,319
Hao, have a good chat with your dad.

137
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,920
Dad, have some tea.

138
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,480
Actually, I came today

139
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,679
to say sorry.

140
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,600
I should have told you earlier

141
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,440
about Jiajia and me.

142
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,080
Perhaps I've been used to solving
problems by myself all my life,

143
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,360
so I neglected your feelings.

144
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,279
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,159
After I went back yesterday,
Jiajia talked a lot to me

146
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,679
and she made me understand

147
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,720
the big reaction everyone had

148
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,879
was all because you cared about me.

149
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,559
You see,

150
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,159
Jiajia is so well-behaved, sensible,

151
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,159
and mature.

152
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,480
Jiajia sees things more clearly than you.

153
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,480
Speak frankly to your dad.

154
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,639
Jiajia is a

155
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,159
kind and mature girl.

156
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,679
Although she is young,

157
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:48,360
she is more mature in many aspects than I am.

158
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,679
I know Jiajia is a good girl,

159
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,039
but you have only known
each other for half a year.

160
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:57,639
Why get married so quickly?

161
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,799
Dad, I think you should understand

162
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:03,679
that when you truly meet

163
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,679
the one,

164
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:07,559
you won't want any delay.

165
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,600
I just want to marry her and
bring her home as soon as possible

166
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,960
to have a family of my own.

167
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,200
I'm not against your marriage.

168
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,159
Even if you really want to get married,

169
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,159
you need time

170
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,360
to prepare for your wedding.

171
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,320
You need to decide whom to invite.

172
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,559
Some things can't be rushed.

173
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,559
I know, Dad.

174
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,600
That's why actually,

175
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,919
we have already been preparing
for quite some time.

176
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,879
It's just during the preparation process,

177
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,240
I didn't think it was necessary to trouble you.

178
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,559
Besides, Jiajia and I

179
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,799
don't care much for ceremonies.

180
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:44,679
We just want to use this wedding to tell people

181
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:47,120
who care about me

182
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,360
that we want to be together

183
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,480
for a lifetime.

184
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,440
That's it.

185
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,799
But marriage

186
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:57,879
is not just about two people.

187
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:00,559
It involves two families.

188
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,679
You are my son.

189
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,480
Can I do nothing when you get married?

190
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,240
Can I attend my son's wedding

191
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,799
like attending a friend's wedding?

192
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,200
How will the parents of the bride

193
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,639
think of us?

194
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,600
Honestly, Dad,

195
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,120
even if I had told you in advance,

196
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,720
hoping for your involvement,

197
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,360
would you have had the time for me?

198
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,440
You are at Zhen Qiang day and night.

199
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,600
I've known this for a long time.

200
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,639
Why bring up Zhen Qiang?

201
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,200
What does Zhen Qiang have to do with this?

202
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
But that's the reality.

203
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,399
All the time in your life

204
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,039
has been spent on Zhen Qiang.

205
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,039
Have you ever thought

206
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:44,639
that you could take it easier at your age?

207
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,200
To not work so hard?

208
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,240
I've told you many times.

209
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,679
I can help you sell it.

210
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,200
Enough.

211
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,440
You keep talking

212
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,879
about selling Zhen Qiang.

213
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,159
I didn't say we have to sell it.

214
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,440
Stop it.

215
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,919
If you have time,

216
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,639
focus on your wedding.

217
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,240
Do it however you want to.

218
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,759
I won't interfere with it anymore.

219
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,200
What are you doing?

220
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,440
I don't want to talk anymore.

221
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,279
Hao, I asked you to come back

222
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:12,000
and clear things up with your dad.

223
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,559
Why did it end on bad terms again?

224
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:15,399
I tried my best.

225
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:18,360
I really can't communicate with him.

226
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,000
Sorry, Mom.

227
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,600
Jiajia's parents will be here soon.

228
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,039
I don't even know.

229
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:28,279
We'll see.

230
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,000
Rest assured.

231
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Thank you, Mom.

232
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,559
Fighting again?

233
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,559
Is it about the wedding again?

234
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:45,159
I don't understand. What's there

235
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,519
to fight about?

236
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,759
Don't bother with them anymore.

237
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:53,399
They are adults, let them cool down.

238
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,879
You've tried.

239
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:57,384
Bye.

240
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,600
Is there a problem at home?

241
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,000
My dad and brother are fighting again.

242
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,440
Do you want to rush home and check on it?

243
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,679
I don't want to go back.

244
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,200
Anyway, whatever I say, they won't listen.

245
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,559
Besides, they are all adults.
Let them solve it themselves.

246
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,559
In that case,

247
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,679
let's find a place

248
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,919
to take a walk and get some air, okay?

249
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:21,000
Aren't you hungry?

250
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,159
We'll eat after the walk.

251
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:25,512
Okay.

252
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,639
This is the first time

253
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,120
I've seen you walk so fast.

254
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,919
You're worried about Mr. Xu, right?

255
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:15,039
Actually, I've always known

256
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,600
that I am the best person

257
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,679
to take over the restaurant at home.

258
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,440
My brother has his own things he wants to do.

259
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,919
And Bao is still young.

260
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:29,159
But when she grows up,

261
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,159
she'll certainly have her own pursuits.

262
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,960
What about you?

263
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,039
Don't you have a life you want to pursue?

264
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,720
I'm the kind of person

265
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,000
who doesn't have many desires.

266
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,279
I just want to live in the present

267
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,039
and to do well in the things at hand.

268
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:51,480
That's enough for me.

269
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,088
It's just…

270
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,720
It's just that you're afraid of messing up.

271
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,399
You fear wasting the many
years of effort put in by Mr. Xu

272
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,039
will be ruined in your hands.

273
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,759
You probably haven't seen

274
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:11,279
the other side of Zhen Qiang.

275
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,240
- Hello!
- Table for three.

276
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,320
Our shop

277
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,840
starts business at 5 PM.

278
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,399
There are many customers.

279
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,960
The staff is busy

280
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,120
until early morning.

281
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,919
After Mr. Qiang finishes the day's accounts,

282
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:41,000
he has to go to the market to buy groceries.

283
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,240
This is how we ensure

284
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,159
that the ingredients are fresh every day.

285
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,320
What are you looking for today?

286
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,600
- This is yellow.
- This one's good.

287
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,559
This one has turned pink.

288
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:50,879
What color is the cuttlefish?

289
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,519
It's black, just look.

290
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,399
Please deliver these things to my shop.

291
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,759
Only after these things are done,
can Mr. Qiang rest.

292
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,440
And by evening, he has to start preparing again

293
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,720
for another busy day.

294
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,080
Remember to deliver on time, okay?

295
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,864
Alright, alright.

296
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,919
It's not that I'm afraid of messing up.

297
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,759
I don't know

298
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,279
if I can be as dedicated

299
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,288
and as good as them.

300
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,440
Do you remember my first day

301
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,360
in Macau?

302
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,960
My phone was broken.

303
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,240
I went to the shop for repairs,
and the boss said it can't be rushed.

304
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,039
It was because of you
that I got it that very night.

305
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,120
I'll treat you to a meal another day,
something delicious.

306
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,440
- Lobster over rice.
- Got it.

307
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,799
And the restaurant we ate at on the first day.

308
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,759
At that time, I thought I had found

309
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,559
a very niche restaurant.

310
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,440
But as soon as I walked in, I found out that

311
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,240
the clerk was your neighbor.

312
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,480
It seems like wherever you go,
there are a lot of people you know.

313
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,039
- Please deliver it to Zhen Qiang for me later.
- Alright, sure.

314
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:08,160
I brought a birthday gift for Bin.

315
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,880
Hey, is there anyone

316
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,440
that you don't know in Macau?

317
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:17,279
Macau is a small place.

318
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,359
As long as you stay long enough,

319
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,160
you'll know someone everywhere you go.

320
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,880
No, it's not like that.

321
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,039
It's because of you.

322
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,880
I've been striving alone for so many years.

323
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,680
I've only interacted with the neighbors
in the chat group.

324
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,480
But you remember
the birthday of your neighbor's child.

325
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,119
Perhaps even you haven't realized.

326
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:48,440
You have a certain

327
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,440
unique charm

328
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,440
that makes people feel

329
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,839
trust and reliance.

330
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,000
Mr. Xu is just like you.

331
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,640
People around you,

332
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,119
the things that happen to them,

333
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,920
the difficulties they encounter,

334
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,559
you all deal with it

335
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,160
as if it were your own matters.

336
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,799
You don't know that people like you

337
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,599
are actually very precious.

338
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,519
I'm not as good as you say.

339
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:31,039
<i>♫ Everything seems all too ordinary ♫</i>

340
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,440
Mr. Xu once told me

341
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,799
that the reason he opened Zhen Qiang

342
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,160
was because

343
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,680
what he wanted

344
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,160
was his neighbors

345
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,480
and his friends together.

346
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,519
Everyone is brought together

347
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,680
by fate.

348
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:55,279
This is the purpose of Zhen Qiang's existence.

349
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,759
I also remember Mr. Xu saying

350
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:02,160
that even if one day,

351
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,519
Zhen Qiang really can't continue.

352
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,119
It's alright.

353
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,519
That would mean the fate has run its course.

354
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:14,848
<i>♫ But, baby ♫</i>

355
00:19:14,848 --> 00:19:18,208
<i>♫ Life is more than this ♫</i>

356
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,608

00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:23,000
<i>♫ To feel the sunshine ♫</i>

358
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,119
So I really think that you

359
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:28,000
shouldn't put too much pressure on yourself.

360
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:31,960
You should just follow

361
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,240
the life creed that you and Mr. Xu believe in

362
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,400
and live that way.

363
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,279
Just try your best to do well

364
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,680
the things that are in front of you.

365
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,000
Live one day at a time.

366
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,079
Each day you have is a day.

367
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,880
Do it the way you want to.

368
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,160
And I don't think that doing it your way
would be anything less than good.

369
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,408
<i>♫ Feel free to have a beautiful dream ♫</i>

370
00:19:57,408 --> 00:20:02,912
<i>♫ You've always had wings ♫</i>

371
00:20:02,912 --> 00:20:10,912
<i>♫ Little fish also have their own ocean ♫</i>

372
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,839
I thought of a joke.

373
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,519
A calf, a lamb, a piglet.

374
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,640
The three of them

375
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,480
walk into Zhen Qiang at the same time.

376
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,279
Who won't get beaten up?

377
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,720
That's a tough joke.

378
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:47,119
The piglet, right?

379
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,799
No.

380
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,880
Then who is it?

381
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,272
The lamb.

382
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,880
Because Zhen Qiang

383
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,960
never closes.

384
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,440
<i>♫ No growth can be stopped ♫</i>

385
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,640
<i>♫ Though the future is uncertain ♫</i>

386
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,912

387

<i>♫ Little fish also have their own ocean ♫</i>

395
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,400
Mr. Xu and Casey are already in the elevator.

396
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,440
They'll be here soon.

397
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,559
- Mr. Xu.
- Director Tong.

398
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,720
- Hello.
- Hello, thank you for taking the time

399
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,880
to come to our meeting.

400
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,039
- Please sit.
- Please.

401
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:05,359
Firstly, I must extend to you

402
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:07,640
our most sincere apologies
on behalf of our company.

403
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,759
Our team will definitely cooperate fully

404
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:12,079
to ensure the issue is resolved properly.

405
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,119
To my knowledge,

406
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,559
before your new member

407
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,880
Amy came,

408
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,400
the shooting had always been orderly.

409
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,880
So let's see how this can be resolved.

410
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,240
Actually, from the beginning of this project,

411
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,319
it was Miss Mai who was coordinating with me.

412
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:28,519
She is very familiar
with the content of the plan

413
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:29,640
and she has done a lot of preparatory work

414
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,759
for the shooting in Macau.

415
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,319
So we still think

416
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,640
it's more reliable

417
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,880
for her to be in charge.

418
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
I see.

419
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,440
Today, I am here to make a promise to you

420
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,519
that a similar situation

421
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:47,000
will absolutely not occur again.

422
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,359
Xinghao has always been our

423
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,880
highly valued client.

424
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,000
We will definitely not fail
the trust you have placed in us.

425
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,880
The project will continue to be managed by Mai.

426
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,079
Amy will not be involved.

427
00:23:00,064 --> 00:23:01,480
Okay.

428
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,440
Mai, there are no issues
with the progress, right?

429
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,079
Yes, we have actually adjusted the plan,

430
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:07,240
so the progress of the entire major plan

431
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,400
will not be affected at all.

432
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,759
Very good.

433
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:14,240
Then, let's leave it at that.

434
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,880
- Okay.
- Okay?

435
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,640
Thank you, Mr. Xu, for trusting us.

436
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,079
- Take care, Director Tong
- Thank you.

437
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,079
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

438
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,000
By the way, Casey,

439
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,440
the headquarters

440
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,920
has assigned a task to me.

441
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,319
- I'd like you to help me take a look.
- Okay.

442
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:37,319
They want to hold a charity auction gala

443
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,559
to enhance our brand image.

444
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,039
There's a philanthropist
from the mainland called

445
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,079
Chloe Liu.

446
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,160
She wants to organize

447
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,240
a painting exhibition focusing
on children with autism

448
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,279
to raise awareness and care.

449
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,640
I think that's a very good entry point.

450
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,240
I will send you
the information about Chloe Liu.

451
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,960
See if you can get in touch
with her in advance.

452
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,519
I'll check if she has any events
to attend in Macau recently.

453
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:54,759
I'll go see her,

454
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:56,799
get to know her, and then
see how to arrange it.

455
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,880
Very good.

456
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,200
Actually, you could go take a look

457
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,920
at how other galleries conduct their auctions.

458
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,960
Not necessarily in Macau.

459
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,359
Just to have a reference style.

460
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:07,759
Alright, I'll immediately
look up different teams.

461
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:10,152
Okay.

462
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,728
I'll go to work first.

463
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,759
What are you doing here?

464
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:28,000
Don't you have to go to the site?

465
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,480
Yes, I do.

466
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,759
But before I go, I wanted
to talk with you for a moment.

467
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,616
Okay.

468
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:40,000
The shopping mall downstairs is so big.

469
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,480
But the offices upstairs are so crowded.

470
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,440
Did you come up here
just to talk about these things?

471
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,359
I want to buy something for a friend.
Is there a discount?

472
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:49,640
If you have nothing else to say, I'll leave.

473
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,240
You know, Dad

474
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,599
is really very stubborn.

475
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,880
He has his own way of doing things.

476
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,240
He's old-fashioned and won't take advice.

477
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,599
He always misunderstands others' intentions.

478
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:04,680
His words can be unpleasant, and he
doesn't apologize when he hurts someone.

479
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,359
From childhood to adulthood,

480
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,440
he neglected you just to focus on Zhen Qiang.

481
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,480
I know you must feel
uncomfortable and aggrieved inside.

482
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,240
I understand what you're saying, okay.

483
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,400
Wait a minute, I haven't finished.

484
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,880
Can you let me finish first?

485
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,720
Okay, go ahead.

486
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,319
I'm not qualified to say this,

487
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,720
but I know it's very unfair.

488
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,359
But no matter what,

489
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,599
you're my elder brother,
the eldest son of the Xu family.

490
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,720
Every one of us cares about you a lot.

491
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:38,880
I believe they would all be proud of you

492
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,000
for your achievements today.

493
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,240
Dad is getting old.

494
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,759
It's hard for him to change his personality.

495
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,440
So as his sons,

496
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,880
all we can do is be tolerant.

497
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,960
So I hope you won't

498
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,160
hold so much against him, okay?

499
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,720
I'm not holding so much against him.
I'm not in a position to do that.

500
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
I'm not you.

501
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,960
I'm not forcing you to apologize to him.

502
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,720
I just hope that you

503
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,799
can speak all your thoughts

504
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,960
out loud for him to hear.

505
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,519
Only then does this emotional knot
have a chance to be untied.

506
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,200
Okay?

507
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,120
Alright, it's all good now.

508
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,839
You promised me.

509
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,039
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

510
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,480
Crazy.

511
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,319
Seriously, I want to buy
something for a friend.

512
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:48,880
- Do you have any discounted items?
- No.

513
00:26:56,448 --> 00:27:00,040
<i>[Zhen Qiang]</i>

514
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:17,640
Mr. Wei,

515
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,640
- Where's my dad?
- Hao, you're here.

516
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:28,640
Dad.

517
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,336
Sit down.

518
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,440
Do you need anything?

519
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,880
No.

520
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,440
I haven't been back in a long time.

521
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,680
So I came to take a look.

522
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,680
If you still want

523
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,160
to persuade me to sell the shop,

524
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:07,176
no need to say anything.

525
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,880
In your heart,

526
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,720
is this shop really that important to you, Dad?

527
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,920
After all these years,

528
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,720
I feel that this home,

529
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,759
this shop is the eldest brother,

530
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:33,960
followed by Le and Bao.

531
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,200
And I am just an outsider.

532
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:39,680
Whether I am here or not

533
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,472
is not very important.

534
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,799
I understand

535
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:46,880
that when you started Zhen Qiang,

536
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,720
it was very difficult.

537
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,960
You were too busy to take care of me,
so you sent me to Grandpa's.

538
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,160
I have never blamed you, Dad.

539
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,480
I really haven't.

540
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
But I sometimes reminisce,

541
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
once the shop was on track,

542
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,559
when we had almost made enough money,

543
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,680
could you have spared some time

544
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,799
to spend with us?

545
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,960
Do you know that I have
to support not only you,

546
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,839
but also this group of old buddies?

547
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,519
Their whole families depend on Zhen Qiang
for a living, do you know that?

548
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:24,920
I know, Dad.

549
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,119
So many big bosses

550
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:27,200
want to buy Zhen Qiang.

551
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,880
Why won't you sell it to anyone?

552
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,839
Everyone gets the money and is happy.

553
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,079
No need to work so hard.

554
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,359
What's not good about that?

555
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:35,039
Besides money,

556
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,880
what else can you talk about?

557
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,079
Why have you become like this?

558
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:42,359
You're nothing like my son.

559
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,279
That's true.

560
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,359
I've been with Grandpa since I was little.

561
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,599
I was sent to America for studies as I grew up.

562
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,359
I know you and Mom worked hard,

563
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:04,079
but have you ever thought
about when I was in America,

564
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,240
I heard friends complain

565
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,680
that their parents were annoying,

566
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,839
saying they nag a lot,

567
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,519
and I didn't know how much I wish
I had a dad to nag me?

568
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:30,559
Anything is fine.

569
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,759
I just want you to understand

570
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:34,680
that Zhen Qiang didn't get to where it is today

571
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,680
because of you alone.

572
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,359
You have many apprentices

573
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,880
and so many old pals.

574
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,480
They are all very capable.

575
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,279
Even if you want to let go,

576
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,519
Zhen Qiang will not fall.

577
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,720
You can rest assured.

578
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,680
But if one day you're worn out,

579
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:56,559
it would be troublesome for the whole family.

580
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,640
So it's okay whether you pay
attention to me or not.

581
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,720
But you can't ignore Mom.
She cares about you a lot.

582
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:14,599
Are you done talking?

583
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:16,936
No.

584
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,960
There's more.

585
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,200
I brought Jiajia back to meet you.

586
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,319
One of the reasons

587
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:32,359
was to let you know

588
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:35,400
that your son has grown up.

589
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,720
That you have a daughter-in-law now,

590
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,559
and you could be holding
your grandchild any minute now.

591
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,559
But what was your attitude toward her?

592
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:44,559
You've been saying for years
that I don't understand you.

593
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,400
In fact, you've never understood me.

594
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,599
Finish this cup of tea before you go.

595
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:14,564
<i>[Zhen Qiang]</i>

596
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,519
Jianming, talk to the person
next to you in a bit.

597
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:28,000
Let's switch seats.

598
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,200
I want to sit with you.

599
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:38,000
<i>Jiajia, we've boarded the plane.</i>

600
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,279
<i>Contact upon landing.</i>

601
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,400
- Hello.
- Jiajia.

602
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,640
Okay, I'll send you

603
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,400
the new flight number.

604
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,480
No need to rush.

605
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,519
Right, when my plane lands,

606
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,319
I'll call you, then you can leave home.

607
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:55,720
Alright, see you in a bit.

608
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,000
Professor Xu.

609
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,079
What a coincidence.

610
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:12,920
Our seats are together, too.

611
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,599
Right, you see, I just

612
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:16,920
sent Jiajia a WeChat message.

613
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,039
When we get to Macau, just make
one trip and it's settled.

614
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,839
Yes, yes.

615
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,400
Let me introduce you.

616
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,759
- Li Meng.
- Li Meng.

617
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:32,680
- Right, right.
- It's been several years, Li Meng.

618
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,960
Tang Wei.

619
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,079
Miss Tang.

620
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:38,400
So you…

621
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,000
We were guiding students
in revising their theses, right?

622
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,279
And we checked in late.

623
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,559
So, so these were the only two seats left.

624
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:44,599
Well, well, Li Meng,

625
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:45,920
let's change seats.

626
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,000
You sit here.

627
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Is that okay?

628
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,519
Of course.

629
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,000
Alright, well, well…

630
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,000
Please walk inside, thank you.

631
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,359
Excuse me, sir?

632
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:00,119
It's okay, we just wanted

633
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,200
to exchange seats.

634
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,519
Sorry, please let the passengers go in first.

635
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:03,960
Please let the passengers go first, okay?

636
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,000
Sorry, sorry.

637
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,079
Then, then we'll wait a moment.

638
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,319
Let's wait.

639
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:09,719
Lady, please move forward, thank you.

640
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,559
I checked the weather forecast today.

641
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:12,880
It's all showers today.

642
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,719
The weather in Macau
is always changing like this.

643
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,239
- Come on.
- It's really nice.

644
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:21,760
It's only been a few days, and you
know Macau like the back of your hand.

645
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,719
Isn't it because I have the best guide?

646
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,168
Fish?

647
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,079
Better than Fish.

648
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:33,800
Really?

649
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,199
Then it must be me.

650
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,440
Oh, it's me.

651
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,079
With Mai here,

652
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,920
she is very good at execution.

653
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,000
Our delay was caught up with

654
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,199
- Director.
- thanks to her.

655
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,880
- Great.
- Let me tell you about the second location.

656
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
They just went there

657
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,360
and they said it was drizzling right now.

658
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,920
I was thinking if the rain
gets heavier later on

659
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,039
and if we can't control it,

660
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:55,320
let's go to the third location first

661
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,599
to shoot the interior scenes.

662
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:58,679
- I've talked with the crew, we can shoot any time.
- Okay, okay.

663
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,480
- It's ready.
- Then you can discuss the next scene.

664
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,960
Let me quickly finish shooting this part.

665
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,960
- Okay.
- Alright.

666
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,960
Thank you.

667
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,840
Thank you, Director Qiang.

668
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,119
Come on, let's keep moving, come on.

669
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,920
Director Tong, please sit.

670
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,280
Okay.

671
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,000
Everyone has been working
hard these past few days.

672
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,400
And if we finish late,

673
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,039
prepare some supper for everyone.

674
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:19,159
Okay, no problem.

675
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,039
Yes, the shooting here is quite tough.

676
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:23,679
But actually, everyone is doing quite well.

677
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:25,480
I know you've worked hard too.

678
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,519
This project for Xinghao

679
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:27,920
is indeed difficult.

680
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,320
When Maggie is on vacation,

681
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,320
her coordination is not keeping up either.

682
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,800
After I get back to the company,

683
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,199
I'll hand over part of Maggie's work to you.

684
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:38,719
You've been with the company
for so many years since graduation.

685
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,960
Your experience is sufficient.
I'll form a new team for you.

686
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,079
You'll lead the team independently.

687
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,159
This way, in terms of creation,

688
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,519
you'll have more freedom.

689
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,880
You can have control over yourself.

690
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,360
What do you think?

691
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,040
Really?

692
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,000
Do you have the confidence
to lead your own team?

693
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,280
Of course, I do.

694
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,400
I've always really hoped

695
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,800
to be able to lead a project.

696
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,880
Then there's no problem.

697
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,679
I'll just go back to the company
and talk to the higher-ups.

698
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:04,000
Thank you, Director Tong.

699
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,239
Thank you for trusting me.

700
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:07,000
Don't celebrate too soon.

701
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,039
The greater the ability,
the greater the responsibility,

702
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:11,159
and the greater
the company's expectations of you.

703
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,639
- Yes.
- Good luck.

704
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:13,719
Thank you.

705
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,400
Excuse me, here you go.

706
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,088
Thank you.

707
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,039
Ladies and gentlemen.

708
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:29,320
Welcome aboard China-Australia Airlines.

709
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,840
After you enter the cabin,

710
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,239
please pay attention to the seat numbers
on the edge of the overhead bins

711
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,719
and take your corresponding seat.

712
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:36,000
You can store your carry-on luggage

713
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
inside the cabin luggage racks

714
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
and under the seats.

715
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,199
<i>[Listen to books]</i>
Please keep the aisle clear.

716
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,440
Thank you for your cooperation.

717
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,280
Jiajia's boyfriend.

718
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,800
Have you met him?

719
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,679
What does he do for work?

720
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,400
It's my first time meeting him too.

721
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Jiajia says

722
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,880
he works in hotel management.

723
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
So, if they

724
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,119
invited us

725
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,599
to make a trip to Macau

726
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:11,719
and meet up,

727
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:15,280
this means it's quite serious.

728
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,440
Maybe so.

729
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,559
Jiajia has grown up.

730
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:24,199
I haven't asked too much
about her romantic affairs.

731
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:33,599
You've been quite busy recently.

732
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,800
I see your moments on social media,

733
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
and you are always flying around.

734
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,960
Yes, it's been quite busy.

735
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,559
What project are you busy with recently?

736
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,559
We've acquired an entertainment company.

737
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:46,360
The cultural and entertainment track
has great potential.

738
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,599
But it's hard to predict at this time.

739
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,159
Li Meng.

740
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:53,239
That, come over here,
and I'll switch seats with you.

741
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:54,679
No, no, no, everyone's already seated.

742
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:56,239
I'm sitting on the inside.

743
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:57,519
It's also quite cramped.

744
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:59,320
I like to sit by the aisle.

745
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,800
Come on, it's okay.

746
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,848
Come on.

747
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,639
- Go ahead, go ahead.
- Thanks, Ms. Wei.

748
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:09,352
It's alright.

749
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,159
- Jianming.
- Meng.

750
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,880
I'm going to take a nap for a bit.

751
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,960
I got up too early today.

752
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,639
Mr. Qiang.

753
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,679
Not taking a nap?

754
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:04,440
You came as soon as he left.

755
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,400
Was it planned?

756
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,159
Who are you talking about?

757
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:10,800
What for?

758
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,039
Don't you

759
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:14,480
have to work with your boss?

760
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,559
Today's filming

761
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:16,559
is almost over.

762
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:19,079
They don't need me anymore.

763
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:20,840
If you have nothing to do, go get busy.

764
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,119
We will open for business in a while.

765
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:25,960
Who says I've got nothing to do?

766
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,440
However,

767
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,840
before working

768
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,760
I've got to eat something first, right?

769
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,840
What do you want to do?

770
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,599
You're not asking me to cook
something for you, are you?

771
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,840
Mr. Qiang.

772
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,519
Please, I'm so hungry.

773
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:43,599
What do you want?

774
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,320
The boss calls the shots. It's up to you.

775
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,679
Do you know the thing

776
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,639
Chef hates most?

777
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:54,960
Not paying for the meal?

778
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,280
It's "up to you".

779
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,079
If you want the pork liver to be refreshing,

780
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:06,000
you mustn't skimp on the preparations.

781
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,880
Got it, take it to wash after rubbing it.

782
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,320
Wash it until the water is clear.

783
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,639
And then after that,

784
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:13,639
boil the water before adding the pork liver.

785
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,039
I know, these things are basic.

786
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:17,079
What you know is just superficial.

787
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:19,880
Don't underestimate these basic things.

788
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,320
Every restaurant,

789
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,880
besides relying on their signature dishes,

790
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,199
depends on these basics to keep afloat.

791
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:27,559
If the foundation is not well laid,

792
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,159
it won't take long

793
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:31,400
before the neighbors stop coming.

794
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,840
I see.

795
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,400
So then take this…

796
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,159
All right.

797
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,360
If you're hungry, go out and wait.

798
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,679
Don't make trouble here.

799
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:42,280
No, what are you doing? I really want to learn.

800
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,599
Learn what?

801
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,119
Learn how to cook from you.

802
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:48,000
Although I have your genes,

803
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,880
it's still just superficial, isn't it?

804
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,519
The essence of each dish

805
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:53,039
relies on experience.

806
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:54,960
Only you can teach me.

807
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,079
Although our restaurant

808
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,559
has many masters,

809
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:59,159
I still have to do it myself.

810
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:00,639
How can I distinguish

811
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:01,639
whether this is delicious

812
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,119
or if that is delicious.

813
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,639
Right?

814
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:09,199
You usually don't like to go into the kitchen.

815
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:11,920
How come you've suddenly changed today?

816
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,679
Because I think eating

817
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,480
is a very common thing for everyone,

818
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,280
but it is actually very important.

819
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,760
So I want to put my heart

820
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,119
into studying it well.

821
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:31,880
If you really want to learn,

822
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,960
please take it seriously.

823
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,960
I'm very strict.

824
00:41:37,216 --> 00:41:38,679
Copy that.

825
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:41,576
Take it to rinse with water.

826
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,544
Yes, sir.

827
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:58,880
When stir-frying clams,

828
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,079
you must use high heat,

829
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,719
and you can't stop in the middle.

830
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:05,679
Okay.

831
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:07,519
Wait until all the clams open

832
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:10,000
to add salt and sugar.

833
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,480
What's next?

834
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,039
- Add oil.
- Yes.

835
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:26,719
That's enough, no need for so much.

836
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:30,840
First, add the leafy greens,
then the thicker stems.

837
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,199
And then,

838
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:41,928
cooking wine.

839
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,000
How long should it be stewed?

840
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
- Ten minutes.
- Ten minutes?

841
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,119
Three minutes.

842
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:52,400
You're so harsh, ten minutes.

843
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,719
Turn up the heat.

844
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:54,960
The flame is too low.

845
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,079
Okay, copy that.

846
00:43:00,182 --> 00:43:05,014
<i>♫ The sun creeps in, it catches ♫</i>

847
00:43:05,014 --> 00:43:10,462
