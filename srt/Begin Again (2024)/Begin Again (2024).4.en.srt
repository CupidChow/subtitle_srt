Of course not.

125
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,959

130
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,959
I think Macau

00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,679
is a wonderful place.

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,159
Yes, because it's hard to find

133
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,559

134
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,720

00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,679
traditional Chinese cultural elements,

136
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,480
and many Western-style buildings.

137
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,720
Kind of fusion.

138
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,376

just architecture, but also the people.

139
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,320
- How?
- Just like that restaurant I had dinner,

140
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,080
the owner

141
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,519
was really nice and adorable.

142
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,080
I was sitting there,

143
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,440
and he chatted with me a lot.

144
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,600
In Macau, it feels like

145
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,399
between people, there is no…

146
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,919
Guard.

147
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,360
Right.

148
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,440
No defenses, no pettiness.

149
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,120
And it's easy for people to get close.

150
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,840

If you haven't, you'd definitely go try.

154
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,480
You must try it next time.

155

157
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,519
Actually, I'm glad

158
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,480
that Macau brings you

159
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,720
so many good impressions.

160
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,559
I find it quite surprising too.

161
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,759
When I first came here,

162
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,120
I felt quite embarrassed.

163
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,840
I had no internet or money.

164
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,080
And my work wasn't going smoothly either.

165
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,759
I felt like I was not even a modern person.

166
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,799
At that time,
I thought it's just a business trip,

167
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,960
I could leave after a few days.

168
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,919
But now,

169
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,240
I don't want to leave.

170
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,000
That's great. Then stay a few more days.

171
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,360
Macau is small,

172
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,240
but I can take you

173
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,159
to lots of tasty and fun places.

174
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,440
But I really am here on business.

175
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,360
I know. I hope you can

176
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,799
come back to Macau sooner.

177
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,480
I don't know.

178
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,639
I don't even know if my proposal will pass.

179
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,000
What if it doesn't pass?

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,320
That's wonderful.

181
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,720
Take a long break and then come back to Macau.

182
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,879
Then I'll take you
to understand the real Macau.

186
00:11:17,472 --> 00:11:23,261
<i>♫ I need someone like you ♫</i>

187
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:27,616
<i>♫ I need your heart ♫</i>

188
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:32,144
<i>♫ To beat with me ♫</i>

189
00:11:32,144 --> 00:11:38,016
<i>♫ Someone to see me through ♫</i>

190
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:46,029
<i>♫ I need you by my side forever ♫</i>

<i>♫ Someone like you ♫</i>

195
00:12:01,726 --> 00:12:08,437
<i>♫ I need your love be mine ♫</i>

196
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,184
Here.

197
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,639
Give you something wonderful

198
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,240
of Macau.

199
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,360
- What is this?
- Herbal tea.

200
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,559
You don't usually drink herbal tea, do you?

201
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,720
- Yes.
- To cool down your internal heat.

202
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,519
The herbal tea reminds me of something.

203
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,960
I noticed that in Macau,

204
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,080
the tea cafes, the ice houses,

205
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,919
all close at six in the evening.

206
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,320
Like the restaurant where I just had dinner

207
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,279
doesn't open until five in the afternoon.

208
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,919
It feels like you all

209
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,200
don't want to make money.

210
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,248
That's not true.

211
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,080
We want to make money,

212
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,720
but we'll never make enough money.

213
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,360
So if you don't enjoy your life

214
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,912
for making money,

215
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,919
that'd be a loss.

216
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,080
Then listen to my everyday life.

217
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,480
I go to work and get off work every day,

218
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,000
and then continue to work overtime after work.

219
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,279
No matter how long I have slept,

220
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,072
I still have to make myself look good

221
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:13,480
before going to work.

222
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,919
Going to work means catching the morning rush.

223
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:16,960
I can take a taxi,

224
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,480
but only by taking the metro

225
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,679
can I avoid traffic jams.

226
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,720
This way I can

227
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,879
punch in on time.

228
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,840
If I am on consecutive business trips,

229
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,600
my suitcase will always stay in the living room

230
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,960
and there's no need to even close it,

231
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,519
just toss a few clothes into it

232
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,000
and then take it with you.

233
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,639
The house is more like

234
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,480
a hotel I stay at.

235
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,360
Work is my life.

236
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,399
Actually, I have also
experienced this kind of life.

237
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,320
But don't you think

238
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,000
you're very much like a non-player character?

239
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,840
Doing a lot of work every day,

240
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,279
but none of them

241
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,000
are the tasks you should do.

242
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,279
But I still complete

243
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,440
many complex and difficult tasks every day.

244
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,600
But they are all tasks
assigned to you by others.

245
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,000
And why make yourself

246
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,200
so tired and so tense?

247
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,159
I don't think ordinary people
have that much time

248
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,120
to sit and ponder
whether they are tired or not.

249
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,080
Because that's just what life is.

250
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,759
Year after year, day after day,
working hard without complaints.

251
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,879
Every day, everyone is fighting

252
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,519
for the life that they've planned

253
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,840
for themselves.

254
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,399
Everyone lives like this.

255
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:39,120
Yes, but I am not

256
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,440
talking about other people's lives.

257
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,639
I am talking about your life.

258
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,679
I think

259
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,519
you are somewhat trapped in your work.

260
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,840
I think you are excellent,

261
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,039
and you don't need to prove it to anyone.

262
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,120
Just like that day we were
at the Calçada da Igreja de S. Lázaro,

263
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,840
I really wanted to invite you for a drink.

264
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,159
But you were too busy to sit down.

265
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,120
You're here in Macau, why is that?

266
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:31,968
Yes.

267
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,320
But perhaps this is my life.

268
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,519
I just have to work hard for my life.

269
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm not as lucky as you.

270
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,279
I think everyone

271
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,679
has their own right

272
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,960
to choose how to live their lives.

273
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,639
You should choose the life you want.

274
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,240
You don't understand

275
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,480
what I am fighting for.

276
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,639
I know what you are fighting for.

277
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,840
And I have also experienced
what you've been through.

278
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,559
- You don't understand.
- I told you I've been through it. I understand.

279
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,320
Maybe you've been through it,

280
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,519
and what you're saying is right,

281
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,840
but you don't know my past,

282
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,600
my experiences, my life,

283
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,120
or my current situation.

284
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,584
Hello.

285
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:23,936
Okay, I…

286
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,039
I'll go send it to you.

287
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,104
Just wait.

288
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,440
I have work to deal with.

289
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,679
I'm leaving now.

290
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,696
Wait, I…

291
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,519
I can wait for you to finish.

292
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,559
Thank you very much for these past few days.

293
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,480
Thank you for your help.

294
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,624
Bye.

295
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,679
We haven't finished.

296
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:12,128
<i>♫ Using all my strength ♫</i>

297
00:17:13,856 --> 00:17:18,085
<i>♫ Still, there's no response ♫</i>

298
00:17:18,085 --> 00:17:22,065
<i>♫ The city is strange and cold ♫</i>

299
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,965
<i>♫ I'm used to ♫</i>

300
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:29,407
<i>♫ Every day's routine ♫</i>

301
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,096
<i>♫ Day by day ♫</i>

302
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:34,656
<i>♫ Spinning as usual ♫</i>

303
00:17:35,232 --> 00:17:39,148
<i>♫ Occasionally there will be cracks ♫</i>

304
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:44,864
<i>♫ A bit of unease and fear will show ♫</i>

305
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:49,181
<i>♫ Yet afraid to be seen ♫</i>

306
00:17:49,728 --> 00:17:51,712
<i>♫ I'm also used to ♫</i>

307
00:17:51,712 --> 00:17:56,160
<i>♫ Hide all the emotions ♫</i>

308
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,839
<i>♫ With every breath ♫</i>

309
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,079
Among the pieces

310
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,200
we displayed today,

311
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,640
some of them

312
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,400
are using a fusion collage techniques.

313
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,200
You can see his use of color is very special.

314
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,519
At times extremely restrained,

315
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:12,079
and at other times, very bold.

316
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,279
Presenting different emotions

317
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:15,960
- and expression under various experiences.
- Yes.

318
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,440
So you can also feel

319
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,880
the emotions on this canvas

320
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,039
are flowing,

321
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,680
carefree, diverse,

322
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,440
complex and vivid.

323
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,200
We can take a look over there at his

324
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,440
another signature piece.

325
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,736
I really like you.

326
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,640
You also want a signature?

327
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,160
No, I want to show my guests this painting.

328
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,208
- Sorry, sorry, this way.
- Excuse me, come here.

329
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,839
Could you sign for me as well?

330
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,119
I am not on the race today.

331
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,880
That's it for today.

332
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,519
Okay? Thank you for your support.

333
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:47,559
So this piece

334
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,559
of his

335
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,359
received high praise at an auction

336
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,160
in Paris last week.

337
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,640
This is made with propylene paint.

338
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,000
Actually, only his mid-to-late period works

339
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,240
used propylene paint.

340
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,799
Mr. Xu, looking for me?

341
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,960
Just call me Howard.

342
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,200
Actually, I've

343
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,880
just received a temporary task.

344
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,200
You need to take care of a VIP guest.

345
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,072
Me?

346
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,559
VIP guests are all managed by dedicated staff
from the VIP Department.

347
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,319
Yes, but this guest

348
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:18,519
is quite special.

349
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,759
He's Mr. Frank,

350
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,200
the son of Ms. Lam,

351
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,440
the HR director

352
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,640
from the group headquarters.

353
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,200
Mr. Frank specifically wanted you
to take care of him.

354
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
That's it.

355
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,424
Okay.

356
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,240
Then, Mr. Frank,

357
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,640
does he have any special requirements?

358
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,000
All of Mr. Frank's information is right here.

359
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Itinerary,

360
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,799
notes for attention are all in here.

361
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,599
- Take your time reading it.
- Got it.

362
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,640
I will familiarize myself

363
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,799
with all the requirements and information soon.

364
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,759
No need to rush.

365
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,640
I just told you to take it easy.

366
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,960
Take it easy, okay?

367
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,240
Okay, then I'll get to work.

368
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,240
Okay.

369
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,319
Seriously,

370
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,799
don't let me see you after six.

371
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,200
I'll send you
the detailed information that follows

372
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,440
to your email.

373
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,680
Okay, thank you.

374
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,319
Feel free to find me anytime.

375
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,960
- Well, I'm leaving.
- Goodbye, take care.

376
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,519
Like this one?

377
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,000
How do you know?

378
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,319
You've been looking at it for a long time.

379
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,279
So you've been paying attention
to me for quite some time as well.

380
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,112
Of course, you are a guest.

381
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,880
I just think this

382
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,200
is quite interesting.

383
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,160
See, its colors are very rich inside,

384
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,720
but it's wrapped

385
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,880
in a plastic film.

386
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,279
So, I assume that this artist

387
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,960
might have a very rich inner world.

388
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,480
However, he wants to deliberately

389
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,759
keep a distance from the world,

390
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,119
wanting to hide himself.

391
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:58,880
Of course, I'm no expert.

392
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,559
So my understanding

393
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,664
might not be quite correct.

394
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,880
Everyone has different perceptions.

395
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,480
Different cognitive understandings,
different life experiences,

396
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,079
even different moods

397
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,119
at this very moment,

398
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,400
can make one see it differently.

399
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,240
So, there's no right or wrong.

400
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,504
What about you?

If we meet again.

404
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:40,119
After all,
today is the first day of the exhibit.

405
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,160
See you.

Hello, I'm Casey from the PR department.

411
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,160
Mr. Frank, hello.

412
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,480
I am Casey from the PR department.

413
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,240
I'm fully responsible

414
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,759
in Macau.

415
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:47,799
Here's my business card.

416
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,079
If you need anything,

417
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,400
you can contact me anytime.

418
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:02,640
According to your schedule,

419
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,400
your first activity is

420
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,599
attending a piano masterclass.

421
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,720
You have about ten minutes to get ready.

422
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:10,640
No need to get ready. Let's go.

Housing Department? I'm Casey.

425
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,279
From now on, for Mr. Frank's room,

426
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:28,720
please do not place any more cookies.

He is allergic to wheat bran.

428
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:32,039
Then, I'll prepare you a list

429
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,200
of the dietary requirements
during the guest's hotel stay.

430
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,000
And I will share a copy
with the Housing and Catering Departments.

431
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,400
Lastly, remember

432
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,559
to purchase the allergy medicine for the guest.

433
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,599
In case it is needed,

434
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,359
we could have it on hand.

435
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,000
Okay, thank you.

436
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:56,119
Mr. Frank, there are some situations

437
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,599
I need to confirm with you.

438
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,839
Your schedule in Macau

439
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,079
is about

440
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:02,160
piano masterclasses, piano room practice,

441
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,119
and daily swim training.

442
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,839
Besides that, I would like to know

443
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,880
if you have any other guardians

444
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,119
or relatives

445
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,960
participating in this trip to Macau,

446
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,799
so I can get in touch with him in time.

447
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:13,888
It's just Mike.

448
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,240
Actually, I need to report

449
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,920
your daily itinerary to Ms. Lam.

450
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,359
But if there's an emergency,

451
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,680
due to the time difference,

452
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,079
if I can't reach Ms. Lam,

453
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,480
who should I confirm with?

454
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,584
Me myself.

455
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,319
Then, I wonder if it's possible

456
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,960
to give me

457
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,440
the contact of your other guardian.

458
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,000
My guardian is my mom.

459
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,119
From now on,

460
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,200
just go with the schedule.

461
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:43,759
I'm tired. I'd like to rest.

462
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,960
Sorry, then I won't disturb you.

463
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:09,319
Excuse me, Mr. Frank. I need to take a call.

464
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,559
Hello, Howard.

465
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:13,119
<i>Casey, have you picked up Mr. Frank yet?</i>

466
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,079
I've just picked him up.

467
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,680
He didn't come out immediately after the class.

468
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,880
So, it was a bit delayed.

469
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,960
<i>Since you've picked Mr. Frank up,</i>

470
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,599
<i>you should tell me right away.</i>

471
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,960
<i>If Ms. Lam asks me,</i>

472
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,039
<i>I couldn't answer her</i>

473
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,559
<i>if I didn't know what's going on.</i>

474
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,640
Understood. Sorry, it won't happen again.

475
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,400
If I just wanted someone to watch over me,

476
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,559
I wouldn't have chosen you.

477
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,839
- What do you mean?
- I thought you were different from the others.

478
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:41,039
At least, you're not that obedient.

479
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,024
Mr. Frank,

480
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,920
your mom has entrusted us

481
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,680
with your schedule in Macau.

482
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,079
Reporting your whereabouts at any time

483
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,839
is to ensure your safety.

484
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:53,400
If you are not satisfied with me…

485
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,480
To be honest,

486
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,960
she doesn't care about me that much.

487
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,079
You're like being my nanny
and having to report anytime.

488
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,880

In that game, you had a queen
against a lone bishop.

You could have used the box method

540

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,759
Does the breakfast not suit your taste?

549
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:24,240
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

550
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,759
Joe.

551
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,440
I've been waiting for you.

552
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,119
Thank you for buying us the cake.

553
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,799
I've wanted to eat this cake
for quite some time,

554
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,079
but there's always a long queue every day.

555
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,319
I don't have the time to buy it.

556
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,240
So you didn't buy it?

557
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,039
Then it must have been Eric.

558
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:42,759
But Eric will definitely leave his name.

559
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:44,839
Just a matchstick.

560
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:46,720
So mysterious.

561
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,559
How does he know I like to eat

562
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,559
this brand of cake?

563
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,799
You must have mentioned it,

564
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,839
and he remembered it.

565
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:55,960
How sweet.

566
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,440
He lined up to buy cake for you.

567
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,920
But I've never mentioned it.

568
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,279
Whatever, I'm fine with it.

569
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,799
Let's eat together.

570
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:06,799
Don't.

571
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,880
He lined up to buy it for you.

572
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,279
How can I finish it all?

573
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,799
- Stop being so polite, go share it.
- Right.

574
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,599
Looks delicious, thank you.

575
00:32:51,744 --> 00:32:55,136
<i>[Went to return books
at the Sir Robert Ho Tung Library.]</i>

576
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,160
Mr. Frank.

577
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,279
It's about time.

578
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,680
Mr. Frank.

579
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,799
It's about time.

580
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,200
Mike, can I not go?

581
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,039
Sorry, Mr. Wei.

582
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,319
I'm not the one in charge.

583
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,440
- Alright, I hope he gets well soon.
- Thank you.

584
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,480
Okay.

585
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,839
You don't need to participate in today's event.

586
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,240
I've already told the teacher

587
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,480
that you are still adjusting to the jet lag,

588
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,960
and feeling a bit unwell,

589
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,279
so you can't do any intense exercise.

590
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,160
Why do you help me?

591
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:09,639
You are my client.

592
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,320
Meeting your needs is my job.

593
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:18,144
However,

594
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:20,119
you mom

595
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,719
can't know about this.

596
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,760
Otherwise, both of us will be in trouble.

597
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:25,632
Got it.

598
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,480
No other schedule is arranged for today.

599
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,599
Anything else that you need me to help?

600
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,880
If no,

601
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,119
I'll go deal with other work

602
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,800
after you finish the meal.

603
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,000
Does your hotel have a gallery?

604
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,064
Yes.

605
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,264
Would you like to take a look?

606
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,696
No problem.

607
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,760
I'll make an appointment
with my colleague from the gallery,

608
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
letting her guide you through.

609
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,616
Join us.

610
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,352
Casey.

611
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,559
Mr. Frank.

612
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:10,480
This is the curator
from the Monte solo exhibition,

613
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,840
Josephine.

614
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,519
Hi, Mr. Frank.

615
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:14,920
Welcome to our gallery.

616
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,159
Would you like me to introduce

617
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:17,679
you about this series of works?

618
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:19,360
No need, I'll look around myself.

619
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,360
Okay.

620
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,079
We have prepared afternoon tea over there.

621
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,280
You can try it if you're interested.

622
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,079
I don't eat things carelessly.
I have allergies.

623
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,840
Okay, then I won't disturb you.

624
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,159
You've had a hard time.

625
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,440
He's so cute.

626
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,440
I feel like such a failure.

627
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:51,639
I can't communicate with the child at all.

628
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:53,480
I've already done everything for him.

629
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,199
I've given him whatever he wants,

630
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:57,280
but he still seems unsatisfied.

631
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,360
I can't handle him.

632
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:01,639
Do you want some tips?

633
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:04,760
Any tricks?

634
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:06,752
Go ahead.

635
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,000
Maybe just don't try too hard.

636
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,239
But you just said,

637
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:15,199
"Mr. Frank, we have prepared afternoon tea…"

638
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:25,360
I was just trying to greet him.

639
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,719
But you are different.

640
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:27,880
You're with him every day.

641
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,639
I don't know how long I can hold on.

642
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,800
So,

643
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,960
you could try not to do everything he wants,

644
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,840
and then he might think you value him.

645
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,320
It seems

646
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,840
to be a trick what you usually use

647
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,000
to deal with the men around you, right?

648
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,440
He's just a child.

649
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,320
Psychologically speaking,

650
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,480
male psychology

651
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,400
is categorized under child psychology.

652
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,920
The principle remains the same.

653
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:55,000
Really?

654
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,519
Men are like children.

655
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:58,840
Just treat him

656
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,880
as an adult.

657
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
Don't keep thinking he's the boss's son,

658
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,920
making yourself timid.

659
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,320
Give it a try.

660
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,599
It might work.

661
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
- Okay. Alright.
- I'm off.

662
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,320
Is the sea in Macau beautiful?

663
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:27,440
Actually, the sea in Macau

664
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:29,760
is nothing special,

665
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:32,159
just like any other sea,

666
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:34,599
bringing peace to everyone.

667
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:59,039
Any other places you want to go?

668
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:01,119
I'm tired. I want to go back.

669
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,280
Aren't you coming with me?

670
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:45,760
Joe.

671
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,800
- You're here, too? What a coincidence!
- Yes.

672
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,639
What a coincidence.

673
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:57,280
Do you also love to read here?

674
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:59,039
I came to return books.

675
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,840
Returning books? I just happened
to finish this one as well.

676
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,904
<i>[Selected Letters of Van Gogh]</i>
I need to return it too.

677
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:05,719
Let's do it together.

678
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:07,680
I can carry it for you.

679
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,392
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

680
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,519
Have you heard a saying?

681
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,599
Met once, what a coincidence.

682
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,280
Met twice, what a chance.

683
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,639
Met third, what a fate.

684
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:29,840
No.

685
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
But I've heard a saying.

686
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,159
All coincidences are long premeditated.

687
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,840
Okay, I admit, I did premeditate.

688
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,360
But it wasn't for long.

689
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:50,880
How did you know?

690
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:53,280
You just said it yourself.

691
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,719
Okay.

692
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,639
That time at the Chinese medicine clinic,
you went there to look for me, right?

693
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,440
When did you realize it?

694
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,679
Your acting was too clumsy.

695
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,719
But there is one thing you overlooked.

696
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,480
The second time we met at the bar.

697
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,079
I actually went there
to look for you on purpose.

698
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,719
I remember now.

699
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:18,239
It was when you got cozy with a beauty, right?

700
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,800
- Come on, give it to me.
- I'm returning the books.

701
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,519
No. Here you are. Thank you.

702
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:24,679
I really don't know her.

703
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:26,039
I must explain it to you.

704
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:28,159
Look at that expression of yours.

705
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,760
You don't trust me.

706
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,800
- I do.
- Sorry, Miss Chen.

707
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,000
You have extra charges for these books

708
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,960
because they are overdue.

709
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,280
Okay, just deduct it.

710
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,400
I forgot to return them
because of too many business trips recently.

711
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,760
- Done?
- Yes.

712
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,440
You don't come here often, do you?

713
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:45,000
I was away on a business trip before.

714
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,208
Let's go.

715
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,719
This building has been around
for over a hundred years.

716
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,360
Previously, a wealthy gentleman
named Ho Tung lived here.

717
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,440
After he passed away,

718
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,639
he donated this place to the government.

719
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:01,239
And then it became the library today.

720
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:04,400
You're not a local here, are you?

721
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,679
After all, your accent

722
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:06,800
is a bit different from theirs.

723
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,519
My dad is from Guangzhou,

724
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:11,616
and my mom is from Nanjing.

725
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:13,800
Then why are you so familiar with

726
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,880
Macau?

727
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,920
After all, I've been living here

728
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,239
for four years now.

729
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,296
Four years?

730
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:22,719
I quite like it here.

731
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:24,719
When I'm free, I usually

732
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:26,599
go stroll around the old town.

733
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:27,639
Don't you think here is more lively

734
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:28,719
than Taipa?

735
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,776
If you're free, I can show you around.

736
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,239
Sure, I'm certainly free.

737
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,599
I'd love to have a friend

738
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,360
who is very familiar with Macau

739
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,599
to give me an in-depth tour of Macau.

740
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,559
So, are you settled in Macau now?

741
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,976
It's hard to say.

742
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:58,880
I have a five-year pact with myself.

743
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,960
Within these five years,

744
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,119
if my career development here

745
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,360
doesn't meet my expectations,

746
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,639
I might have other plans.

747
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:07,648
Five years?

748
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:10,679
Then you have one year left.

749
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:11,920
What are your expectations?

750
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,280
- Simple.
- Shall we go over there?

751
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,599
To collaborate with artists I admire,

752
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:20,400
and to create the exhibitions
I truly want to do,

753
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,320
without considering
too many commercial aspects,

754
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,360
the very pure kind.

755
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,496
That's really cool.

756
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,719
Most of the exhibitions I run now

757
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:31,119
are all about providing a place

758
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,480
for people to take photos.

759
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,480
They don't have much artistic value.

760
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:36,639
I believe these all are

761
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,840
the essential path to purity.

762
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,320
How do you know this is the path?

763
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,039
Guessed it. One out of three.

764
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,000
- You're right.
- Let's go.

765
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,320
I love the drizzle. It's so comfortable.

766
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,280
Alright, but let me tell you.

767
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,239
I have a hard time to style my hair.

768
00:42:57,239 --> 00:42:58,368
I have curly hair.

769
00:43:00,192 --> 00:43:05,024
<i>♫ The sun creeps in, it catches ♫</i>

770
00:43:05,024 --> 00:43:09,472
<i>♫ The leaves quietly and wakes the treetops ♫</i>

771
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:15,712
<i>♫ Dreaming, oh, dreaming ♫</i>

772
00:43:15,712 --> 00:43:19,392
<i>♫ The wonderfulness without any sign ♫</i>

773
00:43:19,392 --> 00:43:24,224
<i>♫ I listen to the breeze
with the tune of the sea ♫</i>

774
00:43:24,224 --> 00:43:29,760
<i>♫ I'm about to embrace the unknown ♫</i>

775
00:43:30,304 --> 00:43:35,031
<i>♫ Dreaming, oh, dreaming ♫</i>

776
00:43:35,031 --> 00:43:38,398
<i>♫ Nothing is predictable ♫</i>

777
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,043
<i>♫ Why not dance with your heartbeat ♫</i>

778
00:43:43,043 --> 00:43:48,227
<i>♫ And swing your dress ♫</i>

779
00:43:48,227 --> 00:43:52,992
<i>♫ At this moment, forget ♫</i>

780
00:43:52,992 --> 00:43:56,000
<i>♫ About all the worries ♫</i>

781
00:43:58,496 --> 00:44:02,670
<i>♫ Why not carry cute curiosity ♫</i>

782
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:07,402
<i>♫ To dance in the wind and the sea ♫</i>

783
00:44:07,402 --> 00:44:09,568
<i>♫ Keep looking ♫</i>

784
00:44:09,568 --> 00:44:16,576
<i>♫ All the wonderful answers

785
00:44:39,392 --> 00:44:43,008
<i>♫ Why not dance with your heartbeat ♫</i>

786
00:44:43,008 --> 00:44:48,249
<i>♫ And swing your dress ♫</i>

787
00:44:48,249 --> 00:44:53,019
<i>♫ At this moment, forget ♫</i>

788
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:56,035
<i>♫ About all the worries ♫</i>

789
00:44:58,624 --> 00:45:02,592
<i>♫ Why not carry cute curiosity ♫</i>

790
00:45:02,592 --> 00:45:07,392

791
00:45:07,392 --> 00:45:09,568
