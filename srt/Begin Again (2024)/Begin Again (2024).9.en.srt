00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:30,888
<i>[Begin Again]</i>

2
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Peeking at me again?

3
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,360
You've arrived.

4
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,520
So…

5
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,360
Your house is really

6
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,240
artistic. It's a totally different feeling

7
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,639
from looking up downstairs

8
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,240
and being in here.

9
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,479
What's wrong?

10
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,000
Have you looked up downstairs many times?

11
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,320
You guess.

12
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,960
Thank you.

13
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,400
May I take a tour?

14
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,784
Of course.

15
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,599
What is this?

16
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,919
A draft of the wedding invitation.

17
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,759
A wedding? Whose wedding?

18
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,439
Mine.

19
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,000
You're getting married?

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,159
Why don't I know about this?

21
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,520
Whose wedding is it? Tell me.

22
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,120
My boss's.

23
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,520
Choose one.

24
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,159
How about this one?

25
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,599
There's a sense of two becoming one,

26
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,280
like soulmates.

27
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,759
Alright, this one it is.

28
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,280
That's it?

29
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
I'm serious.

30
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,919
I wanted to choose this one.

31
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,319
It's just that your choice
makes me more certain.

32
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,759
So we have a tacit understanding.

33
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,400
Come over here.

34
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,639
This is the space I usually use

35
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,000
the most.

36
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,240
Did you paint all these yourself?

37
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,439
You would make quite a lot of money
if you sold these paintings.

38
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,800
Thank you for the compliment.

39
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,840
I mean it.

40
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,560
Seriously.

41
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,919
In my eyes, you are now

42
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:10,120
already a very excellent painter.

43
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,520
But have you thought about
having an exhibition?

44
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,160
Of course.

45
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,120
But if the audience
doesn't like it or can't understand it,

46
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,319
it would crush me.

47
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,240
Is other people's opinion that important?

48
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,800
You are using painting

49
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,240
to create your own language,

50
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,519
so it's normal if others
don't understand or don't get it.

51
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,016
For example,

52
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,079
of course, I only know Van Gogh.

53
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,000
Van Gogh got well-known

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,319
only after he passed away.

55
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,920
So I think the most important thing is

56
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,040
the meaning of your paintings

57
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,600
and the exhibition.

58
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,439
Whether it's to please others,

59
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,040
or for your passion

60
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,399
in your mind.

61
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,680
Want to give it a try?

62
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,439
What?

63
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,240
Painting? Right now?

64
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
Give it a try.

65
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,800
- Really?
- Come on.

66
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,399
I've never painted before.

67
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,639
That's why you should try now.

68
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,720
Then,

69
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,079
what should I paint?

70
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:41,600
You'd paint whatever you want.

71
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,480
You.

72
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,680
Are you sure?

73
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,800
Exactly, it's you.

74
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,680
Alright, what color do you want?

75
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,960
<i>[Episode 9]</i>

76
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,839
Aren't you going to paint me?

77
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,879
Yes.

78
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,439
I'm looking… comparing colors.

79
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,319
Have you ever thought about

80
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,439
when you would get married?

81
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:15,399
Me?

82
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,480
When I was a teen,

83
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,759
I decided that I would not get married.

84
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,639
Why?

85
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,959
Maybe

86
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,560
I don't want to become a woman like my mom,

87
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,959
spending a lifetime complaining,

88
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,600
and waiting for someone to come home.

89
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
But in one's life,

90
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,759
there are many things

91
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,680
worth paying attention to,

92
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
yet she focuses only on

93
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,079
a man.

94
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:42,360
I don't get it.

95
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,879
So,

96
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,839
you like Little Women so much.

97
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,720
I think every girl

98
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,800
should be like Josephine,

99
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
exploring the world without restrains,

100
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,160
and pursing herself.

101
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,040
Otherwise, when it's lost,

102
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,240
you'd also lose your sense
of self-worth along with it.

103
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,800
After all, you can't decide
how long someone will love you.

104
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,064
Right?

105
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,680
Actually, I think you are right.

106
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,360
But pursuing oneself

107
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,879
and getting married

108
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,639
actually are not contradictory.

109
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,519
A wrong relationship
is only about the people involved,

110
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,639
but not about the marriage itself.

111
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,920
When you have someone
who is a perfect match for you,

112
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,800
he can not only help you maintain yourself,

113
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,279
but also provide you with a new perspective.

114
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,360
In that case,

115
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
you could see

116
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,680
a broader world.

117
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,184
Right?

118
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,759
I'm a bit curious.

119
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,040
Why are you so optimistic

120
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,519
on marriage and love?

121
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,199
Maybe because of my parents.

122
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,800
Anyway, since I was young,

123
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,079
I thought they were very loving.

124
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,879
Seeing them made me believe

125
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,560
that in my life,

126
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,879
I would also certainly

127
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,920
meet someone who is a perfect match for me.

128
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,319
Have you met the one?

129
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,504
Of course.

130
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,600
It's crooked.

131
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,199
- Let me see.
- No, wait.

132
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,319
- Right away.
- Let me take a look.

133
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:30,399
- No, no.
- No way, let me see.

134
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,279
You paint so well.

135
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,000
You're talented.

136
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,440
I want to interpret for you

137
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
why I wanted to paint this,

138
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,799
instead of a portrait.

139
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,159
Actually, what I wanted to paint was this.

140
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,159
In my eyes,

141
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,679
you are like water,

142
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,679
pure, clear,

143
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:57,879
and soft.

144
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,440
But I know

145
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,679
that something like water,

146
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,000
can't be grasped if I try to,

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,759
so I can only hold it in my hands,

148
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:11,200
and then it will stay for you.

149
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:18,016
<i>♫ Together we'll chase into the sky ♫</i>

00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,200
It's ready.

183
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,639
But before we start the meal,

184
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,399
I want to confirm something with you.

185
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,399
Today, you told your friend

186
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,399
that I am your boyfriend,

187
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,080
so I want to confirm

188
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,559
if this matter

189
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,759
is true.

190
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,213
Is it true?

191
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:54,538
<i>♫ Can't fool my heart ♫</i>

192
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:58,511
<i>♫ Can't fool my heart ♫</i>

193
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:02,971
<i>♫ Can't fool my heart ♫</i>

194
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:06,110
<i>♫ With the moon out tonight ♫</i>

195
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,816
<i>♫ You could be holding me tight ♫</i>

196
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:13,657
<i>♫ Why do they get us apart ♫</i>

197
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:16,608
<i>♫ They can say what they want ♫</i>

198
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:19,349
<i>♫ But they can't fool my heart ♫</i>

199
00:12:19,349 --> 00:12:22,464
<i>♫ Can't fool my heart ♫</i>

200
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:26,043
<i>♫ Can't fool my heart ♫</i>

201
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:29,695
<i>♫ Can't fool my heart ♫</i>

202
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:34,533
<i>♫ Can't fool my heart ♫</i>

203
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,933
<i>♫ Can't fool my heart ♫</i>

204
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:44,727
<i>♫ Can't fool my heart ♫</i>

205
00:12:44,727 --> 00:12:49,250
<i>♫ Can't fool my heart ♫</i>

206
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,240
Let me remind you

207
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,399
that today's shooting
is not completely closed off.

208
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,919
We are shooting on a time limit,

209
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,080
and semi-closed.

210
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,399
So please get faster.

211
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:11,480
Let's not go overtime, okay?

212
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,559
- Okay.
- Okay.

213
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,080
Okay, and the area where we can shoot today

214
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,320
is just this public square.

215
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,000
Don't go shoot the residential buildings

216
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,279
and the pedestrian walkways over there.

217
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,480
And everyone,

218
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,919
when moving equipment and props,

219
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,639
please be careful and quiet.

220
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,679
Do not disturb the residents, okay?

221
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,879
Thank you all. Thank you for your cooperation.

222
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,128
Okay.

223
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:29,879
Amy said

224
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:32,080
she wants to add some camera positions
near the residential building.

225
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,600
Maybe you should communicate with her about it.

226
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,440
Okay, I'll go talk to her.

227
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,240
- Alright.
- Keep an eye on the time.

228
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,968
Alright.

229
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,200
You wanted to add more camera positions?

230
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,480
I've checked the script with Director
and felt it was too boring.

231
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,639
We have no permit for it,
so we can't shoot over there.

232
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,879
Why don't we have the permit?

233
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,519
Because getting a permit
involving residential buildings

234
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,879
requires the approvals
from many more departments.

235
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,000
It doesn't get approved
as quickly as public areas.

236
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,480
Moreover, when I communicated
with Director before,

237
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,080
he's never mentioned that he wanted
to shoot the residential buildings.

238
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,639
He's never mentioned it before,
but when we got to the shooting location,

239
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,559
we wanted to add it. Isn't it common

240
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,360
during shooting?

241
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,039
If you use the excuse of lacking a permit

242
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,039
to fend me off,

243
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,679
I don't understand. Then you are

244
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:15,360
not needed in this project.

245
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,679
Okay. I believe

246
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,240
that the final result is the most important.

247
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,720
So, if you and Director

248
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,399
agree that the shot there is essential,

249
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,399
then I'll have Fish

250
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,559
go get the permit immediately.

251
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,559
But it definitely can't be done today.

252
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,159
Why are you so certain about it?

253
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,919
You haven't even tried.

254
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,000
There are regulations

255
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,720
for shooting at each location.

256
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,679
Since there are regulations,
we must follow them.

257
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,799
How can we shoot if we don't follow them?

258
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,039
Mai, I understand.

259
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,159
You started this project,
and now I have joined in.

260
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,480
But we are a team.

261
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,799
We are going to

262
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,399
make it best.

263
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,559
This is our common goal.

264
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,279
So, leave it anymore.

265
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:48,399
If we had the time to talk about it,

266
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,840
we would have finished shooting by now.
And they are already shooting now.

267
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,519
Okay?

268
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,399
They are already shooting?

269
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:58,000
Who agreed to this?

270
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,320
- Uncle, very soon.
- I've been waiting long here.

271
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,559
We didn't get a permit for this place.

272
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:06,039
Alright.

273
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,200
- We can't shoot it.
- What's wrong?

274
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,200
We didn't get a permit for this place,
so we can't shoot it here.

275
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,879
Everyone, let's move all these.

276
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:13,960
Move them now.

277
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,919
No, why? We're about to finish.

278
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,679
You just need to communicate with them.
Why move them?

279
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,480
Don't you understand
that this matter is not that simple?

280
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,679
It can't just be solved by communication.

281
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,399
Then tell me what is the difficulty.

282
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,639
I just want a few shots,
is it really that difficult?

283
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,320
Or are you just targeting me?

284
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,200
- Is that so?
- I've already shown you respect.

285
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,320
I'm not targeting you. And I understand
we all want the promo to be best.

286
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,679
But this is a filming site, not your house.

287
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,000
You can't do whatever you want.

288
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,200
What are you angry about?
I don't understand what you are doing.

289
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,720
Hello.

290
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,399
- Hello, Mr. Xu.
<i>- Hello, the police station got a complaint,</i>

291
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,559
<i>saying you're filming without permission,</i>

292
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,600
and obstructing the passage of residents.

293
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,960
You must stop filming.

294
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,799
It doesn't need to stop, right?

295
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,080
Because we are already communicating.

296
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,279
We are moving all our stuff

297
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,720
and already apologizing to the residents.

298
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,039
We are in communication.

299
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:54,240
You are currently
in violation of unauthorized filming.

300
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,919
The government has the right
to shut down the entire project.

301
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:59,799
<i>Alright, you handle the situation first.
I'll go and communicate.</i>

302
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,799
<i>Okay, sorry, I will deal with it now.</i>

303
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,840
Okay, thank you.

304
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,120
Bye.

305
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,360
Because of this…

306
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,120
You have obstructed our passage.

307
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,759
Sorry, I'm really sorry.

308
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,759
Everyone, withdraw immediately.

309
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,639
Why do we withdraw? Tell me why.

310
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,639
Go tell everyone to pause immediately.

311
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,320
No way, why?

312
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,919
Wu Anmei, if you have any suggestion,

313
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,039
just talk about it later.

314
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,039
We have already been asked to stop.

315
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,559
I have more important things to deal with.

316
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:24,200
If you do this, I can only
report this to Maggie immediately.

317
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,320
Whatever.

318
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,944
What's wrong?

319
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,840
Junhao.

320
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,000
Today is the last day
of the intensive training.

321
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,200
<i>Our training goal remains
to find the best racing route</i>

322
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,360
<i>and match the stability.</i>

323
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,559
Cherish this last training opportunity.

324
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,960
- Cheer up!
<i>- Copy that.</i>

325
00:16:57,131 --> 00:16:59,104
<i>♫ I want to make you a believer ♫</i>

326
00:16:59,104 --> 00:17:02,701
<i>♫ My team is invincible ♫</i>

327
00:17:02,701 --> 00:17:05,248
<i>♫ Always the best achiever ♫</i>

328
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:09,824
<i>♫ Do not doubt, we'll meet at the finish line ♫</i>

329
00:17:09,824 --> 00:17:11,552
<i>♫ I want to make you a believer ♫</i>

330
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:15,680
<i>♫ My harvests are so abundant ♫</i>

331
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,048
<i>♫ I want to make you a believer ♫</i>

332
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:22,056
<i>♫ I want to make you a believer ♫</i>

333
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,559
This lap is faster and more stable.

334
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:33,000
The fifth lap only dropped by 0.1. Not bad.

335
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,880
Junhao, keep it up.

336
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,960
Six more laps to go.

337
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,680
<i>I want to try
if I could do faster in this curve.</i>

338
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,400
Junhao, what's going on?

339
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,352
I made a mistake.

340
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,960
Come on.

341
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,519
Take a look at the back there.

342
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:40,200
Open this up.

343
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,079
Okay.

344
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:46,200
The engine doesn't seem to have any issues.

345
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,880
No problems here either.

346
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,480
There seems to be no problem
with the piping, what about inside?

347
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,599
Elvis, are you okay?

348
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:55,272
Are you injured?

349
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,680
- Impressive.
- Amazing.

350
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,799
Hello.

351
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,960
I'm looking for Elvis.

352
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,920
You are…?

353
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,240
You are Elvis's girlfriend, right?

354
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,240
My name is Chen Jiahui,
you can also call me Joe.

355
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,759
Charles. Pleased to meet you.

356
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,360
I am his colleague.

357
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,799
How's his training today?

358
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,880
Pretty good. It went smoothly.

359
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,599
<i>Elvis walked back on his own.</i>

360
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,160
It's okay. A small accident happened.

361
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,839
Is he okay? Did he get injured?

362
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,440
He's fine, no injuries.

363
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,079
In the racer's pre-race training,

364
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,759
it's common to have some

365
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:02,880
small accidents. Just get used to it.

366
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,839
- As long as he is fine.
- Right.

367
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,880
It's not easy to be a girlfriend

368
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,039
of a racer.

369
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,319
You have to support him,

370
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,200
understand him, and accommodate him.

371
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,599
Right. Look, we have a race coming up soon.

372
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:20,200
He's under a lot of stress.

373
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,960
And he doesn't spill it out,

374
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,160
always keeping it bottled up inside.

375
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,240
He might be used to

376
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,839
face everything on his own since he was young.

377
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:30,799
Is that so?

378
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,759
He's always trying to be tough,

379
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:34,759
definitely doesn't like to be comforted.

380
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,160
He would think

381
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,200
comfort is sympathy for the weak.

382
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,759
You understand him quite well.

383
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:45,559
Elvis, you are back.

384
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:52,400
Surprised?

385
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,559
What's wrong with you?

386
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,039
Why are you here?

387
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,279
How's it going today?

388
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,559
When does it end?

389
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,072
I…

390
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,319
It ends now.

391
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,279
You're so tense.

392
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:11,319
Give yourself a break and rest well.

393
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,680
Okay.

394
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,200
Take a walk with me?

395
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,088
I…

396
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,400
I want to practice.

397
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,519
The race is coming.

398
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:24,680
To balance work and rest.

399
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,559
Don't complain that I…

400
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,640
- am not practicing.
- I won't.

401
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm going to change clothes. Just wait for me.

402
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,799
- Alright.
- Go, go.

403
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,119
Then you wait here for him.

404
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,480
I'm really sorry about today.

405
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,240
It is so hot, and we've disturbed you.

406
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,680
Why don't we go somewhere else,
and I'll buy you something to eat and drink?

407
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,920
No.

408
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,799
We just want to stay here
and see what you are going to do.

409
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,240
Why are there so many people here?

410
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,400
Listen, we are an advertising company.

411
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,640
And we are here today to shoot a promo.

412
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,279
But we shouldn't

413
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,359
come to shoot under the residential building.

414
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:32,440
Indeed, it's our fault.

415
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,480
I'm really sorry.

416
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,000
How long are you going to shoot today?

417
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,319
Next time, if we need…

418
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,160
I bought some herbal tea for you guys.

419
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,799
To cool down.

420
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,799
Can you speak Cantonese?

421
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,480
- Yes.
- Good.

422
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,640
I don't understand

423
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,079
what this girl is talking about.

424
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,000
Please explain to them.

425
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,519
Alright, don't rush.

426
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:52,519
Please take a seat.

427
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:54,559
It's okay, I'll talk to her.

428
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,799
I-I'll explain to them.

429
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,440
You go calm the filming crew down.

430
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,799
- It's fine.
- Okay, thank you.

431
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,000
Please tell them

432
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,160
we might come back later on,

433
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,440
but when we do,
we will definitely have the permit.

434
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,319
Got it.

435
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,559
Well, listen…

436
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,440
Director.

437
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,079
Mai, come and take a seat.

438
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,799
Sorry.

439
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,799
I'm really sorry for today.

440
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,160
It was my oversight.

441
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,319
- I didn't expect this
- It's okay.

442
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,359
would lead to a halt in shooting.

443
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,880
The situation in Macau is indeed special.

444
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,519
They have quite a few regulations.

445
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,599
Mr. Xu is already
communicating with the government.

446
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,640
We'll definitely come back
and shoot it again later,

447
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,319
but not today.

448
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,799
Miss Mai.

449
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,000
About the situation today,

450
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,079
it wasn't Mr. Qiang who asked us

451
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:38,079
to set up the camera positions,

452
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,119
but your colleague.

453
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:41,240
She said it's not okay
with just one camera position.

454
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,480
We have to put another one at the entrance
of the residential building across the street.

455
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,839
I think once we resume shooting,

456
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:50,079
if such a situation occurs again,

457
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:52,000
it will definitely
have a great impact on our work.

458
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,559
Well, in the future,

459
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:54,759
should we listen to you,

460
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:57,192
or her?

461
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,920
Well,

462
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,400
if such a situation occurs again, we'll

463
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,599
do everything

464
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,920
as we planned.

465
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,200
I will handle all other situations

466
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,359
that arise, alright?

467
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,519
The current problem is

468
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,839
whether you can control it.

469
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:12,960
I will definitely do

470
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,400
my utmost effort.

471
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,440
Well, I will give you
a definitive answer tomorrow morning.

472
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
Okay, thank you, Mai.

473
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,440
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you.

474
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,440
And thank you all for trusting me.

475
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,119
Alright? Come on, Xu, you…

476
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,799
Settle everyone and let them head back first.

477
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,839
Miss Mai, what about you?

478
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,799
I have things to do, you go ahead.

479
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,000
Okay.

480
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,400
I didn't mean anything else.

481
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,720
I just wanted to shoot a few more scenes.

482
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,079
Yes, that's right.

483
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:37,920
So now everything is on hold.

484
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,160
I have already updated it to Maggie.

485
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,000
She said she'd let you know the next plan.

486
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,519
I can probably imagine what you told her.

487
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,960
But I also want to say,

488
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,759
you are the one to be blamed
for today's incident.

489
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,960
The fact is, because of you,

490
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,400
the whole crew came to a halt.

491
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,880
You have affected my shooting schedule.

492
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,799
It will result in failing
to meet the deadline and budget.

493
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,039
You also affected the professionalism

494
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,359
of my entire team in the minds of my clients

495
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:06,240
and their trust in me.

496
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,400
None of this is something that you can

497
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,960
take responsibility and fix

498
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,400
by just complaining it to Maggie.

499
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,480
And listen,

500
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,519
I will report today's incident in detail

501
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,680
to Director Tong.

502
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,759
You misunderstood me.

503
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:18,240
I was just telling the truth.

504
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,400
Thank you.

505
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,984
Here, have some herbal tea.

506
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,560
Your turn.

507
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,759
Do you lose on purpose?

508
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,480
Do you think I lack the skills?

509
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,279
You let me win, didn't you?

510
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,319
If I win,

511
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,440
you can't get angry.

512
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,720
Am I that kind of person?

513
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:19,319
Look, you just let me win.

514
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,992
Your turn.

515
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,000
I'm not playing anymore.

516
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,320
What?

517
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,240
We agreed just now,

518
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,960
even if you lose, you can't get angry.

519
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,079
- Boring.
- Here.

520
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:53,160
I keep losing to you, can't beat you.

521
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,319
If you can't win, then you won't play?

522
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,319
Look.

523
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,039
You played quite well in the first round.

524
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,359
Strike.

525
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,559
Do you know why?

526
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,240
Because we started the competition,

527
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,440
and you developed a desire to win,

528
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,119
so your moves became distorted.

529
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,079
Try again.

530
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,359
Here, I'll help you get it. It's heavy.

531
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:22,519
Thank you, coach.

532
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:24,480
You just put aside

533
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,519
the mindset of competition.

534
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,599
Take a deep breath and relax.

535
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:31,720
It's just a game.

536
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
See, what did I tell you?

537
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,160
You can do it, right?

538
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,039
Is that what you tell yourself during the race?

539
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,680
Forget winning and losing
and enjoy the process?

540
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:57,359
After all, bowling is a game.

541
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,400
So even if I lose,

542
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,240
it won't bring any burden.

543
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,359
But racing is different.

544
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:04,039
The outcome of a race

545
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,839
determines how far I can go

546
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:08,440
in my career.

547
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,920
Although I told you so,

548
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,960
it's also hard for me to maintain my cool.

549
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,920
This is because

550
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,279
I missed out on the trophy

551
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,720
due to a mistake.

552
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,400
So this year you're here in Macau

553
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,680
to take back your trophy?

554
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:32,799
To reclaim my trophy.

555
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,519
Reclaim.

556
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:38,880
However, my mindset these past few days

557
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:41,799
hasn't been very good.

558
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:46,359
But I felt better
after hanging out with you today.

559
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,319
Do you believe in a sixth sense?

560
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,720
I have a feeling you're going to win.

561
00:29:01,184 --> 00:29:02,519
Okay.

562
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,119
Really. Don't you believe it?

563
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,079
Yes.

564
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,799
Han Junhao.

565
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:10,279
I just want to tell you

566
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:12,359
that I trust you.

567
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,839
You have to trust yourself too.

568
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,119
If you're always tense,

569
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:22,160
you'll end up doing distorted moves

570
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,680
like I did just now.

571
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,119
Only when you know

572
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:27,680
that you can definitely do it

573
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,079
can you ensure that during the race,

574
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,720
you are always driving to your own pace.

575
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,920
So, were you just acting?

576
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,248
No.

577
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,144
However,

578
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:54,519
thank you.

579
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:56,599
Thank you for trusting me.

580
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,720
And thank you

581
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,720
for saying so much to me.

582
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,599
I've taken note.

583
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,839
If you win the trophy, give me half, okay?

584
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,079
Trophy?

585
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,400
If I really get the trophy,

586
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,839
then it is all yours, okay?

587
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,240
But to be honest,

588
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
you do understand

589
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,839
a racer quite well.

590
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,599
Actually, I don't.

591
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:23,039
I'm not interested in racing.

592
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:28,039
But I'm interested in
what you're interested in.

593
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:39,039
Then I must take you

594
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,720
to understand more about it.

595
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,079
Let's go.

596
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,319
Where to?

597
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,519
You'll know it.

598
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,752
Let's go.

599
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,599
Where to?

600
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:55,039
You'll know it.

601
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,680
Come on, let's go.

602
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,680
This wasn't in the plan.

603
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:13,240
The place you want to take me

604
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,119
is the karting track?

605
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,200
Yes, is it cool?

606
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,359
Did you come here when you were a child?

607
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:22,119
Go play.

608
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,559
I'm waiting here.

609
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:25,599
Don't you want to play with me?

610
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,519
Not really,

611
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,119
but you see,

612
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,960
I am wearing high heels.

613
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,559
They won't even let me in.

614
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,559
You should go by yourself.

615
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:42,240
I've prepared the gear for you.

616
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,720
Change into it and you can join me.

617
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,200
I picked it myself.

618
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,240
Give it a try.

619
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,359
You find it funny too?

620
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:11,079
You picked it.

621
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,119
I think they

622
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:14,000
suit you very well.

623
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,680
Let's go. Step on the gas and go!

624
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:20,640
Just steer properly.

625
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,000
Here it comes!

626
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,079
Well.

627
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:37,440
I

628
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,160
don't have a license,

629
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,799
nor have I driven.

630
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,839
So I'd better watch you play.

631
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,599
I'm only eight years old.

632
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,839
I don't have a license either.

633
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,744
Let's go.

634
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,599
Girl, I'm leaving first.

635
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:01,119
Why do I…?

636
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:03,319
Push the left pedal twice to move forward.

637
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:05,608
Move forward.

638
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,200
Move aside!

639
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,960
- Be careful.
- Oh my!

640
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,799
Careful!

641
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,232
Come on!

642
00:33:19,232 --> 00:33:21,544
Careful!

643
00:33:22,048 --> 00:33:24,680
<i>♫ How can you ♫</i>

644
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,920
Very good.

645
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,186
Keep it up!

646
00:33:28,186 --> 00:33:31,044
<i>♫ You're like a queen ♫</i>

647
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,640
You can do it, keep going!

648
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:57,480
You're driving so well!

649
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,440
It's funny.

650
00:34:06,956 --> 00:34:08,928
<i>♫ How can you ♫</i>

651
00:34:08,928 --> 00:34:11,862
<i>♫ Lead me in cheers ♫</i>

652
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:14,920
Go for it!

653
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,719
Do you know?

654
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,199
When you

655
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,239
asked me to come go-karting,

656
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,920
I thought it was childish.

657
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,760
I didn't expect it to be quite fun.

658
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,079
Now you've experienced

659
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:31,079
the joy of being a child, right?

660
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:32,159
When I was a child,

661
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,880
a place like this is
where I most wanted to come,

662
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,719
yet I've never come.

663
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,480
Once I've grown up, it becomes

664
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,920
the least place I want to come.

665
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,136
Why?

666
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:48,480
When I was a child,
if I didn't get the ice cream I wanted to eat,

667
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,440
didn't go to the amusement park
I wanted to visit,

668
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,639
didn't watch the cartoon I wanted to watch,

669
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,840
I would lie to myself

670
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,119
that I just didn't like it,

671
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:02,559
and I didn't want it.

672
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,440
After a long time,

673
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,760
I start to believe it myself.

674
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:13,480
<i>Don't press down on the wrists.</i>

675
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,239
<i>Mom, my hands hurt.</i>

676
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,608
<i>Go on.</i>

677
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:20,559
<i>Wrong.</i>

678
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:21,920
<i>Try again.</i>

679
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,880
<i>Wrong.</i>

680
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,880
<i>Try again.</i>

681
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:35,880
<i>Wash your hands.</i>

682
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,199
<i>I've told you many times</i>

683
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:40,280
<i>to wash your hands before eating.</i>

684
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,360
<i>I've already washed.</i>

685
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,880
<i>And your hands are still dirty?</i>

686
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,416
<i>Look at your hands.</i>

687
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,159
<i>Mom, I'm really scared.</i>

688
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:52,360
<i>Mom, please</i>

689
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,679
<i>let me out.</i>

690
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:55,519
<i>Want to run out and play again?</i>

691
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:56,719
<i>Mom, I won't do that again.</i>

692
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:58,719
<i>Let me out, please.</i>

693
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:02,119
<i>I was wrong, Mom.</i>

694
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,648
<i>Mom.</i>

695
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:15,840
So it's too late to make up for it

696
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,536
once grown up.

697
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:22,559
No way.

698
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:23,880
It's never too late,

699
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,600
as long as you want to.

700
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:34,824
Is that so?

701
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,280
This admission ticket

702
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,840
doesn't quite look like a ticket.

703
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,719
It's really special.

704
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:49,559
Like a work permit.

705
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:51,400
You've never come?

706
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,400
It's my first time.

707
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,920
You've lived in Macau for four years,

708
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,920
yet you've never been

709
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,760
to the Macao Grand Prix Museum.

710
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,079
Let me tell you, this ticket

711
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:00,800
is not just a ticket.

712
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,800
You can use it to race here.

713
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,719
- Here?
- Of course.

714
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,400
Many interactive sessions here.

715
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,559
Oh my.

716
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:11,440
This place is so cool.

717
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,440
Of course.

718
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,719
Let me tell you, all these you see

719
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:16,079
are all champion motorcycles from their years.

720
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,320
Only after they won the championship

721
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,599
could they qualify to be placed in this museum.

722
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:23,199
This is so cool.

723
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,079
Is this a Ducati?

724
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:32,559
998RS.

725
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:35,320
The champion motorcycle in 2003.

726
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,920
Don't just look over there.

727
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,880
Look over here.

728
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,800
The simulator of the Guia Circuit.

729
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,599
How about it? Want to race?

730
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,599
Are you sure you want to race me?

731
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,280
I don't think you've beaten me yet.

732
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,679
Keep up.

733
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:07,008
<i>♫ You want to play ♫</i>

734
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:09,410

00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,628

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,239
I've hit the wall.

738
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:19,760
Bye.

739
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,240
<i>♫ Don't know why you play ♫</i>

740
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,344
<i>♫ By a brand new set of rules ♫</i>

741
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:28,032
<i>♫ My hair is so red and shiny ♫</i>

742
00:38:28,032 --> 00:38:31,760
<i>♫ And my eyes are still blue ♫</i>

743
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,639
Oh my, I'm sweating all over.

744
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:36,119
Driving isn't that easy, right?

745
00:38:37,408 --> 00:38:39,200
<i>♫ You circle around me ♫</i>

746
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,136
<i>♫ Making me feel I have a chance ♫</i>

747
00:38:43,136 --> 00:38:45,480
<i>♫ But now I am drowning ♫</i>

748
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,784
Done.

749
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:56,882
<i>♫ You're like no other than a pool shark ♫</i>

750
00:38:57,533 --> 00:39:00,064
<i>♫ Pool shark, baby ♫</i>

751
00:39:00,064 --> 00:39:04,381
<i>♫ Pool shark, baby ♫</i>

752
00:39:04,906 --> 00:39:08,423
<i>♫ You're like no other than a pool shark ♫</i>

753
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:12,920
Why do you suddenly want to come here?

754
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,519
Don't you want to come?

755
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:19,880
Mr. Wei, you can go in now.

756
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,184
Let's go.

757
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,480
Please come in.

758
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,719
So beautiful.

759
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,320
Do you see the stars?

760
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,559
Stars?

761
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:51,679
Where are they?

762
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:54,519
Right there.

763
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:57,760
Does it look like
a whole sky full of stars on its back?

764
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,840
It's called Marokintana.

765
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,320
Which means With Many Stars.

766
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,800
Sounds so nice.

767
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,199
Too bad they are mute,

768
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:08,320
and can't speak.

769
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,719
Then how do they

770
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:12,719
communicate with their kind?

771
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,199
They use movements to communicate,

772
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,519
just like sign language.

773
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:19,000
But they also like to be alone.

774
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,800
Sometimes, even they swim for a very long time

775
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,320
to a distant sea,

776
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,679
yet don't meet their kind.

777
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,719
Why aren't you speaking?

778
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,639
I am much like them,

779
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:45,920
unable to tell anyone

780
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,159
what's in my heart,

781
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:50,320
and fond of being alone.

782
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,880
Every day,

783
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,159
I spend my time alone.

784
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,039
In the vast ocean,

785
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:02,039
they might not meet

786
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,559
their kind after swimming for a long time.

787
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:05,639
It must be

788
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:08,440
very lonely.

789
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,000
But we have met each other.

790
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:21,199
I am here when you want to speak.

791
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,639
Imagine, at this very moment,

792
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:30,920
the two of us are drifting in the seabed

793
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,639
with no one to disturb us.

794
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:35,239
Everything around

795
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:38,199
falls quiet gradually.

796
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,760
You have grown gills.

797
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,440
Right now, they might itch a bit.

798
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,800
Thus, we won't feel

799
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,800
the inability to breathe.

800
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,440
The first time breathing under water

801
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,760
might be somewhat uncomfortable,

802
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,519
but you'll adapt to it quickly, right?

803
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:58,559
Let's swim together to that part of the sea.

804
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:02,824
Alright.

805
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,679
There are many suns

806
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:09,760
and many moons in the sea.

807
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,400
Look, they are all real.

808
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,880
Come on.

809
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,639
Oh my.

810
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,984
Come on.

811
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:31,639
I feel I have already

812
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:35,440
flown out of the ocean.

813
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,184
Me too.

814
00:43:00,214 --> 00:43:05,046
<i>♫ The sun creeps in, it catches ♫</i>

815
00:43:05,046 --> 00:43:10,494
