00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,799
- Go place the order.
- Okay.

187
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Wait.

188
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,440
I really don't want you to go.

189
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,639
What's wrong? Don't leave.

190
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:59,480
You're not just here
to congratulate my retirement,

191
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,639
but also to welcome the new chef
on his first day of work.

192
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,279
I've said

193
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,600
Zhen Qiang will never rest.

194
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,279
As long as I can cook,

195
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,960
Zhen Qiang will stay open.

196
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,759
- Good.
- Good.

197
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:22,912
But,

198
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,840
I'm getting old now.

199
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,736
So,

200
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,360
how much longer Zhen Qiang can stay open

201
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,159
and whether to continue operating

202
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,080
depends on Le.

203
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:56,080
Someone once told me

204
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,240
Zhen Qiang

205
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,440
is like my eldest son.

206
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,080
He was right.

207
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,360
We've made it from a small storefront

208
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,440
to a known restaurant.

209
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,720
What makes me happiest

210
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,039
is knowing you all, my great regular customers,

211
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,840
and great staff.

212
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,559
Huan and Wei

213
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,200
have been helping me since their twenties.

214
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,159
One is with white hair,

215
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,720
and another one is with no hair.

216
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,080
I've always asked myself

217
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,039
why we have worked so hard for these decades.

218
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,080
I finally understood today.

219
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,320
It's to fulfil my ideal.

220
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,320
And I have achieved it.

221
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,399
But for my family,

222
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,519
I have not done enough.

223
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,080
Zhen has been with me for decades

224
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,320
from a small storefront to what it is now.

225
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,440
She has never complained,
always silently supporting me.

226
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:39,399
And I'm very grateful to Le

227
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,960
for coming to help.

228
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,759
I know how much he hates cooking.

229
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,000
And you too, Bao.

230
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,448
Sorry.

231
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,600
Over all these years,

232
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,799
I've never attended
a single parent-teacher meeting.

233
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,559
But the person I owe the most in life

234
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,008
is Hao.

of your happy family, alright?

364
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,319
I'm doing well.

365
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:40,680
I really like my life as it is now.

366
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,839
Ms. Wei, we can go in now.

367
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,488
Okay.

368
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,960
Hey, you!

369
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,160
Come on, give me a hug.

370
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,480
You have to be happy.

371
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,960
You too, must be happy.

372
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,480
Alright.

373
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,128
I'm leaving.

374
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:17,888
Bye.

375
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,960
Thank you all for coming to my concert.

376
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,079
Actually, I've also prepared a piece

377
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:51,119
that isn't listed on the list.

378
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,319
I wrote it myself.

379
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,920
I'm afraid of others won't like it,

380
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,799
but my friend told me

381
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:00,480
music is the soul's chocolate of human.

382
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,319
As long as I express my true feelings,

383
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,960
I will always resonate with you.

384
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,920
I want to give my last piece of chocolate

385
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,599
to my best friend.

394
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,039
There's a bouquet of flowers for you.

395
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:18,320

Thank you all for coming.

424
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,480
You all know that I am a curator.

425
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:13,519
I've always been very timid before.

426
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,159
Because I did not know

427
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:16,760
what would others feel

428
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,320
after they see my works.

429
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,119
I've imagined it countless times.

430
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,800
But later on, I realized

431
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:28,400
sincerity is what matters the most.

432
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,320
Whether it is facing others or myself,

433
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,320
sincerity is a kind of adventure.

434
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:40,224
Excellent.

435
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:47,559
So I decided

436
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:50,039
to break some established rules,

437
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,360
and some hidden barriers between people,

438
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,039
to face the unknown
and embrace the world bravely.

439
00:39:58,559 --> 00:39:59,960
I also want to thank

440
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:03,800
every important person
who has appeared in my life.

441
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,559
Thank you.

442
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:08,960
Good, congratulations.

443
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,679
Thank you all for coming here today.

444
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,840
May I sit here?

445
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:38,920
You've found the soup?

446
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,480
I went to Fuqing.

447
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:45,840
I found that this soup is actually not rare.

448
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,000
Different places
have different ways of making it,

449
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,360
with different ingredients.

450
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,719
But I can't know what ingredients

451
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:55,920
your bowl of soup used.

452
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,360
But later, I remembered my dad said

453
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,400
gather as fate wills.

454
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,400
The reason the soup you drank was so special

455
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,760
is the love you have for your grandma.

456
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,559
That's why you can't forget it.

457
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,239
Then I started to think

458
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,280
if I also put my love into this bowl of soup,

459
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:21,800
it would surely become a new memory.
