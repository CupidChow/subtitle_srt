[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,590
Why are you standing here? You scared me.

3
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,740
What about you? What did you do when you went out?

4
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,049
What did I do?

5
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,170
This...

6
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,840
How did you know it?

7
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,690
You texted her. How could I not know?

8
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:09,780
So what did you do to find Miss Nana?

9
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,530
Are you angry?

10
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,850
Tell me what you did first.

11
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,210
Then I can know if I should be angry.

12
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,910
So why do you want to see my boyfriend?

13

[TharnType 2 : 7 Years of Love]

15
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,470
What boyfriend? Who are you talking about?

16
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,680
Oh.

17
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,310
I forgot to introduce myself.

18
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,270
My name is Type.

19
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,820
I'm Tharn's boyfriend.

20
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,060
Are you kidding me? I don't think it's funny.

21
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,350
Oh. Or did Mr. Tharn send you to make fun of me?

22
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,220
But this is too much, isn't it?

23
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,810
Do I look like I'm joking?

24
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,340
Hey, I'm not joking with you.

25
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,930
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

26
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,300
But I think you should give up now.

27
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,790
Because Tharn doesn't like

28
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,850
people of your type.

29
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,220
Where is Mr. Tharn? I need to call him.

30
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,210
I'm warning you for your own good.

31
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,920
Because no matter what, you won't get what you want.

32
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,089
It's not too late to change your mind now.

33
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,320
Because Tharn

34
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,200
likes men.

35
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,920
And he doesn't like every man.

36
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,400
It can only be me.

37
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,860
I'll get going then.

38
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,640
Tharn will miss me if I am out for too long.

39
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,300
As for you, take care when you go back.

40
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,940
It's dangerous for such a skinny woman to come out to see a man.

41
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,540
I'm just reminding you out of goodwill.

42
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,430
Are you mad? Why are you laughing?

43
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,890
To be honest,

44
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,690
I knew what you were going to do.

45
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,230
What do you think I'll do?

46
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,960
Are you jealous?

47
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,700
What?

48
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,070
You're so cute when you get jealous.

49
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,909
I was going to deal with it by myself at first,

50
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,610
But I saw you look cute when you were angry,

51
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,170
so I let you solve it first.

52
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,810
In the end, you didn't let me down.

53
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,900
You're so annoying.

54
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,240
Or...

55
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,200
Do you want me to solve it myself?

56
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,540
Dream on.

57
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,110
You are so soft-hearted.

58
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,450
If I had let you solve it yourself,

59
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,860
you would have hesitated.

60
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,140
Then, she won't be able to give up on you.

61
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,660
Why should I be soft-hearted to others?

62
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,800
It's enough for me to be soft-hearted on you alone, isn't it?

63
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,040
Come here.

64
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,000
-What?
-Hurry up.

65
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,130
Smile.

66
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,890
-Why should I smile?
-Come on.

67
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,150
-Smile.
-No.

68
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,740
One, two, three.

69
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:08,250
[Sorry, my boyfriend replied for me.]

70
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,880
Good.

71
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,190
That means

72
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,910
I did it well, right?

73
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:24,760
Yes.

74
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,090
If I did it well,

75
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,130
what about my reward?

76
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,230
Let go of me!

77
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,550
Let go of me!

78
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,170
Dream on. You made me so angry.

79
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,230
Type.

80
00:07:52,570 --> 00:08:04,410
[Brother, my wife is so cute.]

81
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:10,170
[Yes.]

82
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:18,310
[It's rare to see him get jealous.]

83
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,250
Hey.

84
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,920
I just went to get something to eat. And then you are stupid?

85
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,679
You talk too much, Salad.

86
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,429
Thorn, we've been friends for so many years.

87
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,179
Don't you remember that my name is Sanran?

88
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,620
It's none of your business.

89
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,360
And when are you going home?

90
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,750
You have stayed at my house all day. What a waste of electricity.

91
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,670
It's none of your business.

92
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,390
You need to be beaten. How about I spray insect killers on you later?

93
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,210
I'm human, not an ant.

94
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,810
I meant you were a cockroach.

95
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,330
Fine, I can be a cockroach. Cockroaches can't be killed.

96
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,140
Seriously,

97
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,340
why are you so shameless, Sanran?

98
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,970
Because I have an annoying friend like you.

99
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,260
You scold me every time you see me.

100
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,670
That's why I have to be shameless. Otherwise, I won't be able to stay.

101
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,840
So what were you laughing about?

102
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,480
Tell me. I want to care about you.

103
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,820
People here call this "meddling".

104
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,150
Fine, I meddle in your affairs.

105
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,600
That's because I know who you're talking to.

106
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,580
I don't care if he is not from the Kirigan family.

107
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,130
Tharn sent me a message saying that Type is jealous.

108
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,750
But I think my brother is over-excited.

109
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,640
What about you?

110
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,860
Does it hurt to hear this?

111
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,190
Well, no.

112
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,830
Because now I've found the person I love.

113
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,710
Tharn is like a brother I love.

114
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,770
He is just a good memory.

115
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,160
I'm relieved that you can give up on him.

116
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,480
I'm glad

117
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,990
that you've met someone you can treat seriously.

118
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,130
Then I won't have to worry

119
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,200
that you will bother my brother and brother-in-law.

120
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,530
Don't worry.

121
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,500
I won't bother them anymore.

122
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,250
They've been in love for seven years. That's enough.

123
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,320
Come on. Let's continue the game. Hurry up. Get the phone. Hurry up.

124
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,550
Where were we?

125
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,890
What are you doing?

126
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:52,700
I am working.

127
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:03,650
Hello?

128
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,690
[Hello, Type.]

129
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,480
[Have you seen the woman's photo wall?]

130
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,060
Which one?

131
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,070
[The one who seduced Tharn.]

132
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,740
What's the matter?

133
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,890
[Don't ask too much.]

134
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,970
[Go check it out. Hurry up.]

135
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,470
Okay.

136
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,830
[Thank you for everything in the past two years.
I have learned a lot here.]

137
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:35,370
[Thank you, dear colleagues and my perfect boss.]

138
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,450
[I'll visit you when I'm free. Love you.]

139
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,190
[Why did you quit?]

140
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:49,010
[How can I stay here?] I can't get the elder brother.
The younger brother doesn't like me either. I'll be embarrassed if I continue to stay here.]

141
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:11,200
[Thank you. You are a smart person.]

142
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,600
-No.
-Don't bother me. I'm busy.

143
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,480
-No.
-Hey, it's you. Hello, friend.

144
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,330
Long time no see.

145
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,400
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

146
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,750
I came to buy a ring today.

147
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,600
I wanted to pick some, wear them for fun, and take some photos.

148
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,370
-Bastard. You're acting like nothing happened.
-What?

149
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,080
Who is that? Who is that woman?

150
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,970
You know, right, friend?

151
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,380
If Type finds out that you cheated on him,

152
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,170
you will be dead.

153
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,430
-What cheating?
-You'll die a miserable death.

154
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,980
And you know what? If he knows it,

155
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,600
-he'll definitely chop you up and feed you to the duck. You bastard.
-Well...

156
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,230
Anyway, I didn't do anything.

157
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,200
I'm going to let Type get rid of his daily necessities.

158
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:15,670
Oh, daily necessities?

159
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,930
Seriously, friend.

160
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,410
Were you born to be so confident?

161
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,630
What happened? Tell me.

162
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,690
Nothing.

163
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,580
But I'm glad you came.

164
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,580
Well...

165
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,740
-I need your help.
-I don't have a penny.

00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,120
It's not about money.

167
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,610
-Help me make my boyfriend jealous.
-Hey, are you crazy?

168
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,830
I'm not crazy.

169
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,280
You're making trouble for yourself.

170
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,080
-Okay, No?
-No.

171
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,280
I'll treat you to dinner.

172
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,830
Tell me what your first plan is.

173
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,470
I'm all ears.

174
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,880
I'm definitely on your side. Trust me.

175
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,620
I won't let you down.

176
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,000
I'll leave a deep impression on you.

177
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,420
What are you looking at?

178
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,100
Uh...

179
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,350
There's something on your face.

180
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,960
-My face?
-Over there.

181
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,540
There is nothing now.

182
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,520
So you're here, Brother Type.

183
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,700
I've been waiting for you.

184
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,110
I bought you some snacks.

185
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,950
I can't accept them.

186
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,770
Just accept them. I really want to apologize to you.

187
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,150
Okay?

188
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,840
If you don't take them, I'll throw them away.

189
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,350
Look.

190
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,990
I bought a lot for the doctors and nurses.

191
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,450
Okay.

192
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,450
Thank you.

193
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,520
But don't buy me things again next time.

194
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,280
Because I will

195
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,240
feel embarrassed.

196
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,630
Okay.

197
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,670
Thiwat, the boss wants to see you.

198
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,740
What's up?

199
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,200
I don't know. What have you done?

200
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,980
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

201
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,770
Don't forget to schedule a rehabilitation time next week.

202
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,290
Okay.

203
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,550
See you next time.

204
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,700
I don't agree with your leave.

205
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:01,640
You know

206
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,880
many people will go home during the holiday.

207
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,310
And our department is short-handed.

208
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,970
You have to come to work no matter what.

209
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,660
But I've given all my work plans to Sister Teng.

210
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,060
And I've submitted the leave request for a long time.

211
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,830
I said I don't allow you to ask for leave.

212
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,260
Why?

213
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,520
Because we're short-handed.

214
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,270
Or do you insist on asking for leave

215
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,490
even though everyone sacrifices their time to work?

216
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,500
So we have to work, right?

217
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,960
Thiwat, watch your language.

218
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,830
Don't forget that I'm your boss.

219
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,870
I see.

220
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,990
So did the doctor say

221
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,319
when Fiat would recover, Leo?

222
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,609
He's sitting here. Why don't you ask him yourself?

223
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,720
Look at him.

224
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,700
Your friend is immersed in his own world again.

225
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,510
He doesn't care what people around him are talking about.

226
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,520
Then wait for him to get out of his world

227
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,660
and ask him again.

228
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:28,300
Or you can try telepathy.

229
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,650
Maybe he can receive it.

230
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,950
Leo can always tell jokes

231
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,240
expressionlessly.

232
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,460
The doctor said he's slowly recovering.

233
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,140
If he doesn't act recklessly,

234
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,090
he'll recover in a few months.

235
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,750
Oh.

236
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,470
That's why he has the energy to keep talking.

237
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,870
Should I pretend my knees hurt...

238
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,290
And get attention?

239
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,420
What are you mumbling about?

240
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,690
It's none of your business.

241
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,670
Let's eat.

242
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,580
Let's eat.

243
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,270
Let me go!

244
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:28,810
Fiat.

245
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,290
All right.

246
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,590
Why were you laughing? You didn't even eat.

247
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,420
It's none of your business. You guys eat.

248
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,980
Brother, I don't want to care about you either.

249
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,760
But I can't pretend that I didn't see it.

250
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,550
Who were you chatting with when you kept smiling?

251
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,560
Take it and eat.

252
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,890
Here's the sausage for you. Eat it.

253
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,770
As for other sausages,

254
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,750
you can eat them when we get back.

255
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:25,450
Sausage! Sausage! Sausage!

256
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:28,000
Stop it. Stop it. We can eat now.

257
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,460
Leo, you don't even play with us.

258
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,520
We're eating. Don't play.

259
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,070
Why are you so serious?

260
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,930
Okay, let's eat. We won't play.

261
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,170
It's burnt.

262
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,210
Take it. Take it.

263
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,720
Eat them all!

264
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,110
Fiat, you bastard!

265
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,070
What did you give me?

266
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,700
Is this cooked?

267
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,630
Do you want me to have diarrhea? Bastard.

268
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,270
Eat it yourself. Here you are.

269
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,250
Just eat it.

270
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,770
-Bye. Bye.
-Bye. Bye.

271
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,670
Leo, thank you.

272
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,550
For what?

273
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,110
About the liver.

274
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,320
As you know, I don't like liver.

275
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,550
I didn't know it. I just wanted to eat it.

276
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,890
-You knew it.
-I didn't know it.

277
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,060
You're like this every time.

278
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,410
You always care about me the most.

279
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,590
Fiat, the doctor doesn't allow you to jump.

280
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,170
Anyway, in the end, you'll take care of me.

281
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,970
Watch where you're going.

282
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,530
Or you'll bump into someone else's stuff again.

283
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,800
Fine. I'll listen to you for today.

284
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,520
That's what happened, Dad.

285
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,420
That's why I called you.

286
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,270
I definitely can't go back.

287
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,350
[What's wrong with your boss?]

288
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,940
[You had asked for leave, so he should have approved your leave.]

289
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,880
We're really short-handed,

290
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,660
so I have to go to work.

291
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,660
Or do you want me to be a selfish man

292
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,130
that let others work hard

293
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,020
and go home alone to relax?

294
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,940
[That's not true.]

295
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,180
[Others should understand you.]

296
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,060
[You're far away from home.]

297
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,390
[In a year,]

298
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,990
[your mother and I can only see you twice.]

299
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,170
[You always stay there with that foreigner.]

300
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,220
[You have forgotten me and your mom.]

301
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,220
Stop complaining, Dad.

302
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,980
This has nothing to do with Tharn.

303
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,050
I can't take leave because of my boss.

304
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,200
It's not because of him.

305
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,220
[I don't know. I don't care.]

306
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,310
[If you don't come back during the holiday,]

307
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:26,640
[I'll be mad at you.]

308
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,510
Dad.

309
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,510
[What are you saying to Son again?]

310
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,420
[I told you Son is busy at work.]

311
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,800
[Why are you acting like a kid?]

312
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,560
[Your mom always yells.]

313
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,320
[Okay, I won't complain anymore.]

314
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,410
But I have to see you on this vacation.

315
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,200
Remember this, you punk.

316
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,870
You are doing it again. You are even threatening Son.

317
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,240
I'll beat you up with the rack later.

318
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,260
If my son says he can't come back, he can't come back.

319
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,100
Bye.

320
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,590
-Honey.
-What?

321
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,690
I was just saying.

322
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,060
Why were you yelling?

323
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,970
I miss him.

324
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,310
Tell him if you miss him. Don't be mad at him.

325
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,830
-Do you hear me?
-Stop.

326
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,220
I want to watch the drama.

327
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:13,870
You're crazy.

328
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,810
Go iron your clothes.

329
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,520
Thanya.

330
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,650
So pretty.

331
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,150
Type, you are back.

332
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,310
Yes.

333
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,000
Where are you going?

334
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,630
I'm waiting for Seul out here.

335
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,660
He went downstairs to buy food and hasn't come back yet.

336
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,060
He didn't bring his phone.

337
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,510
Where's Brother Tharn?

338
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,260
He went to the company today.

339
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,660
He might be back soon.

340
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,740
You don't look well. Is anything wrong?

341
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,480
No.

342
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,760
I'm just having a little headache due to work issues.

343
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,290
Not just a little.

344
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,840
Let me make you something to drink.

345
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,830
No, I'm fine.

346
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,440
I need to prepare dinner for Tharn.

347
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:17,330
Then I'll tell Brother Tharn that you're sick.

348
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,870
Come to my room first.

349
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,940
If anything happens to you,

350
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,510
Brother Tharn will beat me up.

351
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,490
Okay? I'll make you a hot drink, okay?

352
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,630
Come to my room for a while.

353
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,740
Okay, Brother Type?

354
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,450
Okay.

355
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,260
To be honest, as soon as I saw you,

356
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,930
I knew whose brother you were.

357
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,140
Here's your hot cocoa.

358
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,830
Drink it first. You'll feel better.

359
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,010
Every time I have a headache, Seul makes it for me.

360
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,980
Sometimes when I'm angry with him,

361
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,870
he also comforts me with this.

362
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,130
So we only have Coco at home.

363
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,720
This is Coco.

364
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,210
And this...

365
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,630
I am Coco too.

366
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,440
Drink it first. It'll get cold.

367
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,460
You seem to have something on your mind.

368
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,250
You can tell me if you have anything.

369
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,490
I promise I won't tell anyone.

370
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,210
Do you know?

371
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,360
You have a kind of magic

372
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:55,810
which can make people around you feel at ease.

373
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,960
Promise me first.

374
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:11,920
If I tell you, you won't tell Tharn.

375
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,500
I don't want him to worry.

376
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:18,430
No problem. I swear in the name of the Children's Army.

377
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,890
We swear with three fingers.

378
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,230
Okay.

379
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,800
It is about my boss.

380
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,710
He didn't allow me to take this long vacation.

381
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,170
He said there's not enough staff in the hospital.

382
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,310
He approved

383
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,070
everyone else's leave as usual.

384
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,720
I don't know why he is against me.

385
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,950
Why is he like that?

386
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,320
I don't know either.

387
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,670
I don't know what I did to him

388
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,500
to make him target me like this.

389
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,560
If I didn't need to work for a full year for my resume,

390
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,350
I would have beaten him and resigned.

391
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,100
But I've endured it for half a year.

392
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,490
I have to endure it for another six months.

393
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,960
But now, the problem is...

394
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:25,300
I want to take Tharn to my hometown this long vacation.

395
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,850
I want to take him to see my father often.

396
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,190
Maybe my dad will accept him.

397
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,820
Your dad doesn't like Tharn?

398
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,430
It's not that he doesn't like Tharn.

399
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,550
He just likes to throw tantrums

400
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,350
like most elderly people.

401
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,700
He hopes that his son

402
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,670
can bring him a daughter-in-law.

403
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,640
But who knew the one I took back was a son-in-law...

404
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,520
So...

405
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:53,850
That's it.

406
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,420
It is just like me.

407
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,610
Seul's mom doesn't like me either.

408
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,030
Especially Seul went against his mother for me...

409
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,080
His mother hates me even more.

410
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,000
But Seul

411
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,780
asked me to ignore her. So I ignored her.

412
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,830
Actually, my dad doesn't hate Tharn.

413
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,490
My mom said he's just putting on airs.

414
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,470
Thank you, Pu. I feel much better now.

415
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,660
Since your boyfriend is here,

416
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,700
I'll go back first.

417
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,140
Also...

418
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,030
Thank you for the hot cocoa.

419
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,230
Okay.

420
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,370
If you have anything on your mind, you can come to me again.

421
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,320
But if you can tell Brother Tharn,

422
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,110
that will be better.

423
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,050
-Okay. I'll get going.
-Okay.

424
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,120
Seul, Brother Type is so cute.

425
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,500
I had a good chat with him.

426
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,920
Why did he come to our house?

427
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,620
Because I went out to look for you.

428
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:56,980
You had been down for so long and hadn't come back.

429
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,740
And you didn't bring your phone.

430
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,670
Your favorite snack was sold out here,

431
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,350
so I had to walk to another shop to buy it for you.

432
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,800
Seul, if it's sold out, you don't have to buy it.

433
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,050
I can understand.

434
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:17,930
Are you tired?

435
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:21,780
No.

436
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,230
-Really?
-Yes.

437
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,110
Let me give you a massage.

438
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,760
Let me massage you.

439
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,080
It's okay. I'm not tired.

440
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,920
Let me massage it for you.

441
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,750
What did you talk about with Brother Type just now?

442
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,170
Ask Coco.

443
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,660
Cut it out.

444
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,860
Instead of asking Coco,

445
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,110
it's better to ask my boyfriend, right?

446
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,180
But your boyfriend can't tell you.

447
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,600
Because I promised Brother Type not to tell anyone.

448
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,960
Don't be mad at me.

449
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,010
OK?

450
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:19,740
I'm not angry. I don't want to know it either.

451
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,820
I only care about you.

452
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,540
I'm going to take a shower first.

453
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:33,450
♫I look up to the sky, but I can't see you when I turn back♫

454
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:37,640
♫I'll definitely be anxious♫

455
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:44,190
♫You are my whole world, you know?♫

456
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,920
Whose boyfriend is he? He often gets angry, right?

457
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:49,180
♫It'll be bad if you're gone♫

458
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,080
Seul.

459
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,350
Help me apply my skincare cream.

460
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,510
-Why?
-I can't reach it with my hands.

461
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:04,440
Okay?

462
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,860
Isn't this for wiping your face?

463
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,350
My hand hurts because I gave you a massage.

464
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,780
Please, apply it for me.

465
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:29,520
Okay?

466
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,630
Okay.

467
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,940
Where should I apply it to?

468
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,190
Anywhere is OK.

469
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,370
The face,

470
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,070
the neck,

471
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,480
or the chest...

472
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,570
Apply it to wherever you want.

473
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,310
PuGan.

474
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,740
Hurry up.

475
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,870
-Seul.
-Okay.

476
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:35,900
You can be jealous because of me.

477
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,170
Can I be jealous because of you?

478
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,050
Of course. We're a couple.

479
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:53,110
You can be jealous and possessive.

480
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,030
You can also say you don't like me getting close to others.

481
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,560
You can do anything,

482
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:08,110
just like you can touch any part of me.

483
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,710
Because you're my boyfriend.

484
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,020
Really?

485
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,600
Of course.

486
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,699
You can

487
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,190
do anything.

488
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,409
Any part of your body?

489
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,980
Yes.

490
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,690
Any part...

491
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:12,810
Type.

492
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,020
Are you okay? Why do you look a bit strange?

493
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,450
I should ask you this question. Are you okay?

494
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,460
Me?

495
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,600
Yes.

496
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,340
PuGan texted me

497
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,540
saying you didn't look well.

498
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,540
So what happened to you?

499
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:50,770
Did he tell you what happened to me?

500
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,570
No.

501
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:02,870
He said I have to ask you myself if I want to know it.

502
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,490
So are you okay?

503
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:12,680
I'm fine.

504
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,650
Let me lean on you like this for a while.

505
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,950
Then I'll be fine.

506
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:41,190
OK. You can lean on me as long as you want.

507
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,620
I won't leave.

508
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,490
I'll always be by your side.

509
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,360
Okay.

510
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,980
[Restaurant No. 5]

511
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:23,810
Wait. Small. Small. Small...

512
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,680
-Small cake.
-Small cake.

513
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,180
You're still so forgetful.

514
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,230
-Because you're twins.
-I heard you.

515
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,260
Did I say it too loud?

516
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,040
-Long time no see. How have you been?
-Yes.

517
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,080
Did you miss me?

518
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,640
Of course. I can tell.

519
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:45,740
-No, you're still so humorous.
-Yes.

520
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,760
Where have you been these days?

521
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,960
Oh. I've been busy with work recently.

522
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,410
And it's the end of the month. I have a lot of files to process.

523
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,490
I'm exhausted. And I'm hungry now too.

524
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,450
So I was going to come here and eat something for free.

525
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,900
You always eat and drink for free.

526
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,790
With you saying this...

527
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,830
Why don't you just pull me over and slap me?

528
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:10,040
-Just kidding.
-That's a serious joke.

529
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,950
Oh, right.

530
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,060
-Where is Champ?
-He is inside.

531
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,640
-Is he inside?
-Yes.

532
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,510
Okay, I'll go find him first.

533
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,980
He always wanders around here.

534
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,270
Wait, wait, wait.

535
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,790
-Same as usual.
-Same as usual.

536
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:29,880
That's great. You know me so well.

537
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:41,800
Who is that?

538
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:50,720
Oh, Champ.

539
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:55,260
A few days ago, my seniors asked me out after work.

540
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:59,660
They said the seafood there was fresh.

541
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,050
I didn't have anything urgent,

542
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,540
so I went with them.

543
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,820
Which dish was the best?

544
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,330
Which dish was the best...

545
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,050
I think

546
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,800
it must be this dish. Pepper Fried Fish.

547
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,930
I thought of you after taking the first bite.

548
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,470
Did you think of me?

549
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,110
It was not like that, Champ.

550
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,590
That's not what I meant. I meant...

551
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:42,950
The first bite reminded me of you.

552
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,320
Because you told me that if I find a delicious restaurant,

553
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,040
I need to let you know.

554
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,390
Take me there next time.

555
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,320
Okay.

556
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:58,870
Sure.

557
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,320
Hey.

558
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,340
I think we should forget it.

559
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,050
Why?

560
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,100
Don't you want to go with me?

561
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,670
It's okay. I'll send you the restaurant address later.

562
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:28,170
I just wanted to say, "Let me take you there."

563
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,260
Because your work is hard.

564
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:34,370
I'll pick you up when you get off work early.

565
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,520
Okay?

566
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,600
Okay.

567
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,140
Okay.

568
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,420
You look cute when you smile.

569
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,050
You should smile more often.

570
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,020
I like it

571
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:57,280
♫Don't be like this♫

572
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,650
♫What if I can't control myself?♫

573
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,880
Good brother, I am going to tell you the latest news.

574
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:07,880
♫Will you be cute to others?♫

575
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,190
I promise you will definitely...

576
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:15,460
♫Can you only look at me?♫

577
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,900
be very interested. Wait for me.

578
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:17,320
By the way, I heard from Type that you've been busy with work lately.

579
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:18,980
Are you tired?

580
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,450
Yes.

581
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,550
I'm a little tired.

582
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,350
Recently, I have received a lot of patients,

583
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,820
so I have a lot to think about.

584
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,740
Don't pinch your nose.

585
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,780
It'll turn red.

586
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:46,800
Well...

587
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:50,510
Cream.

588
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,090
Give me a spoon and a fork.

589
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:58,530
Uh.

590
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,550
You are a doctor, and you are so clumsy.

591
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,330
Uh...

592
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:12,690
I'm sorry. I should not be clumsy.

593
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:16,440
Don't be so upset.

594
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,560
I'm not mad.

595
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,950
A cup of hot coffee, please.

596
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,500
Doctor.

597
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,160
Type.

598
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,250
I haven't seen you for days.

599
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:48,200
I rarely come down because there are many patients recently.

600
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:54,110
Isn't it because you keep going to someone secretly?

601
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:58,500
No. I really have patients who need to be treated.

602
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:03,380
I'm not blaming you. I was just teasing you.

603
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,960
Because I happened to meet No.

604
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,560
He told me

605
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,040
he saw you at Champ's shop yesterday.

606
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,050
Uh...

607
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,900
Yes, I went to see Champ yesterday.

608
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,840
Do you like Champ?

609
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,050
I...

610
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:34,490
Is it that obvious, Type?

611
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,700
I think it is very obvious.

612
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,410
But my friends are too stupid.

613
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:47,050
Especially Champ... If you don't put it bluntly,

614
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,030
he won't know it in his next life.

615
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:57,170
Hang in there. My friend is a little dumb.

616
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,240
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

617
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:02,670
I have to give these documents to my boss.

618
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,270
Or I'll get scolded.

619
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:07,730
The patients' files?

620
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,820
No. They are the operational plans of the department.

621
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:14,760
Wait.

622
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,630
This isn't your job, is it?

623
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,660
Yes, I know.

624
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,720
But he's my boss.

625
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:25,510
I have to do as the boss says.

626
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:29,430
I'll get going then.

627
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,240
Otherwise, I'll be picked fault if I'm late.

628
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:38,040
As for Champ, you have to work harder.

629
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:39,970
I'll cheer for you.

630
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,730
I'm leaving. See you next time.

631
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:08,970
Hello, Uncle.

632
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:12,880
I have something to ask you.

633
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:15,290
Do you have time?

634
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,410
By the way, Type,

635
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:22,040
When Fiat brought food to apologize that day,

636
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,480
I couldn't believe it.

637
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:27,330
But he's quite cute anyway.

638
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:29,950
He had better not disobey again,

639
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,670
otherwise, we will have headaches because of him.

640
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:34,510
Yes. I hope so.

641
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:35,790
Thiwat.

642
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:42,390
What? Do you sigh when you see me?

643
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:45,700
Don't forget that I'm your boss.

644
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:47,820
Please respect me.

645
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,850
Sorry.

646
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,280
Do you have a problem with me?

647
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,260
I should ask you this question.

648
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,000
Do you have a problem with me?

649
00:46:58,130 --> 00:46:59,080
Me?

650
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:03,750
I don't want to get back at you.

651
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,430
But do you think I don't know

652
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:08,970
how you looked

653
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:10,980
when I warned you every time?

654
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,560
Calm down, Type.

655
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,840
Sir, calm down.

656
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:20,650
Let's talk in the room if we have anything, okay?

657
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:23,420
No, I just have something to tell him.

658
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,740
May I ask if you have any instructions?

659
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,920
Who dares to order you around?

660
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,030
Take yesterday as an example.

661
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:37,760
I just asked you to organize some documents

662
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,660
but you reported it.

663
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:44,520
I want to know if it was hard to organize the documents.

664
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,860
If it's too hard, tell me next time.

665
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,700
Then I won't disturb your precious private time.

666
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:56,990
What do you mean?

667
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:58,850
Ask him yourself.

668
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:02,240
I don't understand what you're talking about.

669
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:05,040
Who did you report it to?

670
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:09,520
I think it must be a misunderstanding.

671
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,020
There shouldn't be anything.

672
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:15,850
If there's nothing else, we'll leave now.

673
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,940
Or there will be a traffic jam. Let's go.

674
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,830
You're back.

675
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,230
Are you blind?

676
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:35,740
Can't you see me sitting here?

677
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,730
What's wrong, Type?

678
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:45,350
I hate my boss.

679
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,400
Darn it.

680
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,750
I don't know what I did to him. He targets me all day.

681
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,490
Maybe I stepped on his tail in my previous life.

682
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,040
That's why he won't let go of me in this life.

683
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,890
I worked so hard.

684
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,630
He said I reported him to someone else.

685
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,210
Who did I report to?

686
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,600
I was exhausted from just working for him all day.

687
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:12,740
Calm down, Type.

688
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,390
Calm down?

689
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:16,930
I'm so calm that I don't know how to calm down.

690
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:20,160
You're not me. You don't understand.

691
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,020
Can I help you with something?

692
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,580
You can't help me with anything.

693
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:30,170
Can you beat him up for me? Don't make me laugh anymore.

694
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,460
-Type.
-Can you not touch me?

695
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,470
Don't you know I'm annoyed?

696
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:38,800
Don't say I'm impatient.

697
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,730
Yes, I am impatient. So what?

698
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,700
You're not me. How do you know it?

699
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,900
What happens to me every day?

700
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:51,620
I put up with that jerk for half a year.

701
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,950
Darn it. He should stay wherever he wants.

702
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:57,590
I'm so mad!

703
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:13,980
What are they arguing about?

704
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:17,860
Seo Duang hasn't come back from Korea yet.

705
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,160
No one is gossiping with me.

706
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,400
I brought you a cup of coffee.

707
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,300
You might feel better after drinking it.

708
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:09,430
I'm sorry.

709
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,400
It's okay.

710
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,420
You know, Type.

711
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:30,370
I'll always be by your side

712
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:34,150

[Planning for Type's Husband]

720
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,730
[Champ: Techno, you're a total jerk.]

721
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:09,330
[Techno: What's going on? Why was I suddenly scolded?]

722
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:12,020
[Champ: Tharn told me everything. You took his bribes.]

723

[Champ: You made my friend jealous because of him.]

724

[Champ: Of course, I would have wanted them.]

727
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,440
[Techno: Where did Tharn go? Why didn't he report the latest situation?]

728
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,630
[Tharn: Take care of Type for me lately. He's tired.]

729
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:27,060
[Techno: Oh, my.]

730

[Champ: What's wrong with you?]

733
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:37,350
[Techno: People who say "tired" must be...]

734
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:39,490
[Champ: What?]
