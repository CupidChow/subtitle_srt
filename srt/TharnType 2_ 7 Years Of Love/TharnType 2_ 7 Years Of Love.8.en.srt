00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:06,090
Thiwat.

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,510
Would you look at the trash you made?

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,730
What do you mean?

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,290
If that's the best you can do,

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,770
even kids can do better than you.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,820
Has anyone ever taught you

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,490
to think about your professional reputation when you act

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,770
instead of doing something so embarrassing?

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,370
What do you mean?

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,290
We're talking about you kissing your man in front of the hospital.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,820
I don't care

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,290
what you do in your free time.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,480
But this is a hospital.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,630
It's a workplace.

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,440
It's a sacred place.

17
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,390
It's okay if you don't have a brain,

18
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,600
but at least think of the department.

19
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,500
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,610
I won't let this happen again.

21
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,870
There's not much time left.

22
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,160
Tell your man too.

23
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,180
Even if he's stupid and rude,

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,370
you should let him know what this place is.

25
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,060
And you'd better get a checkup too.

26
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:24,760
I'm afraid your patients will lose trust in you.

27
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,950
Most importantly,

28
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,810
take your partner to check his body.

29
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,190
Check it thoroughly.

30
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,600
I think

31
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,250
he might have a lot of diseases.

32
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,330
Type, calm down.

33
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:52,670
Type.

34
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,840
You can look down on me,

35
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,160
but don't insult Tharn.

36
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,100
How dare you hit me?

37
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,450
I'm going to fire you.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,210
Don't come over.

39
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,070
Just you wait.

40
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,600
Fine.

41
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,360
I don't want a boss like you either.

42
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,330
You don't have to work so hard finding excuses to fire me.

43
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,990
I'll resign myself.

44
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,130
Okay, I'll grant your wish.

45
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,420
Type, calm down.

46
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,960
I've had enough, Sister!

47
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,320
You can look down on me,

48
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,860
but you can't look down on my man.

49
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,060
If my boss is a jerk that can't tell right from wrong,

50
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,370
I'd rather lose my job.

51
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,110
Remember what you did.

52
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,680
It won't end so easily.

53
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,190
I'll teach you a lesson.

54
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,870
-Type.
-What are you doing?

55
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,230
I'm calling the police,

56
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,440
and I'll fire you.

57
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,120
You'll be ashamed to stay in this industry.

58
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,340
No one will hire you.

59
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,710
Stop arguing.

60
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,480
Dr. Thiti. Dr. Thiwat.

61
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,240
Dean is looking for you.

62
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,160
[TharnType 2 : 7 Years of Love]

63

[TharnType 2 : 7 Years of Love]

64
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,310
Dean, I don't accept violence at work.

65
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,480
Look at what he did.

66
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,390
He slapped me in front of everyone in the hospital.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,100
You must give him the harshest punishment.

68
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,870
Look, I'm telling you all this,

69
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,250
but he still won't say sorry.

70
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,700
I've reminded him several times, but he didn't listen.

71
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,710
He didn't do his job well, and he still asked for leave.

72
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,130
What a terrible behavior.

73
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,410
I wrote a letter to remind him, but he didn't listen.

74
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,170
Look at what he did to me.

75
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,390
Dr. Thiti, I know what happened.

76
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,890
But I can't just listen to one side.

77
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,910
Do you have anything to say?

78
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,080
No.

79
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,040
I did slap Dr. Thiti in the face.

80
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:32,960
See?

81
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,400
So I suggest to fire him.

82
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,600
Leave it to the committee for the final decison.

83
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,070
But first of all, he did resort to violence.

84
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,330
We have both witnesses and the evidence.

85
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,840
The result should be the same as you said.

86
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,909
You're not going to defend yourself, right?

87
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,530
No.

88
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,140
That's good.

89
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,490
This matter is over.

90
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,790
I have something to tell you two.

91
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,640
Please explain the content of this document.

92
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:28,130
This is the budget document.

93
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,240
I don't think it's all sorted out yet.

94
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:31,960
Did you make it yourself?

95
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,230
Yes.

96
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,550
But as I said,

97
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,730
it may not be completed yet.

98
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,340
So I want to take it back and modify it.

99
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:42,960
Are you sure?

100
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,590
Didn't you ask someone to do it?

101
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,200
I'm sure.

102
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,320
How would I ask others to work on

103
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,960
such important documents?

104
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,770
Open it.

105
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,390
What is this?

106
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,620
Why do you have the same file as me?

107
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,030
I should be asking you.

108
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,360
You said you did it yourself.

109
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,240
If you didn't ask someone to do it,

110
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,200
why is it the same as what I have?

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,950
Doctor Khunpol, please explain.

112
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,790
Before I explain about the documents,

113
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,310
I want to make it clear.

114
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,900
I know Mr. Thiwat has been ordered to do work that is outside of his job scope.

115
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,670
It's been several times.

116
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,810
It's not true.

117
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,400
I didn't order him.

118
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,230
When I knew

119
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,220
that Thiwat was asked to budget for purchasing documents,

120
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,370
I reported it to dean

121
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,370
and replaced this document

122
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,730
with Mr Thiwat's copy.

123
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:12,060
I gave the same copy to the dean in advance.

124
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:52,020
The purchasing documents are not within Thiwat's job scope.

125
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,310
These two documents clearly prove that

126
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:03,130
you're not the one doing them.

127
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,200
You're working together to frame me, aren't you?

128
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:14,390
You came up with the documents yourself, then you swapped them with mine.

129
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,330
Then how can you use these documents as an excuse

130
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,330
to say that Thiwat's work was perfunctory?

131
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,180
Didn't you say that you never ordered him to do it?

132
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:27,210
I knew it. I knew you would do that.

133
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:35,020
I just didn't expect that you would do it in front of so many people in the hospital.

134
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,490
Then explain this.

135
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,650
Why did so many of your subordinates

136
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,570
complain about your behavior?

137
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,960
For example, your abuse of power and improper language

138
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,920
have affected their work and mood.

139
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,670
Most importantly, sexual harassment.

140
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,290
Wait, Dean. There must be a misunderstanding.

141
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,970
This is definitely a frame-up.

142
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,160
Doctor, you framed me, right?

143
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,320
Oh, I know it.

144
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,680
It's because you're close to Dr. Thiwat. Right?

145
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,700
You're working together to frame me, aren't you?

146
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,510
Dr. Thiti.

147
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,410
I told you that I love my family.

148
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,050
If anyone talks like that to my family,

149
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,220
I won't sit back and watch.

150
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,060
Doctor Khunpol and Dean...

151
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,930
Doctor Khunpol is my nephew.

152
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,940
Please take care of it for me.

153
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,010
Doctor Khunpol.

154
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,400
Oh, Type. Are you done with the talk?

155
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,580
I just finished.

156
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,580
I just found out how you've been helping me.

157
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,310
Have a seat.

158
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,790
So, what happened?

159
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,230
I didn't help you.

160
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,740
Besides swapping the documents

161
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,190
and telling your Dean uncle about it,

162
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,360
what else have you done for me?

163
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,920
I can't hide anything from you.

164
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,570
Tell me.

165
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,620
Then I know how to repay you.

166
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,530
I don't like owing others.

167
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,640
Then you should repay Tharn.

168
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,130
What does that have to do with Tharn?

169
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,950
Other than swapping the documents,

170
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,830
I asked my uncle to transfer you to work under another doctor.

171
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,300
But as you know, Doctor Thiti is the real problem here.

172
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,120
I can't ignore what I saw.

173
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,300
Then things happened as you knew them.

174
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,360
So, what does that have to do with Tharn?

175
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,390
It does.

176
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,630
That's what Tharn told me to do.

177
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,850
Tharn.

178
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,850
You haven't met Doctor Khunpol before, have you?

179
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,980
-Doctor, this is Tharn. He's Type's boyfriend.
-Doctor.

180
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,600
That day, you told me that Type was bullied by his boss.

181
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:58,020
[I heard the nurses talking at noon.]

182
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,650
Can you tell me in detail?

183
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,220
-Tharn, I'm not done yet.
-Champ.

184
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,800
This is not the time.

185
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,660
Okay, I know you're nervous.

186
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,340
Doctor. Tell him what happened to Type.

187
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,190
Like I told you on the phone,

188
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,340
Type has been picked on for a while.

189
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,770
He'll be criticized no matter what he does.

190
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,410
No break, and no leave for him.

191
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,660
He was gossiped by the colleagues in the hospital.

192
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,230
Most importantly,

193
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,470
Type was asked to do something out of his job scope.

194
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:45,990
Then...

195
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,700
Is there anything I can help him with?

196
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,360
What can you do? Dress up as a nurse?

197
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,390
Champ.

198
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,300
I just don't want you to be too nervous.

199
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,440
You know that Type can take care of himself.

200
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,100
It's Type we're talking about, you know?

201
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,690
You're right, it's Type.

202
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,910
He might look tough,

203
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,680
but he actually tends to think a lot.

204
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,870
He looks strong but he's soft on the inside.

205
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,700
Do you remember when he was a freshman?

206
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,550
Almost everyone from the university misunderstood him.

207
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,710
And he was so upset.

208
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,500
I don't want him to be upset like that again.

209
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,670
So can you help...

210
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,780
I...

211
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,750
Can I do something for him?

212
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,340
I'm also trying to find the evidence.

213
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,060
Well, I have an idea.

214
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,460
But can you help me?

215
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,500
Sure, Type is also my friend.

216
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,030
So if you want to repay someone,

217
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,640
that person must be Tharn.

218
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,340
But you're the one who finished it.

219
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,830
It's not wrong for me to repay you too.

220
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,140
Tharn loves you very much.

221
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,490
I think so too.

222
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,520
But don't worry. I was going to thank him after all.

223
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,370
But I have to thank you anyway.

224
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,920
If you're grateful to me,

225
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,000
can you start talking casually to me?

226
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,360
Okay, I'm quitting anyway.

227
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,800
Then...

228
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,600
Screw you, doctor.

229
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,360
Okay, I don't mind.

230
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,520
Don't worry about the police report.

231
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,460
The dean guarantees that this is the end.

232
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,930
As for Dr. Thiti,

233
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,310
we'll see what the punishment will be.

234
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,470
I...

235
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:06,470
No.

236
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,640
I don't care what punishment he will receive.

237
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,450
I feel better now that I've beaten him up.

238
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,130
Yes, you did beat him pretty bad.

239
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,450
It's a tiring day.

240
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,950
Go back and rest.

241
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,930
I'll call you if anything happens.

242
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,560
Thank you, doctor.

243
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,660
By the way,

244
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:36,510
I don't like owing others.

245
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,360
I'm serious.

246
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,150
If Champ is too slow,

247
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,740
I'll help you.

248
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,790
Here's my suggestion for you:

249
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,940
be brave.

250
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,910
I'm leaving. See you next time.

251
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:46,040
[Tharn, as for Type's boss, Doctor said you don't need to worry about it.]

252
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:51,340
[It's settled.]

253
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,830
[How?]

254
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:01,210
[Are you free? I'll ask the doctor to call you later.]

255
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,820
[Okay.]

256
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,730
Tharn, the boss is looking for you.

257
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,580
What is it?

258
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,090
How would I know?

259
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,140
I was called here just like you.

260
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,550
I thought I could get a rest first,

261
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,130
but they told me to work right away.

262
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,450
As you know, they're all workaholics.

263
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,320
You too. Hurry up. You're too slow.

264
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,970
I don't want to hear them complain.

265
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,410
Okay, I'll tell the boss later.

266
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,020
I'll tell him that you're talking behind his back.

267
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,840
Okay, I badmouthed him. Hurry up.

268
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,340
Let's go.

269
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,910
[Type calling]

270
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,640
[I'll be back in 2 weeks. Take care. If not, I'll be worried.]

271
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,790
[Missed call from Type]

272
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,210
[Hello?]

273
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,190
Are you asleep, Type?

274
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,070
[Yes, what time is it?]

275
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,350
It's only 11.

276
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,480
[11 p.m. is not early.]

277
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,880
Really?

278
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,130
I miss you.

279
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,520
[Miss you.]

280
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,030
I'm glad you miss me too.

281
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,480
I miss you so bad, Type.

282
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,030
[We just separated this morning.]

283
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,650
Yes, because we just separated this morning,

284
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,250
so I'm missing you a lot.

285
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,600
Just like how you miss me.

286
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,800
[I was just talking in my sleep.]

287
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,550
I'm going to be sad.

288
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,670
[Childish.]

289
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:08,970
Am I childish?

290
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,260
[Super childish.]

291
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,940
[I miss you too.]

292
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,040
Me too.

293
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,010
[Yeah.]

294
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,350
Are you sleepy?

295
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,710
[Yes.]

296
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,210
[Now that things are settled with that jerk boss,]

297
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,690
[I felt relieved.]

298
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,270
[I don't know why, but I was so sleepy when I came back.]

299
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,590
-[And,]
-And...

300
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,190
[thank you.]

301
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,390
Okay.

302
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,990
Go to sleep, Type.

303
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,790
You haven't slept well for months.

304
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,150
Also,

305
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,680
rest more.

306
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:09,020
Let's discuss what to do next when I'm back.

307
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,640
-[Okay, Tharn.]
-Tharn.

308
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,080
Tharn.

309
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,470
What's the matter, Gil?

310
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,550
Let's go to bed.

311
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,470
Let's go to bed.

312
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,500
Bye, Type.

313
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,450
And...

314
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,350
Good night.

315
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,340
What's wrong with you? Why are you drunk?

316
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,130
What?

317
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,450
Who's drunk? No.

318
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:38,630
A few glasses of rice wine won't get me, Gil, drunk.

319
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,970
I'm not drunk.

320
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,160
You said you were going to have dinner.

321
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,520
Yet you came back drunk like a dog.

322
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,180
The boss doesn't treat every day, you know?

323
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,840
Why didn't you go?

324
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:57,530
We're in the North, of course we need to taste the Emperor's Meal.

325
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,530
I think you've been too busy gulping rice wine.

326
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,450
Don't need to work now. Let's go back.

327
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,380
Go back.

328
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,800
You go first.

329
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,070
[Tharn]

330
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:56,440
[Mr. Thara is focusing on work.
Stop filming me.]

331
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,360
Darn it.

332
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,560
I'm going to be up all night again.

333
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:14,970
Darn it.

334
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,050
♫I‘m here, and I never leave♫

00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:42,580
♫Even if the whole world changes♫

336
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:53,260
♫You know you still have me hugging you♫

337
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,910
♫I will always be here♫

338
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,090
♫I promise not to leave♫

339
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:07,430
♫Please believe that this heart remains unchanged♫

340
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:13,290
♫Please don't let go of my hand♫

341
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:17,160
♫No matter if it's painful or happy♫

342
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,440
♫I will always be here♫

343
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,890
You don't have to come with me.

344
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,240
I'm already here.

345
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,380
How are you going to go back if I leave now that I'm the driver?

346
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,960
I'll call a taxi, of course.

347
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,800
Watch where you're going.

348
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,150
You really want to be sent into the Operating Room, don't you?

349
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,390
Leo.

350
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,270
I thought you don't have an appointment today.

351
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,820
Hello, Sister Teng.

352
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,320
Hello.

353
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,500
Is Brother Type here?

354
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,470
He's not here.

355
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,810
I shouldn't have come, then.

356
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,230
I bought him a lot of snacks.

357
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,460
It's okay. You can have them.

358
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,290
Thank you.

359
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:12,770
You're welcome.

360
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,980
Is Brother Type coming to work tomorrow?

361
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,810
No, he quit.

362
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,280
What?

363
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,580
Yes, he resigned yesterday.

364
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,410
Why didn't I know?

365
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,270
Brother Type didn't tell me.

366
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,620
Maybe he couldn't find the time to tell you.

367
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,940
Anyway, Type has resigned.

368
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,620
Someone will take over his job.

369
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,920
Just come to the hospital as scheduled.

370
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,080
And thank you for this.

371
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,170
I'll get back to work.

372
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:56,890
Fiat.

373
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,750
Give it back!

374
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,790
Enough!

375
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,550
I said give it back!

376
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,000
Enough!

377
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,890
Give it back!

378
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,120
I said stop it!

379
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,730
He's seeing someone.

380
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,160
I said give it back!

381
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,900
Fiat.

382
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,120
Give it back.

383
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,390
Why?

384
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,730
Because once again,

385
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,420
I've been through this.

386
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,470
Whenever I wanted someone,

387
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,320
I never got it as I wished.

388
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,350
Not every time.

389
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,260
It's every time.

390
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,850
I wanted my dad to come back, but he abandoned me.

391
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:09,330
I'm so serious about Brother Type. But I was abandoned too.

392
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,690
Am I that annoying?

393
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,150
But I never hated you.

394
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,800
Because you're my friend. Just friend.

395
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,120
No matter how well you take care of me,

396
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,250
it's different.

397
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,210
Yes.

398
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,680
I'm just your friend.

399
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,720
Please help me.

400
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,250
Please?

401
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,150
I will, since I've helped you so much.

402
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,540
Thank you, Leo.

403
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,460
Thank you.

404
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:51,470
What is this?

405
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,190
His address.

406
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,150
How did you get it?

407
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,330
It doesn't matter.

408
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,510
Don't cry. I don't want to comfort you.

409
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,580
What? I'm not crying.

410
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,500
Fine, you're not crying.

411
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,520
Stand up if you're happy now.

412
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,700
I'm hungry. I have a class in the afternoon.

413
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,140
Leo.

414
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,250
Why are you acting cute again?

415
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,430
My knees hurt.

416
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,020
Please?

417
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,690
You know me best.

418
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,320
Thank you.

419
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:23,730
You don't have to thank me.

420
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,030
No need.

421
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:31,850
♫Try to be the one who sees you crying every time♫

422
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:37,040
♫I hold it in until you turn around♫

423
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,770
I'll do anything for you.

424
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,060
♫Only then will I let my tears fall♫

425
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:46,900
♫You'll see who's the one next to you♫

426
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:52,480
♫I‘m willing to be yours and to never leave♫

427
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,090
♫I'll be here, and I'll never disappear♫

428
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,010
Here.

429
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:01,760
Auntie,

430
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,060
I think it's too much.

431
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,100
I can't finish them.

432
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:10,990
What do you mean? I think it's too little.

433
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,840
Oh, right. One more thing.

434
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:15,960
Wait.

435
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,900
Auntie.

436
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:20,830
I almost forgot.

437
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,330
This is your favorite Stir-fried Spicy Fish.

438
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,880
What did Tharn say to you?

439
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,920
Nothing.

440
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,810
But we have a rough idea on what happened to you.

441
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:43,970
Actually, don't worry about me.

442
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,780
It's just a resignation.

443
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,390
It may be a small matter for others,

444
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,420
but I believe it's a big deal for you.

445
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,880
So how can I not worry?

446
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,150
I can handle it. Don't worry.

447
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:06,260
I've had enough with both of you.

448
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,510
It's easy for you to ask us not to worry.

449
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,780
But you two are my sons, no matter how old you are,

450
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,000
I'll always be worried.

451
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,489
Why do you look like that, Type?

452
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:27,420
You're just like my other son.

453
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:30,040
Let me worry about you, okay?

454
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,030
That's right.

455
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:37,570
Brother Type. everyone in our family is your support.

456
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,989
Come back if you're tired.

457
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,719
When you're ready,

458
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,340
I think...

459
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,520
Brother Than will be taking the next step in your relationship.

460
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,710
Dad and mom really want another son.

461
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:57,080
Thanya, don't pressure your brother.

462
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:02,860
Type, eat more. You've lost a lot of weight.

463
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,920
Tharn is worried.

464
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,880
Okay.

465
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:25,290
You're like my real sister, Thanya.

466
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:32,960
And I love you as much as I love my own mother.

467
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,780
Okay.

468
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,520
Hello, Brother Type.

469
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,940
How did you know here?

470
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,580
It's a secret.

471
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,600
Go back, then.

472
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:02,790
Wait.

473
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,380
Why did you quit?

474
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,370
Why should I tell you?

475
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,430
Because you're my doctor.

476
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,770
I'm not, it's Doctor Khunpol and Sister Teng who treated you.

477
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,510
You can consult Sister Teng if you need anything.

478
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,340
I've handed everything over to her.

479
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,130
But I don't trust anyone except you.

480
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,590
You know it.

481
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,190
I know how it feels when I can't play basketball.

482
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,970
Yes, I was a terrible person.

483
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,890
But that was because I knew no one

484
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,200
cared about my knees.

485
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:46,480
You're the only one who cares about my knees.

486
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,120
But I can't do anything now.

487
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,490
I resigned.

488
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:58,610
Can we talk upstairs?

489
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,620
No. My partner doesn't like outsiders in our house.

490
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,520
I really want to talk to you.

491
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,730
Please.

492
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,070
Please, Brother Type? Please?

493
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,060
Let's talk somewhere else.

494
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,730
The guest is here. Go serve them.

495
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:30,900
Type.

496
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,370
Hello, Sister Jeed.

497
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,960
Do you still need to look after the bar when you're pregnant?

498
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:42,360
Yes. Look, my bar is full of young ladies.

499
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,600
If I let my guard down, Khong will definitely lose control.

500
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,580
No way.

501
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,660
Hello, sister.

502
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,790
Hello, have fun.

503
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,550
I'll talk to Type.

504
00:37:59,350 --> 00:37:59,840
Okay.

505
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,520
You can wait inside.

506
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,390
Hey. Come here.

507
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,690
What's wrong with you?

508
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,150
What's wrong with you?

509
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:19,320
Does Tharn know that you brought a boy to my bar?

510
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,250
Sister Jeed, speak nicely.

511
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,740
I am speaking nicely.

512
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,320
Look at him. He's handsome.

513
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,810
The way he looks at you

514
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,920
as if he was going to eat you.

515
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,430
If I had an affair,

516
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,730
I wouldn't bring him to your bar.

517
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,200
Everyone knows that you're on Tharn's side.

518
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:46,540
Aww, are you upset? I'm on both sides.

519
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,190
You're a grown man, and you still feel wronged?

520
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,100
I've known you since you were a kid,

521
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,500
until now...

522
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:56,650
Sister Jeed.

523
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,530
Just so so.

524
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,300
Just kidding.

525
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,110
Well, I trust you. If you say there's nothing, then there's nothing.

526
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,710
I trust you today.

527
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,560
Not only today, you have to trust me no matter what.

528
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:13,300
Well,

529
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,560
how is my nephew?

530
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,200
He's healthy.

531
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,150
Can I touch it?

532
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,650
Type.

533
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,400
I'm your sister.

534
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,450
Why did you cross the line? I'm shy.

535
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,330
Khong, he crossed the line. Where are you?

536
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:38,660
No, I just want to touch your belly.

537
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,100
Oh, touch the baby?

538
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:40,540
Yes.

539
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,110
Okay, let's do it.

540
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,780
You scared me. Wait.

541
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,760
Before you touch my belly,

542
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,650
I have to ask for a gift for my child.

543
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:54,440
I'm not picky. I don't care if it's a red envelope or gold.

544
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,540
Okay.

545
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,890
Okay, deal. Touch it.

546
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,610
-Don't be so nervous. Hurry.
-I'm nervous.

547
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,820
How is it? Did he kick?

548
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,530
The baby is moving, right?

549
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,110
Yes.

550
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,370
He likes you, he's so active.

551
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,060
Look.

552
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,690
Cute.

553
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,970
He's as cute as his mom, right?

554
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,220
He's as cute as his mom.

555
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,130
I won't nag you anymore.

556
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:02,870
Are you close to the bar owner?

557
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,960
I've been here since my freshman year,

558
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,870
until they moved to such a big place here.

559
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:11,930
No wonder.

560
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,040
Let's get to the point.

561
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:22,640
You drink first. We'll talk after you finish.

562
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,740
I'll get straight to the point. I'm in a relationship.

563
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,660
I know.

564
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,500
-Then don't pursue...
-You're seeing a man, right?

565
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,070
You don't have to answer me.

566
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,420
I just want to tell you that

567
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,080
I like men too.

568
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,490
Why would you tell me that?

569
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,770
I just want to tell you

570
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:07,570
that I've never met someone with the same taste.

571
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,500
No, to be precise,

572
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:14,870
I've never met someone with the same taste

573
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,910
and such a kind soul.

574
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,160
I'm not kind.

575
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,130
You are.

576
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,000
You are very kind.

577
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,780
But a kind person like you is not going

578
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:31,200
to keep your promise and take care of my knees.

579
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,980
But I quit.

580
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,780
Resigning doesn't mean

581
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,980
you have to exclude me from your life.

582
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:47,210
At least, can I be your brother?

583
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:50,760
I don't think so.

584
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,470
It'll be good if I can get some suggestions from you.

585
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,540
If it's just occasional...

586
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,190
Thank you.

587
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:03,870
Stubborn.

588
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,530
People often say that about me.

589
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:27,390
Actually, I envy you.

590
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:30,260
What do you mean?

591
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:36,630
To be honest, I've never been in a relationship.

592
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:42,150
People like us only have sex, right?

593
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:47,180
It's hard to find someone who loves you.

594
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:53,590
Has your boyfriend ever been unfaithful to you?

595
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,220
No.

596
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,160
I guess so.

597
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:19,800
Cheers.

598
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:59,650
[Did Type go home?]

599
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:05,870
[Yes, why?]

600
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,850
[I can't reach him.]

601
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:20,190
[He looks tired. Maybe he's asleep.]

602
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,880
[Tired?]

603
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:29,100
[Mom said it's because he's been through a lot.]

604
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:40,440
[You said he just resigned.]

605
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:51,020
[Thank you. I'll bring you a gift when I get back.]

606
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:09,580
[Fiat: You're so cute when you're drunk.]

607
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,020
[Restaurant No. 5]

608
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,900
[This is my new dish.]

609
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,220
I got inspiration from the shop you took me to last time.

610
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:30,860
You copied it?

611
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,060
This is called inspiration.

612
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:37,780
You said you wanted some edible flowers,

613
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,520
so I came up with this dish.

614
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,490
But it may not be because of that restaurant.

615
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:45,030
I think it's because of you.

616
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,330
Because of me?

617
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:49,150
Yes.

618
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:52,290
So, I want to name this dish

619
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:55,940
"Khunpol's Flower".

620
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,470
What do you think?

621
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:04,000
Not good?

622
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,560
[You're so good.]

623
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:11,660
What did you say?

624
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:16,130
No, I just think...

625
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:18,640
You didn't think much, right?

626
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,790
You mean the name of the dish, right?

627
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,770
If Type and No were here, they would have scolded me for not using my brain.

628
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,020
I didn't say that you didn't use your brain.

629
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,920
Only you won't scold me.

630
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:35,020
Right?

631
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:40,210
Speaking of Type,

632
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,850
I saw the boy with a knee injury again today.

633
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,310
Do you remember what I told you?

634
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:48,790
Does it matter?

635
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,070
I'm talking about us.

636
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:59,780
I think that boy likes Type.

637
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,470
That boy likes Type?

638
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,160
That Type who barks at everyone?

639
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,410
Yes, it's true.

640
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,210
His eyes and actions are obvious.

641
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,250
Even if you say so, I don't know much about these kinds of things.

642
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,970
Really? How about this?

643
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,300
Should we tell Tharn?

644
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,020
I don't think so.

645
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,600
I'm afraid it would get out of hand.

646
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,110
I think Type can handle it.

647
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:33,930
I think so.

648
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:42,470
By the way, this dish is called Khunpol's Flower.

649
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,570
Because this is for you.

650
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:51,030
♫Don't be like this♫

651
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:56,390
♫What if I can't control myself?♫

652
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:51,890
Okay?

653
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,520
Type told me to be frank.

654
00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:01,740
♫Will you be cute to others?♫

655
00:48:58,670 --> 00:48:59,980
I'll get straight to the point then.

656
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:00,430
Okay.

657
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,350
Idiot.

658
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:09,650
♫Can you only look at me?♫

659
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:04,920
Why are you calling me an idiot?

660
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,130
Because you're stupid.

661
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,240
How am I stupid?

662
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,200
Obviously, you're an idiot.

663
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,690
Stop scolding me.

664
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,290
Type.

665
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:26,980
Are you okay?

666
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:30,970
Type.

667
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,870
How am I okay?

668
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,110
When will you be back?

669
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:41,380
Type.

670
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:45,610
