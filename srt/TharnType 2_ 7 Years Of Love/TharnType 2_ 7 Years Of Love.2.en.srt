2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,010
Tharn, are you asleep?

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,500
Didn't you tell me

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,080
to let it out when there's something on my mind?

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,580
I don't know what's going on in your head.

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,800
But if you don't tell me,

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,660
I wouldn't know.

8
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,720
Tharn, turn around and talk to me.

9
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,200
Your wife is smart,

10
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,100
but he's not a god that can read your mind.

11
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,340
Turn around and talk to me.

12
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,110
I'm making peace with you.

13
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,640
Sleep, Type. It's late.

14
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,510
Do you want to get up and talk to me?

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,180
It's late, Type.

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,920
We have work tomorrow.

17
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,660
And I have nothing to tell you.

18
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,240
What do you mean?

19
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,460
Do you think that I'm stupid?

20
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,130
How could I not know what's wrong with you?

21
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,570
You've been like this since you returned from home.

22
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,970
Tell me what you want.

23
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,720
Can you give it to me?

24
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,729
You knew what I wanted long ago.

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,009
But you can't give it to me.

26
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,670
Tharn, you jerk.

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,630
This is why I don't want to talk to you.

28
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,920
It turned into a fight every time.

29
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,310
In case you forget, keep in mind that we're both men.

30
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,530
Or, in fact,

31
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,730
you just don't want to reveal our relationship.

32
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,990
That's ridiculous, Tharn.

33
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,490
If I don't want to,

34
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,740
why would I bring you to my parents?

35
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:24,380
Why would I introduce you to my friends?

36
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,420
That's why I told you to sleep. It's late.

37
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,690
Let's say it's just me being unreasonable.

38
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,820
Then tell me,

39
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,010
why you want to get married so much.

40
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,540
Because I love you.

41
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,810
Can you understand?

42
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,110
Even if we love each other,

43
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,000
there's no need to announce it to the world.

44
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,340
I know, Type.

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,950
You don't want to tell anyone

46
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,270
besides those who are close with us.

47
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,040
You've never told others

48
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,640
about our relationship,

49
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,790
not even on social media.

50
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,790
I know we have different opinions on this.

51
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,740
That's why I said to forget about it.

52
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,590
As for what happened today,

53
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,690
I apologize. I was being unreasonable.

54
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,550
Just give me a few days.

55
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,150
I'll try to understand you.

56
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,940
I'll forget about it,

57
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,030
and pretend it never happened.

58
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,640
Okay?

59
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,710
Sure.

60
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,640
Take all the time you need.

61
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,660
I just want to tell everyone about our relationship.

62
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,290
That's all.

63
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,810
You want more time?

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,130
Fine, go ahead.

65
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,420
You jerk!

68
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,740
Why are you shouting?

69
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,570
What are you doing?

70
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,530
I'm making breakfast for you.

71
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,290
How many eggs do you want?

72
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,340
Are you going to coax me in this way?

73
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,710
Put it down.

74
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,460
Come here.

75
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,140
You're an adult, but you can't fry eggs?

76
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,570
Even elementary school kids can do it.

77
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,720
Does it hurt? It turns red.

78
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,720
Why are you laughing?

79
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,530
This pain is worth it.

80
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,350
So, are you not mad anymore?

81
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,980
Do you think I'll feel better just because you get hurt?

82
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,340
Even if you put your hand in the boiling pan,

83
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,810
I won't forgive you.

Hey.

Do you think I don't dare to do so?

I'm sorry, Type.

88

Are you satisfied now?

89
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,350
Sit down. I'll do it.

90
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you want me to help?

91
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,910
Go away.

Who would eat it? Would you look at that?

96
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,170
PuGan, it's time to get up.

97
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,460
I'll sleep for 5 more minutes.

Hey.

99
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,100
You've asked for it twice.

100
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,620
Then I'll ask for a third one.

101
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,830
Okay, but don't blame me for not reminding you.

Okay, let's try, then.

No.

No.

I'll give you 5 minutes to wash up in the bathroom.

What are you doing, Seul?

115
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,360
Grilled toast. I'll put some spread on yours.

116
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,890
It's dangerous, PuGan.

117
00:10:59,330 --> 00:10:59,850
Fine.

118
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,430
How can I put on the spread for you when you're fooling around?

119
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,270
Then forget it.

120

Yes, I just want to hold your hand.

What dirty mouth? I didn't eat anything just now.

133

He's so naughty.

Let him be.

135
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,930
Okay, I'm leaving.

136
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,670
I'll be there in about half an hour.

137
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,550
See you later.

138
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,190
Morning, Brother Tharn.

How are you two?

Where are you going?

141
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,300
We're going to school. PuGan has class.

142
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,920
I do have classes, but you said you would send me.

143
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,540
I said I could go by myself, but you say no.

144
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:05,240
You're graduated, but you're going to school more often than my friends.

145
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,230
Hey, what are you doing?

146
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,300
Watch yourself.

147
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,890
I'm still here, okay?

148
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,260
Let go. What are you doing?

149
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,880
Brother Tharn.

150
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,640
It's too late to worry about me now.

151
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,620
Right, Seul?

152
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,080
Pu, I'm still here.

153
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,630
Behave yourself.

154
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,140
Listen.

155
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,180
If I were there when you were pursuing him,

156
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,710
you

157
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,960
wouldn't become Pu's boyfriend so easily.

158
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,740
Understand?

159
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,880
Sorry, Brother Tharn.

160
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,010
It's too late for you to say this.

161
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,010
What about Brother Type?

162
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,440
Type?

163
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,810
He went to work early in the morning.

164
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,260
Then, you...

165
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,560
Hello, everyone.

166
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,580
I'm your good friend, Khlui.

167
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,160
Guess what's different? I moved to a new apartment!

168
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,730
Today, I'll show you around my apartment.

169
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,360
Once you walk out of the elevator, there's a huge corridor.

170
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,150
Isn't it worth it?

171
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,410
Today, I promise

172
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,320
that if we have over 1,000 audiences,

173
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,890
I'll show you around my bedroom. Oh, I'm so shy.

174
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,550
Come in and have a look.

175
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,820
Isn't it pretty?

176
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,870
Tharn.

177
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,260
Morning, Khlui.

178
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,760
What are you doing here? What a coincidence!

179
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,860
That's my question, why are you here?

180
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,290
I've lived here with Type for a long time.

181
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,180
That means my blessing works.

182
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,080
What blessing?

183
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,680
You forgot again?

184
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,820
I wish you

185
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,420
to grow old together.

186
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,010
To love each other forever, in sickness and in death.

187
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,990
Stop it. What are you doing just now?

188
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,510
Why are you so loud? What's this?

189
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,430
Is it loud?

190
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:20,910
Yes.

191
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,050
I had no idea.

192
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,890
I'm sorry. I'll lower my voice next time.

193
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,270
You're going to do it again?

194
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,590
Of course.

195
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,580
I did the live stream to get more likes just now.

196
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,480
But I'm now

197
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,010
the most popular live seller.

198
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,910
I sell everything.

199
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,360
Even if it's a worn out exhaust pipe,

200
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,240
I can sell it with my eloquence.

201
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,940
Khlui, you're amazing.

202
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,800
I haven't seen you for a while, and you've even eaten an exhaust pipe now?

203
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,960
It's exactly the size of my mouth.

204
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,450
What are you talking about?

205
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,790
Let's talk about you.

206
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,920
How's your cohabitation life?

207
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,560
You've been dating for a long time.

208
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,320
How many years have it been?

209
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,600
Well, 7 years.

210
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,390
Seven years?

211
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,700
Gosh, it must be sweet.

212
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,520
What sweet?

213
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,200
We're just like before,

214
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,360
bickering and fighting every day.

215
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,300
Why?

216
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,990
Hold on.

217
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,620
Khlui, I'm going to the meeting. See you.

218
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,640
Wait.

219
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,350
Tharn.

220
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,990
How can you just leave

221
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,530
without finishing?

222
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,120
What is it?

223
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,850
Why didn't he make it clear?

224
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,960
Should I ask about their cohabitation life?

225
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,220
I do want to, but I have to work.

226
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,070
I'm so tired.

227
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,200
[When are you coming home, you brat?]

228
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,190
It's not been long since I last went home, Dad.

229
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,960
[Stop talking nonsense, Type.]

230
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,220
[The last time you were here was 4 months ago.]

231
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,920
[How could you be so cruel that you don't even visit your parents?]

232
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,130
[What did that mixed-race say to you?]

233
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:05,319
[Just you wait.]

234
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,960
[Okay. I'll chop his head off with the machete next time we meet.]

235
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,980
Then your son will become a widower.

236
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,690
[Hey, what are you talking about?]

237
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,760
[My son is not married yet.]

238
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,060
[How could he become a widower?]

239
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,819
Please accept it, dad.

240
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,510
How many years has it been?

241
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,720
[I'm a man of my word.]

242
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:24,960
[No means no.]

243
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,970
Then you can continue to oppose it.

244
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,770
Your son is going to work. I'm hanging up.

245
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:32,770
[Okay.]

246
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,720
[A man should be responsible for his job.]

247
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,390
[But you also should find time to come home.]

248
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,270
Okay, Dad.

249
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,560
Screw it.

250
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,100
What's wrong with him?

251
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,300
Hey.

252
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,960
What's wrong with Fiat?

253
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,970
Don't you think he's been training nonstop lately?

254
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,110
Yes, he is.

255
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,350
Leo isn't here for just a week.

256
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,790
Can you let Leo come back from Italy tomorrow?

257
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,220
Fiat keeps asking me to train.

258
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,100
I don't even have time to date.

259
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,810
Hey, how long are you guys going to talk?

260
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:33,960
Gosh.

261
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,530
Go find the coach.

262
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,430
Hurry!

263
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,020
Fiat, are you okay?

264
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,660
Leo's going to kill me.

265
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,840
[Emergency Room]

266
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,670
Call the doctor.

267
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,540
The doctor will be here soon. Calm down.

268
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,380
The doctor is here.

269
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,830
Doctor, I can't quit playing basketball!

270
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,780
Okay, patient.

271
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,320
Calm down.

272
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,280
Calm down. The doctor is here. Don't worry.

273
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,110
Breathe slowly.

274
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,020
Let me check on you first.

275
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,490
Ouch!

276
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,490
Breathe slowly.

277
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,240
Breathe slowly. Calm down.

278
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,310
Lie down.

279
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,130
Gosh!

280
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,040
Doctor, this patient is not easy to deal with.

281
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,640
He doesn't seem like someone who would cooperate.

282
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,500
It's okay. Let's wait for the MRI result first.

283
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,640
What should we do if his ligament is really torn apart?

284
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,340
Don't worry. We'll see.

285
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,250
Hello, Type.

286
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,510
Come here.

287
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,170
Hello.

288
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,970
Long time no see. How are you? I miss you a lot.

289
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,560
Are you here to watch Tharn's performance?

290
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,710
Yes.

291
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,820
How are you?

292
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,810
I'm fine.

293
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,340
But my wife is pregnant, and she's fierce.

294
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,720
Congratulations.

295
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,810
Congratulations on your baby, and the opening of your bar.

296
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,100
Thanks.

297
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,230
What do you think? It's bigger than before.

298
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,600
It's much bigger than before.

299
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,120
Of course.

300
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,280
It cost me a lot.

301
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,510
I'm going bankrupt now.

302
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,520
Because of the refurbishment?

303
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,850
No. Because of my wife's morning sickness.

304
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,570
She goes shopping every time after she vomits.

305
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,390
Actually, her morning sickness isn't that frequent. She just wants to shop.

306
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,350
If she gets pregnant for 18 months,

307
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,300
I'll really go bankrupt.

308
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,430
It's worrying me.

309
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,040
Calm down.

310
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,820
Oh, that reminds me. Jeed is waiting for you.

311
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,360
Okay.

312
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,590
Go find her. She's been missing you for days.

313
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,630
-Okay.
-I'll go to my friend.

314
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,070
Okay.

315
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,520
-See you later. Bye.
-Okay.

316
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,490
Don't forget to meet Jeed.

317
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,150
Okay.

318
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,240
Do you want more?

319
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,160
No, thanks.

320
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,000
Type. Type, you're here.

321
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,920
Come and sit here.

322
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,880
Hurry up.

323
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,730
We're sitting in front of the stage.

324
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,490
What do you want to drink today?

325
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,320
I'll drink whatever you give me.

326
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,330
Look how cute you are.

327
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,600
I'll arrange it nicely for you, my dear brother.

328
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,470
Okay.

329
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,850
You know how to survive, huh?

330
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,920
Am I not her brother?

331
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:35,780
You were.

332
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,220
Okay, I love you.

333
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,760
I'll give you more.

334
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,960
This is for free.

335
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,710
This is stronger.

336
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,290
Here.

337
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,240
Thank you.

338
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,970
Do you have kidney dialysis service at your hospital?

339
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,130
Just kidding.

340
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:53,570
It's liver.

341
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,140
Oh, it's liver dialysis. I'm sorry.

342
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,110
You're talking nonsense again.

343
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,860
What took you so long?

344
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,130
Sorry, I had work to do.

345
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,580
Speaking of work,

346
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,930
can I put our leaflets in your department?

347
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,460
You're promoting your restaurant again?

348
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,790
I didn't do it everywhere.

349
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,770
Really?

350
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,530
Sure you didn't do it everywhere.

351
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,300
[Leaflets of Restaurant]

352
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,890
My bar is now full of leaflets.

353
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,790
It's just a little, Sister Jeed.

354
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,230
Okay.

355
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,620
Just let it go for the sake of your brother.

356
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,920
By the way, is there anything good today, Sister Jeed?

357
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,370
You're talking about food again.

358
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,820
I'm hungry. Aren't you hungry?

359
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,230
I'll tell the waiter later.

360
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,630
Don't go.

361
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,040
Stay here. We haven't seen each other for so long.

362
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,050
The three of us are here too.

363
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,470
Yes, I miss you guys.

364
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,570
Look, sis.

365
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,760
Time is like a fleeing show.

366
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,040
Look at us. We finished our first year in a blink of an eye.

367
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,510
Yeah.

368
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,520
Then, I graduated with a bachelor's degree.

369
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,390
-You went to our graduation ceremony, right?
-Yes.

370
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,550
And then Type got his master's degree.

371
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,930
Damn it!

372
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,810
We're old now.

373
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,220
You're old, not me. Why are you looking at me?

374
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,590
Why are you staring at me?

375
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,520
I mean, among us, you're as pretty as ever.

376
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,710
Don't touch me. I'll go serve other guests.

377
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,740
I'm not in the mood.

378
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,060
I'm leaving.

379
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,960
Okay.

380
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,860
No, why did you make her angry?

381
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,630
I was just kidding.

382
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,810
We can't talk about age at all.

383
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,530
Look, we've all grown up.

384
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,930
Look at me.

385
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,930
Who would believe that I'm a civil servant?

386
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,470
While you, Champ, the silly,

387
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,020
have always been a fool.

388
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,760
What kind of person would have forgotten their own school

389
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,250
and only graduated after 5 years?

390
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,800
You almost graduated with the medical students.

391
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,820
Eight years for them?

392
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,190
You jerk!

393
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,170
It only takes 6 years to study medicine.

394
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,430
Really?

395
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,720
If you're going to scold someone, think about the lines first.

396
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,980
Really? Six years?

397
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,710
Yes.

398
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,350
You're so silly.

399
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,260
But

400
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:06,560
our friend is now the restaurant owner.

401
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,300
He has his own restaurant.

402
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,920
You're really passionate about food.

403
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,560
Well, you shouldn't go to my restaurant and eat for free anymore.

404
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,730
My restaurant is on the verge of closing thanks to you.

405
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,450
Darn it.

406
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,810
And you, Type, a jerk.

407
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,840
What?

408
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,310
You always hit my head without reason.

409
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,000
And kicked me when you were not in a good mood.

410
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,900
Do you want to get beaten?

411
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,670
Calm down. It's not the time yet.

412
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,420
What?

413
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:35,910
Get me one now.

414
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,240
I already did.

415
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:43,200
But in the end you're working at a hospital, taking care of patients.

416
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,710
Hey, why are you...

417
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,610
Do you want to get kicked,

418
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,310
then go to my hospital?

419
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:53,340
Save your energy. Calm down. I was just kidding.

420
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:58,840
Hold on. There's one more person I have to talk about.

421
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,490
Who?

422
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,430
Of course it's Tharn.

423
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,550
Tharn, the sweetheart of our Type.

424
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,740
He's very outstanding.

425
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:16,380
Besides being a music producer, he also works for his father's company.

426
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,500
Your father-in-law.

427
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:22,530
He sells instruments online,

428
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,620
and he works part-time playing here.

429
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,390
How many jobs does he have?

430
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,310
Impressive.

431
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:35,530
Wait, he has one more job.

432
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,630
What?

433
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,330
A job that you're familiar with.

434
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:41,880
What?

435
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,220
To serve you every night.

436
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,200
You jerk!

437
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,860
You really like to pry into my business, don't you?

438
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,140
Hello, everyone.

439
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,380
This song

440
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:04,600

00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,420

What?

466

All of us are in a relationship

-Really?

471
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,520
He knows nothing about love.

472
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:20,250
♫I know our encounter♫

473

♫I've now made the decision♫

Look at him.

482

Look.

483
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,980

00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,720
Right?

492
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,220

504
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,190
You're so cunning.

505
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:35,070
I know you like it when I play instruments.

506
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,110
If I had time to practice drums,

507
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,490
I would practice.

508
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,540
Because I like how you look when you play the drum?

509
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,490
Yes.

510
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,020
It's more than like.

511
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:55,630
You love it.

512
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,690
Then do you know it?

513
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,470
What?

514
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,780
Do you know why I'm okay with you being swamped with work?

515
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,090
Because I know you love what you do.

516
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,050
And?

517
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:33,610
I also love you for doing what you love.

518
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,380
Then, do you know

519
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:45,860
what

520
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,820
I love the most?

521
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,490
Me.

522
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,590
Gosh.

523
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,040
Are you okay?

524
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,120
Wait.

525
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,720
We only have soda.

526
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,260
Screw it.

527
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,290
I can't do it today, bro.

528
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,960
-Champ.
-What?

529
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,570
Where are Type and Tharn?

530
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,350
I think the scene has reappeared.

531
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,030
Only the two of us are left.

532
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,440
Aren't you used to it yet?

533
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,700
They disappear suddenly every time.

534
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,080
Only the two of us.

535
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,280
Leave them alone.

536
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,960
They might be eating each other somewhere nearby.

537
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,610
Do you want this?

538
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,730
No.

539
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:19,890
What about you?

540
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,380
Come on.

541
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:39,080
[Where are you? I'm here.]

542
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,990
[Hold on. My boss is looking for me.]

543
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,250
[Okay, I'll wait for you at the same old place.]

544
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,340
Doctor, how are you?

545
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,710
Long time no see.

546
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,850
Do you remember me?

547
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:06,850
Champ.

548
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:09,710
Why are you so surprised?

549
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,679
I'm sorry.

550
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:16,560
I just didn't expect to see you.

551
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,850
I haven't seen you for so long. You still act silly.

552
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,469
Yes. How are you doing, then?

553
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,540
I'm fine.

554
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,730
What are you thinking?

555
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,130
Making trouble at the pediatrics?

556
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:54,880
Trouble?

557
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,390
What did I do?

558
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,420
Someone reported that you harassed a nurse there.

559
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,180
What do you mean by harassment?

560
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,410
I was discussing the physical test results with the patient.

561
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,280
I was doing my job.

562
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,410
You still like to refute me.

563
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,530
But someone testified against you.

564
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:22,910
If it's about the recent case,

565
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,290
I went there with Sister Teng.

566
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,750
She can prove that I was there for work.

567
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,300
I called you here just to give you a reminder,

568
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,270
yet you're rebutting me.

569
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,630
You're probably too free,

570
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,350
that's why you have time to do those things.

571
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,980
They came to me for help

572
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,960
because I was your boss.

573
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:49,800
Think about it. If the nurse filed a complaint to the hospital,

574
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,070
the reputation of our department will be greatly affected.

575
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,590
If you can use your head to think,

576
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,540
then think about it.

577
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,950
This is a reminder.

578
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:09,960
Don't do it again.

579
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,000
Okay, I'll be careful next time.

580
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:19,200
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

581
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,130
So, you opened a healthy diet restaurant?

582
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,220
Yes.

583
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,420
You don't believe someone like me can do it, do you?

584
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,380
I'm used to being laughed at by No.

585
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,520
Who said that?

586
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,450
I think it suits you.

587
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,500
You always bought me delicious food before.

588
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:55,150
Yeah. It's rare to hear that.

589
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,280
I'm sorry. I'm used to doing it.

590
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,580
Do you do this to your partner often?

591
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,020
How would someone like me have a partner?

592
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,640
I don't have one. No even said

593
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,830
that I can't find a wife with my personality.

594
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:23,010
But I said I was used to it because it was you.

595
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,000
Do you remember? When we were freshmen,

596
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,820
I liked to touch your head.

597
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,400
Not because you were skinny,

598
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,210
but because every time I was with you,

599
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,710
you seemed pocket-sized to me.

600
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,150
Type, this way.

601
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,790
Damn it, what a jerk!

602
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,780
Calm down. What happened?

603
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,020
That jerk!

604
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:56,560
I'm fine. I just didn't have lunch.

605
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,180
Hello, doctor.

606
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,890
I was going to tell Champ

607
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,780
that we work in the same place.

608
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,810
Type, just talk to me like you used to.

609
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,220
No, Doctor.

610
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,990
This is a workplace.

611
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,890
If I speak informally to you,

612
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,520
I'm going to get another complaint.

613
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,310
Let's talk informally when we're outside.

614
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,380
Type, you should've told me earlier

615
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,950
that you work in the same place with him.

616
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,370
I haven't seen him since freshman year.

617
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,820
What brings you here?

618
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,950
Oh, here. These are the foods from my restaurant.

619
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,460
You can share it with your department,

620
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,140
and help me to give out the leaflets.

621
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,980
I promise all the foods are delicious.

622
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,990
You can run around the court after eating it.

623
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,870
Run around the court? Did you put something in it?

624
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,070
Okay, trust me.

625
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,210
No one can fight me when it comes to eating.

626
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,220
I won't make a mistake like I did for the elective course.

627
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,780
Speaking of the food...

628
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,520
Here you go.

629
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,290
Remember to eat. Don't just work.

630
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:09,860
Thank you.

631
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:22,850
By the way,

632
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,580
are you still playing soccer?

633
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:33,400
I don't play soccer anymore. I do boxing instead.

634
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,350
We can't run like we used to.

635
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,920
Speaking of which, I remember something.

636
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,210
Last week, there was a basketball player from our school

637
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,050
here to treat his torn ligaments.

638
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,960
Torn ligament? Will he be transferred for physiotherapy?

639
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,320
He'll be transferred to the rehabilitation centre first.

640
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:04,330
Well, what are you talking about?

641
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,350
No, hit the break shot.

642
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,870
Wait, calm down. I need to find the angle.

643
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,510
No, wait.

644
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,020
Watch me.

645
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,020
This jerk, he's doing it again.

646
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:32,250
Darn it.

647
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,210
-Are you going to hit the ball or not?
-I am.

648
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,940
Step away if you're not. You're wasting our time.

649
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,640
You jerk!

650
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,620
Oh, one potting.

651
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:47,710
So cool. You have my respect.

652
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,620
Slow down.

653
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,780
Hey. Hey. Hey.

654
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,060
You have work tomorrow. Calm down.

655
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:54,920
Put it down.

656
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,070
What's wrong? Why did he drink so much?

657
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,810
[Did he fight with Tharn?]

658
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:00,440
No.

659
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:01,750
You have sharp ears.

660
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,080
It's about his work.

661
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,310
When the doctor was there,

662
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,660
he acted cool.

663
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,590
When there were only two of us, he couldn't stop scolding him.

664
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,660
How can I not curse at him?

665
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,930
Everyone in the hospital knows that he robs the cradle.

666
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:20,160
I didn't pester the nurse.

667
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,660
It was she pestering me.

668
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,210
I already rejected her.

669
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,880
But that jerk kept pestering me.

670
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,570
I didn't do anything.

671
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,870
It's his problem that he couldn't win her heart,

672
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,170
but he vented his anger on me.

673
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,280
Darn it.

674
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:35,960
Are you scolding your boss?

675
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:36,910
Yes.

676
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,020
Fine.

677
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:38,940
Screw you.

678
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,460
Is it time for fun?

679
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,790
I just want you to feel better.

680
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,110
-Give it to me.
-That's mine.

681
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,040
What should I drink, then?

682
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,500
You...

683
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,690
I'll hit from this angle.

684
00:41:53,580 --> 00:42:00,390
[I'm Kunpeng.]

685
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,470
-What are you mumbling about?
-Nothing.

686
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,670
This one.

687
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:01,730
I'm looking for the angle.

688
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,780
[Oh, Doctor, sorry. I forgot to say hello to you.]

689
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:02,390
Funny you.

690
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,970
[It's okay. I guess you're busy.]

691
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:04,390
Will you hit it or not?

692
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,010
Fine.

693
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,230
[I just want to tell you that this is my account.]

694
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,560
You're good.

695
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,420
[See you next time.]

696
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,550
Go ahead.

697
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:14,540
[Good night.]

698
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,270
Hurry up.

699
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,760
Okay.

700
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,580
He used to be cute, and he's still so cute now.

701
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,610
Is he really a doctor?

702
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:26,810
I'm curious.

703
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,700
Who are you talking to?

704
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,510
Doctor.

705
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,750
The one I told you about. He sent me a message.

706
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,620
Which doctor?

707
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,270
Kunpeng.

708
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,820
Do you remember? He's our friend in freshman year.

709
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,430
Oh, Kunpeng. Your roommate?

710
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,040
Yes.

711
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:49,100
The one we wanted to switch rooms with at first.

712
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,710
Yes.

713
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,140
The cute one.

714
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:55,920
Does he like you?

715
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,940
Are you crazy?

716
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,900
Take it.

717
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,110
Okay.

718
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:09,180
Type, don't drink too much.

719
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,960
Right. If you're drunk, I won't carry you home.

720
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,580
You're as heavy as a cow.

721
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:19,190
Go order more. You talk too much.

722
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,860
Hey, I don't have money to pay.

723
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,190
-It's on me.
-Excuse me.

724
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,630
Waiter.

725
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,390
Champ, it's your turn.

726
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:36,640
Tharn.

727
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,540
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

728
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,580
-Type.
-Pick him up. He's heavy.

729
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:48,560
This jerk, your wife thought he's skinny?

730
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,940
You're as heavy as a cow, you jerk.

731
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,190
My shoulder is going to be dislocated.

732
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,590
Here, it's your wife's.

733
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,680
What were you guys doing? Why was he so drunk?

734
00:43:59,060 --> 00:43:59,850
Are you asking me?

735
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:02,750
I might have the answer.

736
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,060
You jerk.

737
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,250
I should be asking you instead.

738
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,790
Did you two fight?

739
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,590
Well...

740
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:12,330
Can't you remember?

741
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,660
When we drank together today,

742
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,060
we only talked about work,

743
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:21,750
and his stupid boss.

744
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,030
And?

745
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:26,590
And?

746
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:31,400
Hey, how many years have we been friends?

747
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:38,420
-Okay.
-You know it, he gets drunk because of you every time.

748
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:40,190
Right?

749
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:43,650
Yes.

750
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:45,160
You admit it.

751
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:48,970
Then why did you fight this time?

752
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,850
-We didn't.
-But...

753
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,790
Because you weren't aroused? You didn't do well in bed?

754
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:55,740
Keep your voice down.

755
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:57,680
Thorn is getting married.

756
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,140
Really? Congratulations.

757
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,730
I'm ready.

758
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:06,090
-Yeah.
-But Thorn didn't invite me.

759
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,750
-Maybe he hates you.
-Hey.

760
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,870
Is it true? Can I go eat and drink for free?

761
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:11,510
Is it okay?

762
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,230
Okay, I'll tell him.

763
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:16,220
Wait, we're getting off track.

764
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,360
What does this have to do with Brother Thorn's wedding?

765
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:23,930
It's just... I want to marry him.

766
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,200
What? Is he pregnant?

767
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,560
He got pregnant before getting married?

768
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,800
Did you make him pregnant or what?

769
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,850
If he's not pregnant, then what?

770
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,560
No.

771
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:32,990
Oh, right. I forgot.

772
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:34,640
I'm relieved that my friend won't get pregnant.

773
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:38,940
-Thank you for the ride.
-Okay.

774
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,080
I'll bring him in.

775
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:42,780
Wait.

776
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:46,070
What now?

777
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:50,600
-I think this time...
-Yes.

778
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,440
You need a helper.

779
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,490
What helper?

780
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:54,830
Hold on.

781
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:56,830
What helper?

782
00:45:59,030 --> 00:45:59,940
I'm looking for a group chat.

783
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:02,670
What are you doing?

784
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,120
Hold on. You'll find out soon.

785
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:10,570
I'm going to remove him.

786
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:13,160
What are you doing?

787
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:14,540
Hold on.

788
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,530
You never complain that he is heavy when you carry him to bed,

789
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:18,610
but now you do.

790
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:20,280
I haven't said anything yet.

791
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:26,120
Look.

792
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:26,890
What?

793
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:29,690
What do you think about this group?

794
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,540
Plan for Type's husband.

795
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:37,180
This time, you'll marry your wife for sure.

796
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,780
Thank you, No.

797
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:41,570
Alright.

798
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,300
Thank you for sending him back. Be careful on your way home.

799
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,320
We're going in, Type.

800
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,750
Type.

801
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,390
If you have something on your mind,

802
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,590
why didn't you tell me?

803
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,780
Even if it's No and your friends,

804
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,010
I would get jealous too.

805
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:04,160
Give me a hug.

806
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:34,100
You're so clingy, that's why

807
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:43,160
I hope you only belong to me.

808
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,920
Why can't I hear anything?

809
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,930
Are they fighting?

810
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:26,130
What?

811
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:32,030
Goodness.

812
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:36,520
I almost dropped the good stuff.

813
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,570
I'll not undergo the surgery no matter what.

814
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,750
Even if you want me to do it.

815
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:49,470
I won't take the risk no matter what.

816
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:51,870
I don't care how much rehab therapy I need to do

817
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:53,200
or how many pills I need to take,

818
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,580
I won't have the surgery.

819
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,820
And I'm going back to the court.

820
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,500
Here's the thing, sir.

821
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,710
Surgery is not scary.

822
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:06,230
Besides, you can have minimally invasive surgery.

823
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,850
The wound is small and you'll recover soon.

824
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,610
And you'll recover faster

825
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:11,740
with rehab therapy.

826
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:14,570
Can you guarantee that?

827
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:16,060
If I get surgery,

828
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,910
my knee will recover like it did before my injury.

829
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:24,300
Sir, it's better to do it than not.

830
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,870
If you don't have surgery,

831
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:29,080
your torn ligament may not be restored.

832
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,390
More importantly, you might not be able to jump anymore.

833
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,880
You don't have to convince me.

834
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:39,610
I don't believe it even if the doctors say so.

835
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,990
Why should I agree now?

836
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,910
I'm here for rehabilitation,

837
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:44,880
so that my leg can recover.

838
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:48,110
Just do your job.

839
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,000
