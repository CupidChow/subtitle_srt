00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,980
Put it properly.

173
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,670
Why is it wilted? Isn't there any fresh one?

174
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,900
I told you to cut it in the morning.

175
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,820
You did it last night, right?

176
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,590
Where is everyone? Why is no one here to help?

177
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,070
They're here.

178
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,080
Honey, let's start.

179
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,380
I'm happy for your achievement.

180
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,490
Tharn, come here.

181
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,900
-Hello.
-Hello.

182
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,070
Let's go.

183
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,410
But I don't know what to do.

184
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,150
It's not hard.

185
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,380
I think that's what Naga wants too.

186
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,000
Go, kid.

187
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,840
This kid.

188
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,940
He's always like a child when he's not confident.

189
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,690
Go.

190
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,960
Come on, kid. Hurry. Come with me.

191
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,590
Cut the hair.

192
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,300
Honey, scissors.

193
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,700
Cut it and put it here.

194
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,870
Cut it. Cut it.

195
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,510
Cut it after praying.

196
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,470
Put it inside, kid.

197
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,910
Alright, everyone. Line up. Line up.

198
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,700
Line up! Line up! Hurry!

199
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,410
Hurry up.

200
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,440
You stand here. You stand here.

201
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,800
Where's the tray? Here. Okay.

202
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,240
-Honey, hurry up.
-Honey, slow down.

203
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,580
-Look, everyone's here.
-This is my first time wearing high heels.

204
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,610
-Say hello.
-Where are you taking me?

205
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,290
Hello, everyone. Hello, everyone.

206
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,240
Hello, everyone.

207
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,180
-You jerk.
-That's it.

208
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,940
-Hurry up. Hurry up.
-Oh, my God!

209
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,420
Hi, everyone.

210
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,130
Hi, guys.

211
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,600
-Come on.
-Why are you dragging me?

212
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,620
Seriously.

213
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,390
-Can I?
-What should I hold?

214
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,250
-You hold this.
-Thank you.

215
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,800
-I'll take this.
-I'm going to be a monk's mother.

216
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,700
-Are you ready?
-Stop running.

217
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,610
Don't run.

218
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,100
I won't run. I'll dance later.

219
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,310
Honey, are you done?

220
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,770
It can't be any better.

221
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,510
-How can you say that?
-If you don't believe me, check my voice.

222
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,910
No, I'll just check you.

223
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,990
Honey.

224
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,610
You're so greedy. You're holding it all by yourself.

225
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,670
The pillow, the fan and bowls.

226
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,530
Are you crazy?

227
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,490
Greed.

228
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,770
Tharn.

229
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,890
Come here, kid.

230
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,580
Come here. Come closer.

231
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,720
Say it.

232
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,530
Here, the pillow.

233
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,580
Take it.

234
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,280
Well...

235
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,210
Don't talk.

236
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,860
He didn't say anything.

237
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,050
-I'm reminding him just in case.
-Really?

238
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,510
Then what should I do with the pillow?

239
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,270
You don't know the meaning of holding a pillow, do you?

240
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,810
Listen, people say in Naga's parade,

241
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,320
the one holding the pillow

242
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,050
can be siblings or others.

243
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,800
But most people think

244
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,090
the one holding the pillow is Naga's partner.

245
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,350
And Naga told you to hold it.

246
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,700
Now you know

247
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,230
why his father is willing to let you take it.

248
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,000
He agreed. Don't push me.

249
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,750
His dad agreed. Do you understand?

250
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,350
-Thank you, Mom.
-You're welcome.

251
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,610
Thank you, Dad.

252
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,580
That's all.

253
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:30,900
Honey.

254
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,500
The diamond cracked.

255
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,070
-You deserve it.
-Come here.

256
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,940
Shall we start?

257
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,070
♫Every time you look into the vast sky♫

258
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:59,530
♫You'll see clouds floating with the wind♫

259
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:04,590
♫And disappear♫

260
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:09,000
♫The hour hand won't stop no matter what♫

261
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,060
♫It will still be moving day by day, month by month, and year by year♫

262
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:20,680
♫But I'm still here♫

263
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,150
♫Because I‘m here, and I will never leave♫

264
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:29,100
♫Even if the whole world changes♫

265
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:36,490
♫You just need to know that you still have me hugging you♫

266
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,190
Here, here.

267
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,490
Here too. Here too.

268
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,050
Here too.

269
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:02,160
I didn't get it. Here.

270
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,200
-When I see Type that brat...
-No.

271
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,140
Don't say that.

272
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,340
He's already a monk. Show some respect.

273
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,320
Is he a monk? I forgot. I forgot.

274
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,690
No one heard me. No one heard me. Let me say it again.

275
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:15,360
My eyes are not used to it when I see Master Type.

276
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,240
Usually,

277
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,910
whenever he sees us, he will run over

278
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,000
and pat my head so loudly.

279
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,720
-That's true. You're right.
-Right?

280
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:24,470
But No,

281
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,800
you're making fun of a monk. Be careful, you might go to hell.

282
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,990
Bro, we'll meet even if I go to hell.

283
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,900
-With whom?
-You.

284
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,800
-I'm not going to hell with you.
-Why? Let's meet there.

285
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,480
Doctor, is everything ready?

286
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,200
Doctor, how is it? Are you okay? Are you hot?

287
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,780
It's not that hot.

288
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,900
Doctor, Doctor, may I interrupt?

289
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,220
It is just that hot.

290
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,230
Open your app and take a look.

291
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,710
The weather is so hot.

292
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,810
Put the wok on the floor and fry some rice.

293
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,070
Then it'll be cooked, ready to eat.

294
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,940
It's savory. You'll be stuffed.

295
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,240
-You're exaggerating.
-Really?

296
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,620
It's too hot. I can't stand it. Look at my sweat.

297
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:10,780
Ah-ha.

298
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,750
Eat up. It'll cool you down.

299
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,060
Okay.

300
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:26,820
What?

301
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,420
You won't be hot if you put it on.

302
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,140
Thank you.

303
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,940
Excuse me, bro.

304
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,600
You're at the temple, not at home.

305
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,580
Even if you want to flirt, you still have to look at the occasion.

306
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,240
This is a temple. Watch yourself.

307
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,980
Oh, and you even put the hat on him like that.

308
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,980
Oh, my gosh. What a sin.

309
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,400
-No respect at all.
-No.

310
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:58,930
What are you talking about?

311
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,380
Put it on, Doctor. Don't listen to him.

312
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,220
You usually work in the air-conditioner room.

313
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,320
You will faint on a day like this.

314
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,620
You're so caring about him. You're so sweet.

315
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,130
Stay like this forever, okay?

316
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,380
By the way, Doctor.

317
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,550
We're here to attend the Ordination Ceremony, right?

318
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,350
Have you heard of this?

319
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,840
You have to become a monk first before you have sex.

320
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:29,920
Even if you have a partner, you have to wait patiently.

321
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:30,900
You know, right?

322
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,730
But

323
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:39,860
if you become my friend's boyfriend now,

324
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,280
he's all ready.

325
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,830
You don't have to wait.

326
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,260
Why?

327
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:50,730
-Tell him.
-Because I've been a monk.

328
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,600
-I'm ready to have sex anytime.
-Hey.

329
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,440
I mean marriage.

330
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,030
If you get together with me now,

331
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,290
I'm ready to marry you anytime.

332
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,330
I'm so excited.

333
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,960
I feel so shy to hear it.

334
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,790
That's amazing!

335
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,620
Champ, I'm so proud of you!

336
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,930
You've finally made progress on this.

337
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:21,690
Great!

338
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,410
What?

339
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,200
It's just a joke between friends.

340
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,790
Right?

341
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,020
-Friends?
-Yeah.

342
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,800
Don't say something so hurtful out loud.

343
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,410
My friend is indeed amazing.

344
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,270
Whatever, Doctor.

345
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,570
It's so hard to be you.

346
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,370
Cheer up.

347
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:48,070
It's not that hard, Techno.

348
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,390
You're smiling?

349
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,980
You seem to enjoy it.

350
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,400
You're amazing, Doctor.

351
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:16,020
[Planning for Type's husband.]

352
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,950
[Techno: Hey. Does anyone know how the monk is doing?]

353
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,080
[Champ: What is it?]

354
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,560
[Techno: How is he doing? He's been a monk for almost a week.]

355
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,030
[Champ: I think we should ask Tharn.]

356
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,880
[Thanya: I don't think he has time to read the messages.]

357
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,390
[Techno: Why?]

358
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,070
[Thanya: He should be preparing.]

359
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,330
[Techno: Prepare for what?]

360
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,300
Brother Tharn, you just got back?

361
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,380
Yes.

362
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,420
I'm here to get something. I'll go back to sleep at home.

363
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,620
Why?

364
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,470
Because my house is closer to the airport.

365
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,730
Are you going to fly to Brother Type?

366
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:34,500
Yes.

367
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,010
I told him I would wait.

368
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:41,410
But that doesn't mean I won't go to him.

369
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,550
Anyway, when I'm not around,

370
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,680
please help me to take care of my house.

371
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,140
Roger.

372
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:49,400
I promise I'll do my best to take care of your house.

373
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,920
Great.

374
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,520
-Brother Tharn's really great, right?
-Yes.

375
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,760
I wouldn't be able to stand it,

376
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,780
if I need to stay away from you for so long.

377
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,530
What are you talking about?

378
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,770
Wait for me.

379
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,640
-Don't be impatient. He'll be here soon.
-Can we make it on time?

380
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,690
-Hello, Mom and Dad.
-Hello.

381
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,270
Why are you here so often?

382
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,250
I'm sick of seeing your face.

383
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,920
Old people are always stubborn.

384
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,370
In fact,

385
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,060
he's been waiting for you before the chicken crows.

386
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,850
Honey, don't tell him.

387
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,590
I'll lose face.

388
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,270
Why are you laughing?

389
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,420
How long are you going to stand there?

390
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,590
It'll be late for the monk to eat.

391
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,360
Thank you, Dad.

392
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,760
Hurry up.

393
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,560
-Go. Take this.
-Okay, thank you.

394
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,070
And this.

395
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,460
Kneel down and walk over.

396
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,430
Do it like this. Look at me. Like this.

397
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:58,900
Put down your things.

398
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,870
Watch your behavior.

399
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,670
Kneel down to the monk. Come on, step back.

400
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:13,950
Put your hands together, put them on your chest and kneel.

401
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,430
-Do you know how to bow?
-Yes.

402
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,750
Your fingers are wide open, like a map.

403
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,820
Okay. First bow.

404
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:27,830
Bend over.

405
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,130
Keep your elbows and knees aligned.

406
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,590
Stand up.

407
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,310
Second bow.

408
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,620
Third bow.

409
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,520
All right, present your item.

410
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,920
Give it to Master.

411
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,990
Give it to Master, not put it down.

412
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:16,730
Sit with your legs on the same side.

413
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,020
Receive your blessings.

414
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,920
I wish you a long life. Be spirited,

415
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,050
happy, and healthy.

416
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,500
Amitabha.

417
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,820
Amitabha.

418
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,480
Done.

419
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,159
Thank you, Dad.

420
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:51,199
You're welcome. Just remember what you should do.

421
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:51,770
Okay.

422
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,070
All right, let's go back.

423
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,660
You don't have to come every week, almsgiver.

424
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:07,110
Don't say that, Master. I want to come.

425
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,880
So...

426
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,290
Master, don't stop me.

427
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,930
You're so stubborn.

428
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,950
Doctor, how is it? Did you wait long?

429
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,210
There were so many customers in the afternoon today.

430
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,970
It's okay.

431
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,330
Actually, you don't have to come personally.

432
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,650
Just ask the staff to deliver it.

433
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,540
It can't be, you're my important guest.

434
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,240
Tharn, Type, Techno, and you

435
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,090
are all my important guests.

436
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,290
Tharn also booked food from my restaurant.

437
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,910
He asked me to deliver it to him at 5 a.m.

438
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,450
But I know he's giving it to Master.

439
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,130
If we were not friends,

440
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,340
I wouldn't have delivered it.

441
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,260
Anyway, I really admire him.

442
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,600
He flew there on Saturday and came back on Sunday.

443
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,900
He told me he'd go there every week.

444
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:39,180
Love does turn people blind.

445
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,440
It's so much better to be alone.

446
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:43,990
Am I right, Doctor?

447
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,350
Doctor?

448
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,360
Sometimes,

449
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,730
I hate you too.

450
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,020
Doctor.

451
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,940
Doctor, why do you hate me?

452
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,070
What have I done that has made you unhappy?

453
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:27,880
Just tell me.

454
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:34,730
Nothing.

455
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,860
You didn't do anything.

456
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,790
-Then why did you...
-Because you didn't do anything.

457
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,480
You don't know.

458
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,740
You don't understand.

459
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,920
Even though I've made it so obvious...

460
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,350
What are you talking about?

461
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,910
I like you.

462
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,690
What did you say?

463
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,110
I like you.

464
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,370
I've liked you since freshman year.

465
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,160
I've liked you for 7 years.

466
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:52,400
I...

467
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,870
I never knew.

468
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,010
You don't know?

469
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,100
It's because you never cared about me.

470
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,270
I know

471
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,380
the hope is slim.

472
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,970
All I can do is dream.

473
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,550
To have a daydream.

474
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,720
I don't want anything from you.

475
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,300
You don't have to give me an answer.

476
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,470
But from now on,

477
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,800
there might be no reason for us to meet again.

478
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,490
Doctor.

479
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,710
I'm fine.

480
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,930
I'm fine.

481
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:26,570
I felt relieved that I could

482
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:31,820
at least get it off my chest.

483
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,030
Thank you

484
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,790
for making this heart

485
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,540
happy for several years.

486
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,400
Bye.

487
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:19,020
What are you doing?

488
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,650
I don't know what love is,

489
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,280
and I don't understand what love is.

490
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,960
But when you said goodbye to me,

491
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,050
I felt terrible.

492
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:04,550
Don't say goodbye to me again, okay?

493
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,210
But you don't like me.

494
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:24,840
I don't know.

495
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,180
But I won't let you and me

496
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:32,110
just end like this.

497
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:40,620
♫Can you only look at me?♫

498
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,670
Just wait a little longer, Tharn.

499
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:36,500
Are you going this week too?

500
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:38,830
Yes.

501
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:41,580
Don't stop me, Brother Thorn.

502
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:44,390
Even though you're so exhausted?

503
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,410
What?

504
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:47,630
This is my happiness.

505
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,470
And next week, Type will return to normal life.

506
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,080
Then are you ready for this week?

507
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,460
Mom has prepared the stuff for me.

508
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,130
I got off work early, so I came back to get it myself.

509
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,380
I don't think I need it.

510
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:13,680
Good luck, bro.

511
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:43,300
Type.

512
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:47,970
Are you back?

513
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:50,960
What's wrong?

514
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,530
You're back.

515
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:58,090
You're really back, right?

516
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:00,710
Yes.

517
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,200
I'm back.

518
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,630
Who do you think I am?

519
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:12,970
You're back for me, Type.

520
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:15,540
You're back.

521
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:25,950
Thank you

522
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:28,810
for still waiting for me.

523
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:30,790
Mm-hmm.

524
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,130
Are you going to sleep like this?

525
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:46,620
Yes.

526
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,240
Come here.

527
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,490
-Tharn.
-Yes?

528
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,550
Did you buy a new TV?

529
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:05,580
Thanya bought it that day.

530
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,610
Where's the light? Did you change its location?

531
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:13,700
No. It's still there.

532
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:14,970
Well,

533
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,380
how about my black watch? Did you see it?

534
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:19,860
I couldn't find it.

535
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:21,780
Type.

536
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:23,800
If you feel shy,

537
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,260
I'll keep chatting with you

538
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,580
until you stop being shy, okay?

539
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,530
Um... I...

540
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:38,180
To be honest,

541
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,220
I don't know what to do.

542
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:43,500
I'm not used to it yet.

543
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:46,600
I don't know what I should do.

544
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,360
Then,

545
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,940
do you want me to stop?

546
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:06,030
No.

547
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:08,320
Don't stop.

548
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:29,110
Type, do you want some water?

549
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:30,990
I'll get it for you.

550
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:35,080
Okay.

551
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:36,730
Tharn.

552
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,120
Let's swear together, okay?

553
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,360
I talked to my parents.

554
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:55,360
I might keep staying in Bangkok.

555
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:59,450
Because you're here.

556
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,400
And they can understand me.

557
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:08,370
They also told me to listen to my heart.

558
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,110
That's why I chose to do it.

559
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,230
Because my heart

560
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:18,640
is here,

561
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:21,720
with you.

562
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,060
Are you

563
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,230
telling me...

564
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:31,080
Yes.

565
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,180
Let's get married.

566
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,930
Are you serious?

567
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:56,710

[One year later]

599
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,190
Thorn,

600
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:43,590
you will have your own family soon.

601
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:47,250
From now on, you'll be her pillar.

602
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,410
Yeah.

603
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:53,120
So handsome.

604
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:59,980
Remember the first day you wanted her to be your bride.

605
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:01,810
No matter what happens,

606
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,970
I hope you can think back of that day.

607
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:06,950
Do you understand, my eldest son?

608
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:15,310
I will try my best to build a family like you.

609
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,410
Can you beat me?

610
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,650
Of course. Right, son?

611
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,160
-Let's go. Let him prepare.
-Let's go.

612
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:30,560
Thank you, Mom and Dad. See you later.

613
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,510
Am I handsome enough?

614
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,830
Let me see. Turn around.

615
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,480
Nice tuxedo.

616
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,600
The tie too.

617
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:03,960
-But your face...
-Hey.

618
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:07,470
You're cool enough. Don't think too much.

619
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,470
I'm not very confident.

620
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:11,910
Brother Thorn,

621
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,620
you've been saying that for days. Be confident.

622
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,160
You'll do the same when it's your turn.

623
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:26,250
To be honest, if you weren't my brother,

624
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,320
I would have held the wedding before you.

625
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,240
Good luck, Thorn.

626
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:45,240
You too, bro.

627
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:46,660
Are you still nervous?

628
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,200
Relax.

629
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:53,370
I'll be by your side.

630
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,440
Thank you.

631
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:22,780
What's wrong?

632
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,270
I'm sad.

633
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:30,640
My brother held the wedding before me.

634
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:36,210
But Brother Thorn proposed earlier than you.

635
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:38,800
But you and I

636
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:41,750
fell in love earlier than them.

637
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,160
I miss you when you were wearing a hat.

638
00:57:58,130 --> 00:57:59,460
Don't make fun of me.

639
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:03,220
You wore a hat for months before.

640
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:07,040
Why are you so shy about it? You're so cute.

641
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,630
Then who's a crybaby?

642
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:13,320
He cried like a dog after being surprised by me.

643
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:20,730
Then who said Gil had a crush on me?

644
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:27,730
Who knew your friend would flirt with girls using your face?

645
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:34,740
-Right.
-Yes?

646
00:58:35,330 --> 00:58:36,650
Our wedding...

647
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:39,670
Don't make it so grand.

648
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:42,830
Well...

649
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,010
I'm not sure about this.

650
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:47,950
Tharn.

651
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:19,160
Fine, do whatever you want.

652
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,270
I already promised you that day, right?

653
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,080
You also agreed

654
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:32,480
to be with me forever.

655
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:35,940
Yes.

656
