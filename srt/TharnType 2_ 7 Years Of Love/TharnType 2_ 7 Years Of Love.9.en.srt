I'm not throwing tantrums.

Didn't you say you have something to tell me this morning?

It's already noon.

What do you want?

149
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,870
I should ask you this question.

150
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,790
What was wrong with you last night?

151
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,180
Why did you drag me out? Why were you mad at me?

152
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,200
I didn't do anything wrong.

153
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,350
How could you say you didn't do anything wrong?

154
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,610
When will you realize what you did is wrong?

155
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,400
What did I do wrong?

156
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,090
Do you really want me to tell you?

157
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,330
I didn't discipline you about

158
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,560
who you slept with and flirted with before.

159
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,420
But it's different this time.

160
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,780
I've reminded you. The person you're messing with has a boyfriend.

161
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,850
You're also well aware that he has a boyfriend.

162
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,530
What did you do?

163
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,790
I can't stand watching my friend do this.

164

You can stop now, Fiat.

What if I don't?

166
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,180

00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,010
Can you be my husband instead of him?

170
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,050
No?

171
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,730
I can be your husband. Can you stop messing around?

172
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,870
That day,

173
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,660
I shouldn't have promised you that

174
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,130
I will be with you forever.

175
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,570
I shouldn't have...

176
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,830
Why don't you turn around and look at the person around you?

177
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:51,370
♫I want you to know everything hidden in my heart♫

178
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:56,220
♫If you try to become me♫

179
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,560
♫You'll understand♫

180
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:05,660
♫Try to be the one who sees you crying every time♫

181
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,870
♫I hold it in until you turn around♫

182
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,800
♫Only then will I let my tears fall♫

183
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,100
Darn it.

184
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,190
Tharn, what took you so long to pick up my call?

185
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:07,430
I miss you so much.

186
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,000
Hello, Brother Type.

187
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,859
What's the matter? I'm not feeling well.

188
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,920
Let's talk next time.

189
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,130
Wait.

190
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,630
Wait.

191
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,640
Tharn.

192
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,230
I'm tired.

193
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,810
I have a headache.

194
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,970
I miss you.

195
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,140
Why has it been so quiet these days?

196
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,660
I can't hear anyone's voice.

197
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,840
Could it be...

198
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,950
Did I hear from the wrong place?

199
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,380
What are you doing?

200
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,660
Why are you scared?

201
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,420
Haven't you ever met someone who was disappointed

202
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,560
because his dream was shattered?

203
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,430
Calm down. Calm down.

204
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,840
Calm down. Calm down.

205
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,150
Don't cry now. I can't hear them.

206
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,070
You have to comfort me. I'm crying.

207
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,520
I'm comforting you.

208
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,890
I'm comforting you. I'm comforting you.

209
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,530
You have to comfort me.

210
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,080
-I'm comforting you.
-Please comfort me first.

211
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,870
What are you doing?

212
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,350
-Comfort me.
-I'm comforting you.

213
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,010
No, no.

214
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:08,790
Tharn.

215
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,810
Tharn.

216
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,230
-What are you doing?
-What?

217
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,020
I was knocking and calling you just now. But you didn't hear me.

218
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,160
I was busy with work.

219
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,020
What can I do for you?

220
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,130
I know you're working. I know you want to go back to Bangkok as soon as possible.

221
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,700
But what's wrong with you? You turned off your phone and didn't answer my calls.

222
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,050
-Turning off my phone?
-I couldn't reach you.

223
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,080
I think it ran out of battery.

224
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,900
I'm sorry. What can I do for you?

225
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,880
Nothing.

226
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,480
How far did you get with the song you're writing for your wife?

227
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,100
What?

228
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,690
I've been living with you and eating with you for over a week.

229
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,110
How come I didn't know you used your bedtime to write songs for your wife?

230
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,790
I want to marry him as soon as possible,

231
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,120
but he hasn't agreed yet.

232
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,420
What? Are you going to show off your wife to me again?

233
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,940
No, he called me.

234
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,180
I'll call him back first.

235
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,680
Hello?

236
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,270
Type, did you just get up?

237
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,300
Why do you sound so weird?

238
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,400
I called you. Why didn't you answer my calls?

239
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,410
You sound hoarse, Type.

240
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,970
Are you not feeling well?

241
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,410
No. Can't I act cute to you?

242
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,530
You can act cute to me at any time.

243
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,540
But you have to tell me what's wrong with you.

244
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,110
I have a headache.

245
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,390
And then?

246
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,900
I'm going crazy with a headache. I seem to have a fever

247
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,410
Then...

248
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,020
Haven't you seen a doctor yet?

249
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:49,140
Not yet, but I'm fine. I'll be fine after taking the medicine.

250
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,280
No, Type. You need to see a doctor.

251
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,060
I'll go back to Bangkok.

252
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,720
No, I just have a headache and a fever.

253
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,380
Do you think I can't take care of myself?

254
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,710
If I leave now, I should be there in the morning.

255
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,150
I will let Phu take care of you first, OK?

256
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,820
No need.

257
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,910
I called you because...

258
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,680
I miss you.

259
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,440
But you're sick, Type.

260
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,890
Then finish your work as soon as possible and come back to me.

261
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,380
I want to go back to you now, Type.

262
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,480
I miss you.

263
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,080
Okay.

264
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,360
Hey, friend.

265
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,960
Can you tell me what happened to you?

266
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,390
I'm going back to Bangkok.

267
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,930
Hey, then we will be done.

268
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,910
You can't go back now.

269
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,680
The work is almost done. Let's finish it first.

270
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,150
-Why can't I go back now?
-Hey.

271
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,940
Because I know you're a responsible person.

272
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,480
Finish your work first.

273
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,940
Do you think your boyfriend will be happy for you if you go back now?

274
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,490
Calm down.

275
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,420
As I heard just now...

276
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,860
Didn't your boyfriend tell you not to go back?

277
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,770
Phu.

278
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,600
I have something I want you to help with.

279
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,380
What is it?

280
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,720
Got it. Why did you press so many times? I have a headache.

281
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,330
Hello, Brother Type.

282
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,490
What are you doing here?

283
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,200
I heard someone was sick,

284
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,680
so I bought him some hot porridge.

285
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:55,240
I didn't ask you to buy it. Go home. I'm going to sleep.

286
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,010
I didn't mean to disturb you, Type.

287
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,080
I'm really here to visit you.

288
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:15,990
Brother Type.

289
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,170
Are you okay?

290
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,790
Hey, you're sweating profusely.

291
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,770
Have you taken your medicine?

292
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,620
I'm fine. I'm sorry.

293
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,020
You don't need to apologize.

294
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,140
Where is your room?

295
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,630
I think you need some rest.

296
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,450
Watch your knees.

297
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,890
My knees are much better.

298
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,240
I'm just holding you. It's okay.

299
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,510
My room is here.

300
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,130
Be careful.

301
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,120
By the way, I'll use your kitchen to get you some porridge.

302
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,010
You need to eat something before you take your medicine.

303
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,850
I'm sorry.

304
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,040
But I like Brother Type too.

305
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,240
You are still worried about my knees

306
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,520
even when you're sick.

307
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:45,880
Then, is there anything wrong

308
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,790
with me liking you?

309
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,050
Brother Type, are you here?

310
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,960
Who are you?

311
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,430
How did you get in?

312
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,000
I have the room card.

313
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,010
Who are you? How did you get in?

314
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,060
Where did you get the room card?

315
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,350
I'm Brother Type's younger brother.

316
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,540
Who are you?

317
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,970
His biological brother?

318
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,670
I'm not his biological brother.

319
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,530
When can I know who you are?

320
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,650
So you are this kind of brother.

321
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,290
This kind of...

322
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,440
I didn't expect Brother Type to like this kind of man.

323
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,550
What kind is this kind?

324
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,440
-Where's Brother Type?
-He's asleep.

325
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,110
Can't I go in and see him when he is asleep?

326
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,530
If you're still sober, you should know that

327
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,460
you shouldn't disturb the patient.

328
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,670
Then since you disturbed Type, you are not sober.

329
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,660
No wonder you wouldn't answer my questions.

330
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,760
So you're not sober.

331
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,980
Why should I answer you?

332
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,980
We're both here for the same purpose, right?

333
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,450
Let's get straight to the point.

334
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:48,410
You're here because Brother Type's boyfriend isn't here. Right?

335
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,150
Yes. I came here because his boyfriend is not here.

336
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,400
At first, I didn't expect Brother Type to like this kind of man.

337
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:03,100
When his boyfriend wasn't around, he asked someone else to come to him.

338
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,550
But the more I realize it's like this...

339
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,470
The thing will be much easier.

340
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,790
I don't know what you're talking about.

341
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,070
But I think you should go back.

342
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,670
I need to take care of the patient.

343
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,210
You came later than me.

344
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:24,050
But I was called here. At least, I have the room card.

345
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,620
Then who are you?

346
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:31,450
Did you break in illegally? I will call the police.

347
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,980
What will you say? Who are you?

348
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,560
You might have been called here today,

349
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,090
but don't think it'll be you again next time.

350
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,060
At least,

351
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,090
I don't think I lost at all.

352
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:13,210
What was he talking about? I don't even understand.

353
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,320
What?

354
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:21,600
Was he

355
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,230
scolding me just now?

356
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,219
Cirrus.

357
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:41,550
You're here. How's Brother Type?

358
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,679
Cirrus, please comfort me.

359
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,500
What's wrong, Phu?

360
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,880
Please comfort me.

361
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:51,520
Okay, good boy. Come here.

362
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:53,550
Sit down slowly.

363
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,680
I was scolded.

364
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,480
I realized it later.

365
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,980
How can I comfort you?

366
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,600
I don't know. You have to comfort me.

367
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:19,350
By the way, he also said that I look like this, but Type still wants me.

368
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,130
Who said that?

369
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,550
Are you defending me against injustice?

370
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,750
Phu.

371
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,110
Do you think I'm cute?

372
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,410
Yes.

373
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:50,960
♫I look up to the sky, but I can't see you when I turn back♫

374
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,290
Then I'll be in a good mood

375
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,340
because you said I'm cute.

376
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,090
♫I'll definitely be anxious♫

377
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,670
Is this all?

378
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,310
Yes, I am happy.

379
00:35:55,090 --> 00:36:01,730
♫You are my whole world, you know?♫

380
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,510
You turned happy so fast.

381
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:00,640
Yes.

382
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:06,880
♫It'll be bad if you're gone♫

383
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,510
Are you feeling better?

384
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:06,790
Yes.

385
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,760
I didn't dare to go in and wake you up because you were still asleep.

386
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,520
There's porridge in the fridge.

387
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,120
Take your medicine if you wake up.

388
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,870
[Tharn]

389
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,780
Hello?

390
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,340
[How are you?]

391
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,230
Much better.

392
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:08,560
By the way, Tharn. Why does Phu have the key to our house?

393
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,410
[Oh. I gave it to him before I came here.]

394
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,550
[If something happens, he can help me check on you.]

395
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,610
Do you have to keep an eye on me?

396
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:24,340
[No, you had a conflict with your boss then. I was just worried about you.]

397
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:29,000
OK. I was just kidding. I haven't said anything yet.

398
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,930
As for Phu, I'll thank him later.

399
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:38,370
He came yesterday, but I was unconscious.

400
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:43,810
[Aren't you going to ask me when I'll be back?]

401
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,000
When are you going to come back?

402
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,890
[Tomorrow.]

403
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,800
Really?

404
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,510
[Yes. I'm so happy to hear your voice so excited.]

405
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,470
[Do you miss me?]

406
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,150
Yes.

407
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:02,530
I miss you so much that I've recovered. Are you satisfied?

408
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,080
Well,

409
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,670
what time are you coming back?

410
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,230
[I will be back on time for dinner with you.]

411
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,600
Then I need to go out and buy something quickly.

412
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,510
Because there's nothing to eat here.

413
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,720
Okay, I can go to the hospital on my way.

414
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,700
[What will you do there?]

415
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,700
I will go there to pack my things.

416
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:32,070
[Call me if you can't stand it.]

417
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,870
OK, I'm fine.

418
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,030
[I don't believe you.]

419
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,150
Don't believe me if you don't.

420
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,330
I'm hanging up. I'm going to take a shower.

421
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,040
I stink after sleeping for days.

422
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:07,980
[Phu, thank you for taking care of Type for me.]

423
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:18,310
[You are welcome, Brother Tharn. I'll visit him again after school.]

424
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:22,800
[No need.]

425
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,660
[Oh, why?]

426
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:35,280
[I'm in Bangkok right now. I'll go back to see him myself later.]

427
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,900
What type do you want?

428
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:44,700
I want a simple and elegant wedding ring.

429
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,850
Okay, let me recommend to you.

430
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,050
This one.

431
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:53,200
It's square. There's a diamond.

432
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,910
-It doesn't look flamboyant or dull. It's elegant.
-Okay.

433
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,740
-And this one is broad.
-Okay.

434
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,790
This one has a diamond set by prongs.

435
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:06,660
It's easy to wear too.

436
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,830
-Can I try it?
-Yes.

437
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,600
You can try it on.

438
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,440
Do you like it?

439
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,610
Don't quit and disappear.

440
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,460
Come to me often.

441
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:30,290
If I show up in the hospital again... That means I'm sick.

442
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,610
That's not what I meant.

443
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,520
I was just kidding.

444
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:39,150
Call me if you miss me.

445
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,500
If I miss you, I have to call you first.

446
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,730
You don't even want to contact me. Is that the case?

447
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:51,900
I'm afraid that calling others often may make someone jealous.

448
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,150
I can tell you're showing off your husband.

449
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,950
Because he's worth me showing off.

450
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,960
I won't talk to you. I have to go to work.

451
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:05,200
There is a lot of work. Especially after someone quitted...

452
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,120
Okay, Sister. I'll call you.

453
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,910
-Don't go back on your word.
-Okay.

454
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,660
-Bye.
-Bye.

455
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,900
Doctor, I'm glad you're here. I have something I want to talk to you about.

456
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,500
Sure, but give me five minutes.

457
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:32,670
Anyway, thank you for helping me.

458
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:37,440
I haven't done anything worth your thank yet.

459
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,790
Just by helping to cover up the incident where I hit that guy,

460
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,240
you have already been a great help to me.

461
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,020
I talked to Sister Teng.

462
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,770
I was supposed to be investigated by the committee, right?

463
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:54,130
If you weren't behind it, who would have done it?

464
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,780
Don't say I'm behind it.

465
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,560
Actually, the dean originally wanted to handle this matter.

466
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,390
Anyway, thank you.

467
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:10,100
I really need to accept your gratitude, right?

468
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,450
Yes, take it.

469
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:19,460
I feel so lucky to have Champ as my friend.

470
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,550
What does it have to do with him?

471
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,950
You tried so hard to help me. Wasn't it because I'm Champ's friend?

472
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,410
No, no.

473
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,510
Here you are.

474
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,330
Take it.

475
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:42,890
Hey.

476
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,330
Thank you.

477
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,360
It is simple, right?

478
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:57,860
Champ is like this bottle of water.

479
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:03,390
You want to tell me...

480
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:08,550
If you want Champ to know, you need to tell him directly.

481
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:12,490
Ask him directly if he wants to accept your love.

482
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,710
Look. It's so easy. It is just like me giving you the bottle of water.

483
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:21,790
If you keep beating around the bush, he will never know it.

484
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,250
But how could Champ accept me

485
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:30,930
as easily as you gave me this bottle of water?

486
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,160
Have you tried it?

487
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,020
How do you know it if you haven't tried it?

488
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:42,530
OK.

489
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,970
Thank you anyway.

490
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:48,880
Good luck.

491
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:53,990
Good luck too.

492
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:06,720
Doctor, if Champ rejects you, tell me right away.

493
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,740
I'll hit his head. How dare he ignore a good person like you?

494
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,160
Okay.

495
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:20,290
Then I hope you don't have to hit his head.

496
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:21,880
Okay.

497
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,110
What's wrong, Fiat?

498
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:45,910
-I can't find the pen.
-What?

499
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,530
It's just a pen. Buy another one.

500
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,580
That's different.

501
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,540
Then look for it. It won't go anywhere.

502
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:00,170
Have you found it?

503
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,800
Leo, this way.

504
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:11,620
Oh.

505
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:14,850
Didn't he see us?

506
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,270
He didn't see me on purpose.

507
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:32,230
Marry me

508
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:34,600
♫I will always be here♫

509
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,730
♫I promise not to leave♫

510
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:41,030
♫Please believe that this heart remains unchanged♫

511

[Super Breakdown]

512
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:43,250
[Hey, how is Dr. Thiti?
I saw Type pack up today.]

513
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,850
[Very miserable.]

514
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:48,330
[He'll be investigated by the committee.]

515
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:50,430
[Then do you know why he hates Type so much?]

516
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:53,370
[His lover in pediatrics was rejected by Type.]

517
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:56,310
[Oh, my. But he made Type look really bad.]

518
00:48:56,310 --> 00:49:00,300
[Poor him. We shouldn't have listened to one side of the story.]

519
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,320
[Khunpol: Then don't do it again.]

520
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,360
[Khunpol: Don't imagine it yourselves before knowing the facts.]

521
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,300
[Khunpol: I hope this won't happen again.]

522
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,350
[Khunpol leaves the group chat.]

523
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:14,870
[Has the doctor gone out?]

524
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:17,600
[Yes.]

525
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,260
[Did you know about the doctor? Someone often comes to pick him up.]

526
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,870
[I don't want to gossip, but we have to talk about this.]
