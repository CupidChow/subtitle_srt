00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,170
What are you doing?

5
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,190
Oh, you wanted to be romantic,

6
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,740
but you ruined it, right?

7
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,990
Don't be upset.

8
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,829
I'm on my holiday, but I still have to get up early for you.

9
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,030
I wanted to do something for you

10
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,540
because you aren't working today.

11
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,920
And blow up the house?

12
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,750
I won't. I was baking a cake.

13
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:45,780
Oh, never know you'll make me a cake.

14
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,010
Yes, as you can see.

15
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,540
But what I saw was you trying to blow up the house.

16
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,590
-And...
-And what?

17
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,650
I think

18
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,830
you'd better do something else that you're good at.

19
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,460
It's your precious holiday.

20
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,750
I was going to let you take a good rest at first.

21
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,070
I didn't ask you to do that.

22
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,930
You eat like a child, it's all over your mouth.

23
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,820
Wipe it properly.

24
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,060
Can you stop nagging?

25
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,190
That's how I always eat.

26
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,730
And you always ask me to wipe your mouth.

27
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,150
Then clean it for me.

28
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,100
By the way, have you finished talking with your mom?

29
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,860
That's why you have time to talk to me?

30
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,100
Yes.

31
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,340
I told her.

32
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,310
I came back because of your knee.

33
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,800
What?

34
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,630
Then she'll blame me for your return.

35
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,409
My reputation as a "good son" has been ruined.

36
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,990
No.

37
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,130
I should call your mom

38
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,940
and tell her it was your own decision to come back.

39
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,660
You don't have to call her.

40
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,740
Your position as the "good son" is still there.

41
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,090
I told her

42
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,990
that I came back because I found out from my teammates.

43
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,630
If she blames you,

44
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,440
it's because you didn't tell her when you were in the hospital, okay?

45
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,200
She almost booked the earliest flight back

46
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,290
when she knew that you were in the hospital.

47
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,350
But I told her that you're much better now.

48
00:06:59,150 --> 00:06:59,990
Oh.

49
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,470
Looks like

50
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,960
I have to call her tonight and say I love her.

51
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,940
Whatever.

52
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,560
At this point, I don't know whose mother she is.

53
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,520
Oh, I almost forgot.

54
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,530
This is from my teammate.

55
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,080
Hey, aren't these the shoes I wanted?

56
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,570
They're on sale, and they're just around here.

57
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,230
Can you take me there, please?

58
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,310
Your knee hasn't recovered yet.

59
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,780
Do you want to make it worse?

60
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,670
Choose the one you want.

61
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,770
I'll look for it.

62
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,230
No, I want to choose it myself.

63
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,830
You're injured. You should more careful.

64
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,810
What if I don't like what you pick?

65
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,260
Please, Leo, let me go.

66
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,850
Please? Please?

67
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:07,740
Alright.

68
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,010
Don't complain to me later.

69
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,370
I promise I won't.

70
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,090
Look into my eyes.

71
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,540
Okay, Leo?

72
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,670
Please take me with you, please.

73
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,260
Don't you feel bad for me?

74
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,890
I'll get the car, come out after you finish it.

75
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,610
I love you the most in the world.

76
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,070
You love whoever can satisfy you.

77
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,480
I'm hungry.

78
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,850
Well,

79
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,290
I'll cook something for you.

80
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,810
What do you want to eat?

81
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,670
I said I'm hungry.

82
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,440
I wanted to invite you to eat out with me.

83
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,080
Do you want to go on a date?

84
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,460
It's rare for you to invite me on a date.

85
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,090
Of course I have to go.

86
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,240
Go take a shower first.

87
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,310
I'll take a shower there.

88
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,370
Okay.

89
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,020
Hurry up.

90
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,630
Okay.

91
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,980
Or do you want to shower with me?

92
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,270
Stop seducing me, Type.

93
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,900
I'm really hungry.

94
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,900
Go take a shower quickly.

95
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,630
I'm going to take a shower.

96
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,700
Okay.

97
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,000
-Tharn.
-Yes.

98
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,080
Is this where Thorn proposed to Ahn?

99
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,350
Yes.

100
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,950
That's why I brought you here.

101
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,140
Tharn.

102
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,430
My staff texted me. You can read it.

103
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,350
A teacher asked for a discount on the guitar string and bass string.

104
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,530
That's why my employee texted me and asked me how much of a discount should be given.

105
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,790
I didn't say anything.

106
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,220
But I want to tell you,

107
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,410
so that you can be at ease.

108
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,750
Do whatever you want.

109
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,190
Tell me about your website. How's it going?

110
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,990
My website?

111
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,220
It's been quite good recently.

112
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,580
Many people like shopping online nowadays.

113
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,990
So I got more orders.

114
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,010
I just hired a new admin to monitor the website.

115
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,490
And I plan to open a physical store soon.

116
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,520
I'm looking at the location now.

117
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,960
Isn't it a bit rushed?

118
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,120
Don't forget that you just started your online business.

119
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,190
What should you do

120
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,590
if it only does well for a while?

121
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,610
Are you worried about me?

122
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,230
I've studied the market.

123
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,960
If the sales are bad,

124
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,610
I'll use the physical store to store the goods.

125
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,260
In this way, I don't need to put it in my dad's warehouse.

126
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,390
I don't want to bother him.

127
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,030
Even so,

128
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,020
you think too far ahead.

129
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,860
Think about it.

130
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,780
Take your time. Don't rush.

131
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,610
I'm not.

132
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,800
I'm just anxious.

133
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:39,530
I hope to provide you with a stable and secure life.

134
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,250
Besides,

135
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,680
I want to take care of you as much as I can.

136
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,090
I can work. I can take care of myself.

137
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,970
And I can take care of you too.

138
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,360
To be honest, maybe you're not sure about it now.

139
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,410
But in the future,

140
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:29,100
can you put on our wedding ring?

141
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,810
Dream on.

142
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,420
Finish your meal and pay the bill.

143
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,720
We have to buy some household stuff later.

144
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,740
Eat. It tastes good.

145
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,030
Okay.

146
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,640
Shopping together like this

147
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,330
reminds me of our first year.

148
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,430
Why are you recalling the past now?

149
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,910
I begged you for a long time

150
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,450
to ask you out at that time.

151
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,500
Look at you now.

152
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,790
You've become the financial director of our family.

153
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,160
If I'm not in charge,

154
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,200
you would simply spend without a second thought.

155
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,860
I haven't counted

156
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,500
the money you spent treating your colleagues to dinner yet.

157
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,660
I know you're rich,

158
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,670
but you need to learn to save money, too.

159
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,080
That's why I can't live without you.

160
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,200
Screw you. Stop flirting.

161
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,140
I've lost count of how many times you've succeeded.

162
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,190
I'm tired, Type.

163
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,170
I'll put the stuff in the car first.

164
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,800
And I'll come back to flirt with you later, okay?

165
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,150
Okay. Come back soon.

166
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,930
Damn it, when are you going to get over the love-sick phase?

167
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,630
We've been together for years.

168
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,910
I'll leave this with you.

169
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,500
I need to use the toilet.

170
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,260
Come back here after you're done.

171
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,460
Hurry up, Leo.

172
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,700
It's going to sell out.

173
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,810
Slow down. Mind your knee.

174
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,010
I told you, I'm afraid that it'll sell out.

175
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,360
Didn't you say today was the last day of the promotion?

176
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,120
But I told you

177
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,300
that I can help you buy it.

178
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,680
Why do you still insist on coming together?

179
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,620
I'm afraid that you would pick the wrong one.

180
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,820
So troublesome.

181
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,670
So what?

182
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,180
Don't you love me anymore?

183
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,790
-Brother Type. Brother Type.
-It's you.

184
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,610
Are you shopping?

185
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,360
I'm here to buy something.

186
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:05,890
How's your knee? Are you okay to be here?

187
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:09,589
Oh, I feel much better.

188
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,780
Thank you for your advice.

189
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,950
I've reflected on myself.

190
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:23,390
I have to at least heal my knee for myself.

191
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,780
I'm glad you think that way.

192
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,770
Don't forget to come for rehabilitation practices at the time we agreed on.

193
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:30,800
Okay.

194
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,000
Well, Brother Type, this is Leo.

195
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:38,730
My friend.

196
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,880
Leo, this is Brother Type.

197
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,220
I told you. He's in charge of my rehabilitation.

198
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,010
Hello.

199
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,240
Take care of your friend.

200
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,540
Don't let him walk too far.

201
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,110
I just walked a bit, brother.

202
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,650
I have to go. Goodbye.

203
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,110
Brother Type, I'll text you later.

204
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,680
Text me when you have something important.

205
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,750
Okay.

206
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,420
Brother Type is cute, right?

207
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,200
But he's too cold.

208
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,350
I'm so handsome, but he shows no interest in me.

209
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,630
What do you think?

210
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,850
Leo, where are you going?

211
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,810
You said you were worried about my knee.

212
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,180
Who were those two guys?

213
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,680
A patient from the hospital.

214
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,600
I ran into him, so I asked him about his injury.

215
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,850
Really?

216
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,540
So stop looking at them.

217
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,630
If not, your eyes are going to meet.

218
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,810
And they'll fall for your charm again.

219
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,890
I'm sick of being jealous.

220
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,630
Who is the charming one,  actually?

221
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,840
Have you realized?

222
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,550
You're the only one who likes me because you're out of your mind.

223
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,650
How I wish I were the only one.

224
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,710
Who else could it be?

225
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,940
Let's go. Aren't you going to buy books?

226
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,720
-Let's go.
-Okay.

227
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,820
Who was that?

228
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,060
-Which one?
-The guy you just saw.

229
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,240
Are you deaf or forgetful?

230
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,500
I told you.

231
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,060
He's in charge of my rehabilitation at the hospital.

232
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,460
I know that.

233
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,040
But your gaze tells that he's more than that.

234
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,860
Why? What's with my gaze?

235
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,310
I can tell what you're thinking, okay?

236
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,730
Take it easy.

237
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,660
Look at your friend's face.

238
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,540
People like me

239
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,520
never fail to get what I want,

240
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,200
except for one thing.

241
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,160
That you'll never stop whining at me.

242
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:22,800
Oh, right.

243
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,700
Hurry up and pick one for me. My knees are starting to hurt.

244
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,880
Didn't I tell you not to complain?

245
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,660
Alright.

246
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,120
Which pair do you want?

247
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,090
I want this.

248
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,090
-This pair?
-No, lower.

249
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:46,870
This one?

250
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,620
No, that one.

251
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,500
-This?
-Yes. Yes.

252
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,880
What do you think? Do you like it?

253
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,350
It's light. It'll be comfortable.

254
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,560
-Can you wear this size?
-I can.

255
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,280
Try it.

256
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,320
How is it?

257
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:43,660
Pretty good.

258
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,350
Is it comfortable?

259
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,710
Do I look good?

260
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,730
You're really...

261
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,080
[Restaurant No. 5]

262
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,510
-What are you doing here, doctor?
-Well...

263
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,790
Well, I...

264
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,050
How did you get here? Are you alone?

265
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,450
I...

266
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,980
I didn't come here for you.

267
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,020
I... I just got lost.

268
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,350
Yes, I got lost.

269
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,290
Oh, I didn't say anything.

270
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,250
Did something happen?

271
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,260
No, I'm fine.

272
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,380
I really got lost.

273
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,380
Yeah, I know.

274
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,920
If you don't believe me, I can explain.

275
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,010
I took the wrong turn and...

276
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,680
I remember... I remember...

277
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,500
Your shop happens to be nearby.

278
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,880
So I...

279
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,840
I...

280
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,650
I just remembered that your shop was nearby.

281
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,830
Then when I realized it...

282
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,470
When I realized it,

283
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,760
I was already in front of your shop.

284
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,420
Oh, I see.

285
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,480
Look.

286
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,920
Hey, it really worked, doctor.

287
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,070
Are other staff coming?

288
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,140
Did you invite anyone else?

289
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:50,290
Well...

290
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:51,700
You...

291
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,250
You're too close to me, Champ.

292
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,430
Really?

293
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:57,790
I'm sorry.

294
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,170
This is how I get along with my friends.

295
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,530
It's okay.

296
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,860
Why? Are you shy?

297
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,620
You're still so shy.

298
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,560
You're so cute.

299
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,440
-Since you're here, let's get inside.
-Hey.

300
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,550
I... I told you I took the wrong turn.

301
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,640
Since you came to my shop by mistake,

302
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,860
I'll take you to something delicious. Let's go.

303
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,380
Here, my signature dish.

304
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,020
Chicken Breast with Super Herbal Sauce.

305
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,340
Do you know how many herbs

306
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,090
I've studied for this dish?

307
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,740
If I didn't come up with this dish,

308
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,780
I would sell herbs instead.

309
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,730
That's funny.

310
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,880
Who would have thought someone like me

311
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,140
would open a restaurant.? Not even I.

312
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,740
Doctor.

313
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,440
Doctor.

314
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,680
Are you okay? Are you sleep deprived?

315
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,120
I'm sure you stayed up all night reading again.

316
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,120
Speaking of this,

317
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,220
I suddenly remembered when we were in our first year.

318
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,440
You always read at night.

319
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,230
And I can't sleep because of you.

320
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,010
Do you know that

321
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,310
I almost changed rooms with Type that time?

322
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:38,060
Thankfully, there's Tharn.

323
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,060
I found someone to switch rooms with you.

324
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:47,510
Who?

325
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,990
Hey, Champ! This way! Come here!

326
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,560
What's wrong, No?

327
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,060
This is the guy who wants to change rooms with you.

328
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,690
He's the only one who's willing to change rooms with you.

329
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,210
Yes, I was looking for someone to change rooms too.

330
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,010
It's not because my roommate is not good,

331
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,310
but because he studies medicine.

332
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,560
I couldn't sleep because he was up studying all night.

333
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,870
So I want to change rooms with someone.

334
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,090
You can discuss it yourselves.

335
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,450
Go to the Student Dormitory Service Centre later.

336
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,100
I won't change.

337
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,880
Thank you for offering to change rooms with me.

338
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,650
But my roommate and I still have things to do.

339
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,210
Sorry for wasting your time.

340
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,470
It's okay. Tell me if you want to change later.

341
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,750
Bye.

342
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,160
Guess who's the reason I can't focus on reading?

343
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,970
Who are you referring to?

344
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,700
Nothing.

345
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,570
Kun, what are you doing?

346
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,790
Why do you look so serious?

347
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,900
I'm preparing for the lab test this afternoon.

348
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,300
I'm not very confident.

349
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,530
You're kidding. How are you not confident?

350
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,970
Because I'm not.

351
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:25,330
Papeng, I think Champ has been trolling on me lately.

352
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,010
Champ? Your roommate?

353
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,380
Why? Did he do something to you?

354
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,270
He didn't do anything.

355
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,210
-Oh.
-Actually,

356
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,090
It's not entirely his fault.

357
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,970
It's mostly my fault.

358
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,910
Recently,

359
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,800
Champ likes to walk naked without his top in the room.

360
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,590
I can't focus on reading.

361
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,350
I have to wait until Champ falls asleep,

362
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,540
then only I can focus on reading.

363
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,600
And then?

364
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,810
I mean, it's summer time.

365
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:17,300
So Champ always walks in the room in his underwear.

366
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,400
And I feel so awkward.

367
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,190
I don't know what to do.

368
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,350
Not to mention reading,

369
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:34,080
forcing myself to not look at Champ

370
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,100
is way harder than focusing on reading.

371
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,690
Did he make you shy?

372
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,790
I'm not.

373
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,410
My cutie pie.

374
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,890
What should I do, Papeng?

375
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,700
I can't focus on reading at all.

376
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,890
It's okay.

377
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,650
Why are you laughing, doctor?

378
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,130
Nothing. I'm just

379
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,400
thinking about something.

380
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,960
Okay, then.

381
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,180
Try it and see if it tastes good.

382
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,390
I've been thinking about this recipe for a long time.

383
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,110
Then it must be delicious.

384
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,250
You...

385
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,660
You said it was delicious before you took a bite.

386
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,580
Try it first.

387
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,140
Okay.

388
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,700
I'll eat it then.

389
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,100
Hey.

390
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,580
It tastes good, Champ.

391
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,490
You seem to be in a good mood recently.

392
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:27,110
Maybe it's because Ahn agreed to my proposal.

393
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,430
I envy you.

394
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,750
Does that make you think about you and Type?

395
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,700
Yes, a little.

396
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,730
I don't know when he'll say yes.

397
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,360
Just like what Type said,

398
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,840
marriage is not a child's play.

399
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,100
Give him some time.

400
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:53,030
Brother, I've always been serious about Type.

401
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,240
I know.

402
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,660
But don't forget, Tharn.

403
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,190
Even though we can ignore what others think,

404
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,950
But Type is right.

405
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,780
Our society hasn't really accepted it yet.

406
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,550
Type must be worried about this.

407
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,410
And he's afraid that it'll affect dad and mom's reputation.

408
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,720
But I don't care.

409
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:23,420
No one in our family cares about this.

410
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,870
But he does.

411
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,790
He cares about you and our family.

412
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,380
Give him some time.

413
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,640
It's like I don't know him at all,

414
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,850
even though I know what he's thinking.

415
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,780
Okay, I can wait until he's ready.

416
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,470
Hang in there.

417
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,440
Excuse me, Mr. Thorn.

418
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,580
Mr Tharn.

419
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,640
I'm bringing you coffee and dessert.

420
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,620
Thank you.

421
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,640
I haven't asked you to come in yet. Get out.

422
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,340
Don't come in unless I tell you to.

423
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,270
Sorry, Mr. Thorn.

424
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,450
It's almost noon,

425
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,240
and I thought Mr. Tharn might be hungry.

426
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,310
So I brought some snacks here.

427
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,950
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

428
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,300
But if you need anything, Mr. Tharn,

429
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,060
you can call me anytime.

430
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,110
Okay.

431
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,090
I told you to leave. Please.

432
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,810
What made our Mr. Thorn Thara

433
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,410
so annoyed?

434
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:03,550
Anyone can tell that she's here to seduce you.

435
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,440
But I already have Type.

436
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,820
Don't forget that I don't like women.

437
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:16,410
I know, but I don't really like her.

438
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,010
She came in to seduce me before

439
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,350
until she found out that Ahn and I were getting married.

440
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,210
She probably thinks that you're still single.

441
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,750
So you're her new target.

442
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,890
If you don't like her,

443
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,350
why do you keep her here?

444
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,430
Speaking of work, she's actually a skilled worker.

445
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,710
Isn't it inappropriate to just fire her?

446
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,540
Are you done signing it?

447
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,530
Yes.

448
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,000
I'll go back now.

449
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,730
I'm going to buy dinner for Type tonight.

450
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,390
You've taken good care of him.

451
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,020
I hope he will be softhearted

452
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,900
and marry you soon.

453
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,910
I hope so too.

454
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,690
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

455
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:05,910
Call me if anything happens.

456
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,210
-Champ
-Yes?

457
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,310
I'll get going.

458
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,380
Thank you for being my guest today.

459
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,320
When I develop new menus later,

460
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,540
I'll let you try it.

461
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:36,650
Okay.

462
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:40,380
I'll come to you when I'm free.

463
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,270
But if you find a nice restaurant,

464
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,550
let me know.

465
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,100
So that I can try it,

466
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:48,020
and come back to improve my recipe.

467
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,210
Okay.

468
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,030
Well...

469
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,730
Can I ask you out?

470
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,780
Of course. Why not?

471
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,050
Look, you're getting cute again.

472
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,430
Are you going back to the hospital now?

473
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,690
Yes, I'm on duty.

474
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,430
Okay, go ahead, or you'll be late.

475
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:18,850
Hey.

476
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,020
Sorry, I forgot again.

477
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,590
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

478
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,950
Take care. Don't get lost this time.

479
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,330
But it would be nice to see you here often.

480
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,680
Okay, see you next time.

481
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:43,720
Okay.

482
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:25,810
[Get some rest. I'm worried about you.]

483
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:25,650
What are you filming?

484
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,060
I'm swearing my sovereignty over you.

485
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,520
Ridiculous.

486
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,730
Type.

487
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:49,560
Yes?

488
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,940
Well...

489
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:55,870
I'm

490
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,700
worried about you.

491
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,350
You always say you could hang on when you can't.

492
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,290
Because you want to work for a full year.

493
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,970
You know it.

494
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,860
So don't worry about me.

495
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,470
Anyway, if I really can't hold on,

496
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,650
I'll resign and let you support me.

497
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:31,990
Well,

498
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,400
resign now, then.

499
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:40,590
I have no problem supporting you.

500
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,700
You crazy.

501
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,190
Anyway, I still can handle it. Trust me.

502
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,460
If you want me to trust you,

503
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,520
stop your work,

504
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,330
and have dinner.

Excuse me, can I get 10% off?

517
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,900
Well, he just left.

518
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,010
He's smiling. That means...

519
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,590
We need to register as a member first.

520
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,300
Is this enough? I don't think so.

521
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,560
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-No.

522
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,190
Five minutes ago, you said

523
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,940
that you're full with your mom's cooking.

524
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,550
You're still the same after so many years.

525
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,260
You're still a big eater.

526
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,710
None of your business. Tell me about you.

527
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:01,320
Isn't your husband going to perform today?

528
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,250
Why are you here? You're not going to guard him?

529
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,030
-You jerk!
-You jerk.

530
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,460
Speaking of Tharn,

531
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,630
I think the older he gets, the more attractive he is.

532
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:15,610
Do you think so?

533
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,930
The older he gets, the sexier he is. Like a daddy.

534
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,560
Especially when he was on the sofa that day.

535
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,280
I remember it very clearly.

536
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,800
That moan was amazing.

537
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:29,150
-Damn it, I get hit on my right face.
-You talk too much.

538
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,330
I was just kidding, screw you.

539
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,610
Do you want me to order some dessert?

540
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,160
It can relieve stress, right?

541
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,920
You deserve a beating.

542
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,690
Even if he's charming like you said,

543
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,010
I can't stay by his side every day.

544
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:48,530
Why?

545
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,160
Last time,

546
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,730
I ran into Jeed when I went there.

547
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,400
She kept boozing me

548
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,900
until I was so dizzy that I almost got late for work the next day.

549
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,190
Did you say that you were dizzy because you were drunk?

550
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,330
-Of course.
-Oh.

551
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,210
I thought you had drunk...

552
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,610
Oops, I thought it was something else.

553
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,090
You're dirty-minded.

554
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:09,480
I can hear you even on the sofa, you jerk.

555
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,310
Okay, I'll stop.

556
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,850
Speaking of Tharn,

557
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,360
he's indeed charming.

558
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,030
A few days ago, when I went shopping,

559
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,780
I saw him walking with a woman.

560
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,100
-Oh, my...
-What?

561
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,020
Is he with a woman?

562
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,800
Did I spill the beans again?

563
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,130
I had it slip out again. What should I do?

564
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,810
Type.

565
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,890
Tell me everything.

566
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,330
No, I really can't tell you.

567
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,480
I really can't.

568
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,740
But if you takeaway 2 Brownies...

569
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,400
-I'll buy you five.
-Deal.

570
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,350
-Here's the thing. Listen carefully.
-You really only care about food.

571
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,350
You jerk, food is always number one.

572
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,680
Especially when it's free.

573
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,290
Here's the thing.

574
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:13,980
I planned to watch a movie a few days ago.

575
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,340
But it's not time yet.

576
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,790
So I went downstairs for dinner.

577
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,520
Then I suddenly wanted to use the toilet,

578
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,880
so I was walking to the toilet.

579
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,440
Then I glanced at the right,

580
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,810
I saw Tharn.

581
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,690
I thought it was Tharn.

582
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:27,680
Was it him? I'm not sure.

583
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,810
It must be Tharn. Okay, let's eat first.

584
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:30,590
Let's eat first.

585
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:35,490
-Tell me first.
-You messed up my hair, jerk.

586
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,560
Okay, leave it here. I can tell you first.

587
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,230
Well...

588
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,950
Every time I see Tharn, I see you, right?

589
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,840
You two come in set, you're always together.

590
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,800
Right, so I looked around when I saw him,

591
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,850
and didn't see you.

592
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:46,830
I was going to say hello to him,

593
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,750
and ask him if he saw you, or where you were.

594
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:52,980
It's like we were in a drama, you know?

595
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,960
The first step, we got nothing. And the second step,

596
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,850
the director said "stop".

597
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,170
It was stopped without any obstacles.

598
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:05,370
Then a woman just walked over.

599
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:06,700
I was shocked.

600
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,990
That woman was coming for Tharn.

601
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,880
She said hi, and talked to him, like they were close to each other.

602
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:16,300
And I thought it must be. Yes, it is.

603
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,830
But I can't hold on to my poop anymore,

604
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,470
so I went to the toilet in the end.

605
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:23,560
Otherwise, I would've followed them. I missed the chance.

606
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:25,200
What a pity.

607
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,030
Don't worry. I understand.

608
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:40,720
Five Brownie, takeaway.

609
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,210
-Go and order.
-Okay.

610
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:47,350
Excuse me, I want to order.

611
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:50,160
I'd like five Brownie, takeaway please.

612
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,820
It's on him. Thanks.

613

Eat up. Worrying won't help.

614

Most importantly, I've checked.

640
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:48,810
He is definitely single.

641

I've already missed Mr. Thorn.

642
