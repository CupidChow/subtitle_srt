[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,720
I won't do the surgery no matter what.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,890
Even if you all want me to do it...

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,640
I won't take the risk no matter what.

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,980
I can do as much rehabilitation treatment as I need,

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,330
and take as much medication as I need.

7
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,700
I won't do the surgery.

8
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,010
And I'm going back to play basketball.

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,660
Here's the thing, Sir.

10
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,880
Surgery is not scary.

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,520
Besides, you can have minimally invasive surgery according to your situation.

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,980
The wound will be small and you'll recover soon.

13
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,740
Surgery combined with your rehabilitation treatment,...

14
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,830
you will recover faster.

15
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,700
Can you guarantee

16
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,240
if I get surgery,

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,120
my knee will recover to the way they were before I was injured?

18
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,430
Sir, it's better to do it than not.

19
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,060
Because if you don't do surgery,

20
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,200
your torn ligament may not be able to recover.

21
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,540
More importantly, you may never be able to jump again.

22
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,960
You don't have to convince me.

23
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,700
I didn't believe it even if those doctors said so.

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,180
Why should I agree now?

25
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,690
I'm here for rehabilitation

26
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,060
to let my leg recover.

27
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,290
Just do what's within your responsibility.

28
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,130
Okay, if you've made up your mind...

29
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,600
Teng, did you call me?

30
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,600
As I said just now,

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,630
I will do rehabilitation treatment for you.

32
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,539
This is Thiwat, a doctor in sports rehabilitation.

33
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:34,940
He is responsible for your rehabilitation treatment.

34
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,430
You can call me Type.

35
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,780
Sports rehabilitation doctors are mainly responsible for

36
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,120
checking your physical condition

37
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,690
-and providing guidance...
-I don't want to know

38
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,400
what exercise rehabilitation doctors do.

39
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,180
What I want to know is when I can go back to play basketball.

40
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,289
But according to your situation,

41
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,870
if surgery and rehabilitation treatment are carried out simultaneously...

42
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,170
I said I won't do it.

43
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,840
Don't you understand human language?

44
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,540
No matter what you say, I won't do surgery.

45
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,759
Can you guarantee that

46
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,110
if I have surgery,

47
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,130
I can return to the court?

48
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,829
Even if you don't do surgery today...

49
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,950
Is it okay to let knee injuries be there

50
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,900
and cause inconvenience in movement?

51
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,600
Type.

52
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,880
I don't care

53
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,770
I don't care about my future.

54
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,920
But I must go back to play basketball.

55
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,540
I'm the captain now.

56
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,900
There will be a competition soon. I want to participate in the competition.

57
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,170
I want to win for our team!

58
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,380
Here's the thing.

59
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,650
Rehabilitation will take some time.

60
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,320
It doesn't mean that you'll be able to jump right away.

61
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,440
If you act too hastily, there will be long-term harm.

62
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,730
Can't you understand my words?

63
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,760
I said I don't care about my future.

64
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,600
But I have to go back to the court.

65
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,470
Why can't you understand?

66
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,250
Bastard child.

67
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,020
When is your next match?

68
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,350
One and a half months later.

69
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,990
As long as you can get me back to play basketball,

70
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,960
you can do anything.

71
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,030
Can you make it?

72
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,100
Do you want to give it a try?

73
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,579

[TharnType 2 : 7 Years of Love]

75
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,810
What's wrong with kids these days?

76
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,160
Bastard child. He doesn't want this or that.

77
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,140
But he wants to recover his ligament in a month and a half.

78
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,930
Is he crazy?

79
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,380
Who can do that? Does he think we're highly skilled doctors?

80
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,080
That's a ligament, not a puzzle.

81
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,570
Calm down, Sister.

82
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,240
I can't calm down.

83
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,700
I said one thing, and he refuted ten sentences.

84
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,050
And you, Type.

85
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,510
How can you promise him that he will recover in a month and a half?

86
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,770
He won't be able to play in the next game.

87
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,180
What a pity.

88
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,610
He's good-looking and has a nice body.

89
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,710
but he has such a bad temper.

90
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,690
He looks in line with your taste, but his temperament asked for a beating.

91
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,860
-Right?
-Yes, I want to beat him...

92
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,440
Are you crazy? No matter how angry I get,

93
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,159
I won't beat up a patient.

94
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,610
But when it comes to talking about him, I feel angry.

95
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,690
It's not that I'm not angry,

96
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,190
but he's quite pitiful.

97
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,740
He's just afraid.

98
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,050
Did you take the wrong medicine this morning?

99
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,870
What are you talking about?

100
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,390
I should ask you what's wrong with you.

101
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,080
You are usually so irritable.

102
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,370
Why did you become a saint today?

103
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,000
Do you like him?

104
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,600
But he also looks like my ideal type.

105
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,470
He is young, handsome, and sporty, with delicate skin and tender flesh.

106
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,150
He's a human, not a crispy pig.

107
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,320
Delicate skin and tender flesh...

108
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,330
I don't like him either.

109
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,500
To be honest, I wanted to beat him up.

110
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,260
But he's a patient. We have to serve him anyway, right?

111
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,590
You're right.

112
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,130
He's really pitiful, too.

113
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,290
Besides,

114
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,560
his temperament is very similar to mine before.

115
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,960
Really? What were you like before?

116
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,550
Were you stubborn?

117
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,550
What were you like before? Say it. What were you like before?

118
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,790
No.

119
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,240
Get back to work. I've been closely watched recently.

120
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,930
You're halfway there. What the hell were you like before?

121
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,830
You were naughty, weren't you?

122
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,670
Right? Right? Right?

123
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,430
Fiat, pick up the ball and give it to me.

124
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:57,760
Brother.

125
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,790
Do you think Brother Fiat can make it?

126
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,020
Do you think he can?

127
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,890
Leo won't be back until the end of the month.

128
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,450
I wonder who can make Fiat listen.

129
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,640
Then why didn't Fiat

130
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,000
go to training camp in Italy with Leo?

131
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,690
They're always together.

132
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,550
I heard his family didn't let him go.

133
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,080
Don't tell others now that you know.

134
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,770
When Fiat was young, Fiat liked to mock his dad

135
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,820
and run away from home.

136
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,880
After that, the farthest he can go out is to Leo's house.

137
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,429
Don't tell anyone.

138
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,620
Fiat doesn't think too much.

139
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,520
But if Leo finds out you make fun of Fiat with this,

140
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,330
he'll kill you.

141
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,730
Leo is so scary. Who dares to mess with him?

142
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,470
But, Fiat really makes people worried.

143
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,110
Leo's not here, and his knees are injured.

144
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,080
I think so too.

145
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,620
If Leo knows about this,

146
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,660
he should be back soon

147
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,990
But forget it. Now, you should worry about yourself first.

148
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,650
Go practice. Go.

149
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,520
-Me?
-Yes.

150
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,360
-Go.
-Okay.

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,150
Are you going to sleep?

152
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,160
Yes.

153
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,300
I can work outside.

154
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,120
It's okay. Just work here.

155
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,140
I can sleep.

156
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,470
Type.

157
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:13,830
What the matter?

158
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:21,160
Do you remember

159
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,630
what day it is tomorrow?

160
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,550
What day?

161
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,400
Oh, I remember.

162
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,390
I remember.

163
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,670
Aren't you going to work?

164
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,630
Yes.

165
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,540
I should be able to do it tomorrow.

166
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,860
Go to sleep.

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,500
-And you...
-What?

168
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,270
Don't let your mind dwell on mess anymore.

169
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:25,400
I can't help but think about it.

170
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,420
Let me tell you, Tharn.

171
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,890
My mind

172
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,470
is full of you, Type.

173
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,870
I can't stop thinking about you.

174
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,730
Are you shy when you smile like that?

175
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,860
Why should I be shy?

176
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:19,610
Are you shy?

177
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,830
-No.
-Really?

178
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,040
No.

179
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,930
Be brave, Khun.

180
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,670
It's been seven years now.

181
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,580
Come on.

182
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:38,060
[Hello, Champ. I'm Khun.]

183
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,840
Why should I introduce myself?

184
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,830
He knows I'm Khun.

185
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:58,760
[Champ, how are you? How are you doing?]

186
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,790
Don't do this.

187
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,900
Let me do it again. Don't do this.

188
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:19,260
[Are you free these days?]

189
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,320
It sounds like a salesman.

190
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,790
What should I do?

191
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,610
I dare not.

192
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,130
I dare not. I dare not. I dare not.

193
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:40,130
Right. I will say...

194
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,580
[Are you free these days?]

195
00:14:44,580 --> 00:15:17,390
[Are you free? I found a very delicious restaurant. Let's go there and eat together.]

196
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,290
Isn't it too direct?

197
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,450
It's too direct. Let me recall it.

198
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,880
Let me recall it.  This will...

199
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:34,940
[Let's go.]

200
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,700
Oh my!

201
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,420
My gosh.

202
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,550
Really?

203
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,370
My gosh.

204
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,030
My goodness.

205
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:34,650
Yes!

206
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,430
Oh my!

207
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,840
The dishes are too fancy.

208
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,990
Doctor,

209
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,840
If you treat us to such good food,

210
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,650
ask me to join you in the future more frequently.

211
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,770
Listen, my friend.

212
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,200
I'm ready.

213
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,180
Wait.

214
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,220
Why do you treat us to dinner?

215
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,330
Is it because we haven't seen each other for a long time?

216
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,010
-Right?
-Yes.

217
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,650
-But...
- Well...

218
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,290
I'm happy that you're here today.

219
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,330
Eat this.

220
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:39,610
What?

221
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:42,950
Over there.

222
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,310
You ate and made your face dirty again.

223
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,870
Hey, Doctor.

224
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,980
Let's eat.

225
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,420
His embarrassment gives people goosebumps.

226
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,589
You look much cuter in person than in the photo.

227
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,870
I'm glad you came to see me today.

228
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,340
Yes.

229
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,600
I happen to live nearby.

230
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:38,890
Is something bothering you?

231
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,110
Or you don't want to see me?

232
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,520
You can go back first.

233
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:43,920
I have no objections.

234
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,070
It's okay, Brother.

235
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,340
I'm just worried about my family affairs

236
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,450
and things in school.

237
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,900
This person wants to do this and that person wants to do that.

238
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,370
No one wants to hear my ideas.

239
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,630
If you have anything, you can tell me.

240
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,630
I'm willing to listen.

241
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,310
If you want me to do something interesting,

242
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,500
something not boring,

243
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,620
or something that only the two of us know...

244
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:43,980
[Love this moment]

245
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,460
If you can relieve me of boredom...

246
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,350
Be careful on your way back.

247
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,500
Bye.

248
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,320
Do you still have a lot to do, Type?

249
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,570
Not much.

250
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,420
If no one else gives me more work...

251
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,460
Dr. Thiti?

252
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,900
Do you need my help?

253
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,170
It's okay. Didn't you make an appointment with your mother?

254
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,880
I'm almost done.

255
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,130
You are sure you can finish it, right?

256
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,240
Who do you think I am?

257
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,230
Okay, Little Genius.

258
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,180
Then I won't hesitate. I'll go back first.

259
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,870
Okay.

260
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,180
-Come on.
-Bye. Bye.

261
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:26,740
Hello?

262
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,700
[Type, where are you?]

263
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,050
I'm in the office.

264
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,420
[Don't tell me you forgot it.]

265
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,830
[I reminded you last night.]

266
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,830
Is Thorn going to propose to Ahn?

267
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,500
[Yes, are you coming?]

268
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,260
I have to submit the documents tomorrow morning.

269
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,500
I'm sorry, Tharn.

270
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,120
I don't think I can go.

271
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,950
[Forget it. When will you finish it? Do you want me to pick you up?]

272
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,570
It's okay. I don't know when I can finish it.

273
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:11,190
Please send my congratulations to Brother Thorn.

274
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,540
[Hmm.]

275
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,010
OK.

276
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,710
Brother Tharn, are you ready?

277
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,900
Brother Thorn said he'll be here soon.

278
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,830
Of course, I am ready, Your Highness.

279
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,710
It's all for our brother.

280
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,270
That's right. Then Thorn can be less possessive of me.

281
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:51,670
Let's go

282
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:14,990
Please go downstairs.

283
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,730
Why do you look so special today?

284
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:18,940
What's up?

285
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,280
No, there is nothing.

286
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,070
I just want to bring my girlfriend here to have dinner.

287
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,240
Because you usually take me to

288
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,480
famous restaurants on Yaowarat Road

289
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,080
or super spicy Thai cuisine.

290
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,980
Do you remember when was the last time

291
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,330
we came to this kind of restaurant?

292
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,940
I just want to have dinner with my girlfriend.

293
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,830
Are you sure you didn't make a big mistake

294
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,150
and brought me here to atone for your sins?

295
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,520
How can you think of me like that?

296
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,540
Just kidding.

297
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,580
If you make a mistake,

298
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,420
it should be that you are too worried about Thanya.

299
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,040
She's grown up and you still keep an eye on her.

300
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,610
She's still a child.

301
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,030
How can I not worry about her?

302
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,160
In the crew, I don't know who's pursuing her.

303
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,690
My mom didn't listen to me either when I told Thanya not to act.

304
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,680
If I hadn't got a scholarship and gone to study in England,

305
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,700
I wouldn't have let her act.

306
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,860
Then you wouldn't have seen me.

307
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,100
Fine, I can have her act.

308
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,860
But...

309
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,280
But, I'm still worried about her.

310
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,190
Come on. The person who is possessive of his younger sister,

311
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,070
let's see how special the special dinner is.

312
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,960
Are we the only guests left?

313
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,910
Yeah, I find it strange too.

314
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,030
Thorn, my mom is coming back from Korea this week.

315
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,500
I want to take her to your home to visit your family.

316
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,250
Are your parents free?

317
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,670
When will you call them mom and dad?

318
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,550
Don't make me shy.

319
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,590
So will they be at home?

320
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,800
I'll ask them for you.

321
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,560
Look, Ahn.

322
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,720
That's Thanya's interview.

323
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,760
Thanya, tell us about the drama you're shooting now.

324
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,320
This drama is very romantic.

325
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,810
I loved it after reading the script.

326
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:01,480
The male and female leads are cute too.

327
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,710
You have such a cute male lead in the drama.

328
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,620
In reality,

329
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,730
do you have your own male lead?

330
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,170
Of course.

331
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:12,140
Who captured the heart of our National Sweetheart?

332
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,910
For me, there are two leading men.

333
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,010
One of them is clingy to me.

334
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,430
But I think

335
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,400
it's time for him to have true love beside him.

336
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,430
There is only one girl I agree with,

337
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,930
who is always by his side.

338
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:31,200
She wouldn't even leave Thorn,

339
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,530
although he is so possessive of his sister.

340
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,020
So I agree to have this girl be with my brother.

341
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,690
Ahn, turn around, take a look

342
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,400
and you'll see that person.

343
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,270
Answer me first before I answer you.

344
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,400
In your life,

345
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,770
Auntie ranks first.

346
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,710
Thanya ranks second.

347
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,230
So, you have to promise me

348
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:24,210
that I'll be your only and third place forever.

349
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,800
That way, I'll answer you.

350
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,640
If I always put you in the third place,

351
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,680
won't you be mad at me?

352
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,670
I've known it since the day I promised to be your girlfriend.

353
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,720
Let's get married.

354
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,960
See? I'm getting married.

355
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:37,820
[Congratulations, Brother.]

356
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,210
Congratulations, Brother Thorn.

357
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,340
Tharn.

358
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,600
When did you come back?

359
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,490
Did you eat? Do you need me to heat food for you?

360
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:40,660
Are you trying to act cute with me?

361
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,110
Tharn, don't think too much.

362
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,480
I know what you're thinking.

363
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,450
You and I

364
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:09,440
are very happy to live together like this.

365
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,080
It's just a wedding.

366
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:19,560
Yes.

367
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,690
I think so too.

368
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,510
Are you working?

369
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,370
Do you want me to stand up?

370
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:54,200
♫All you need to know is that there's still me holding you♫

371
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,310
It's okay. Just sit like this.

372
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,850
♫I will always be here♫

373
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,070
♫I promise not to leave♫

374
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:07,830
♫Please believe that this heart remains unchanged♫

375
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,640
Hello, is that the police?

376
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,290
Wait, Brother.

377
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:54,990
Calm down.

378
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,350
I know my neighbor.

379
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,870
A suspicious person is sneaking around in front of my brother's house.

380
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:01,880
Brother.

381
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,510
I told you I'm not a bad guy.

382
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,220
-Police! Oh no!
-Brother.

383
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,090
He's a thief.

384
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:11,010
Wait, I really know them.

385
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,810
I'm just kidding.

386
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:19,060
Do you remember me? I was also there that day.

387
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,840
Brother Tharn told me that you're his senior.

388
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,020
-You scared me.
-I was just kidding.

389
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,830
Don't do that again, okay?

390
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,380
What's the matter?

391
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,040
Don't pester my boyfriend.

392
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,210
Well...

393
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,340
I...

394
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:58,670
Me?

395
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,210
I'll go back to my room. What?

396
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,860
Hey, what's the matter?

397
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,740
[What do you mean? When are you coming back?]

398
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,520
[Fiat is insane.]

399
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,460
He was already crazy.

400
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,050
[Yes, but he's crazier than before.]

401
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,040
[I don't care if he gets mad.]

402
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:51,780
[His knees hurt so much, but he still plays basketball.]

403
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,930
[What if his knees can't be used?]

404
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,380
What did you say?

405
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,890
Did he hurt his knees?

406
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,470
[Yes.]

407
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,480
[Didn't you know he fell and was sent to the hospital?]

408
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:08,320
No, I didn't. He didn't tell me.

409
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,469
[How can it be possible? He's so close to you.]

410
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,110
[Forget it. When are you coming back?]

411
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,510
[Come back and teach him a lesson. I can't control him anymore.]

412
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,139
[Hello, Leo.]

413
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,250
[Are you listening to me?]

414
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,590
[Hello?]

415
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,320
Bye.

416
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,659
Hey, book me a ticket.

417
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:40,650
I need to go back to Thailand immediately.

418
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,030
Brother, are you okay?

419
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,690
Who's your brother?

420
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,280
Don't touch me!

421
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:10,690
I got hurt because of your friend.

422
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:13,980
You jerk.

423
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,230
What rehabilitation is this? I should have improved after doing it.

424
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,320
It hurts so much.

425
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,830
I don't know if you're teasing me.

426
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,520
Brother, speak properly.

427
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,450
No one is making fun of you.

428
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,640
You guys are all part of the same group.

429
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,130
Once you get the money, you don't care about me anymore.

430
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,230
No one cares about my feelings.

431
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,170
Brother, talk properly.

432
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,610
Why should I talk to you nicely?

433
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:53,930
Am I wrong? Aren't you working for money?

434
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,690
No one cares about my feelings.

435
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,960
It hurts so much.

436
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,540
Whatever. I'll go to play basketball like this.

437
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,290
Are you going to break your knees like that?

438
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,080
I don't care.

439
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,970
Anyway, I'm not good at anything.

440
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,650
Okay.

441
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,840
Then wear out your knees.

442
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,150
Don't let me see you cry then.

443
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:29,920
Go.

444
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,480
Your life and your knees...

445
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:35,950
I won't stop you.

446
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,510
But you...

447
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,590
If you don't love yourself,

448
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,250
why should others worry about you?

449
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:04,190
I don't know what happened to you,

450
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,290
but before you do anything,

451
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,190
think about your knees and yourself first.

452
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,920
I will definitely get you back to play basketball,

453
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,610
but you must follow my training plan.

454
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:24,720
Follow the agreement and have rehabilitation treatment with Sister Teng every time.

455
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:25,880
Is that okay?

456
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:46,370
Be careful.

457
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:51,630
Are you OK?

458
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,460
How are you? Are you feeling better?

459
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,610
Do you mean my knees

460
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,510
or my mood?

461
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,940
It means you are good when you're in the mood to talk back.

462
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,550
Are you sure you did everything as Sister Teng said?

463
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,860
Well, I...

464
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,940
I jumped.

465
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,110
Oh, Brother.

466
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,710
I'm afraid. I'm afraid I won't be able to play basketball anymore.

467
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,510
At the thought of that,

468
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,700
my legs jumped subconsciously.

469
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,380
Then you got hurt like this.

470
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,040
Let me see.

471
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,230
Is it okay?

472
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:12,560
Brother Type.

473
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:13,950
What's the matter?

474
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,800
Can I have your number?

475
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,480
Come on.

476
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,860
At least when I don't know what to do,

477
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,620
I have someone to ask.

478
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,210
Okay.

479
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,170
Next time, learn to listen to what others say,

480
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,910
rather than wanting it to recover immediately.

481
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,580
Who can do that?

482
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,600
Okay.

483
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,480
Are you sure it's okay?

484
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:01,890
Yes.

485
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:37,020
[Hello, Brother Type.]

486
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:54,950
Why didn't you tell me?

487
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,460
What is it?

488
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:01,840
About your knees.

489
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:04,870
Oh.

490
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:09,840
It's just knee pain.

491
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,330
Besides, you were living happily there.

492
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,510
Why should I tell you?

493
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,000
We need to talk.

494
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,860
You're making a scene as soon as you're here.

495
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,970
Are you angry because I didn't ask you?

496
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:36,790
Fine.

497
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,810
Well,

498
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,210
how are you?

499
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,140
Were you tired all the way?

500
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,930
Let me hug you.

501
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,730
Don't mess with me.

502
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:56,670
I didn't.

503
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,170
But you...

504
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,430
Why are you back?

505
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,790
Didn't you say that you'd be back at the end of the month?

506
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,750
What's going on?

507
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,200
You didn't even contact me.

508
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,470
How could I tell you?

509
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:13,710
But you know, if you told me,

510
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,640
I would come back right away.

511
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,980
Why should I tell you?

512
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,060
Do you

513
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,420
have any feelings for me?

514
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:33,620
Fiat.

515
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,690
Don't talk to me like that.

516
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:40,000
I'm not your subordinate.

517
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,360
I'm not afraid of you.

518
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,320
I don't want you to be afraid of me.

519
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,200
I'm worried about you.

520
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,550
Because you're my friend.

521
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,680
If my return makes you angry

522
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,430
and you have no time to spend with others,

523
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,060
I apologize to you. I shouldn't have come back.

524
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,980
I bought you the cake you like.

525
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,300
I'll give it to you later.

526
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,700
Yes, Your Highness.

527
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:37,770
I'll go there as soon as possible.

528
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,480
Hello, how can I help you?

529
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,340
Sure.

530
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,650
Can I see these rings?

531
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,140
Yes, please wait a moment.

532
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,320
Let me show you.

533
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:00,440
Please take a look.

534
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,840
Can I take a photo?

535
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,130
Sure, go ahead.

536
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,270
-Thank you.
-You are welcome.

537
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,090
[When will your friend agree?]

538
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:48,050
[Gosh, he's showing off his ring.]

539
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:51,500
[Hey, which mall are you at?
I'm at a mall too.]

540
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:57,140
Mr. Tharn.

541
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:58,890
It's really you.

542
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,520
I'm Nana.

543
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:03,080
Do you remember me? I'm Mr. Thorn's secretary.

544
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:06,340
Yes.

545
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,460
What a coincidence. What are you doing here?

546
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,360
Do you want to buy a ring for someone?

547
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,940
For my boyfriend.

548
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:16,650
I plan to buy him one.

549
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,260
Come on.

550
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:22,490
Everyone in the company knows you're single.

551
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,260
Is it for your mother or Thanya?

552
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:27,960
No.

553
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:30,850
I really bought it for my boyfriend.

554
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:35,180
Let me help.

555
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:48,640
Oh my.

556
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,600
Tharn is betraying Type!

557
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,100
I'm sorry.

558
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,040
I didn't mean to make you angry.

559
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,040
I just...

560
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,750
You said it yourself, didn't you?

561
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,340
You wanted to go to that camp long ago.

562
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:51,200
How can I tell you I hurt my knees?

563
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,250
You can tell me.

564
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,780
If I had told you, you have come back like this?

565
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:03,910
Isn't the camp important to you?

566
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:05,960
How could I do that?

567
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:11,790
Do you know

568
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,890
how angry I was?

569
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:17,010
I had to know what happened to you from others.

570
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,500
I know you're worried about me.

571
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,000
You're worried about me, right?

572
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:31,180
Yes.

573
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:38,540
But I know

574
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,670
what you were thinking when you hurt your knee.

575
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:44,650
What do you know?

576
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,850
You were afraid you can't play basketball anymore.

577
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:53,730
Yes. I'm sorry.

578
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:55,320
Please forgive me.

579
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:01,840
Have I ever been willing to be angry with you?

580
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,980
If I don't cool down,

581
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,550
you'll keep throwing tantrums at me like this.

582
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,440
That means

583
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,200
you're not mad anymore?

584
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,040
I won't be angry

585
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:24,920
if you behave better in the future.

586
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:27,470
Okay.

587
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,030
Leo.

588
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,320
What if my knees don't heal?

589
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:47,460
If I can't play basketball anymore...

590
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:50,650
I'm scared.

591
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:54,940
I know.

592
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,190
That's why I came back.

593
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,260
I'm back to be with you.

594
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,360
Yes.

595
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,540
You came back late.

596
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,170
I've lost my temper several times.

597
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,810
If you didn't come back to calm me down,

598
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:27,320
I would torture them to death.

599
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:29,840
I'll vent my anger on them

600
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:33,860
and let them practice until they die.

601
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:41,330
That's why I'm back.

602
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:44,550
I have already returned.

603
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:28,100
[Plan for Type's Husband]

604
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:03,700
[Tharn: When will your friend agree?]

605
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,140
[Techno: Oh, you are showing off the ring.]

606
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,240
[Techno: Hey, which mall are you at?
I'm at a mall right now too.]

607
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,430
[Champ: Which mall are you at? Are you going to have a meal? I want to go too.]

608
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:13,700
[Techno: Damn it. Tharn is about to cheat.]

609
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,050
[Champ: Hey, what do you mean?]

610
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:16,930
[Champ: Techno.]

611
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:18,190
[Champ: Techno.]

612
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:19,910
[Champ: Techno.]

613
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:28,100
[Techno: Type must know this.]
