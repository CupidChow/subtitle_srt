How much did you spend?

5
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,880
Did I make it too grand again?

6
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,350
But I didn't say I don't like it.

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,660
That means

8
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,150
you like it, right?

9
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,490
I don't like you spending money so recklessly,

10
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,690
but I like your intentions.

11
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,050
You did it for me, right?

12
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,050
Yes.

13
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,170
I want you to rest.

00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,789
Actually, I want to take you to other provinces to play.

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,760
But we are not very free recently.

16
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,350
So,

17
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,670
I changed the environment.

18
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,820
So I have to agree with you, right?

19
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,310
So are you willing to agree with me?

20
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,630
Since you love me so much,

21
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,570
it is OK for me to agree with you.

I'm sure. I will never get tired of you.

You're smiling like this. Are you shy?

As long as we smile, someone will come to us.

156
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,450
As for your face...

157
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,930
If you frown, people will run away because of fear.

-I dodged.
-Aren't you afraid of getting beaten?

159
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,240
Brother Type, don't worry about me.

160
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,890
I have Cirrus by my side.

161

Cirrus will take care of me, right?

162
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,480
It is my responsibility.

Go.

167
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,650
What's wrong?

168
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,740
You stepped on my foot.

169

Sorry, I didn't mean it.

170

You two can also come in and eat with us.

171
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,330
So, can you tell me now?

172
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,610
Why are you having a party at my place?

173
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,640
I just wanted to meet my friends.

174
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,150
Because my friends don't meet much anymore.

175
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,860
Because my friends are too clingy to their husbands.

176
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,460
Are you referring to Champ?

177
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,530
I referred to you.

178
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,130
Wait, Speaking of Champ,

179
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,010
we're also here to celebrate that his restaurant has opened for a month.

180
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,440
And it's not closed yet.

181
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,880
What does it have to do with you, No?

182
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,480
It has nothing to do with me.

183
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,390
I just want to make the excuse sound more sufficient.

184
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,710
Champ, No is cursing your restaurant to go bankrupt.

185
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,420
Tharn, does what in my mind sound too loud?

186
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,190
You've already said that, No.

187
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,010
No, you are cursing my restaurant.

188
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,110
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

189
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,430
What in my heart sounds too loud.

190
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,860
Come on!

191
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,710
Phugun, don't care about them.

192
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,360
Let them talk nonsense.

193
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,310
But I think it's quite fun.

194
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,760
You look close.

195
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,130
I'm his best friend.

196
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:52,150
I've witnessed every moment of Type's life.

197
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,990
If you keep talking, I'll eat it.

198
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,240
My chicken, Champ.

199
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,560
-Can you learn to share some with friends?
-There's still so much left.

200
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,390
I bought it. And my salary is not as high as yours.

201
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,380
-You talk too much. Eat it.
-What?

202
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,300
Stop fighting!

203
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,750
Phu.

204
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,560
We've known each other since freshman year.

205
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:22,190
But Type and No have known each other since middle school. Right?

206
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,050
Yes

207
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,080
How did Brother Champ know you?

208
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,480
I lived in the dorm at school since the beginning.

209
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,940
But one day, Type wanted to change rooms.

210
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,490
No came to ask me.

211
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,280
But luckily we didn't change.

212
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,170
That's great.

213
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,370
You've been friends for years.

214
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,470
And you look close.

215
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,420
Yes.

216
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,360
You've been dating for seven years, right?

217
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,980
Yes, seven years.

218
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,030
But I still love Type as I did in the first year.

219
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,110
Here comes the first injury.

220
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,930
Brothers, have you heard of the seven-year itch?

221
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,010
Are you scared?

222
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,890
No.

223
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,550
What's there to be afraid of?

224
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,500
Aren't you scared?

225
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,470
Yes.

226
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,130
But I'm afraid.

227
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,550
I'm afraid that

228
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,619
you won't love me anymore.

229
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:25,160
What's wrong?

230
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,119
I want to vomit.

231
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,270
But I feel sorry for the chicken I ate.

232
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,750
Seven years have passed, and you still love each other.

233
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,440
By the way,

234
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,690
did anything bad happen to you two?

235
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,510
For me,

236
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,960
the worst thing is about my boss.

237
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,130
Wait, what does that have to do with the seven-year itch?

238
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,940
I'm not afraid.

239
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,040
No matter what happens,

240
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,290
I'll hold Type's hand

241
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,840
and get through everything with him.

242
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,590
Champ, call the doctor.

243
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,180
I need a blood sugar test.

244
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,590
Give me insulin in my stomach immediately.

245
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,170
What are you talking about?

246
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,840
Calm down. Put it down.

247
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,680
It's sharp.

248
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,730
You can't do this. Let's eat.

249
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,840
Do you want to talk to me?

250
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,120
You can tell that?

251
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,700
Yes.

252
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,410
I see you and Type are so in love...

253
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,360
Yes.

254
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,160
I love Type.

255
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,190
Type loves me too.

256
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,370
He's just a little stubborn and reluctant to admit it.

257
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,300
I love Phugun too.

258
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,650
I want to be with him forever.

259
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,260
Just like you...

260
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,170
Don't be like us.

261
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,230
Type is different from others.

262
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,440
Actually now,

263
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,650
he doesn't want to tell others we're dating.

264
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:45,960
Really?

265
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,410
Yes.

266
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,520
I'll go help them.

267
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,340
Okay.

268
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,900
Ha-ha-ha-ha! Fool, I won!

269
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,880
Let me see.

270
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,810
You have five but you didn't play with it.

271
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,870
-Your hand is full of cards, bro.
-Because I saw the yellow card.

272
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,670
No, I only have one left.

273
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,270
There's only one left.

274
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,370
I won!

275
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,230
It's okay. It's just a game.

276
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,840
Who should I choose?

277
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,570
Oh.

278
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,380
I'll pick you, Type.

279
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,590
Okay.

280
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,100
Just tell me what you want.

281
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,260
I demand you to

282
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,580
kiss Tharn's mouth.

283
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,660
Wait, that's enough. Stay still.

284
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,870
But I like it.

285
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,930
Stay still, handsome boy.

286
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,540
He asked me to do it.

287
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,570
Fine. I will stay still.

288
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,160
Who is it, Type?

289
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,330
My colleague is calling me.

290
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,460
I'll answer the phone now.

291
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,150
Okay.

292
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,200
Go ahead.

293
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,900
What a disappointment!

294
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,750
He picked the right time.

295
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,070
Shuffle the cards again.

296
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,390
You'll absolutely lose to me this time.

297
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,470
Fine.

298
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,900
Do you know how to write "victory"?

299
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,560
-Do you want to go out and chat alone?
-Calm down, former boxer.

300
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,180
You don't have to worry so much.

301
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,250
Phugun. Phugun.

302
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,200
What are you going to tease me about?

303
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,830
Don't think like that.

304
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,140
Who do you think I am?

305
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,020
Well... Can I have your number?

306
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,730
I will friend you. Hurry up.

307
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,820
Just give it to me.

308
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,000
Okay.

309
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,320
Hurry up.

310
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:19,520
But...

311
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,120
What?

312
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,500
I have a requirement. Don't always send me messages.

313
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,000
Why?

314
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,080
Someone will be jealous.

315
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,660
Okay.

316
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,510
-Just kidding.
-It's okay.

317
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,950
Then give me his number.

318
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,750
Cirrus.

319
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,030
How is it, bro?

320
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,780
Everything is fine here. Nothing special.

321
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,860
How are you?

322
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,540
I am dealing cards. I am dealing cards.

323
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,960
Nothing unusual.

324
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,040
I am shuffling the cards.

325
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,410
I need to go to the hospital.

326
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,510
Who is sick?

327
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,140
My boss called me.

328
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:51,980
On the day off?

329
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,070
I don't know what's going on.

330
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:00,320
-Then I'll send you there.
-Let's go too.

331
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,980
We'll go back to our room.

332
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,860
Let's go, Cirrus.

333
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,320
I'm going back to my restaurant.

334
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,580
I'm leaving too.

335
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,430
I have to go to my restaurant.

336
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,420
See you.

337
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,540
See you what?

338
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,580
We came here together.

339
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,550
Wait.

340
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,820
Take me with you.

341
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,730
We came here together.

342
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,790
Don't leave me behind.

343
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,090
You're finally here, Mr. Thiwat.

344
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,370
I thought I'd have to wait all day.

345
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,420
I happened to be stuck in a traffic jam.

346
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,380
Why did you call me here?

347
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,840
About your application for leave...

348
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,880
I said no, right?

349
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:55,890
I know.

350
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,460
But I also found someone to replace me.

351
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,320
You're really persistent.

352
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,620
Unbelievable.

353
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,880
But I don't care who you switch with.

354
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,400
I won't approve.

355
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,610
Because I said we're short-handed.

356
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,590
So you won't let me take leave, right?

357
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,720
Yes, because I'm your boss.

358
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,830
Thank you.

359
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,210
Thank you for letting me know

360
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:34,070
that older people may not be more mature.

361
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,520
Thiwat, you've gone too far.

362
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,590
Pay attention to your words. Don't be too impolite.

363
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:42,880
Yes.

364
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,430
I know. You are the leader.

365
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,610
That's all, right?

366
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,690
I’m leaving,

367
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,020
Boss.

368
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,770
Thiwat.

369
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,630
Thiwat.

370
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,450
Type!

371
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,340
Something serious happened.

372
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,780
What's wrong?

373
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,510
Boss gave you a warning letter.

374
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,700
I knew I would be targeted.

375
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,350
So he's really immature as I said.

376
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,830
He probably felt embarrassed.

377
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,260
No one has ever scolded him like that.

378
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,880
I'm happy that he knows I was scolding him.

379
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,080
I can't stand him anymore.

380
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,330
Can I hit him, Sister?

381
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:49,810
Hey.

382
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,320
Then I will sign the resignation letter and wait for him.

383
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,190
Calm down.

384
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,340
You said you'd stay here for a year, right?

385
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Go home after work today.

386
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,470
Don't ambush him.

387
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,110
Okay, Sister.

388
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,320
Hello, Champ.

389
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,790
I sent you the address of the restaurant.

390
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,590
[Got it.]

391
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,770
[I'm calling to ask when you're getting off work.]

392
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,510
Today? I'm not sure.

393
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,220
Maybe around five.

394
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,530
[Do you want me to pick you up?]

395
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,970
It's okay. I drove here today.

396
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,530
It is Okay for us to meet at the restaurant.

397
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:37,800
[Okay.]

398
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,830
[Text me when you're leaving.]

399
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,050
[According to the map, I will arrive earlier than you.]

400
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,040
Okay, see you at the restaurant.

401
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,400
Yesterday, Dr. Thiti

402
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,230
called Type over to ask about taking leave.

403
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,090
But I think they had a fight.

404
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,100
Type insisted on taking leave.

405
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,340
He even asked someone to take over his shift.

406
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,750
-Really?
-Yes.

407
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,510
But the department is short of hands.

408
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,120
Dr. Thiti didn't allow him to take leave.

409
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,200
So he was scolded by Type as immature.

410
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,080
Type said Dr. Thiti doesn't care about his employees as a leader.

411
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,170
My gosh.

412
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,460
I didn't expect him to scold his boss.

413
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,040
If it were me, I would have scolded him back.

414
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,300
I didn't expect him to be so bold.

415
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,600
He looks polite.

416
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,040
I didn't expect him to be so sharp-tongued.

417
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,590
I heard Dr. Thiti sent him a warning letter, right?

418
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,710
Yes.

419
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,970
If I were Dr. Thiti,

420
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,490
I would be very sad.

421
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,100
I also wanted to talk nicely,

422
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,710
but I was scolded.

423
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,540
Yes.

424
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,290
I'm sorry.

425
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,830
Doctor, do you want to inquire with us?

426
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,630
What happened?

427
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,320
Don't tell anyone after you know it.

428
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,740
It's about Sports Medicine Department.

429
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,260
Have you heard about the thing that happened in Sports Medicine Department?

430
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,540
Your brother, Type?

431
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,430
That's him.

432
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,820
I heard he had a conflict with Dr. Thiti again.

433
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,700
He is handsome,

434
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,370
but he has done too many bad things.

435
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,730
He likes to steal someone else's boyfriend.

436
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,100
He likes to complain to others.

437
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,080
And now he wants to take more leave.

438
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,970
He knows how busy the hospital will be

439
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,440
during the long holiday...

440
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,750
Do you really like him?

441
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,320
I do,

442
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,160
but he's a troublemaker.

443
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,710
If you have any doubts, you can tell me.

444
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,140
Let's go.

445
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:56,990
Go!

446
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,390
Again...

447
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,580
How many times do I have to go through this?

448
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:23,890
[Stop filming me.]

449
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:23,890
[Mr. Tharn is really focused on his work.]

450
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:21,780
Darn it.

451
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,230
Gil, seriously,

452
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:31,070
don't upload my videos to Instagram.

453
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,730
Your Instagram is full of my photos.

454
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,650
Do you know it?

455
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,330
Stop uploading my videos.

456
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,860
What's wrong, Type?

457
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,520
Calm down first.

458
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,720
How can I calm down?

459
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,900
Who's in such a good mood like you?

460
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,360
You just sit there talking on the phone and laughing every day.

461
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,930
Do you know what I went through today?

462
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:58,300
People in the whole hospital think I'm a jerk.

463
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,780
The damn boss

464
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,930
spread rumors about me scolding him everywhere.

465
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,210
Darn it.

466
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,150
Why is he not talking about

467
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,550
the things he forced me to do every day?

468
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,620
Then why didn't you tell me about these?

469
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,770
What do you want me to tell you?

470
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,720
I see you're so happy.

471
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,300
I dare not interrupt.

472
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,460
What am I happy about, Type?

473
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,210
What you see is my job.

474
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,820
I didn't provoke anyone.

475
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,610
Work?

476
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,860
Yes, it's work.

477
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,420
Why do you vent your anger on me?

478
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,710
I'll sleep somewhere else.

479
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:42,830
I won't let you go.

480
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:45,970
I want to leave.

481
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,560
Brother Type, what's the matter?

482
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,850
Can I sleep in your room tonight, Phu?

483
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,400
What about Brother Tharn?

484
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,760
I can sleep on the sofa too.

485
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,330
Please, Phu.

486
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,430
Here's the thing.

487
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,280
I think it will be better if you go and clarify with Brother Tharn first.

488
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,120
Can you not mention his name now?

489
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,460
I beg you.

490
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,260
Come inside first.

491
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,940
Type, what are you doing here?

492
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,460
I miss it when we were in school...

493
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,900
When you had a fight with Tharn,

494
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,820
you'd come to my room.

495
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,770
Yes.

496
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,170
It's been a long time.

497
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,520
Look.

498
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,950
Tharn is here to pick you up.

499
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,250
Don't open the door for him.

500
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,880
No way.

501
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,110
You two...

502
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,290
If Seo Duang were here,

503
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,770
we'd all be reunited.

504
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,530
Speaking of which, I miss Seo Duang.

505
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:47,980
Seo Duang!

506
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,060
I can't debut anymore.

507
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,460
I have nothing left.

508
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,330
What are you talking about?

509
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,550
I don't understand.

510
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,150
I can't debut.

511
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,640
I have nothing.

512
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,590
My whole life's effort...

513
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,230
I have nothing now.

514
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,890
Calm down. Don't cry.

515
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,670
That's my dream.

516
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,890
I've worked hard for it all my life.

517
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,090
Why is this the end?

518
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,600
I just wanted to pursue my dream.

519
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,950
I didn't kill anyone.

520
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,130
This is the reality.

521
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,080
It's not as beautiful as in novels.

522
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,340
Yes.

523
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,160
You should give up.

524
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,530
I know it is not like in novels...

525
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,410
I was also mentally prepared,

526
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,640
but I'm still sad.

527
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,770
I practiced and trained so hard that I was going to die.

528
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,630
I was still practicing in my dream.

529
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,320
But I still didn't pass it in the end.

530
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:31,330
But at least you have Khlui by your side.

531
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,739
Yeah, I'm with you.

532
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,590
Don't cry.

533
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,420
I’m going back to my room.

534
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,100
Come on, Seo Duang.

535
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:54,630
Type, wait.

536
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,489
Where are you going?

537
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:56,300
Help me first.

538
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,120
Good luck, Brother.

539
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,240
Type!

540
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,400
Khlui, don't leave me behind.

541
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,910
I do want to meddle in others' affairs,

542
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,040
but I have to comfort my friend.

543
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,170
Come on.

544
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,050
Cry.

545
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,410
[He only told me about his damn boss.]

546
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,500
But he's really irritable, No.

547
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,380
[Really?]

548
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,920
[I don't know it either.]

549
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,860
[But I think he's being cruelly targeted this time.]

550
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:32,110
[Otherwise, people like Type won't lose their temper so easily.]

551
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,520
Fine. If you don't know it,

552
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,170
there shouldn't be anyone who'd know it.

553
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,220
Then I'll wait for him to calm down

554
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,960
before I ask him myself.

555
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,910
[Wait, what you just said...]

556
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,930
[as if I'm a busybody.]

557
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,480
[But I think I was wrong.]

558
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,080
[Why don't we try to ask Champ?]

559
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,980
[He seems to be close to Dr. Khunpol recently.]

560
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,110
[He probably knows some inside information.]

561
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,310
It's okay, No. You don't have to do this.

562
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,630
[I'll call Champ. Wait for me. Don't hang up.]

563
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,010
[I am coming.]

564
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,680
[Tharn, No has told me.]

565
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,240
[Type has not complained to me about anything.]

566
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,950
[But I'm with Doctor now.]

567
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,340
[He said he had something to tell you.]

568
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:42,190
[Hello, Tharn. I'm Khunpol.]

569
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,610
[I'm Champ's friend.]

570
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,760
[I work in the same place as Type.]

571
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:50,900
[I heard from the nurses during the day...]

572
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,990
[Brother Type, how are you?
Did you solve the thing you told me?]

573
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,830
I have known everything.

574
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,120
What?

575
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,450
How did you know about

576
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,200
things in the hospital?

577
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:07,010
Champ asked me to talk to Doctor Khunpol.

578
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,700
He said

579
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,500
you were bullied by your boss,

580
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:22,980
and you were sent a warning letter.

581
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,140
Also,

582
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,090
people in the hospital were talking about you.

583
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:39,780
That's it.

584
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:46,930
Actually,

585
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,120
about the warning letter,

586
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,410
I already knew

587
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,130
I would get it no matter what.

588
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,870
But I didn't expect that bad boss

589
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,620
would spread rumors and slander me.

590
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,860
He also told people in the hospital.

591
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,140
As you know,

592
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:27,160
I don't like to be the focus of attention.

593
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,450
But today in the hospital,

594
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,990
everyone was looking at me.

595
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,670
They were talking about me.

596
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,000
I felt really bad.

597
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,340
Type.

598
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,610
What's wrong?

599
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,780
Are you going to quit?

600
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,320
I can still handle it.

601
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,280
I was just irritated today.

602
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,910
Let me ask you again.

603
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,210
Are you going to quit?

604
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,160
You don't have to stay for a year.

605
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,690
After you quit,

606
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,100
you can still find a job you want to do.

607
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,540
I can take care of you, Type.

608
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,650
It is OK if you don't want to quit.

609
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:55,630
I know

610
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,570
My Little Type is the best.

611
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,730
Everything will pass.

612
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,010
Can you hug me?

613
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,710
♫You just need to know♫

614
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:33,370
♫You still have me hugging you♫

615
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,600
I'm hugging you.

616
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,180
I want you to hold me tight.

617
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:37,010
♫I will always be here♫

618
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:40,250
♫I promise not to leave♫

619
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,650
Then I'll hug you like this all night.

620
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:47,540
♫Please believe that this heart remains unchanged♫

621
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:53,380
♫Please don't let go of my hand♫

622
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:57,190
♫No matter if it's painful or happy♫

623
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:04,280
♫I'll always be by your side♫

624
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:16,130
Type, when I told you to quit,

625
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,440
I was serious.

626
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,470
I can work and support you.

627
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,250
Okay.

628
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:45,860
I know.

629
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,680
But I don't want to run away from problems anymore.

630
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:55,850
In the past,

631
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,700
I always evaded problems.

632
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,850
When I was young,

633
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:08,310
I ran to Bangkok because of that incident.

634
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:12,170
When I was a freshman,

635
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,210
I had a conflict with you.

636
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,530
I wanted to escape from you

637
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,860
and leave everything to you.

638
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,950
But now,

639
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,560
I'm not the same Thiwat that I used to be.

640
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:39,090
I have to be responsible for what I said.

641
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:44,720
Since I said I will stay for one year, I will stay for one year.

642
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,200
I just need to endure for a few more months.

643
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:00,430
Type.

644
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:08,700
Don't forget that

645
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:12,560
you have me.

646
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,580
Just because I have you,

647
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:27,920
I can still hold on.

648
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:40,690
Forget it. Let's eat.

649
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,680
Or I'll be late for work.

650
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:44,220
Let's eat.

651
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,460
Type,

652
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,520
I have to go on a business trip to another province.

653
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:31,010
Is it about the new song?

654
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:37,720
Yes, I need to learn the music there

655
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,620
to use it.

656
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:43,060
When are you going?

657
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,760
Today.

658
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:50,150
I'll go home and pack up later, and then I'll leave.

659
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:55,150
Why don't you tell me when you get there?

660
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:57,480
Type.

661
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,720
You know many things have happened recently.

662
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,410
I didn't have the chance to tell you.

663
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,560
Yes.

664
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:09,150
Forget it.

665
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,880
You have to work.

666
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,340
Yes.

667
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,090
How many days do you have to go?

668
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,010
Two weeks.

669
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:23,930
Type.

670
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:27,980
If I finish early,

671
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,180
I'll come back to you as soon as possible.

672
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,540
Okay?

673
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,560
Thank you for sending me here.

674
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:52,910
Have a safe trip.

675
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,520
I am leaving.

676
00:47:58,530 --> 00:47:59,620
Bye, Type.

677
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:00,660
Okay.

678
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:14,880
I'll leave this to you.

679
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,350
If there's anything urgent, you can use it.

680
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:18,160
Don't worry, Brother.

681
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:19,780
Phugun has told me.

682
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:20,970
Okay.

683
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,170
I'll get going.

684
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:23,910
Or else, when I get there tonight, it will be very late.

685
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:25,270
Brother Tharn.

686
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:27,900
Text Phugun when you arrive.

687
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,500
He's always worried.

688
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,250
Okay, thank you.

689
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:31,680
Okay.

690
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:38,540
Thiwat.

691
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:45,710
What did you make for me?

692
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:48,950
What did I do?

693
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:50,490
Something made so carelessly...

694
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:51,910
Even kids can do better than you.

695
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,980
Has anyone taught you to always think about your professional reputation

696
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:58,620
when you do everything,

697
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,990
rather than doing such a shameful thing?

698
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,650
What do you refer to?

699
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:10,420
He refers to you kissing your man at the hospital gate.

700
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,530
I don't care

701
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,950
what you do in your free time.

702
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,040
But this is a hospital.

703
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,280
It's a workplace.

704
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,070
It's a sacred place.

705
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,180
It's okay if you don't have a brain to think,

706
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,260
but at least think about the reputation of the department.

707
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:35,110
I'm sorry.

708
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:37,300
I won't let this happen again.

709
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,390
You probably don't have much time left.

710
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,900
Also, tell your man...

711
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,330
Although he is a fool,

712
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,780
and no one has educated him well,

713
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,980
let him know what this place is.

714
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:56,750
And you'd better get a checkup too.

715
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:59,450
I'm afraid your patient won't trust you.

716
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,630
Most importantly,

717
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:08,430
take your partner to check his body.

718
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,840
Make the check more detailed.

719
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:13,290
I am afraid that...

720
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:17,980
He would have many viruses.

721
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,120
Type, calm down.

722
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:25,510
Type.

723
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:26,640
You can look down on me,

724
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:29,040
but don't insult Tharn.

725
00:51:46,830 --> 00:52:10,900
[He has lost integrity.]

726
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:53,930
[TT1: Comrades, have you known it?]

727
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:55,900
[TT2: Oh, my God. I am so surprised that I almost drop my chin.]

728
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,470
[TT3: He didn't reflect on himself at all.]

729
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:01,070
[TT4: He doesn't care about etiquette and occasion at all. He kissed in the hospital.]

730
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:03,000
[TT3: Doesn't he feel ashamed at all?]

731
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,820
[TT4: Do you know who he is?]

732
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:10,900
[TT1: Type. He's in the Sports Medicine Department.]
