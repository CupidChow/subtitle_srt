Don't run!

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,300
I'm afraid I can't catch up with you.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,129
Are you really going to resign?

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,730
I think I've made myself clear.

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,080
I have a boyfriend.

10

Then go and like someone else.

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,350
I don't want to fight with my boyfriend.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,480

Does it hurt?

20

Can't it be me, Brother Type?

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,270
I have no one by my side now.

22
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,910
I really have no one.

Didn't you say you'd be back tomorrow?

35
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,540
I wanted to give you a surprise.

But I didn't expect you to give me such a surprise.

If I hadn't come back,

I'm afraid I wouldn't see what you're doing behind me.

39
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,720
I didn't do anything.

40
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,520
You didn't do anything?

41
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,080
I saw you kissing him.

00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,670
Don't tell me that this is what you've been doing

46

I thought you were sick.

I thought you needed me.

49
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,860
And I worked dog-tired to get back to you

50
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,640
just to see you cheat on me?

51
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,580
If it were you,

52
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,280
how would you feel, Type?

I beg you, Tharn.

61
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,840
You two should sit down and talk at home.

62
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,620
It's not good for Type if you fight here.

I'm Type's boyfriend.

I don't know what the relationship between you two is.

But I'm warning you.

Stop pestering Type.

What if I say no?

72
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,710
You probably don't know

73
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,880
how I look when I get angry.

74
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,140
I won't let you off easily

75
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,470
just because you're young.

76
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,280
I will kill you.

77
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:30,910
Darn it.

78
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,080
Calm down, Type.

79
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,409
So what happened?

80
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,350
I don't know what happened.

81
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,300
But I guess it's the kid who started it.

82
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,280
But no matter what happens,

83
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,830
you need to calm down and stay rational, understand?

84
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,140
Stay rational. And then?

85
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,560
He doesn't trust me.

86
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,110
He thinks I cheated on him.

87
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,290
He thinks I kissed that kid.

88
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,900
He should know better than anyone.

89
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,340
I would never do that.

90
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,070
But why doesn't he trust me?

91
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,140
Why did he think that I would do that behind his back?

92
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,250
I'm angry because he doesn't trust me.

93
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,680
I missed him so much that I'm going crazy!

94
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,280
I missed him so much that I feel like dying.

95
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,419
Every day, I wished he'd come back to me.

96
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,570
I've been with him for 7 years.

97
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,049
Seven years.

98
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,830
I've never fallen in love with anyone except him.

99
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,630
Darn it.

100
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,560
I didn't have to wait for 7 years if I wanted to cheat on him.

101
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,160
Then you have to tell him.

102
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,780
Now?

103
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,000
He won't listen to me.

104
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,200
But you have to communicate, right?

105
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,380
Yes.

106
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,050
But not now.

107
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,560
I even want to kill him now.

108
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,240
Calm down.

109
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,280
Calm down.

110
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,040
We need to talk.

111
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,570
Not now.

112
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,900
But I want to talk now.

113
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,390
I didn't kiss him.

114
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,370
Then what did I see?

115
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,800
He dragged me over and kissed me.

116
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,720
The Type I know

117
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,890
is not stupid enough to let others kiss him.

118
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,580
Do you think I wanted to kiss him?

119
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,500

when I was not around?

127
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,650
I don't think you had a soccer game, right?

128
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,430
I didn't.

129

You're so busted, aren't you?

130

00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,200
What's wrong?

172
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,550
One wants to eat.

173
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,380
-The other wants to sleep.
-Yes.

174
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,900
-Is this a restaurant or a hotel?
-It's a hotel.

175
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,810
This way, please.

176
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,390
Let him know whose restaurant this is.

177
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:40,930
So that Fiat kissed you.

178
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:45,050
And Tharn happened to see you two being lovey-dovey.

179
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,910
That's why he made a fuss, right?

180
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,340
Yes.

181
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,770
I knew it.

182
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,160
Then...

183
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,000
Are you really breaking up with Tharn?

184
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,140
I didn't say that.

185
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,050
I just want to be apart and calm down.

186
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,720
-Just be apart for a while...
-I'll hit your face.

187
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,970
You jerk.

188
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,770
Type.

189
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,260
Tharn thought you wanted to break up with him.

190
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,330
I didn't say that.

191
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,900
But you just ran out like that, my friend.

192
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,050
You look like you're breaking up.

193
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,090
I don't know what to say.

194
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,220
But he doesn't look well.

195
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,910
I think he's very sad.

196
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,570
How about your bro? Am I not sad

197
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,970
to hear his damn words saying that I cheated on him?

198
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,860
Bro, you 'damned' at me just now.

199
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,110
Oh, I'm sorry.

200
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,640
Then what are you going to do?

201
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,300
Think carefully.

202
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,940
You've been dating him for so long.

203
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,300
You can't give up because of that Fiat kid.

204
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,490
You have to teach him a lesson, understand?

205
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:09,920
Wait.

206
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,589
I remember the doctor told me about him.

207
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:18,990
What did he say?

208
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,270
That kid likes you, right, Type?

209
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,069
Doctor said there's another kid who likes him.

210
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,990
If we make them fall in love with each other,

211
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,340
the problem will be solved.

212
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,790
You're a genius. Amazing.

213
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,610
What did you eat today? Why are you so smart?

214
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,830
You're usually dumb as hell.

215
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,570
-You asked for it.
-Calm down.

216
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,520
It's close to my foot.

217
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,780
What a great angle.

218
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,910
Hey, what are you thinking, my friend?

219
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,240
I know what I should do.

220
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,920
Go to sleep now. Would you look at the time?

221
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,980
You're so dramatic.

222
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,710
In the end, you still have to wait for Tharn to coax you first.

223
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,880
And you'll be soft-hearted again, you fool.

224
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,000
Where are you going?

225
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,130
Me?

226
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,250
I'm going to get some wine to fill my blood.

227
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,190
I can't live without alcohol lately.

228
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,360
Every time Fiat came to the hospital,

229
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,700
I saw someone accompanying him.

230
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,780
I may be thinking too much.

231
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,850
But I don't think the way he looked at Fiat

232
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,340
was the way you would look at your friend.

233
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,060
Fiat valued that person greatly too.

234
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:51,040
But what I remember most clearly is his eyes.

235
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,410
Those eyes were filled

236
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,040
with affection.

237
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,820
I remember his name is Leo.

238
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,900
How's your leg?

239
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,810
-It's fine.
-It's okay, right?

240
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:10,880
Yes.

241
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,450
Leo.

242
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,160
Let me ask you seriously.

243
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,380
What happened between you two?

244
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,500
You didn't talk to him.

245
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,530
Every time he sees you, he looks like he's going to cry.

246
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,540
Nothing.

247
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,500
Leo, how many years have we been friends?

248
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,030
No matter how much you speak ill of Fiat,

249
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,560
you still worry about him.

250
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,300
You're just like his father.

251
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,210
Everyone on the team is very nervous now.

252
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,000
Please say sorry for me.

253
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,990
I think you should tell him yourself.

254
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,450
About what?

255
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,190
About what you're thinking.

256
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,750
I can't.

257
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,780
Because I don't want to lose him.

258
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,170
♫Try to be the one who sees you crying every time♫

259
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:59,340
♫I hold it in until you turn around♫

260
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,070
Damn it.

261
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,340
♫Only then will I let my tears fall♫

262
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,060
How can I tell him?

♫You'll see who's the one next to you♫

264
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,630
If I tell him,

265
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,930
I'll lose him for sure.

266
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:14,830
♫I‘m willing to be yours and to never leave♫

267
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,300
I can't tell.

268
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,380
I can't lose him.

269
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:21,090
♫I'll be here, and I'll never disappear♫

270
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,160
I want to talk to you.

271
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,960
Fiat is not a bad person.

272
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,550
He just went through too much.

273
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,890
Everyone has experienced a lot.

274
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,840
But that doesn't make up the reason for him to do that.

275
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,050
Let me ask you.

276
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,520
If you love him, why don't you have him?

277
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,890
Why did you let him pester others?

278
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,040
I...

279
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,710
I can't do it.

280
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,940
You can't do it, or you never try to?

281
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,080
He only treats me as a friend.

282
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,780
That's why I'm asking you.

283
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,070
Is it that you can't do it, or that you never try to?

284
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,190
I...

285
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,780
I once thought we could be more than friends.

286
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,340
But he never thought of me in that way.

287
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,160
I don't want to lose him.

288
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,680
I'd rather stay friends with him.

289
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,310
It's better than him leaving me.

290
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,890
If that's all you can think of, then you can stay pained.

291
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,140
Then what do you want me to do?

292
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,150
Tell me.

293
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,970
What should I do to make him look at me?

294
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,040
Just like how he looks at you.

295
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,300
Shall we work together?

Phugun heard you had a fight with Type yesterday.

336
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:25,040
He called me because he was worried about you.

337
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,270
What happened?

338
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,480
Sorry, I told Brother Thorn.

339
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,480
But I'm really worried about you.

340
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,440
So what happened?

341
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,780
I had a fight with him.

342
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,940
He said we should be apart for a while.

343
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,640
What do you mean?

344
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,870
Type promised me that he won't break up with you.

345
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,140
Brother Type didn't say he was having a breakup.

346
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,700
Brother Tharn.

347
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,350
I don't believe Brother Type will break up with you.

348
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,890
That's impossible.

349
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:14,850
That's right. I don't think Brother Type meant that.

350
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:18,620
He's been thinking about you and worrying about you.

351
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,350
Although I haven't known Brother Type for long,

352
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,740
I know he would never say that.

353
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,490
But Type said to be apart for a while...

354
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:29,750
For me...

355
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,930
Brother Thorn, stop it.

356
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:36,310
Please, Brother Tharn. You have to trust Brother Type.

357
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,220
But now,

358
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,180
I can't think of anything, Thanya.

359
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,030
I miss him so much.

360
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,060
Go take a shower.

361
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:58,450
Your brain will figure it out when you feel better.

362
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:00,680
Let's go.

363
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,490
Right, Brother Tharn. Go take a shower.

364
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,680
Let's go.

365
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,940
Thanya and I will help you clean your room.

366
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,310
Let's go.

367
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,610
What about me?

368
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,190
Just stay quiet.

369
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,940
Where is Brother Thorn?

370
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,870
I drove him back.

371
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:49,920
Have you eaten?

372
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,160
Do you want me to make you something to eat?

373
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,860
No, I'm not hungry yet.

374
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,370
You guys fought because of the owner of this fountain pen, right?

375
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,770
If it's the person who came over when Brother Type was sick,

376
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,740
I can guarantee that nothing happened.

377
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,050
He came in on his own.

378
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,120
Brother Type was too sick to get up.

379
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,000
Trust me.

380
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,150
Brother Tharn.

381
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,170
It's okay.

382
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:33,090
I think you two should go back first.

383
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:38,860
But...

384
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,640
Thanya,

385
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,700
I want to stay alone for a while.

386
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,140
I'm sober now.

387
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,220
So,

388
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,500
I won't do anything stupid.

389
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,870
Give me some time.

390
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,580
I want to be alone.

391
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,170
Sure.

392
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,250
Gosh, it's hot.

393
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,430
Today, for those who were born on Friday,

394
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,990
if you want to be lucky,

395
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,740
you must cross the threshold with your right foot first.

396
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:02,630
No.

397
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,410
Oh, my. Is this lucky?

398
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,300
-Hello?
-No.

399
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,730
You always come to me whenever something happens.

400
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,030
What's wrong, Tharn?

401
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,580
Is Type with you?

402
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,340
What happened?

403
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,930
Or something bad happened to Type? Oh, my God!

404
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,530
No.

405
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,770
Tharn.

406
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,250
You know I can't tell you.

407
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,780
So don't ask me.

408
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,890
At least tell me

409
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,550
what happened while I was away.

410
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,030
I'm hungry.

411
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,590
See you.

412
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,460
Let's run for now. Let's go inside.

413
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,880
Damn it, the door is locked.

414
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,290
Gosh, what's going on?

415
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,220
[Restaurant No. 5]

416
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,380
Type, you're here.

417
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,120
Darn it.

418
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,910
What's wrong?

419
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,370
Wait. Let me take a break.

420
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,950
I almost had a heart attack.

421
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,210
Champ, come here.

422
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,860
I have something to tell you. Hurry.

423
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,930
No, you guys talk.

424
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,720
I'll get back to work.

425
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,680
Come here. It's better when you listen to it here. Hurry.

426
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,250
No, I have a lot of work to do.

427
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,330
I'll listen from here.

428
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,730
What's wrong with you?

429
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,800
Okay, I'll tell you.

430
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,750
Do you know who I met today?

431
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:00,750
Who?

432
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,450
I met Tharn today.

433
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,370
Aren't you excited?

434
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,770
You know what?

435
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,700
Tharn waited for me at my workplace.

436
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,340
I thought I was done for.

437
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,870
Fortunately, I've accumulated a lot of merits.

438
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,790
By the way, I didn't say anything about your whereabouts or what you're doing.

439
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,410
I didn't say a thing.

440
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,600
I swear.

441
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,660
And about our plan,

442
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,570
I didn't tell him either.

443
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:33,950
Really.

444
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,040
-So?
-You...

445
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,360
Here's the thing.

446
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,110
Tharn asked me to tell you that he wants to talk to you now.

447
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,070
Tharn has calmed down.

448
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,010
In my opinion,

449
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,630
you should talk to him now. I'm serious.

450
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,520
So that you can put an end to everything.

451
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,050
Not now.

452
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:09,270
Type, if you don't talk now,

453
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,000
when are you going to talk?

454
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,659
I can't talk to him yet,

455
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,080
not until I have taken care of everything.

456
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,260
What's wrong with you?

457
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,590
Champ, come and wake your friend up.

458
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:25,810
Type.

459
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,050
You're doing this again.

460
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,170
You were like that with Lhong too.

461
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,820
Are you going to do it again with Fiat?

462
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,370
Are you?

463
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,400
Yes.

464
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:35,820
What?

465
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,170
I'll fix him.

466
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,130
Why is he so unreasonable?

467
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,920
Is there no other way?

468
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,520
No.

469
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,830
You know me. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

470
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,780
Those memories are back.

471
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,420
Champ, let me clean the plates for you.

472
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,350
Damn it. Why is he so angry?

473
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,480
Wash your dishes.

474
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,130
Put the knife in a safe place.

475
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,470
Otherwise, he would stab me, not Tharn.

476
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,000
Is anyone here?

477
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,860
Leave me alone.

478
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:36,460
Did you come alone?

479
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,230
Did you get dumped?

480
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,080
I told you to leave me alone.

481
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,520
Do you want me to comfort you?

482
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,800
At least it's better than being alone on a day like this.

483
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,430
Are you sure?

484
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,450
You might get into jail this time.

485
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,980
If you're still a coward,

486
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,420
just keep enduring this kind of situation.

487
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,990
I'm sure.

488
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,130
Okay.

489
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,360
Have you ever been like this?

490
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,880
When you need someone,

491
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,580
but no one wants you.

492
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,080
When I was young,

493
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,860
I used to be very disobedient.

494
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,160
Because I was worried that I might lose my dad.

495
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,490
But he ended up abandoning me

496
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,890
to be with my new mom now.

497
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,280
Now that I've grown up,

498
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,870
I just need someone.

499
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,690
But no one wants me.

500
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,490
Maybe I was born to be like this.

501
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,930
No one wants me.

502
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,490
Tonight,

503
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,630
do you want me to accompany you?

504
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,740
Sure.

505
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,000
I have no choice.

506
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,270
You're awake.

507
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,680
Who are you?

508
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,140
Why did you kidnap me? What are you doing?

509
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:12,870
Let go of me!

510
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,270
Don't you remember me?

511
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,630
Brother Type.

512
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:29,800
I'm glad

513
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:35,240
that you still remember me after you caused me so much trouble.

514
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,830
What are you going to do to me?

515
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,980
What should I do?

516
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,230
What if I take revenge on you?

517
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,050
Let go of me!

518
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,610
You can do anything, but don't touch my knee.

519
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,190
Let go!

520
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,850
I beg you.

521
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,070
Let me go.

522
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,280
Don't do that.

523
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,890
Do you want me to pity you?

524
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:17,570
No.

525
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,460
I'm willing to do anything.

526
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,080
Let me go.

527
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,410
I have nothing left.

528
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,480
If I can't play basketball, I really have nothing.

529
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,050
Why did you do that?

530
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,420
Please let me go, brother. Please.

531
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,180
I asked you why did you do that?

532
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,710
I just need someone.

533
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,490
So why me?

534
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,980
Because you were worried about me.

535
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,890
You saw the value in me.

536
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,530
No one saw my value.

537
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,390
Dad, mom, and sister...

538
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,880
None of them cares about me.

539
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,620
I know you have a boyfriend.

540
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,590
But I'm jealous.

541
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,030
I just want someone like you.

542
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,490
I want someone like you.

543
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,890
Am I wrong?

544
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,300
Yes.

545
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,880
You were wrong the moment you wanted to mess with someone's boyfriend.

546
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,880
If they cared just a bit about me,

547
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,670
I wouldn't have done that.

548
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:57,370
Who would love you when you are like this?

549
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,130
Right.

550
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,790
Who will love me?

551
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,720
No one.

552
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,870
I was born to be hated.

553
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,650
Even those who swore to be by my side...

554
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:19,770
No matter what I've done to irritate him,

555
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,750
he stays indifferent.

556
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:30,510
Even if I sleep with someone else, he's still indifferent.

557
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,520
Even if I can't play basketball with him anymore,

558
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,770
he's still indifferent.

559
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,590
I want you to care more about me.

560
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,610
But you hate me.

561
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:58,020
You don't want to get involved with me anymore

562
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,800
You don't want to see my face anymore.

563
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,100
You don't want to take care of me anymore.

564
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,830
I have nothing left.

565
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:28,570
Next time, don't do that again.

566
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,730
If you love someone, make sure to grab him tight.

567
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,100
Don't provoke him like this.

568
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:58,570
If you love someone, grab him tight.

569
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,610
Goodness.

570
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:17,880
Are you done?

571
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,160
Is someone here?

572
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,130
Hey, how is it?

573
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,250
Tell me.

574
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:33,540
I should be hating that kid.

575
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:35,360
But I pity him instead.

576
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,190
Wait. Pity him?

577
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,400
-Yes.
-Why?

578
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:43,860
How do you know they like each other?

579
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:47,000
I didn't know either.

580
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,360
Huh? What do you mean?

581
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:56,440
I just trusted my instinct.

582
00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:00,450
That kid just wanted to win me over.

583
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,140
He doesn't want me.

584
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:03,730
Really?

585
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,330
Wait.

586
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,520
Let me summarize.

587
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:12,470
Those two caused you to fight so hard with Tharn.

588
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:16,640
But you set them up together.

589
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:18,090
Yes.

590
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,810
I don't think so.

591
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:23,760
Please.

592
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:29,030
The Type I know isn't that kind.

593
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,790
What's going on? Tell me.

594
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:34,240
-I'm not that kind indeed.
-Yes.

595
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,140
But if they're together,

596
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,380
no one will pester me.

597
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,230
And no one will bother Tharn either.

598
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,670
-I see.
-Just to make sure nothing goes wrong,

599
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,540
It's just to have someone keep an eye on Fiat.

600
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,590
In this way, I'll be relieved. That's all.

601
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,490
You're so smart.

602
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:59,360
Alright, don't worry.

603
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,200
It's good.

604
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,750
Do you remember what Type said?

605
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:06,740
His signature phrase.

606
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:09,550
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

607
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:12,300
He's serious.

608
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,470
-That punk.
-I'm scared too.

609
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,340
-Don't be scared.
-Let's go.

610
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,670
I'm more scared.

611
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,890
I thought he was up to something when he kidnapped that kid.

612
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,910
Don't hurt me.

613
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,450
Let go of me!

614
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,990
This will never happen to you.

615
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,010
If you turn around and look at the person who truly loves you.

616
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:31,930
Fiat.

617
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,310
Leo.

618
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:37,960
My dad doesn't love me anymore. He doesn't love me.

619
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:43,460
He kicked me out.

620
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,700
No one wants me anymore.

621
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:51,490
If no one wants me, why would I be born?

622
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,490
Don't think like that.

623
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,900
You have to love yourself first.

624
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,990
If you don't love yourself,

625
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:01,310
how can you let others love you?

626
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,180
If I love myself,

627
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,600
would you love me?

628
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:09,940
Yes.

629
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,980
Live with me.

630
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,000
If no one loves you,

631
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,940
I'll love you, Fiat.

632
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:34,710
Did you see me now?

633
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:36,650
The one who sees your value.

634
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:42,560
♫You'll see who's the one next to you♫

635
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,350

♫I'll be here, and I'll never disappear♫

639
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:54,620
I'm so scared.

640
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:58,250
Brother Type was going to destroy my knee.

641
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:01,170
I can't play basketball with you anymore.

642
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:07,240
I'm going to lose everything.

643
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,730
I'm scared.

644
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:15,580
Even if you can't play basketball,

645
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:22,370
I promise I will always be by your side.

646
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,630
You're lying.

647
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:31,140
You don't want to get involved with me anymore.

648
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,820
You don't want to see me anymore.

649
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,530
You don't care either when I get together

650
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:41,590
with someone else to provoke you.

651
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:43,530
Who says I don't?

652
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,560
Do you know

653
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:55,990
how hurt I was when I saw you with someone else?

654
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:07,580
I thought I was only a friend to you.

655
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:09,340
I love you.

♫I want you to know everything hidden in my heart♫

♫I'll be here, and I'll never disappear♫

I have nothing to say.

Phugun.

683
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,750
My boyfriend asked me to hit on another man.

684
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:56,150
How am I supposed to feel about that?

685
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,600
But Brother Type begged me.

686
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:05,200
I'm your boyfriend.

687
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:09,350
How can you let me pursue someone else?

688
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,840
I just want to help Brother Type.

689
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:18,210
Brother Type said no one is more suitable than you.

690
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,340
Cirrus.

691
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,960
You were super handsome when you hit on that boy

692
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:30,150
with that cold look.

693
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,490
I fell in love with you right away.

695
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,260
Cirrus.

696
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,650
Hello! Hello! Test, test.

697
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:03,500
What are you doing, Phu?

698
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:08,330
I'm not Phugun, I'm Coco.

699
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:11,990
Phugun asked me to tell the handsome Cirrus.

700
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:15,870
Please don't be mad, okay? Let's make up.

701
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,460
Let's make up.

702
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:23,190
Should I make up with the one who asked me to hit on someone else?

703
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,970
But Coco thinks that's because Phugun has trust in you.

704
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,490
He believes you when you say that you love him.

705
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:41,580
So, let's make up. Please, please, please, please.

706
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:44,290
Handsome Cirrus, please make up with Phugun.

707
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,270
Please? Let's make up, okay?

708
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:49,270

Yes?

Let's make up.

712
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:05,570
Please?

713

Please? Let's make up.

♫You are my whole world, you know?♫

716

Then don't.

717
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,070
Only me winning against you is enough.
