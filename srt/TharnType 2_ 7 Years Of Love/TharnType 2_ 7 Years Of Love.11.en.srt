Are you deaf?

00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,250
Dad.

13
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,450
Walk carefully. Be careful not to trip over.

14
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,310
You jerk.

15
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,940
What's going on? Why do you look so upset? Why are you irritable?

16
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,040
How can I not be irritable? Look at you.

17
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,040
It's nothing serious.

18
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,550
What? Do you want me to get hurt even more?

19
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,800
No.

20
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,220
But when you called me, I was scared out of my wits.

21
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,130
I didn't scold you, but you also need to reflect on yourself.

22
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,640
How dare you make me reflect!

23
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,779
Dad, be careful.

24
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,300
You'll get another injury if you fall.

25
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,740
What?

26
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,910
I made such a small mistake. Are you going to mock me until my grandson becomes a monk?

27
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,110
Let's go, Dad.

28
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,080
You should go inside and sit.

29
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,420
If the wound on your foot suppurates, you'll have to trouble others again.

30
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,909
No. My son is at home now.

31
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,670
Why should I bother someone else?

32
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:59,640
If anything happens to me... You have to take me to the clinic.

33
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,220
Come on. Dad, sit down.

34
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,600
I am excellent in health.

35
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,150
Are you really okay?

36
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,360
Luckily, I resigned.

37
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,420
If I hadn't quit, even if you sawed your leg...

38
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,090
I wouldn't have known if the bad boss would let me take a leave.

39
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,020
That's good. You can come back to live at home.

40
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,710
Dad, after the long break...

41
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,200
No.

42
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,190
I might have to go back when your leg recovers.

43
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,080
Hey.

44
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,310
Is it because of that foreigner? Tell me.

45
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,080
I think you should come home to live.

46
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,330
If Bangkok's job is so bad, come and work for me.

47
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,420
If that foreigner misses you, he'll come to you.

48
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,100
As if he'll come...

49
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,900
Good. Then break up with him.

50
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,950
I've always hated him.

51
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,690
I'm sick of you too. You always ask me to break up with him.

52
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,710
I won't break up with him no matter what.

53

How dare you talk to your dad like this?

54
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,200
Mom, look at your husband.

55
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,940
He's injured, but he still doesn't restrain himself. Take him inside.

56

59
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,120

60

I am leaving.

61

We should just break up now.

62
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,990
Darn it.

63
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,440

want you to coax me.

You are also aware of this matter.

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,850
You brought him in.

What?

70
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,380
Damn it.

71

Hey.

72
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,290
Why am I so unlucky?

73
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,430
It's just a bag of noodles. I can't even cook it.

74
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,410
Why am I so stupid?

75
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,620
Why, Type?

76
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,050
Why can't I live

77
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,250
without you?

78
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,550
Hey.

79
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,730
You want to know it, right, Type?

80
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,780
Yes?

81
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,670
I can't live without you.

82
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,720
I'm pathetic.

83
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,270
Are you satisfied?

84
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,610
So you came back feeling depressed

85
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,150
and being a handsome guy abandoned by his wife?

86
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,320
Even if it's you, if you say that... I'll get mad too.

87
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,810
I was just kidding.

88
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,780
Brother Type said he'll never break up with you.

89
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,990
But now,

90
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,480
he went home to be with his parents.

91
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,970
He had to go back to take care of his parents.

92
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,340
Didn't you say his dad hurt his leg?

93
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,970
If you feel aggrieved because of this... I don't think it's fair.

94
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,110
I am not feeling aggrieved, Dad.

95
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,790
You are stubborn.

96
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,720
Whose sister are you?

97
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,550
I'm the sister of you two.

98
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,120
So you two should make up soon

99
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,140
and be my cute brothers as before.

100
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,400
Thanya, aren't you going to the cast and crew today?

101
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,920
You're going to be late.

102
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,010
Go, Your Highness.

103
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,830
Thorn should be waiting for you in the car.

104
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,520
-Don't think too much.
-Okay.

105
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,530
Brother Type really loves you.

106
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,070
I'm leaving.

107
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,290
Bye. Good luck.

108
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,470
Did you have a fight with Type?

109
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,100
You don't have to turn around to look at your dad.

110
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,600
I know it even if he doesn't tell me.

111
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,410
Tharn, I don't know what the problem is between you and Type,

112
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,130
but as someone who's been married for over 30 years, I want to say...

113
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,680
What your mom wants to explain to you is

114
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,800
two people's lives require communication.

115
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,730
If people don't communicate,

116
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,210
no matter how much they love each other, the relationship will end.

117
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,940
Do you understand, Tharn?

118
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,380
Well...

119
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,020
Type.

120
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,470
I saw him staying with another man.

121
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,880
Did you ask him who that man was?

122
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,320
He said he was a patient.

123
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,820
You don't believe him, do you?

124
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,240
Tharn, if you don't believe him, there's nothing wrong with you.

125
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,150
Because I've misunderstood your dad a few times.

126
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,230
We've also argued until our house almost collapsed.

127
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,360
But your dad proved that I was the only one he had at last.

128
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:31,990
So you mean you also want me to coax him, right?

129
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,860
You may be very stubborn right now, and you may not listen to others.

130
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,530
But I have to tell you one thing, and you need to remember it with your heart.

131
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,420
Being stubborn won't make things better.

132
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:10,450
Both of you are young now. Both of you take it to heart.

133
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,200
You know...

134
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:20,410
I believe you're not the only one who's sad now.

135
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,820
Yes, I've proved it myself.

136
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,910
How about this? I'll cook what you like tonight.

137
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:36,880
Okay.

138
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,770
Okay.

139
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,310
Let's go. I'm going to the kitchen first.

140
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,440
Let me help.

141
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,070
I want to see how long you can stay with me in the kitchen.

142
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,310
A heart is more important than ability.

143
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,890
The father and son in this family are the same.

144
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,260
Type.

145
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,680
If I apologize to you,

146
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,800
you'll come back, right?

147
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,960
Are you still thinking too much?

148
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,590
I don't know.

149
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,870
I'm scared...

150
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,080
And I feel guilty too.

151
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,670
Can you tell me?

152
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,210
I...

153
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,840
I don't know how to face Brother Type when I see him again.

154
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,170
Then apologize to him with me.

155
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,480
I can't do that.

156
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,580
I promise I'll be by your side.

157
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,820
Okay.

158
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,490
But you have to go with me.

159
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,760
Type.

160
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,080
You and I

161
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,730
have never been apart for so long.

162
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,350
-What's for lunch today?
-A lot.

163
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,790
-Look at that car. Do you want to drive it?
-No.

164
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,660
Go back to your room and put the stuff there.

165
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,090
-I want to eat this.
-Which one?

166
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,340
This one.

167
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:18,900
Let's eat at home.

168
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,750
It's okay. I'm here.

169
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:31,720
Wait.

170
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,080
Can I talk to you?

171
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,830
Just for a moment.

172
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,510
But I have nothing to talk about with you.

173
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,840
I want to apologize.

174
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:55,860
For everything...

175
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,490
We're not the ones whom you should apologize to.

176
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,690
I know.

177
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,740
Fiat wants to apologize to him too.

178
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,370
What's going on, Phu?

179
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,280
It's a long story, Brother Tharn.

180
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,810
Tharn, let's talk inside.

181
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,360
Okay?

182
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,850
Okay?

183
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,250
OK.

184
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,760
What do you want to say?

185
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,680
Just say it.

186
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,360
Well, Brother,

187
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,980
I really want to apologize to you.

188
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,280
I caused you trouble.

189
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,110
I'm the reason why you fought with Brother Type.

190
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,090
I'm not happy about what I did.

191
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,290
I really want to apologize to you.

192
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,400
I'm sorry. I did these things without thinking.

193
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,390
I've reflected on myself.

194
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,810
Besides,

195
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,480
please apologize to Brother Type for me.

196
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,730
I don't know if he'll forgive me.

197
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,370
I'm really sorry.

198
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,120
Phu!

199
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,720
Here you are.

200
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,510
I...

201
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,750
I'll tell Type that you have apologized to him.

202
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,630
Thank you.

203
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,900
Be careful. Behind you. Behind you.

204
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,540
Almost.

205
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,670
Type, where are you going?

206
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,430
Come on. Let's talk.

207
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,210
What will we talk about, Dad?

208
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,460
Sit down.

209
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:54,460
Hey.

210
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,420
Do you remember their daughter who went to Chiang Mai to study?

211
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,130
Which one? There are many.

212
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:06,650
The daughter from that family is beautiful and has a good figure.

213
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,490
No, I don't remember her.

214
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,720
What the hell is going on? How come your brain is worse than mine?

215
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,420
The girl with a fine figure and plump hips.

216
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,490
What if I don't remember?

217
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,720
Do you want to have sex with her at such an age?

218
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,100
Hey, you!

219
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,130
You still don't get it?

220
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,730
No. I don't want to get it either.

221
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,560
Wait.

222
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,630
Where are you going?

223
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,720
I'm going out, Dad. I have an appointment with Kom.

224
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,400
That's good.

225
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,700
You can say hello to his sister by the way.

226
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,640
Why should I? I can't remember her even if I go to say hello.

227
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,610
She probably doesn't remember me either.

228
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,170
Who said that?

229
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,630
She brought snacks today.

230
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,940
She saw you and said she hadn't seen you for a long time.

231
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,220
Her eyes are like this...

232
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,300
They are both pink.

233
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,100
I told you she remembers you.

234
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,500
Go say hello to her.

235
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,340
She's pretty.

236
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,620
She's prettier than your mom when she was young.

237
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,870
What exactly do you want to say? Say it.

238
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,830
I want a daughter-in-law.

239
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:17,070
You must pursue her and let her become my daughter-in-law.

240
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,730
Listen to me.

241
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:25,470
No matter how beautiful a woman you find me,

242
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,360
or a girl with breasts as big as watermelons...

243
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,320
I'm not interested.

244
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,220
Because your son is seeing someone.

245
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,920
What's important is

246
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,580
your son is seeing a man.

247
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,270
You don't have to drive a wedge between us to make us break up because we won't break up no matter what.

248
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,830
We're still dating.

249
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,920
We're just living apart.

250
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,430
How vulgar!

251
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,050
You don't love yourself. You're vulgar.

252
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,180
How dare you say that?

253
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:04,270
Mom, Dad said he wants his neighbor's daughter to be his mistress.

254
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,840
She's much prettier than you.

255
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,120
Your bad mouth. Who said that?

256
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,870
-Come back, you bastard.
-I am leaving, Dad.

257
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,190
Come back. Come back first.

258
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,950
Look at what he said.

259
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,170
Hey!

260
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,000
Hey, calm down.

261
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,470
What's going on? You drank a bottle as soon as you arrived.

262
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,020
Is there anything bothering you?

263
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,850
I had a fight with my dad.

264
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,060
Fighting?

265
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,980
What did you argue about?

266
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,110
Look how much he dotes on you.

267
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,000
He wants me to get married to a woman.

268
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,530
But you have

269
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,110
already had a boyfriend, right?

270
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,290
Look. You're drinking again.

271
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,550
A boyfriend who I am fighting with.

272
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,220
Don't tell me that

273
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,560
you were fighting, so you ran back here.

274
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,590
Do you think I'm so cowardly?

275
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,590
My dad hurt his leg. I came back to see him.

276
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,380
I happened to fight with him recently.

277
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,930
You quarreled and then separated.

278
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,250
It isn't good.

279
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,540
Yes, I know.

280
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,440
It's simple. Go back and make up with him.

281
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,170
I'm right about this.

282
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:14,040
Type, no one is right or wrong when two people fall in love.

283
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,210
He said I cheated on him.

284
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,760
What?

285
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,020
And then?

286
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,920
I said, "If you don't believe me, let's be apart for a while."

287
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,290
Type.

288
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,030
You shouldn't have said this.

289
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,000
You know what...

290
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:50,960
You're punishing him. It's like you're torturing yourself.

291
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,690
Because he was being unreasonable.

292
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:59,280
When two people are dating, they make trouble for no reason.

293
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,020
Are you a good guy?

294
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,570
Are you going to say that you never make trouble?

295
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,210
You don't know what Tharn looked like.

296
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,130
He always thinks too much about me.

297
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,360
He always talks about marriage.

298
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,090
How can we get married when we're both men?

299
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,550
He's jealous of everything.

300
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,180
In the future, when I go to the bathroom, he will be jealous of the toilet too.

301
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,340
You know what...

302
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,510
Everything you're saying now indicates one thing.

303
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,610
You're showing off how much your boyfriend loves you.

304
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,620
Enough. I won't fight with you today.

305
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,920
Please shut up.

306
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,600
Alright, I was just kidding.

307
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,020
Here you are.

308
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:55,830
What is it?

309
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:02,740
My neighbor asked me to give it to your parents.

310
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,700
His son is going to become a monk.

311
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,080
Kom.

312
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,050
-What?
-Have you ever been a monk?

313
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:17,750
Yes.

314
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,210
What about you?

315
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,320
I was just getting in touch with it.

316
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,010
So,

317
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,409
are you going to become a monk?

318
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,110
Since you're back,

319
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,230
learn some Buddhist teachings to manage your family life.

320
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,690
Type.

321
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,980
Are you serious?

322
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,159
What did you say?

323
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:56,620
Why are you so loud?

324
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,110
Dad, are you deaf besides your leg injury?

325
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,100
Yes.

326
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,240
You are going to become a monk?

327
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,300
Yes, you heard me right. I am going to become a monk

328
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,340
Why so suddenly?

329
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,210
If you don't want me to become a monk,

330
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,780
-it is OK for me not to become a monk.
-Wait, son.

331
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,200
It's up to you.

332
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,670
If you are going to become a monk but don't want to become a monk in your heart,

333
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,080
you won't get any merit either.

334
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,300
Listen to me.

335
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,580
Yes.

336
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,240
Even if I can't have children,

337
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,590
I can become a monk for you.

338
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,100
I really want to do this.

339
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,910
I'm going to talk to Master tomorrow.

340
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:59,390
I won't stop you if you decided to do it.

341
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:04,040
But now, you need to take a shower first, okay?

342
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,710
Did you tell me that you wanted to become a monk after breaking the precepts?

343
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,850
You smell like alcohol all over. I don't even know how to hit you.

344
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,010
You drank so much.

345
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,480
Yes, sir.

346
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,210
-Bye. Walk properly.
-I am leaving.

347
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,330
He is going to become a monk.

348
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,000
Honey.

349
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,240
-What?
-Son is going to become a monk.

350
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,470
I heard it. I heard it too.

351
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,590
I don't know if it's because he wants to become a monk before getting married.

352
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,310
Hey, don't say anything unpleasant.

353
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,940
Who is he going to marry?

354
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:38,940
I don't want to know.

355
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,980
Enough. What marriage?

356
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,250
The TV drama is on. I want to watch it.

357
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:48,730
Look. This is my heroine. Is she pretty?

358
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,040
She is already the leading actress at such a young age.

359
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,670
Do you like her?

360
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,590
If Son had a girlfriend like this,

361
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,240
I wouldn't say a word or complain.

362
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:05,990
Honey.

363
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,230
Can you leave the child's business alone?

364
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:32,080
♫Every time you look into the vast sky♫

365
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:40,400
♫You'll see clouds floating with the wind♫

366
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:47,970
♫And disappear♫

367
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:19,920
Type.

368
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,180
Tharn.

369
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,040
I miss you.

370
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,610
[I really miss you.]

371
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,350
Tharn.

372
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:48,710
Bye.

373
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,910
Tharn, the son of a bitch!

374
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:15,500
We haven't talked for almost a month.

375
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,160
You just said, "Bye"?

376
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,860
Who do you think you are?

377
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,060
Do you want to die?

378
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,690
You want to be beaten, don't you, Tharn?

379
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,740
You bastard!

380
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,730
Die wherever you should die.

381
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,720
I won't care about you anymore.

382
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,090
Whatever you want is your business.

383
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,130
You have nothing to do with me anymore.

384
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,110
Who do you think you are?

385
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,400
Why did you do this to me?

386
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,410
♫I want you to be my last lover♫

387
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:47,220
♫The person who stays with me all the time♫

388
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,020

♫I will not make you sad♫

♫Can you hear my words, baby?♫

392
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,530
Are you really leaving me behind like this?

♫Please don't let go of my hand♫

394
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,030
It's only been seven years.

395
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,360
You said you wouldn't love anyone other than me, right?

396
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,980
You said you couldn't live without me, right?

397
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,890
It's only been seven years.

398
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,700
Why did you make me fall in love with you

399
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,970
seven years ago?

400
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,980
Is it really over like this?

401
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,530
♫I miss the time when we gazed into each other's eyes♫

Tharn.

♫Should I keep it in my heart♫

410

It's okay, Type.

412
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,880
This is good.

413
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,150
You can become a monk without distractions.

414
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,610
It's okay, Type.

415
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,430
It's nothing.

416
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,850

422
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,030
Honey, I want to rehearse first.

423
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:37,740
I'll dance like this tomorrow.

424
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:38,910
You are crazy.

425
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:41,240
Type, come here, Son.

426
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,020
Your dad is so excited that you're going to become a monk.

427
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,450
Honey, I have to be excited.

428
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:48,830
Our only son will become a monk.

429
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:55,310
I'm going to post a post tomorrow and ask the whole village to come.

430
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,310
You are crazy.

431
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:02,930
What?

432
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:05,970
What's wrong with him?

433
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:07,790
Let him be.

434
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,340
Get to work.

435
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:10,860
I'm sleepy.

436
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,130
Honey, you need to stand in the front tomorrow.

437
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:19,100
-Yes, I need to dance.
-Dance in the front.

438
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:19,540
Yes.

439
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,180
You're crazy.

440
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,290
It's like rowing a canoe.

441
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,230
Crazy man.

442
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:46,690
Dad, can you stay?

443
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,570
Last time, the doctors said you had pus on your feet because you walked.

444
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:50,840
What do you want this time?

445
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,370
Can you stay quiet for one day? No, one week.

446
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,300
How can I stay quiet? I don't like him.

447
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:05,680
Who? Mom?

448
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,870
You will get beaten by Mom later.

449
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,600
Don't act like you don't understand.

450
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,430
I haven't seen him for weeks.

451
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,730
I thought I wouldn't have to see him this year.

452
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,860
Who would have thought of...

453
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,350
Just say what you want to say.

454
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,500
Say something that others can understand.

455
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,200
I don't know.

456
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,500
Dad.

457
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,660
Damn it. This leg...

458
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,640
I will have someone tear down this door.

459
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,590
What's wrong with him?

460
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,760
-Type.
-Tharn.

461
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,720
I miss you, Type.

462
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,870
I miss you every day.

463
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:04,790
I miss you every moment.

464
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,820
Don't leave me behind again

465
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:22,610
♫Please don't let go of my hand♫

466
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:26,500
♫No matter if it's painful or happy♫

467
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:33,270
♫I'll always be by your side♫

468
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,300
Choose it. Do you want to be beaten or kicked by me?

469
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,380
I choose...

470
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:41,270
Kiss you, okay?

471
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,700
Can I put my foot in your mouth?

472
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:53,920
Well,

473
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:56,920
how are you?

474
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,380
I'm fine.

475
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:04,340
But if you had shown up yesterday... Thorn would have come to collect your body.

476
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,690
I'm sorry.

477
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:21,620
For what?

478
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:23,740
Everything.

479
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:26,110
Don't make it so vague.

480
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,590
Tell me what you did wrong.

481
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,300
Actually,

482
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:39,370
I don't think I did anything wrong.

483
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,890
But when I saw you... I admitted that it was all my fault.

484
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:54,850
I'm sorry, Type. I said something mean to you.

485
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,040
Actually, I don't like what you said to me.

486
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,720
I'm sorry.

487
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,630
But I want you to remember

488
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:14,430
I will never betray you.

489
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:18,750
If I want to do it, it will be after breaking up with you.

490
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,240
I want to

491
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,450
apologize for my carelessness.

492
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:30,980
To be frank,

493
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:37,070
there are many things I don't like about your unreasonable behaviors.

494
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,430
Actually, there are also many aspects.

495
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,460
Your nature has been exposed in the past few years.

496
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:54,420
I also believe that there are many things where you are not satisfied with me.

497
00:49:57,690 --> 00:49:58,830
But from now on,

498
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,450
I hope we can talk about everything.

499
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,360
I will try to be calmer

500
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:11,490
and more mature.

501
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:17,740
I won't let this kind of thing happen again.

502
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,030
Because

503
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,130
I don't want to be apart from you for so long.

504
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:34,090
You said you'd be more mature just now.

505
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:39,900
-Can you make it?
-You...

506
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:45,780
Can you let it go?

507
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:49,980
Yes.

508
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:55,050
Can I kiss you now?

509
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:06,240
I'm also waiting for you to kiss me.

510
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,510
Hey, what are you doing?

511
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:24,050
Time is up.

512
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,330
But if what you say satisfies me, I can take a day off.

513
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,420
I love you.

514
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:37,760
Let's go.

515
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:04,210
Why are you laughing?

516
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,280
Do what you want to do quickly.

517
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:45,110
No.

518
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:48,160
Today,

519
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:51,450
I want to be gentle to you.

520
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,370
Let me do it, Type.

521
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:05,340
I'm not used to it.

522
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:10,160
It's a rare opportunity.

523
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:17,250
Okay.

524
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:31,990
-Hey.
-Yes?

525
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:35,790
Did you come to the bar to eat snacks?

526
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,850
The snacks in Khong's bar are delicious.

527
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:41,870
Here you are.

528
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:45,740
See? It's delicious.

529
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,990
I was wondering who you were.

530
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,830
-Hello.
-Hello. You turn out to be Tharn's younger brother.

531
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,480
So I need to thank Tharn and Type, right?

532
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:56,880
They let me have regular customers like you.

533
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,700
-I think so, Brother.
-Okay.

534
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,020
By the way, the food in your bar is really good.

535
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,430
It's normal. Look at my bar.

536
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,810
It must be delicious.

537
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,790
But I'm sorry. Can you not just order food next time?

538
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,620
My snacks don't make me any profit.

539
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:14,610
Order wine. Drink more so that I can make money.

540
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:19,760
Sure, you treat us today. I'll order wine next time.

541
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:22,690
No problem.

542
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:25,410
I'm rich. I have money. I'll treat you this time.

543
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:26,670
Jeed.

544
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,950
Don't tell her it's my treat.

545
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:30,350
Just pretend I didn't say it. I'm leaving.

546
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:34,330
-He walked away so fast.
-Hello.

547
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:35,710
What's your name?

548
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,250
I am...

549
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:38,960
What’s your name?

550
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,640
Jeed, Jeed. Khong is cheating on you.

551
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:42,810
Damn!

552
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,150
He was kind enough to treat us. We shouldn't have teased him.

553
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:52,140
Whatever.

554
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,040
What's wrong?

555
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:11,480
You look so quiet. What are you thinking about?

556
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:12,900
Nothing.

557
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:17,140
I'm just thinking that Cirrus is handsome today.

558
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,870
Sweet talker.

559
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:25,550
I'm your boyfriend.

560
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:27,960
What?

561
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:30,660
What?

562
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,310
What?

563
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,850
Where is that ruthless-eyed, cold-faced

564
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,710
Cirrus?

565
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:46,870
He died when he met Phugun.

566
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:51,960
Hey!

567
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:54,520
Then what are you really thinking about?

568
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:02,920
Do you think Brother Tharn and Brother Type have reconciled?

569
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,800
Do you trust Tharn?

570
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:14,750
Yes.

571
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:17,400
I believe him too.

572
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,010
I think Brother Tharn will handle it well.

573
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:25,840
Because they love each other.

574
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,070
Yes.

575
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,170
I think so too.

576
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:38,450
Then we don't have to worry about them.

577
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:43,180
Yes, we don't need to worry about them.

578
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:46,240
But I'm more worried about my boyfriend.

579
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,870
It's late. It's ten o'clock.

580
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:51,720
We can go home now.

581
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,990
We haven't finished yet. Why should we go home in such a hurry?

582
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:00,830
How about this? Let's finish the food before we go home.

583
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,080
What are you doing? We're outside.

584
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:20,240
-Because you're cute.
-Everyone else has been looking at us.

585
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,220
Are you shy?

586
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:29,090
What?

587
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,720
-No, I'm not.
-You're shy, aren't you?

588
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,480
-Are you shy?
-Others have already seen us.

589
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:27,590
My home

590
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:30,440
is you, Type.

591
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,800
I'm sorry.

592
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,460
And thank you

593
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:58,070
for calling me.

594
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:10,520
It is good if you stay in Bangkok because of me.

595
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,430
But no matter where you are,

596
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,820
I'll always be with you, Type.

597
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,660
I've been looking for you for a long time, Type.

598
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:33,460
I just came out for a walk.

599
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,920
I didn't want to wake you up because you were sleeping soundly.

600
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:43,430
In the future, you need to wake me up. I want to take a walk with you.

601
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,710
Are you so clingy to me?

602
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,300
Yes.

603
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,960
I want to be with you forever.

604
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:10,680
Type.

605
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,220
Yes?

606
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:28,880
I said I want to be with you forever.

607
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:31,950
It's true.

608
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:38,680
I want to be the person beside you.

609
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:45,420
I want to be with you when you laugh and cry.

610
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,840
I want to take care of you

611
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:51,710
and be taken care of by you.

612
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,940
I want to be that person, Type.

613
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,840
If I propose now, will you say yes?

614
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:07,340
Tharn.

615
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:15,480

01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:10,460
I want to take care of you.

623
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,410
I can't accept it yet.

624
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:26,920
Tharn.

625
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,290
Tharn.

626
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:32,410
Tharn.

627
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:36,260
Tharn, wait for me.

628
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:44,190
There's a reason I can't accept it yet.

629
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:50,000
I want to be a monk.

630
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:01,120
-Are you going to be a monk?
-I told my parents...

631
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:05,690
I may not be able to give them grandchildren,

632
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:10,000
but I can become a monk for them.

633
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:14,210
So,

634
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:18,130
I can't accept your ring now.

635
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:25,810
Propose to me

636
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:29,850
after I finish being a monk.

637
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:35,170
I will accept your ring.

638
01:08:38,609 --> 01:08:39,670
This...

639
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:42,760
You mean...

640
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:46,920
Yes. I will marry you after I finish being a monk.

641
01:08:59,729 --> 01:09:04,950
I have something to tell you too.

642
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:15,960
I choose to stay in Bangkok

643
01:09:19,569 --> 01:09:20,569
because of you.

644
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,390
Because my home

645
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:30,859
is also you.

646
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:34,870

Doctor.

660
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:41,090
Have you finished your work? Actually, I can wait.

661
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:42,370
It's okay.

662
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:44,930
I really have time now.

663
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,420
I was afraid you would wait too long, so I hurried over.

664
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:53,770
This is a new dish in my restaurant. I said I'll make it and let you try it.

665
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:56,320
Thank you.

666
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:02,520
After I try it, I will send you my comments through texting.

667
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:06,010
Call me. I don't read messages.

668
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:18,020
Sure.

669
01:11:19,490 --> 01:11:20,350
Well,

670
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,800
I don't think we'll see each other often later.

671
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:25,920
Why? What's wrong with you?

672
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:34,020
Because Type is not working here anymore.

673
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:36,800
I thought something happened.

674
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:39,100
Are you crazy? What does this have to do with Type?

675
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,720
I'll come to you anyway.

676
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:47,550
You're an expert in my restaurant. How can I not come to you?

677
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:53,640
You idiot.

678
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:55,540
Why did you scold me?

679
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:58,350
I'm leaving. I won't tell you.

680
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:01,790
Doctor, tell me first.

681
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,190
No.

682
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:05,190
It's a secret.

683
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:07,550
Hey.

684
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:18,300
Good acting.

685
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,680
Dad, where is Mom?

686
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:26,210
She left early in the morning.

687
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:30,470
A son refused to help.

688
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,820
All day and all night, I don't know where he went.

689
01:12:35,090 --> 01:12:37,490
Dad, let me ask you sincerely.

690
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,820
Your son has been dating him for years.

691
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,760
When will you get used to it?

692
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:47,080
I won't get used to it.

693
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:55,690
Hey, you bastard. Look at this. Watch TV.

694
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:01,020
I want her to be my daughter-in-law.

695
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:05,120
I don't want this foreigner.

696
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:13,780
Tharn, talk to my dad.

697
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:15,670
-What?
-Go.

698
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,600
What? What's the matter?

699
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:20,650
Well...

700
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:22,470
Is this person

701
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:27,780
Thanya?

702
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:31,630
Yes. Do you know her?

703
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:35,530
Thanya

704
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:39,290
is my biological sister.

705
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,120
She's Tharn's biological sister.

706
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:49,280
Do you want to see the photo if you don't believe us?

707
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:50,230
Do you want to see the photo?

708
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:53,590
-Your sister?
-Yes.

709
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:58,270
How's it going? Dad, are you satisfied?

710
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,150
Your son

711
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,920
found a man who looks like her.

712
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:05,400
Take a look if you don't believe me.

713
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:19,880
I'll ask Thanya to visit you when she is free.

714
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:24,890
I don't believe it.

715
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:27,390
You are crazy.

716
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:29,720
Someone like you...

717
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:33,520
-Whose father is he?
-He's yours.

718
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:38,200
Your dad has good taste.

719
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:41,220
She looks like you.

720
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:43,190
She's my sister.

721
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,140
Don't laugh at your dad. I take pity on him.

722
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:51,190
Hold back your laughter before blaming me.

723
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:53,660
Let's go. Sit down.

724
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:03,700
Who would have thought that your dad likes Thanya?

725
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:08,620
Fortunately, Thanya and I inherited Dad's genes.

726
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:09,800
Yes.

727
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,390
Don't talk about your sister first.

728
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:16,550
You don't live here for free.

729
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:18,990
You have a lot of work to do.

730
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,310
Can you take it, Young Master Thara?

731
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:24,830
I can do anything for you

732
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:28,760
except cooking.

733
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:30,950
Okay.

734
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,580
Tonight,

735
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,440
I'll serve you

736
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:43,610
I want you to know

737
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:47,260
no matter where you are,

738
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,200
I'll be there.

739
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:54,450
OK.

740
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:02,110
I just knew my dad liked Thanya.

741
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:39,620
