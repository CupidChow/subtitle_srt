174
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,900
[Okay? I'm hanging up.]

175
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,220
What's wrong with him?

176
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:45,770
[When are you coming home?]

177
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:51,110
[I'm going to Khong's bar later.]

178
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,060
[Take a taxi home if you're drunk.]

179
00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:00,770
[Okay, honey.]

180
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,550
He said we can't be together anymore.

181
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,580
-He can't stand seeing his boyfriend sad.
-What drama?

182
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,250
Poor thing.

183
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:48,100
-And the hero... Why does everyone like him?
-I can be sad too.

184
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,260
What's up?

185
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,160
You're home early today.

186
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,750
There was no traffic jam.

187
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,460
Today,

188
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,720
Jeed asked about you.

189
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,280
Please tell her if I have time,

190
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,609
I will go find her.

191
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,720
Okay, I'll tell her.

192
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,710
Tharn.

193
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,260
Did you drink or take a bath with alcohol?

194
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,420
It's like you fell into a wine jar.

195
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,890
You stink.

196
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,720
Aren't you going to ask me

197
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,990
what Jeed said to me?

198
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,650
It must be the same as before.

199
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,200
She asked you where I went.

200
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,910
She asked me

201
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:51,130
why my beloved wife didn't come.

202
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,650
Enough.

203
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,830
If you're drunk, go somewhere else.

204
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,770
Can't you see I'm ironing clothes?

205
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,500
If you wrinkle it, I'll kill you.

206
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:09,350
But aren't these my clothes?

207
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,490
Yes.

208
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,210
I'm ironing clothes for you.

209
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,100
Why are you ironing clothes for me?

210
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,580
I ironed it. Why can't I iron your clothes?

211
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,340
Don't iron them next time. Why should you iron them?

212
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,700
As you know, I wash clothes at the dry cleaner.

213
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,580
It only cost me a few dollars. You don't need to iron them.

214
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,140
All right.

215
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,570
I stood here

216
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,760
and ironed your clothes for over an hour.

217
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,240
Is this how you talk to me?

218
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,240
You want to do it yourself, right?

219
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,850
Fine, do it yourself.

220
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,500
I won't meddle in your business anymore.

221
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,990
Type.

222
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,760
What's up, No?

223
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,750
What does it have to do with me

224
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,040
if a girl is pursuing your boyfriend?

225
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,420
If he really betrays you,

226
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,920
chop off his penis

227
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,580
and throw it into the toilet to flush it off.

228
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,030
That's all. I'm going to sleep.

229
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,200
Was it No?

230
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,160
Otherwise, do you think it was a dog that came from somewhere?

231
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,430
Tharn.

232
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,030
Let me remind you first.

233
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,640
I'm in a bad mood today.

234
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,400
If you come near me again,

235
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,870
I can't guarantee your safety.

236
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,510
Type.

237
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,920
You know it too, don't you?

238
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,190
I just don't want you to be too tired.

239
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,980
Just now,

240
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,020
I might have said something wrong.

241
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,870
I just don't want you to be too tired.

242
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:50,750
It's already tiring for you to work.

243
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,040
Don't do housework anymore.

244
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,320
I'm sorry.

245
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,780
I'm sorry.

246
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,860
I shouldn't have said that without serious thought.

247
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,050
Do you want me to feel guilty

248
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,870
for being unreasonable?

249
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,880
I...

250
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,790
didn't mean that.

251
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,480
I'm angry

252
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,030
because I wanted to do something for you.

253
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,640
We bought this house with your father's money.

254
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,300
We also use your money to pay for

255
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,650
electricity, water, and daily expenses.

256
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,710
I just wanted to do something for you.

257
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,120
I have to iron my clothes anyway.

258
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,660
Don't think too much.

259
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,950
I'm willing to do these for you.

260
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,040
As you know,

261
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,880
my money is yours.

262
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,990
Forget it. I'm going to sleep.

263
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,770
Tharn.

264
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:37,680
I'm not in the mood.

265
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,100
I don't want to do anything.

266
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,930
I just want to hug you. Let me hug you.

267
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,240
Tharn.

268
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,940
Please forgive me. Please forgive me.

269
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,060
Please.

270
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,750
Forgive me.

271
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,430
Alright.

272
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,270
You have forgiven me, right?

273
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,900
Yes.

274
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,000
Fine, I won't be angry.

275
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,490
But remember what I will say.

276
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,330
If I want to iron your clothes,

277
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,030
I'll iron them.

278
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,860
If I don't want to,

279
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,900
I won't iron them.

280
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,380
As for you,

281
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,480
if you don't want to suffer from physical pain,

282
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,060
don't try to get into my bed today.

283
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:59,100
[MMY Hospital. Our mission is to be responsible for your health.]

284
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,410
Thank you for the ride.

285
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,850
Okay.

286
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,650
Are you still mad at me?

287
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,980
You don't listen to anything I say.

288
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,780
You're like a girl on her period. You are in a bad mood.

289
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,960
Anyway, I will do what I want to do.

290
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,920
I did all these for you.

291
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,220
Type.

292
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,880
I'll pick you up tonight.

293
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,360
Did you just move in?

294
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,910
I live here too.

295
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,550
I live on the 11th floor. Which floor do you live on?

296
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,820
After all, we live in the same building.

297
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,880
It's okay to get to know each other.

298
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,480
If there is anything, we can help each other out.

299
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,780
Do you want me to help you move it?

300
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,820
It looks heavy.

301
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,650
Seul! Seul!

302
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,870
Wait for me.

303
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,200
-PuGan.
-What?

304
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,610
Why are you moving it? It's too heavy.

305
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,630
I'll move it later.

306
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,770
These are a piece of cake.

307
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,000
And there are all dolls inside.

308
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,570
Put it on my box.

309
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,730
It's okay. I can carry it.

310
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,740
I told you to put it on my box.

311
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,530
It's okay.

312
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:10,820
Put it on my box.

313
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,490
Okay.

314
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,610
Good. Good boy.

315
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,700
I don't need your compliment.

316
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,830
If I don't do as you said,

317
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,030
you will call me "mischievous boy" again.

318
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,520
Then, who is the person behind us?

319
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,450
Do you know her?

320
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,190
No.

321
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,320
You don't know her?

322
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,770
I don't care about her.

323
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,990
-Seul.
-What?

324
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,470
If you say that, she will say you're arrogant.

325
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,120
Whatever.

326
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,710
Why should I care?

327
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,850
I only care about you.

328
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,260
There you go again, Seul.

329
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,540
I'm not the only person in this world.

330
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,840
But you're the only one in my world.

331
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,730
Oh, Pu!

332
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,260
Brother Tharn.

333
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,390
Hello.

334
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,340
Did you move in today?

335
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,690
Sorry, I forgot about it.

336
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,190
It's okay, Brother Tharn.

337
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,350
It's nothing.

338
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:15,610
And

339
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,100
the one next to me is Seul.

340
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,120
-He's...
-Pu's boyfriend.

341
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,970
Well...

342
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:25,790
Then,

343
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:30,250
did you tell him who I am?

344
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,050
Yes.

345
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,310
I was just telling you what my relationship is with him.

346
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,140
Your boyfriend is really jealous.

347
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,210
To let your guard down,

348
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,120
I have a boyfriend.

349
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,280
As for this,

350
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,470
let me help you move it.

351
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
I'm free today.

352
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,240
Is there anything else I can help with?

353
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,150
Nothing.

354
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,210
Are you shy?

355
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,520
What are you talking about, Brother Tharn?

356
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,190
You can also be shy, I see.

357
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,190
Enough.

358
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,330
Alright, I won't tease you anymore.

359
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,010
If my boyfriend comes back early today,

360
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,040
I'll bring him to see you, okay?

361
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,770
Okay.

362
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,060
Seul.

363
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,240
Let's go inside.

364
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,240
Do you want some milk?

365
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,280
No.

366
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:00,180
I want to drink plain water. Put more ice cubes in.

367
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,650
Do you want more ice cubes?

368
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,330
Yes, Mr. Type.

369
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,460
I'll add more ice for you.

370
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,060
Well, today...

371
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,630
Didn't your boss ask you to work overtime?

372
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,320
Don't mention it.

373
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,610
Maybe he will call me later.

374
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,620
It's rare to spend a nice Sunday with you.

375
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,280
Yeah.

376
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,520
I don't know why he hates me so much.

377
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,180
I don't think he hates you.

378
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,520
He just doesn't like your mouth.

379
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,360
You're scolding me too, Tharn.

380
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,290
I'm much more polite than when I was a freshman.

381
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,190
If he saw me when I was a student,

382
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,600
he would be scared to death.

383
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,610
If he is scared to death,

384
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,240
you'll be fired.

385
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:17,870
Type.

386
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:19,980
What's the matter?

387
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,750
If you feel uncomfortable about anything,

388
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,420
you can tell me.

389
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,240
Why should I tell you?

390
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,850
Then why do you need a boyfriend

391
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,430
if you don't tell him what's on your mind?

392
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,320
Got it.

393
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,240
Do you remember Champ's roommate when he was a freshman?

394
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:54,990
I don't remember.

395
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,940
He studied medicine too.

396
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,000
I saw him in the hospital days ago.

397
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,200
He seems to be called

398
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,440
Doctor Kunpeng.

399
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,700
Champ used to call him Kun.

400
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:14,840
And then?

401
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,740
I have told you everything.

402
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,960
I'm washing dishes.

403
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,040
Tharn, you're in my way.

404
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,770
Keep washing.

405
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,190
Tharn.

406
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,810
Do you want me to help you wash it?

407
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,970
No.

408
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,530
Judging from your appearance,

409
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,730
you definitely don't want to help me wash the dishes.

410
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,070
But today

411
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,820
is a day off.

412
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,310
Tharn, no.

413
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,130
Okay...

414
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,050
Type.

415
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,750
Okay...

416
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,590
As you know,

417
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:01,700
I can't control myself

418
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,720
when I see you wearing a vest.

419
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:09,720
You...

420
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,190
You still seduce me in a vest.

421
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,910
I'm not seducing you.

422
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,700
Are you going to have sex here?

423
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:36,710
Yes.

424
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:01,870
Let it be.

425
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,840
Tharn.

426
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,080
I told you, "Let it be", Type.

427
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,150
Just answer the phone.

428
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,260
If it's not something urgent,

429
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,300
I'll really scold them.

430
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,010
[Thanya]

431
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:26,870
Go ahead and scold her.

432
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,080
Hello, Your Highness.

433
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,460
What's up?

434
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:39,679
Why did you call me so early in the morning?

435
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,929
[I thought you were good.]

436
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,380
[Did you forget that]

437
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,949
[you should go home today?]

438
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,020
[Brother Thorn said you have only half an hour.]

439
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,080
[Come back quickly.]

440
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,300
Yes, Your Highness.

441
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:53,630
I will go back to find you right away.

442
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:00,990
What's the matter?

443
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,050
What's the matter?

444
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,670
Go get changed.

445
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,300
Let's go.

446
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,160
You said you were going to scold your sister, right?

447
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,270
I only saw someone accelerate crazily

448
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,720
in order to arrive within half an hour.

449
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,600
You were just saying, Tharn?

450
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,660
She's my sister.

451
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,770
Don't make fun of me, okay?

452
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,300
Tharn, a handsome guy, is afraid of his own sister.

453
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,120
Chuoba.

454
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,780
Do you miss me?

455
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,220
Do you miss me?

456
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,950
Do you miss me?

457
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,260
Brother Tharn. Brother Type.

458
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,350
Hello.

459
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,680
You guys are coming so slowly.

460
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,440
-Because...
-It's because of Tharn that we're late.

461
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,280
Who's scared of my sister?

462
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,770
How are you doing, Your Highness?

463
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,270
Come on, Brother Type.

464
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,290
Everyone is waiting.

465
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,020
Yes, Your Highness.

466
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:31,320
San, are you teasing me?

467
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,090
I told you I don't want the sofa to be this color.

468
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,580
I want a dark sofa.

469
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,470
Your father hired me.

470
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,660
Of course, I should do as he says.

471
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,770
I'll do as you say

472
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,230
when you have money to hire me.

473
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,940
Oh, who's here?

474
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,040
I should have asked you this question, right?

475
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,470
Why are you here??

476
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,100
This is my home.

477
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,990
Hey, San.

478
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,050
Calm down.

479
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,170
I designed this house.

480
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,580
Of course, I need to check it before I hand it over.

481
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,050
If you want to have free food and drink, just say it.

482
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,670
I've been watching you work here every day.

483
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,770
When I knew

484
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,280
my beloved brother would come back today,

485
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,750
I came specifically to find him.

486
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,270
San, don't make trouble for me.

487
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,380
Type is still here.

488
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,070
Let go of me first.

489
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,550
San, you are so old,

490
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,120
but you still can't change the bad habit of making trouble.

491
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:35,050
Yes.

492
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,910
The older you get, the worse you talk.

493
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,050
I'm your friend.

494
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,760
Did you ask me

495
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,670
whether I want to make friends with you?

496
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,050
Enough, stop arguing.

497
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,970
So why did you ask me and Type to come here?

498
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,190
What's the matter?

499
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,340
That's why

500
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:55,570
I would wait until you all came.

501
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,670
Here's the thing, everyone.

502
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,080
I'm going to propose to Ahn.

503
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,320
Goodness.

504
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,120
Is this an emergency, Brother?

505
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,830
Brother Thorn, it's just a marriage.

506
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,570
Is it necessary for you to let Tanya call and urge us to come?

507
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,370
That's right, Son.

508
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,860
It's not a big deal.

509
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,190
I even canceled the gathering with my friends.

510
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,870
I also canceled the golf party.

511
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,090
Hey, isn't anyone excited for me?

512
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,050
I'm getting married.

513
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,780
Congratulations. Be happy.

514
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,470
Oh, you sincerely congratulated me.

515
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,040
My best friend is getting married.

516
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,920
Why do you want to marry Ahn suddenly?

517
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,010
This is my little princess.

518
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:29,980
Here's the thing.

519
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:33,650
Once I suddenly woke up.

520
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,060
I suddenly felt something.

521
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,830
I hoped she's the one I see every day when I wake up.

522
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,610
When I realized that,

523
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,490
I went to measure her size

524
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,700
and bought a ring.

525
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:45,020
When are you going to propose to her?

526
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,780
Then I can prepare a proper betrothal gift.

527
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,890
Can I give all the property

528
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,950
that belongs to you to Ahn?

529
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,670
This Friday, Dad.

530
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,140
You can transfer all the property

531
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,750
that belongs to me to Ahn.

532
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,480
I really like her.

533
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:02,330
I hope she won't throw away your ring.

534
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:04,760
You talk too much.

535
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,680
Brother Thorn is getting married.

536
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,860
When will Brother Tharn and Brother Type get married?

537
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:25,870
Thanya, we don't need to rush your second brother.

538
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,490
Focus on your eldest brother first. Let's help him prepare it together.

539
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,940
Otherwise, he'll be upset.

540
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,190
No.

541
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,640
Thorn won't be mad at me, right?

542
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,900
Yes

543
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,200
I really want to get to Friday soon.

544
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:07,390
You've said it four times.

545
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,790
I'm happy.

546
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,820
Don't be too happy yet.

547
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,060
You don't know if Ahn will agree.

548
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,860
Don't be jealous of me, Brother.

549
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,800
Since you're getting married,

550
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,680
don't worry about your sister too much.

551
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,790
Thanya told me

552
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,620
that you followed her to the set

553
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,940
and reviewed all the scripts she would shoot.

554
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,870
I'm a man too.

555
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,470
I know men's character.

556
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,820
How could I be not worried?

557
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,260
Fine, you're right.

558
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,400
My lover and I will finally be married.

559
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,770
What about you? When are you two getting married?

560
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,140
Have you forgotten

561
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:53,080
we are gay lovers?

562
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,610
Can't homosexuals get married?

563
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:00,210
There are a lot of limits.

564
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:01,620
What do you mean?

565
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:10,350
I'm not worried about my family.

566
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,450
A foreigner near my house proposed

567
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,640
to my friend.

568
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,330
But you are different.

569
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,010
Your family has a good reputation in society.

570
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,940
There are so many people in Dad's company.

571
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:31,170
And your acquaintances, friends,

572
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,610
and your fiancee's friends...

573
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:37,240
Not including Thanya's fans yet...

574
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,170
If they know

575
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,810
Tharn is going to marry a man,

576
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,880
how will they feel?

577
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:49,990
Listen to me.

578
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:54,630
My family doesn't care about others' opinions.

579
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,400
It's good now, Brother.

580
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,470
This is the best state.

581
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,710
If there's a problem, we will just break up.

582
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,570
We won't need to be gossiped.

583
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,850
You're still so stubborn after so many years.

584
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,610
That's who I am. Tharn knows it too.

585
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:19,210
Okay.

586
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:38,150
[Fighting!]

587
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,080
[Come on, Fiat!]

588
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,760
Everyone, gather here.

589
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,070
What should we do, Brother Fiat?

590
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,710
You arrange for it.

591
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,120
I'll run over there and wait.

592
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,490
-Pass it to me as soon as you get the ball.
-Okay.

593
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:03,940
Before they catch up,

594
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,030
we'd better get more points.

595
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:07,950
Otherwise,

596
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,350
we'll definitely lose.

597
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,320
Come on, let's win with a big score.

598
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:14,410
Come on.

599
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:16,110
Are you going back?

600
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,290
-Bye.
-Bye.

601
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,260
Bye.

602
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,370
Fiat, stop practicing.

603
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:37,550
We won. Let's celebrate.

604
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:38,910
Are you going?

605
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:40,630
You go first.

606
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,610
I'll practice a little longer.

607
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,650
You're too energetic.

608
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,040
Are you going to practice for a long time?

609
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,230
Well, I'm free today.

610
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:52,580
I want to practice more.

611
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,300
Take it easy.

612
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,370
If Leo finds out that you keep practicing and don't rest,

613
00:46:58,530 --> 00:46:59,860
he will trouble us again.

614
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,630
Are you going to celebrate?

615
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,370
If not,

616
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:07,730
come and practice with me.

617
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,220
No.

618
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:12,540
The competition alone is tiring.

619
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,590
We're not as energetic as you.

620
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:16,050
Yes, I agree.

621
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,420
Then you guys go quickly.

622
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:20,190
Otherwise,

623
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:23,130
I will use the right of the captain

624
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,050
to order you, you, and you

625
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,180
to practice with me.

626
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,280
What are you waiting for?

627
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,460
Let's go.

628
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,210
It's 11 p.m.

629
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,900
Every time we go to your home, we come home late.

630
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,740
And I have to meet your ex.

631
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:51,520
I will bicker with him endlessly.

632
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,700
What's wrong with you?

633
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:10,940
Nothing.

634
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,010
Tharn.

635
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,330
I've been with you for seven years.

636
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,160
How could I not know that

637
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:21,490
you're lying when you say it's nothing?

638
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:39,960
Let's get married, Type.

639
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,690
You're thinking of this again.

640
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,300
We have been together

641
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:50,180
longer than Thorn and Ahn.

642
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:52,300
Is there any connection?

643
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,250
Don't make trouble.

644
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:55,940
I'm not making trouble, Type.

645
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:01,040
I just want to move forward with you.

-I...
-Tharn.

That's enough.

We fight every time we talk about this.
