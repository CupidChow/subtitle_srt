Tharn, when are the musicians coming to record the demos today?

00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:17,480
Tharn.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,710
Tharn.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,430
Hey.

00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,360
Tharn.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:27,750
What's wrong?

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,060
I was asking you.

When are the musicians coming to record the demos today?

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,180
Musicians?

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:34,840
Yes.

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,460
2:30 p.m.

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,470
But only the keyboardist.

14
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,640
Okay, then.

15
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,460
We'll settle the guide track first,

16
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,260
then we'll have the band record it after it is approved.

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,450
What's wrong with you?

18
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,760
I'm fine.

19
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,730

21
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,270
Do you think that's wrong?

22
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,000
That I'm possessive of someone so badly.

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,730
I want the whole world to know

24
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,400
that he only belongs to me.

25
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,340
What's wrong with you today?

26
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,229
There's nothing wrong about that.

27
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,500
It means he's important to you.

28
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,410
Don't sigh or talk nonsense.

29
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,860
Finish your work quickly.

30
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,830
It's almost noon. I'm hungry.

31
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,060
What should we have for lunch?

32
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:58,630
Anything. You choose.

33
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,080
Okay, Mr. Thara.

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,890
You're so not picky at all.

35
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,919
I don't know what happened,

36
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,930
but do your best, bro.

37
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,270
Bye.

38
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,630
Thank you.

[TharnType 2 : 7 Years of Love]

41
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:59,079
I don't think this case is difficult.

42
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,630
but we need to follow up.

43
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,360
Okay, I'm counting on you, then.

Mr Thiwat.

Yes?

46
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,330
The boss orders you to sort out last month's cases and send it to him.

47
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,750
But it's not my job.

I don't know.

00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,630
That's all the boss told me.

50
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
I'll get going.

51
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,450
What have you done to offend him?

52
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,130
I don't know either.

Okay.

55
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,420
I'll go back and take a shower.

I'll go back first.

Tell me when you get off work.

I'll pick you up.

Oh, doctor, you're not home yet?

I just finished my shift.

I saw the light was still on, so I came over.

94

Yes, I am.

I'm summarizing the cases from the last month.

00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,590
Of your patients?

101

If it was only my patients,

102
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,190
I would have done it long ago.

103

I'm doing for the whole department.

104
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,250
I was informed this afternoon,

105
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,540
and he wants it tomorrow morning.

106
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,080
It seems like someone's making things hard for me, doctor.

107
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,670
Then why did you do it yourself?

108
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,260
I mean, it's not your job.

109
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,110
Forget it, doctor.

110
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,830
It'll be done soon.

111
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,090
Okay.

112
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,720
Then when can you go home?

113
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,930
I don't know.

114
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,570

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,580
What is it?

117
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,530
I was going to invite you to dinner.

118
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,840
Seems like I have to postpone it.

119
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,940
It's going to take a long time.

120
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,179
Champ, right?

121
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,780
Go now.

122
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:46,600
But...

123
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,170
It's okay.

124
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,810
It doesn't matter.

125
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,670
If you're late,

126
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,360
Champ will be angry and hungry.

127
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,310
But if he knows

128
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,840
that you're doing something that is not within your job scope,

129
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,280
he won't let it slide for sure.

130
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,850
You know Champ so well.

131
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:09,910
I know

132
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,510
that Champ loves his friends very much.

133
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,110
If he knows...

134
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,650
Then don't tell him.

135
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,100
I would be sorry

136
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,410
for taking your time with Champ.

137
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:26,860
But...

138
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,880
It's okay.

139
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,450
I can do it.

140
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,000
You should leave now.

141
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,160
Okay.

142
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,580
I'll get going, then.

143
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,320
Okay.

144
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,060
Good luck.

145
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,310
Doctor.

146
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,000
Doctor!

147
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,150
You're distracted again.

148
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,950
Is something wrong?

149
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,660
Nothing.

150
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,420
I'm just thinking about something.

151
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,650
Work?

152
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,420
Not really.

153
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,150
Then leave it.

154
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,150
Let's eat first.

155
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,550
Okay?

156
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,660
I'm not you.

157
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,670
All you think about is eating.

158
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,020
You have to eat more.

159
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,930
Look at you, you're so small.

160
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,970
How am I small?

161
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,640
I'm not small.

162
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,700
I'm about the same height as you.

163
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,760
Well, you're right.

164
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,790
You're about my height.

165
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,790
But for some reason,

166
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,410
when I'm with you, you seem small to me.

167
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,060
My sister has a signature phrase.

168
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,740
"So tiny that it can be rolled into a ball and swallowed."

169
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,110
Have you heard of it?

170
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,100
What does it mean?

171
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,670
I don't quite get it either.

172
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,410
When my sister watches movies,

173
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,280
she often says "totes adorbs" or other similar words.

174
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,080
When she sees a cute boy,

175
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,950
she would say she wanted to roll him into a ball and eat him.

176
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:30,940
Something like that.

177
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,120
Really?

178
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,250
I don't get it.

179
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,900
And what about that?

180
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,480
You really paid attention to my words.

181
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,760
After all, I rarely hear you talk about your family.

182
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,720
Indeed, I don’t talk much with No.

183
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,650
But I never understood

184
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,350
why she would want to roll someone into a ball and eat them.

185
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,770
Until...

186
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,170
Until what?

187
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,760
Until I met you.

188
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,130
Eat up.

189
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,670
Before I roll you into a ball and eat you.

190
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,150
I'm happy to see you smile.

191
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,220
You look anxious today.

192
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,310
You can talk to me anytime if there's something.

193
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,230
You know, right?

194
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,520
Actually, I'm not thinking about work.

195
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,070
But I'm thinking about Type.

196
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,270
Type?

197
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,850
What's wrong with him?

198
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,770
Seems like someone in the hospital doesn't like him lately.

199
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,460
I have to submit these documents to my boss.

200
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,070
Or I'll get scolded.

201
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,460
The patient files?

202
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,640
The operation plan of our department.

203
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,430
Wait.

204
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,350
But this is not your job.

205
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,790
Yes.

206
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,420
I know.

207
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,420
But he's my boss.

208
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,320
I must do what he tells me to do.

209
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,930
When I came out just now,

210
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,610
he was still doing what his boss asked him to do.

211
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,640
But it's not within his job scope.

212
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,510
I don't know

213
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,290
if he has offended someone.

214
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,360
But this is not the first time I find him in this kind of situation.

215
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,200
It's been several times.

216
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,310
Type is a straightforward person.

217
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,580
People who like him will like him.

218
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,610
But those who hate him hate him.

219
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,670
But I know him well.

220
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,040
He can do it. He won't be defeated so easily.

221
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,210
Don't think too much.

222
00:13:59,270 --> 00:13:59,830
Okay.

223
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,270
You really care about each of your friends.

224
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,250
I care about you too.

225
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,920
♫Don't be like this♫

226
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,420
Really?

227
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,230
What kind of person do you think I am?

228
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,910
You're cute

229
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:20,980
and kind.

230
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,760
♫What if I can't control myself?♫

231
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,030
Everyone loves you.

232
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:27,820
Look.

233
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,250
You're acting cute again.

234
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:34,380
♫Will you be cute to others?♫

235
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,580
Says who? I'm not acting cute.

236
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:43,320
♫Can you only look at me?♫

237
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,570
Okay, then.

238
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,590
Eat.

239
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,500
Or I'll roll you into a ball and eat you for real.

240
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,460
♫Don't be like this♫

241
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:52,740
♫What if I can't control myself?♫

242
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:58,080
♫Will you be cute to others?♫

243
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:06,020
♫Can you only look at me?♫

244
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,260
It's delicious.

245
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,320
I'll get going, then.

246
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,490
Take care.

247
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,430
Tell me when you get home.

248
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:10,530
Okay.

249
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,330
You too, take care.

250
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,250
Okay, see you.

251
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,680
Uncle, I need your help.

252
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,310
Huh, it's already this late?

253
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:24,000
[He's playing the guitar with a sweet smile.
Everyone will fall for him.]

254
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:24,000
[When will you stop filming me?]

255
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,130
You must be so happy

256
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,500
that I wasn't there.

257
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,110
Darn it.

258
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,500
Where have you been?

259
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,200
Why did you carry so many things?

260
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,430
I bought something for Phugun.

261
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,890
Does he like snacks?

262
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,250
Yes.

263
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,150
I'll buy some for him later.

264
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,829
No need.

265
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,040
Why?

266
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,990
I can take care of him.

267
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,740
Did you just come back?

268
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,060
It's quite late.

269
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,319
Yeah.

270
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,140
There's been a lot of work lately.

271
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,520
Don't worry.

272
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,670
I don't have time to play with Phu just to make someone jealous.

273
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,510
I'm leaving, brother-in-law.

274
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,840
Tharn, give me some space.

275
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,440
Tharn.

276
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,080
When should I pick you up?

277
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,600
Type, when should I pick you up?

278
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,450
It's okay. I can go back by myself.

279
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,920
I'm here to see you off.

280
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,500
Of course, I have to pick you up too.

281
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,290
I told you I don't need it.

282
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,500
You've been quiet all the way

283
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,320
because you're unhappy with this?

284
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,390
I'm not unhappy.

285
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:26,570
How can I not pick you up when you're like this?

286
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,720
You worked too much last night, you know?

287
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,060
I went to Khong’s bar to play,

288
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,050
and I came home earlier than you.

289
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,040
Isn't it good?

290
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,130
So that you can have fun with others.

291
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,640
Who are you referring to?

292
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,970
Thanya, which one do you think I should choose?

293
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,120
No. 3 or this one?

294
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,980
I like No. 8 too.

295
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,300
I like No. 5.

296
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,800
No. 5?

297
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,170
Yes.

298
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,320
Okay, I'll take No. 5.

299
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,690
Brother Thorn, why don't you ask Sister Amy?

300
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,970
I asked her,

301
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,310
but she let me decide.

302
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:41,500
She knew I would let you choose in the end.

303
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,600
Sister Amy always follows you.

304
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,480
You're going to be spoiled.

305
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,320
Here you are.

306
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,560
I've been looking for you.

307
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,670
Brother Tharn is here.

308
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,000
Where's Type?

309
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,600
He's busy with work.

310
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,920
Thanya,

311
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,920
I brought you a cake.

312
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,220
Thank you.

313
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,120
She needs to control her weight.

314
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,110
She's shooting a drama.

315
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,170
One piece won't hurt.

316
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,480
I'll go put the cake first.

317
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:16,470
Okay.

318
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,620
You look anxious.

319
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,390
Did you fight with Type?

320
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,650
I don't know if it's a fight.

321
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,190
We've been arguing every time we talk.

322
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,940
We fight more than we talk.

323
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,260
Did Brother Tharn do something wrong?

324
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,170
Thanya is always on Type's side.

325
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,840
Did you forget that Tharn is your brother?

326
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,600
I didn't.

327
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,980
But Brother Type is not an unreasonable person.

328
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,150
Are you saying that I'm unreasonable?

329
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,620
I didn't mean that.

330
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,140
I mean,

331
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,260
Brother Type is not as irritable as Brother Tharn.

332
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,430
That's the same as what you said just now. You say I'm irritable, right?

333
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,620
But honestly, I always get angry when I'm with Type.

334
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,600
And you only get angry at Type.

335
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,850
Just like Brother Thorn.

336
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,480
No matter how much he dotes on me,

337
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,010
he only loves Sister Amy.

338
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,820
But no matter what,

339
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,580
Thanya will always be

340
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,400
our one and only sister.

341
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:56,410
[I'm going home for dinner. Mom and Thanya miss you so much.]

342
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,610
What's wrong?

343
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,160
You've been staring at your phone all day.

344
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,040
I didn't.

345
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,120
It's only noon now.

346
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,700
Half a day, then.

347
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,420
But if he doesn't contact you,

348
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,700
you'll stay upset sitting here all day.

349
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,240
I'm curious to see your depressed face.

350
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,630
Sorry to disappoint you.

351
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,950
He just contacted me.

352
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,800
Take your meal if you're feeling better now.

353
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,710
We have a lot of work waiting.

354
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,500
Sister Teng.

355
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,100
What's wrong?

356
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,770
I have a question.

357
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:22,530
Go ahead.

358
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,340
If you do something wrong

359
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,740
and you want to coax but you don't want to lose face,

360
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,680
what would you do?

361
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,640
The person who contacted you?

362
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,670
Come on, sis.

363
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,760
If it were me,

364
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,740
I would...

365
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,660
I don't want to know.

366
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,170
Just kidding.

367
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,210
I know you don't want to make it public, but can't I even take a look?

368
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,050
Okay, I'll be serious.

369
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,820
If it were me,

370
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,490
I would've bought him flowers.

371
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,760
Flowers?

372
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,580
Yes.

373
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,490
You can use it on any occasion.

374
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,220
I'm Thiwat.

375
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,980
Okay, I'll go down.

376
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,090
What a long sigh.

377
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,910
Did your boss call?

378
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,920
You're close.

379
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,810
It's his secretary.

380
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,080
He asked me to meet him this afternoon.

381
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,930
So annoying.

382
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,240
I heard that you're looking for me?

383
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,530
You're quite good.

384
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,930
Help me with the purchasing documents too.

385
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,540
But I don't think it's my job.

386
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,950
You're right.

387
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,520
But I'm your boss.

388
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,330
Right, Mr Thiwat?

389
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,350
Yes.

390
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,800
So as your boss,

391
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,800
you have to work as I said.

392
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,690
You don't want a warning letter, do you?

393
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:54,710
You're forcing me.

394
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,070
I have the right to sign your resignation letter.

395
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,320
You have two choices now.

396
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,720
Follow my order

397
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,510
or I use my right.

398
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,500
Is that all?

399
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,760
I'll get going then.

400
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,420
I want it done in 3 days.

401
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,290
Brother Type.

402
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,800
Where are you going?

403
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,750
Wait for me!

404
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,630
Brother Type.

405
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,980
Brother Type.

406
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,500
Brother Type.

407
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,610
Brother Type, are you off work?

408
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,460
I've been waiting for you.

409
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:20,250
But it's okay. I can wait.

410
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,750
Can you stop following me?

411
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,990
Do you want to eat with me?

412
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,230
No.

413
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,750
Coffee is fine too.

414
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,120
I said no.

415
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,360
I really want to talk to you.

416
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,460
Brother Type.

417
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,280
Fiat.

418
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,660
Are you okay?

419
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:53,310
I'm sorry for chasing after you just now.

420
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,330
It's okay.

421
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,330
If you want to get better soon,

422
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,240
don't do that again.

423
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,700
I'm really sorry.

424
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,600
Brother Type, you're so nice.

425
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,630
Do you know that?

426
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,400
I'm not nice.

427
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,020
And I apologize to you

428
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,990
about what happened just now.

429
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,530
Something's bothering me.

430
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,710
What is it?

431
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,860
No, it's nothing. I don't want to complain to a kid.

432
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,280
But this kid

433
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,810
is always ready to listen.

434
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,080
Someone told me

435
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,510
that if you keep those bad things to yourself,

436
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,360
you'll have anxiety.

437
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,320
Let's say I'm just talking randomly.

438
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,240
Okay.

439
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,660
Recently, I suddenly realized the truth.

440
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,130
What is it?

441
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:11,140
There's a huge difference between school and work.

442
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,790
Everything was fun in school.

443
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,900
No matter how hard the class is,

444
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,460
the worst thing is just failing the class.

445
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,800
But work...

446
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,020
Like they said,

447
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,880
no matter how tiring work is, it's better than to deal with people.

448
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,100
I used to scold whoever scolded me.

449
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,920
But with all the "boss" and "rank",

450
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,720
I can't do anything,

451
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,850
even when I meet under-qualified people.

452
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,240
What will you do, then?

453
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,270
Just bear with it.

454
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,340
What if you can't bear it anymore?

455
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,060
Luckily, that day hasn't come yet.

456
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:11,970
But there's a limit to human patience.

457
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,830
Forget it. Just think of it as a random tirade.

458
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,880
Can I ask you something?

459
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,610
How far have you put up with it?

460
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,400
You're almost at your limit, right?

461
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,750
What are you doing?

462
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:12,420
Nothing.

463
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,690
I'm just taking photos of the coffee for my friends.

464
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,000
What?

465
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,400
What are you angry about?

466
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,070
What about you? Why are you coaxing me?

467
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,630
Do you think that's how I coax you?

468
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,110
I'm sorry.

469
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,280
Here.

470
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:37,670
Are you giving it to me?

471
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,450
Is there another dog if not you?

472
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,930
I've coaxed you, okay?

473
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,300
I mean it.

474
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,530
As long as you say sorry,

475
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,300
you have me in the palm of your hand.

476
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:22,180
Good, because I never want you to slip out of my hand.

477
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:36,640
Go to bed quickly if you have finished it.

478
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,010
[I'll text you.]

479
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,830
Brother Type is cute, right?

480
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,429
Where are you?

481
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,469
[I'm going to find Brother Type.]

482
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:25,330
[What's wrong?]

483
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,219
I'll be right back.

484
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,250
[What's wrong?]

485
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,440
I told you to come home now.

486
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,929
I need to talk to you.

487
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,699
[Can't I go and see Brother Type first?]

488
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,650
[He finally agrees to go out with me.]

489
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,880
But I said I have something to talk with you.

490
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,940
Go home and find me now.

491
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,050
[Okay, I got it.]

492
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,139
[Why are you yelling at me?]

493
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,450
[Okay, I'll go home and find you.]

494
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,330
Why did you call me to come home?

495
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,750
It's not been easy to get Brother Type to chat with me.

496
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,390
You really like interrupting my happiness.

497
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,730
Why are you showing it to me?

498
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:30,970
He's seeing someone.

499
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,590
So?

500
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,660
He's seeing someone.

501
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,940
You shouldn't have anything to do with him.

502
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:56,330
I never interfered with whom you played with.

503
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,890
But this is not right.

504
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,930
What's wrong with me?

505
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,120
As long as they are not married,

506
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,040
I stand a chance.

507
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,180
We've been friends for 10 years.

508
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:16,750
I didn't expect you to be so irrational.

509
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,360
Leo.

510
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,260
Am I wrong?

511
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,540
I told you he's seeing someone.

512
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,070
You should understand now.

513
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,160
So what?

514
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:30,840
I don't care.

515
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,490
Fiat.

516
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,680
Don't yell at me.

517
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,040
I'm serious this time.

518
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,960
You know he has a boyfriend,

519
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,250
why don't you give up?

520
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,930
Because I want him.

521
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:52,680
I don't mind even if he has a partner or a kid.

522
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,220
Stop being a brat to get people's attention.

523
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,810
That's my business.

524
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,260
It has nothing to do with you.

525
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,150
I'm warning you.

526
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,610
Don't pester him.

527
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:07,950
I won't listen to you.

528
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,150
Then get out of my house!

529
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:11,800
I won't.

530
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,590
Then don't pester him.

531
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:18,920
I told you that I would keep pestering Brother Type.

532
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,760
I won't stop.

533
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,310
Understand?

534
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,640
Then get out of my house.

535
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,740
-No.
-Get out!

536
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,350
Get out!

537
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,360
-Are you kicking me out?
-Yes.

538
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,840
Okay, I'll go.

539
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:59,650
♫I want you to know everything hidden in my heart♫

540
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:04,460
♫If you try to become me♫

541
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,810
♫You'll understand♫

542
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,830
I did this

543
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,680
because of you, didn't I?

544
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,860
♫Try to be the one who sees you crying every time♫

545
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,890
Why are you kicking me out?

546
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:20,970
♫I hold it in until you turn around♫

547
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,960
♫Only then will I let my tears fall♫

548
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,920
♫You'll see who's the one next to you♫

549

552
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,260
I only have you.

553
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,080
Why are you doing this to me?

554
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:09,700
What about me?

555
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,870
Have you ever cared about my feelings?

556
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:23,990
Fiat.

557
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:31,710
Are you okay?

558
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,470
Leave me alone.

559
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,850
I'm sorry.

560
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,750
Get up. Let's go inside.

561
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,480
You asked me to leave, why would you care about me?

562
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,310
Fiat.

563
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,270
Let's go inside.

564
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:02,890
I'm not going.

565
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,520
Don't move.

566
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,510
It hurts.

567
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,520
I'm sorry.

568
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,350
I want to go home.

569
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,180
Your knees hurt so bad. How can you go home?

570
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,520
Sleep here tonight.

571
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,350
What if you yell at me again?

572
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,750
I won't yell at you.

573
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,330
I want to go home.

574
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,090
I'm sorry.

575
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,690
I shouldn't have kicked you out.

576
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:24,270
I was angry because you didn't listen to me.

577
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,320
Please forgive me.

578
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,540
Never kick me out again.

579
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,350
I won't do that anymore.

580
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,480
Why are you avoiding me?

581
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,810
I've brushed my teeth.

582
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:43,690
You can verify it if you don't believe me.

583
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:53,980
This is what we call verification.

584
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,090
Okay, I believe you smell good.

585
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:11,570
Are you going to work all night again?

586
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:13,800
Yeah.

587
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,330
Go to sleep first.

588
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:18,310
I think you should get some rest, Type.

589
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,770
Do it tomorrow.

590
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:22,350
No.

591
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:24,260
If I sleep tonight,

592
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,000
I won't be able to get up to do it tomorrow.

593
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:31,030
I'll set an alarm tomorrow and wake you up.

594
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:32,500
So can you sleep now?

595
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,470
Oh, that's funny.

596
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:37,420
You're the one who always turns off the alarm.

597
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:40,450
I won't turn it off tomorrow.

598
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,570
Just go to sleep.

599
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:45,550
I don't believe it.

600
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:53,680
I'm serious, Type.

601
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,790
I think you should sleep.

602
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,120
You should rest.

603
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:01,570
I know I need to rest.

604
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,560
I like the smell of your shower.

605
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:14,130
Why?

606
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:18,590
Do I always stink?

607
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,430
It's not like that.

608
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:25,980
Your scent makes me feel at ease.

609
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:45,680
You can go to bed now.

610
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,170
Didn't you say you want to rest?

611
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,540
I did.

612
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:53,410
When?

613
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:56,800
When we just hugged,

614
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,120
Type.

615
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:02,570
Sleep. I want you to sleep.

616
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:08,120
Or what can I do for you?

617
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,270
You're already helping me by staying next to me.

618
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:16,700
Fine.

619
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,570
But I want more.

620
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:08,310
It reminds me of that day

621
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,200
when I was kicked out from home.

622
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:19,700
When you cried in front of my house?

623
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,230
Yes.

624
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,730
Are you still thinking about that?

625
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:30,990
I will never forget.

626
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,640
I clearly remember that day.

627
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:41,380
The day my dad kicked me out.

628
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:48,420
Because I didn't accept the person who wanted to marry him.

629
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,180
Why?

630
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:57,010
I'm just worried that I'll lose my dad.

631
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,240
He's all I have.

632
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,780
But he kicked me out and scolded me instead.

633
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,880
He said I'm not his son.

634
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,040
Darn it.

635
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,930
If it weren't for you that day,

636
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,830
your family wouldn't let me live in your house.

637
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:44,490
Without you, I don't know how to live.

638
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,580
But you're kicking me out today.

639
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,150

I was in rage.

But I really didn't mean to kick you out.

643
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:26,100
Anyone can kick me out. I don't care.

644

But not you.

645
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,710
I can let the whole world hate me.

646
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,770
I can let them point fingers at me.
