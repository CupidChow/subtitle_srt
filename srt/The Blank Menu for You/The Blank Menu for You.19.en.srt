00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,169
CHOI KANG-ROK

2
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:01,594
Your story is served as today's menu in…

3
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,464
The Blank Menu for You.

4
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,584
You don't need to wipe this down.

5
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:25,618
-Really?
-Yes.

6
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:26,786
It's already clean.

7
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,054
-But…
-Yes?

8
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,523
There might be some dust,
so I'll do it anyway.

9
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,332
Is there anything else for me to do?

10
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,770
-Well, today…
-Yes?

11
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,338
Things look clean around here.

12
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,307
Still, please give me something to do.

13
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,677
Then could you read today's order?

14
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,479
-Today's order?
-Yes.

15
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,582
If we read that, then…

16
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,152
-This would be our last service.
-Right.

17
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,053
Right.

18
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,357
But still, we have to read it eventually.

19
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:05,892
And…

20
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,595
Samchoon was so nonchalant.

21
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,598
He kept powering through,
like he was doing his chores,

22
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,501
and told me to hurry and read the order.

23
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,570
I wanted to stay in the moment
a little longer.

24
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,139
It made me think

25
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,842
that maybe I'm being silly
for feeling this way.

26
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,378
For feeling disappointed and slightly sad.

27
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,281
It felt really…

28
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:34,320
She was moving really slowly,
wiping things down again and again.

29
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,158
I understood why she was acting like that,

30
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,060
but it's better to get moving.

31
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,495
Yes.

32
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,531
Because we need to go home.

33
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,434
It's imperative that we go home.

34
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,304
Business as usual.

35
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,039
Just like any other day.

36
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,108
Shall we get started?

37
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,110
Shall we tell our guest
to take their time coming?

38
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,112
The thing is…

39
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:00,813
-Yes?
-We made a promise.

40
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,948
You're right.

41
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,587
-I'll read it.
-Okay.

42
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,521
All right.

43
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,125
"Dear The Blank Menu for You."

44
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,494
"As I watch my daughter grow,

45
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,897
I'm reminded of my own childhood."

46
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,067
"If I were to lay out my life
as a three-course meal,

47
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,468
it would start with grade school,

48
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:26,072
when we were all made to take part
in an 'Eat More Anchovies' campaign

49
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,174
and had to bring anchovies
to school every day."

50
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:33,046
"Then the soy sauce rice that my friend's
mom would cook us at his house."

51
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:33,947
"And finally,

52
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,416
the cheap, instant iced coffee
that I would sneakily drink

53
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,284
from my friend's family fridge."

54
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,955
"Chef, please breathe new life
into the good old days,

55
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,823
which you surely remember,

56
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,426
and let them shine
through modern flavors."

57
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,995
So that's today's order.

58
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,131
They sound like they're on the older side.

59
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,866
They might be similar in age to me.

60
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:57,570
Did you use to call it "grade school"?

61
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,572
Never, no.

62
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,407
You must have called it elementary school.

63
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,442
Exactly.

64
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:05,511
I also only know "grade school."

65
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,512
Then,

66
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,315
our guest wrote
about the "Eat More Anchovies" campaign.

67
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,918
-Yes.
-Did you do that too? Do you remember?

68
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,319
I personally don't.

69
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:16,322
We did have a "Drink More Milk" campaign.

70
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,890
"Drink More Milk"? To make you grow?

71
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,226
Yes, drinking more milk
makes your bones stronger.

72
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,761
-Right.
-Getting in your calcium.

73
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,964
But we were told to chew even
when drinking milk.

74
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,766
-Chew milk?
-Milk, yes.

75
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,902
They said that chewing milk
helps your body absorb it better.

76
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:30,837
Right.

77
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:34,007
I heard that back in second grade,
but I've never forgotten it since.

78
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,441
I still chew my milk.

79
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,277
-To this day?
-Yes, I chew milk.

80
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,380
But the thing that was shocking…

81
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,049
The "Eat More Anchovies" campaign
brought it to mind.

82
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,018
Instead of anchovies, do you know saury?

83
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,519
-Yes.
-Saury.

84
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,721
They say you should eat anchovies whole.

85
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,789
Yes, of course.

86
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,891
That you're okay to just chew the bones.

87
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,593
That way, you're consuming calcium.

88
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:57,864
But, as an extension of that,

89
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,234
there was someone who advised
that you should eat saury whole.

90
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,269
I saw this person eat a whole saury

91
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,407
like this, from its head to its tail.

92
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,542
-Like in a film?
-He just chewed the whole thing.

93
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,645
Sure, they were grilled saury,

94
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:16,416
but if you think about the bones,
they're actually quite tough.

95
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,117
Absolutely.

96
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:21,954
But he would chew them whole
as a means of demonstration,

97
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:25,124
and I can't help but wonder
how much it must've hurt his gums.

98
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,460
And his throat as he swallows.

99
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,462
His throat was probably all scratched up.

100
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:31,698
Right.

101
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,666
So, what's on the menu today?

102
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,402
-What will we be serving our guest?
-Right, well…

103
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,206
We're going to change
the "Eat More Anchovies" campaign

104
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,875
to "Eat More Saury."

105
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:48,281
Saury is gradually becoming
a fish of the past.

106
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:52,251
-Yes, it's been a while since I've had it.
-It's hard to find these days.

107
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,221
If they occasionally serve it
at a hoe place…

108
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,189
On the house.

109
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,557
Yes.

110
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,959
Almost all saury is caught offshore.

111
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,796
Saury seems to be hard
to come by these days,

112
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,433
so today, we'll be making
a saury-topped rice.

113
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,735
SAURY DEOP-BAP

114
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,137
-And they wrote soy sauce rice.
-Yes.

115
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,739
Yes, they wrote soy sauce rice.

116
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,608
Back in the day, would soy sauce rice
just be soy sauce and rice?

117
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,343
There would have been two versions.

118
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,978
One with soy sauce, butter, and rice.

119
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,380
That sounds delicious.

120
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,982
Or soy sauce, eggs, and rice.

121
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,952
I think there would have been
those two versions,

122
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,388
but we're going to go
with my personal favorite.

123
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,656
Soy sauce, eggs, and rice.

124
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:34,260
We'll reimagine this dish
with a modern twist,

125
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,629
as you'd eat it today.

126
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,498
-Sounds great.
-Okay.

127
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,300
And then, we have
"the cheap, instant iced coffee."

128
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:42,635
But now…

129
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,504
-Now they're an adult.
-Yes.

130
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,172
And they're raising a daughter.

131
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,142
They don't have to drink it in secret.

132
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,778
So a coffee that they can eat
proudly in the open.

133
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,380
A dessert of sorts.

134
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:56,816
COFFEE JELLY

135
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:00,052
We're going to try making coffee
in the form of a jelly.

136
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,587
-A jelly?
-Yes.

137
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:04,190
We'd need to let it sit,
so let's work on this together first.

138
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,459
-Then we can move on.
-Understood.

139
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,730
Today, once more, hwaiting.

140
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,231
One, two, three.

141
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,335
I think… I did a pretty good job.

142
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:17,837
What? What is it?

143
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,605
COFFEE JELLY

144
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,375
This is a drip bag,
which we'll use to extract coffee.

145
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,743
-Sounds good.
-Let's do it.

146
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,046
-This is piping hot.
-Okay.

147
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,149
We take the water

148
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,952
and imagine we're professional baristas.

149
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,687
Okay, like professional baristas.

150
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,224
This coffee will give the dessert
a slight bitterness.

151
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,461
Let's take that into account
as we let the coffee drip.

152
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:42,361
Sure.

153
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:54,640
Looks about done.

154
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,146
Now, we take the extracted coffee.

155
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,647
Yes?

156
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:03,483
Pour it in here.

157
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,787
We want to add in the gelatin

158
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,355
while the coffee's still warm.

159
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:19,932
-Add in the gelatin.
-Sure.

160
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,834
-And take this.
-Yes?

161
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:23,803
Should I put them in one by…

162
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,737
Oh, okay.

163
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:32,278
We're basically just lowering
the temperature slowly.

164
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,716
And we'll set this.

165
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,551
-In here.
-Okay.

166
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,723
If it's too hard, it would be difficult
to get it to set in here.

167
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,592
-Right.
-As it just starts to set, you want to…

168
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,363
-Okay, when it gets sloshy?
-Yes.

169
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,731
Understood.

170
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:56,602
COFFEE JELLY

171
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,703
Now, time for this.

172
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,575
-I'd drink this with a straw back then.
-Right.

173
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,945
And if you cut it wrong,
you'd end up spilling the whole thing.

174
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:06,846
Right.

175
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,619
And this is almond powder.

176
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:15,521
Add this in.

177
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,758
Just almond powder
and coffee-flavored milk sounds good.

178
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:19,992
-Right?
-Totally.

179
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,929
And some sugar.

180
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,102
-What do you think about that?
-About what?

181
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,971
After eating a dessert…

182
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,205
-Yes?
-Saying "It's too sweet!"

183
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:34,640
Oh?

184
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,075
You know people who say that?

185
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,344
-Right, I do.
-What do you think about them?

186
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,613
It seems you have
particular thoughts about that.

187
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,514
I do.

188
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,051
I find it a little hard to understand.

189
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,387
-You mean to say, "It should be sweet"?
-Exactly.

190
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,956
If they say, "It's too sweet!"

191
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,525
I always think that.

192
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,726
"It's meant to be sweet."

193
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,995
Do you want it to be salty?

194
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,830
So instead they should say,
"This is great"?

195
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,634
I think desserts are really important.

196
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,671
-They wrap up a meal.
-Right.

197
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:09,241
And they can determine your mood.

198
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,142
Right.

199
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,017
I can smell it now.

200
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,287
If we want to contain the scent,

201
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,789
we could cover the lid and let it sit.

202
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,726
-So we don't lose the good scent?
-Exactly.

203
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:37,803
Now, you'll feel
that the jelly starts to thicken.

204
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,971
-Yes?
-That's time to pour.

205
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:39,872
Okay.

206
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,776
I think it's starting to feel
ever so slightly heavier.

207
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,177
Right, it is.

208
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,148
-Now.
-Yes?

209
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,854
It's thick.

210
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,324
It feels luxurious.

211
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,795
If we were to let this harden,

212
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,463
would it become like taffy?

213
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,665
It would, yes.

214
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:09,835
Taffy…

215
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:13,739
It would become jelly.

216
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,208
-Now, we need these to firm up.
-Right.

217
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,312
They need to firm up for us to go home.

218
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,315
If they don't set, we can't go home.

219
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,784
I don't mind not going home.

220
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,725
MIX WHIPPED CREAM
WITH COFFEE-FLAVORED MILK

221
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,297
-Syrup?
-Yes, we'll add in this amaretto syrup.

222
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,973
Can you smell the aroma?

223
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,076
It smells like an almond latte.

224
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:57,283
We're going to pour this
on top of the jelly later.

225
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,351
-Right.
-But we need the jelly to set.

226
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,188
-Please keep an eye on that.
-Sure.

227
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,156
I'll start working on something else.

228
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,224
Understood.

229
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,762
I need to prep the saury.

230
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:16,902
Going from the sweet,
decadent scent of the dessert

231
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,337
to the fishy smell of saury.

232
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,306
-Right.
-Right.

233
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,610
Have you ever hit rock bottom with saury?

234
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:30,583
Has anyone ever
hit rock bottom with saury?

235
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:31,717
Sorry?

236
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,721
Well, once in another universe…

237
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,123
Yes?

238
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,592
I cooked with saury,

239
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,060
and yeah.

240
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,996
I was eliminated.

241
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,732
How did you feel?

242
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,736
Well, I thought I didn't feel so bad,

243
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,073
but I guess some part of me did.

244
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,508
It taught me something new.

245
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,344
You didn't hit rock bottom, then.

246
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,282
We have less than an hour left.

247
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,450
-Yes?
-Will we be okay?

248
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,156
Why is time going by so quickly today?

249
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,726
I think that's just how we feel.

250
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,327
-Sorry?
-Because it's our last.

251
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,229
Time seems to be going much faster today.

252
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,197
It does, right?

253
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:25,337
If you don't gut the fish quickly,
it can go all mushy.

254
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,773
We can't give our guest mushy saury.

255
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,674
-Right?
-Absolutely.

256
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:32,111
Today's a battle against time.

257
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,227
All right.

258
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,395
-They're sloshy.
-What?

259
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,532
They're starting to get sloshy.

260
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,874
There's no point in mixing it anymore.

261
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,377
Now, we pour.

262
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,436
This looks delicious.

263
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,005
We need to smooth the surface.

264
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:09,842
Just like this.

265
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,343
Goodness!

266
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:19,618
Is this good?

267
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:20,519
That's great.

268
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,453
-Really?
-Yes.

269
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,995
Now that's done, I feel a sense of relief.

270
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,199
You did great, Samchoon.

271
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,003
-Timing's key here.
-Right.

272
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,472
It's hard to get these layers.
Take a look.

273
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,474
They're so pretty.

274
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,410
-They look like cocktails.
-Right.

275
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,314
-I'll pop them in the fridge.
-Thanks.

276
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,293
Now, for the saury deop-bap sauce.

277
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:05,531
The sort of sauce we're going for

278
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:06,966
is similar to eel deop-bap.

279
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,701
Eel. Grilled eel.

280
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,139
Some cheongju.

281
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,207
CHEONGJU (COOKING WINE)

282
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,010
MIRIN

283
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,880
SOY SAUCE

284
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,250
And you need some sugar.

285
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,696
Why do we add so much sugar?

286
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,531
This may look like a lot,

287
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:40,499
but it's actually…

288
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,736
-The proportions are spot on.
-They are?

289
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:48,240
For us to get a good balance
between the sweet and savory,

290
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,843
we need at least this much sugar.

291
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:55,381
But one person wouldn't eat all of this.

292
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,149
-Right.
-So it's not that bad.

293
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,519
If you look at the amount we use,
it might seem like a lot of sugar.

294
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,921
But in reality…

295
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,658
-It's not much?
-Yes, you wouldn't be eating that much.

296
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,136
I love shishito peppers.

297
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,905
-They're very addictive.
-Totally.

298
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,007
They also feel like a bit of a gamble.

299
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:22,908
Right.

300
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,545
Unlike Cheongyang chili peppers,
which you know will be spicy,

301
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,680
these have a different charm.

302
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:29,581
Exactly.

303
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,917
We'll serve these on the side

304
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,486
of the saury deop-bap.

305
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:46,899
I like extra Korean leek.

306
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,233
Coming right up.

307
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,207
This much for a single portion.

308
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,544
-Now, the egg soy sauce rice.
-Right.

309
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,679
If we just crack the egg

310
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,515
and add in the whites,
it might be a little tricky to eat.

311
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,484
So we're going to whip it up.

312
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,353
We'll place the whipped egg whites
right on top,

313
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,155
then the yolk in the center.

314
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,159
Then they can mix it up
with Korean leeks, seaweed, and wasabi.

315
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,128
Sounds perfect.

316
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,832
This is a place of creation.

317
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:20,799
Yes.

318
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,168
We want to add our own flair.

319
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,137
Because it's The Blank Menu for You.

320
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:31,443
BOIL MIRIN, SOY SAUCE, WATER,
AND PEPERONCINI TO MAKE THE EGG MARINADE

321
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,250
ONCE THE MARINADE HAS CHILLED,

322
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,220
POUR OVER EGG YOLKS
AND LET THEM MARINATE FOR A DAY

323
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,557
I've brought the soy sauce to a boil
and let the yolks sit in it.

324
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:49,194
If we make it now and serve immediately,
the flavors won't quite be there.

325
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,830
If you really want to elevate the flavors,

326
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,066
you should start marinating them
the night before.

327
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,201
Then

328
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,637
they'd taste great.

329
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,339
-They'd absorb the soy sauce.
-Exactly.

330
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,942
KOREAN LEEKS

331
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,756
We're going to top
the soy sauce egg rice with this.

332
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,958
They have a kick,
so I rinsed them in water.

333
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:20,859
You did?

334
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,462
They should be slightly less spicy

335
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,632
and a little lighter if you rinse them.

336
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:27,599
-You rinsed them?
-Yes.

337
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,672
Soy sauce egg rice
has to be wrapped in seaweed.

338
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,073
Right… Oh?

339
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,309
Wait, is this seaweed for garnish?

340
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,344
-We're going to sprinkle it on top.
-Right.

341
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,713
-Now that I think about it…
-Yes?

342
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,950
It might be better
to use this seaweed to wrap the rice.

343
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,852
Shall we let them wrap the rice?

344
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,287
Shall we? That sounds good.

345
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,821
-I think that'd be better.
-Okay.

346
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,258
Rather than using them as garnish.
You're right that egg rice…

347
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,027
-Should be wrapped, right?
-Yes.

348
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,363
So you changed something because of me?

349
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,632
If there's a better idea,
you quickly change course.

350
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,404
I think wrapping the rice
will be much tastier.

00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,417
Hello.

357
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:53,318
Hello.

358
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:54,987
-Hello.
-Hi.

359
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,555
-Wow, it's an honor.
-Hello.

360
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,323
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

361
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,258
Right.

362
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,158
Shake hands…

363
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:02,728
It's nice to meet you.

364
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:03,762
Hello.

365
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:05,364
This is awesome.

366
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:06,999
Do I sit here?

367
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,367
Yes, exactly.

368
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,636
Welcome to The Blank Menu for You.

369
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,106
I practically grew up

370
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,842
listening to his group's songs,
Epik High's.

371
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,445
Maybe "grew up" isn't the right term,
since I wasn't exactly growing by then.

372
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,881
I listened to their songs
when I was fully grown.

373
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:27,286
OUR NINETEENTH GUEST
TABLO

374
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:31,290
Please allow me to check your order.

375
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,458
You wrote that watching your daughter grow

376
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,662
reminds you a lot of your own childhood.

377
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:39,498
You also said you were reminded

378
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,034
of the "Eat More Anchovies" campaign

379
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,037
and the soy sauce rice
your friend's mother would cook you.

380
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,773
And the cheap instant iced coffee

381
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,808
that you would secretly drink
from their fridge.

382
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,245
"Chef, please breathe new life
into the good old days,

383
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,615
which you surely remember, and let them
shine through modern flavors."

384
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,617
You even added a wave at the end.

385
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,420
-I basically requested a remix.
-Sure.

386
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,555
In your order,

387
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,557
I read the phrase "grade school"

388
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:11,163
and wondered who it was that remembered
when it was called "grade school."

389
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,765
And you said you're raising a daughter,

390
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,168
so I felt a sense of affinity.

391
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,236
I truly did.

392
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,805
We've never met,

393
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,940
but I felt that we lived through

394
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,377
the same times
and are living similar lives now.

395
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:26,712
Are you older…

396
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:28,747
-You're a hyeong?
-I was born in '78.

397
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,015
-Oh, '78?
-Yes.

398
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,084
-I was born in '80.
-Right.

399
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,986
There's a huge difference
between '70s and '80s kids.

400
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,457
-They wouldn't hang out together.
-There was a world of difference.

401
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,825
-There was?
-Yes.

402
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:43,261
We called that era the turbulent '70s.

403
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:46,598
Right, to an '80s kid,
someone who was born in '79

404
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:50,168
feels at least a decade older.

405
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,871
So he's totally older, a hyeongnim.

406
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:55,307
Total hyeongnim.

407
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,808
I don't know about "total," but okay.

408
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,844
-Hyeongnim, thanks in advance.
-You're his hyeong.

409
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,011
Not at all.

410
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:05,851
I don't really recall hearing
about an "Eat More Anchovies" campaign.

411
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,519
Well, if you were born in '78,

412
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:12,124
it's entirely possible
that you wouldn't remember it.

413
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,658
It started with us.

414
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,559
Okay.

415
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:18,130
And the campaign went sort of hand in hand

416
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:21,099
with the "Drink More Milk" campaign.

417
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,469
They said that chewing milk
would make you smarter.

418
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:25,504
Do you remember that?

419
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,141
-We were talking about it earlier.
-We actually were!

420
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:30,342
You've never heard of this?

421
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,877
I'd never heard of it, but…

422
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,645
You're meant to chew milk.

423
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,414
Apparently he still chews milk.

424
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,348
The thing is,

425
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,384
we think like that because we were
subject to rote learning.

426
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,453
-It's not actually true.
-Right.

427
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,756
Whether or not you chew milk
or just swallow it,

428
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,024
it would be the same.

429
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,894
But back in the day,
we were told you had to chew milk.

430
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:54,299
And the campaigns went together
because if you drank milk with anchovies,

431
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,467
you'd get real smart.

432
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,437
So back in elementary school,
when it was time to drink our milk,

433
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:02,741
we were made to bring packed anchovies
to eat with our milk.

434
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,644
Just anything that included anchovies.

435
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,412
-So it could be stir-fried anchovies?
-Yes.

436
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:11,049
It was almost like they let us
remix the anchovies however we'd like.

437
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:17,122
But my mom always packed me anchovies
just as they were sold at the market.

438
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,559
Anchovies just as they are.

439
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,995
Real, organic anchovies.

440
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:27,699
Ever since, whenever I go
to a Korean home-cooked diner,

441
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,469
I'll often just leave the anchovies.

442
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:34,139
Still to this day,
I feel like the anchovies' eyes

443
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:35,774
are staring into my soul.

444
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,375
Do you get what I'm saying?

445
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:41,446
It's as if the anchovies
can stare right through my soul

446
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,349
and look into my memories and past.

447
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,686
So I don't really eat anchovies too often.

448
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,454
Yes.

449
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,328
If you two talk for a while,
I'll go ahead and prepare the food.

450
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,529
-All right.
-Of course.

451
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,031
-I'll explain the dishes as they're ready.
-Thank you.

452
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,266
Please enjoy.

453
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,167
Yes.

454
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,503
I actually drew you

455
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,471
that welcome note.

456
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,940
Wait, you drew this yourself?

457
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,743
It's just a bunch of scribbles.

458
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,013
You're really gifted.

459
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,450
When I was younger,
I was really into Cyworld.

460
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:22,254
And back then,
my BGM was Epik High's "Fly."

461
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,989
-Thank you.
-The pleasure is mine.

462
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,293
Even the URL is "Cool Haru."

463
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,995
-My daughter's name.
-Exactly.

464
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:31,363
-Yes.
-This is so cute.

465
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,065
-Thank you.
-I'll need to display this.

466
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,238
FLOUR

467
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:31,056
FLAMBÉ THE SAURY SAUCE
TO BURN OFF THE ALCOHOL

468
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,096
SICHUAN PEPPER POWDER

469
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,498
SHICHIMI (JAPANESE SPICE MIX)

470
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,276
It already looks so good.

471
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,980
Our Samchoon always says,

472
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,182
"Don't get your hopes up."

473
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:36,421
Artists who say,
"Don't get your hopes up,"

474
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:39,591
tend to turn out killer hits.

475
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,032
I can't wait.

476
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:56,941
I'll serve you your first dish.

477
00:27:58,910 --> 00:27:59,744
Wow.

478
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:13,758
This is…

479
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,827
In your order,

480
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,897
you mentioned
the "Eat More Anchovies" campaign,

481
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,432
and we changed that to saury.

482
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,567
"Eat More Saury."

483
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,269
It's a little like grilled eel.

484
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,904
Exactly. I thought it was eel.

485
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,607
Yes, it looks similar,
but it should be tastier than anchovies.

486
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,811
We typically eat anchovies whole,

487
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,280
so, leaning on those memories,

488
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,049
I thought we'd serve saury whole.

489
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,385
-Wow, this is a relief.
-It is?

490
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,354
Even as I was writing that order,

491
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:46,891
I was a little worried in case
you'd actually serve me anchovies,

492
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,827
although I'm sure
it would have been delicious.

493
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,564
So seeing this makes me so happy.

494
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,465
Right.

495
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,968
It's a deop-bap,
with the joy of eating a whole fish,

496
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,404
so please take big bites.

497
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,574
I didn't cut up the saury,

498
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,275
so you can take a huge chunk.

499
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:05,710
It's really soft.

500
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,846
-Cuts like butter with a spoon.
-Yes.

501
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,215
Try it with the rice.

502
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:30,702
It's delicious.

503
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,704
Would it be weird if I cried now?

504
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,205
Yes. Please don't cry.

505
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,108
It's really good.

506
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,844
If I'm honest, when I was younger,

507
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:43,181
I used to eat a lot of fish.

508
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,216
But ever since,

509
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,685
I've been more of a meat guy
than a fish guy.

510
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:48,887
-Right.
-I have.

511
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,290
It definitely brings back old memories.

512
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:01,232
It's so good.

513
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,175
These days,
saury is a little hard to come by.

514
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,678
At the supermarket,
you'll see the occasional saury,

515
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,513
but they're mostly deep-sea fished.

516
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,982
-They are.
-Yes.

517
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,352
It seems to be because of climate change.

518
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:25,290
The types of fish
being caught are changing.

519
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:29,460
I fear that saury,
a fish we all hold fond memories of,

520
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:33,932
may soon become a fish
that exists only in our memories.

521
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:40,071
So there was an element
of wanting to remember saury

522
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:42,440
in choosing to cook it for you today.

523
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:43,775
It's almost like…

524
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:48,046
you're preserving saury.

525
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:52,717
Yes, maybe if people see you
thoroughly enjoying saury,

526
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,753
they may be encouraged to try it more.

527
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:02,861
I wanted you to eat such big chunks,
so that's great.

528
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,063
It's really good.

529
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,503
But it's really similar to eel.

530
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:14,772
Not just the way it looks,

531
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,476
but even the texture reminds me of eel.

532
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,811
Like an eel deop-bap.

533
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:21,512
It's super tender.

534
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:30,121
It's delicious.

535
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:34,592
When you were younger, did you like saury?

536
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:38,263
When I was younger,
especially in our generation…

537
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:39,163
Yes?

538
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,601
You didn't have a say
in which foods you liked or disliked.

539
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:47,238
We didn't have phrases like "matjip"
for good restaurants.

540
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,374
We just ate what we were given,

541
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,477
and whether it tasted good or bad,

542
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,812
the important thing was to eat
as if it tasted good.

543
00:31:55,313 --> 00:32:00,084
If you were served food
and you picked at it a little,

544
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,253
you would be told off for being rude.

545
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,622
If you ate your food gratefully,

546
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,190
you were a well-disciplined kid.

547
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,926
-You'd be commended?
-Yes.

548
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:09,494
So, the thing is,

549
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,230
whether the food tasted good or not
didn't really matter.

550
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:15,233
What was more important
was how you approached the food.

551
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:16,668
So, back then,

552
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,873
any food that you were given
was food that tasted good.

553
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:33,751
I ate every last bite.

554
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,586
-It was so good.
-I'll prepare the next dish.

555
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:38,656
Yes, we actually have a second dish.

556
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:40,591
It's honestly so delicious.

557
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:42,894
You told me not to get my hopes up,

558
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,463
but after this,
I'm so hyped for the second dish.

559
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,365
Right, well…

560
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,939
I'll serve you your second dish.

561
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,040
-Thank you.
-Here.

562
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:29,941
Wow.

563
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,376
This looks great.

564
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,286
This is so impressive.

565
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:03,574
This here is rice with soy sauce and eggs,

566
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,743
including the egg whites.

567
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,912
It's soy sauce egg rice.

568
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:11,682
People normally don't enjoy the whites
in soy sauce egg rice.

569
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:14,485
But you need the egg whites
to complete the dish.

570
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,355
Only then can you call it
soy sauce egg rice.

571
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:20,658
We've whipped the egg whites
and placed them on top.

572
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,662
This looks a little like something
you'd find in an animated film.

573
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,698
Like the sun among the clouds.

574
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,000
-The sun?
-Yes.

575
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,068
It's stunning.

576
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:34,072
If you want to lessen
the feeling of eating raw eggs,

577
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,907
you can add wasabi and Korean leeks.

578
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:39,043
Mix in some of that Korean leek
that we've sliced thinly for you,

579
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,411
and you'd be good.

580
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:44,315
Right, and please eat it
wrapped in the seaweed.

581
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,585
I love this combo.

582
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,488
Please take your time.

583
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:56,961
-Am I doing it right?
-Yes.

584
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:58,563
Yes, you are.

585
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:02,467
Wow, this is cool.

586
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,203
It's so pretty how the yolk collapses.

587
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,040
The yolk will act as the seasoning.

588
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,409
Please use it to season to taste.

589
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,285
This is really something.

590
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,622
I don't see any soy sauce,

591
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,327
but the egg yolk itself
acts like soy sauce.

592
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:34,732
And the egg whites
do really feel like clouds in the mouth.

593
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,402
The seasoning is just perfect,

594
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,905
so there's actually no need to mix it.

595
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,406
You can mix as you please.

596
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:47,211
Some people may prefer to eat it
with a lot of the Korean leek.

597
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,548
-Can I eat it like this?
-Yes.

598
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:53,985
It's just rice with soy sauce,
which pairs well with crispy seaweed.

599
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,898
If the saury rice was the main dish,

600
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,834
this dish is also rice,

601
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,170
but it's like a palate cleanser.

602
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,205
-A cleanser.
-It does do that.

603
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,909
It's not too overpowering
and is incredibly light.

604
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,877
I love it.

605
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,685
Do you normally eat a lot?

606
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:31,255
-Me? Do I eat a lot?
-Yes, do you?

607
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:34,926
I tend to eat whatever someone serves me,

608
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:38,529
and I'm completely satisfied
with whatever portion I get.

609
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:41,499
-So you're fine with being served less?
-Yes.

610
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:44,502
When I'm home alone or when I'm working,

611
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,872
I often go the whole day without eating.

612
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:53,044
In my twenties, I always wished
for someone to invent a meal-in-a-pill.

613
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,214
Eating felt like a waste of time.

614
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,183
I'd never thought of "food"
and "happiness"

615
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,786
being in one sentence together.

616
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,889
Eating three times a day
always felt like a chore.

617
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:08,993
You have to go somewhere, sit down,
read the menu, and eat.

618
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,295
It all felt like a hassle,

619
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,297
but since getting married,

620
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,166
I've realized,

621
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:18,669
"Oh, food can bring such happiness."

622
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,072
Because the family gathers to eat.

623
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,873
That's the only time

624
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,477
that Haru's back from school,
Hye-jung's back from work,

625
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,279
and I am too.

626
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:32,083
Meals are the only time
that the three of us can get together,

627
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,419
and that time
should be when we are the happiest.

628
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:36,621
So now,

629
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:39,757
mealtime in our household

630
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:42,426
is the loudest time of the day.

631
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,830
And the happiest.
Sometimes we'll put a movie on.

632
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,767
It's now become the time
when we chat and laugh the most as a unit.

633
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,202
So it feels like

634
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:56,741
my previous generation
and our family are distinctly different,

635
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,776
just in the way we approach food.

636
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:04,382
Honestly, I think you're so cool.

637
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,851
People who are great cooks
or professional chefs.

638
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:08,419
Well, thank you.

639
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,722
In an interview, someone once asked me,

640
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,225
"What would you have become
if not a musician?"

641
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:18,262
And I dared to say
that I think I would have been a chef.

642
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,132
I think people who cook

643
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:24,435
are the closest
to what I believe to be true art.

644
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:29,974
I've always thought they're the artists
closest to the truest form of art.

645
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,511
No matter what art you create,

646
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,880
whether you act or make music,

647
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:40,818
the most beautiful art seems to be,
in my opinion,

648
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:44,422
when you are closest
and most intimate with your audience.

649
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,290
So musicians who,

650
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,526
during their indie or underground days,

651
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:53,230
perform at a small venue
right in front of a very small audience

652
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:56,133
seem to grow at an astronomic speed.

653
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:00,104
It's because you can see
the reason you do this.

654
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,873
It's a constant reminder.

655
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,476
"That's right, I do this
because of that screaming kid

656
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,211
or that person who's laughing."

657
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:08,579
"That's my purpose."

658
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,947
And the thing is,

659
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:13,317
whenever artists find success and fame,

660
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:19,290
it becomes harder to remember
why they started in the first place.

661
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,591
It's an ironic reality.

662
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:22,860
But when you cook,

663
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:27,131
chefs can immediately see their audience.

664
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,600
If you just peek out of your kitchen,

665
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,036
you can see the person

666
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,940
who's eating the food you just made
and the emotions they're feeling.

667
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,476
You can see them with your own two eyes.

668
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,879
That, to me, feels like true art.

669
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,483
In some ways, I'm jealous,
and in other ways,

670
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,485
I feel bad for you.

671
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,288
Because having to see that can be cruel.

672
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,024
It seems like a very tough job,

673
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:58,562
but I think, if done right,
it can be a truly beautiful job.

674
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:02,566
Back in the day,

675
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:07,471
there were other names
for people who cook.

676
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,740
-What sort of names?
-Like "grade school."

677
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:13,677
Like kitchen… kitchen rats?
Those sorts of names.

678
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,347
Like how singers used to be called
glorified clowns?

679
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,115
-Exactly, yes.
-Okay.

680
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:21,519
The act of cooking

681
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:25,856
wasn't considered art, really.

682
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,158
-Right.
-Yes.

683
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,694
Things are different now,

684
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:34,165
but I've never really thought
to call my cooking art.

685
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,233
I'd feel a little embarrassed.

686
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,003
You shouldn't think that way.
We'll call it art for you.

687
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,104
Thank you.

688
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,573
Honestly, it is art you're doing.

689
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,042
The reality is that I'm a rapper.

690
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:49,547
Rappers, still to this day,
aren't recognized as artists.

691
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:52,983
If I call the work I do "art,"

692
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,853
some people say,
"Are you kidding? How is rap art?"

693
00:40:56,587 --> 00:41:00,724
There are a lot of people
who don't even consider it to be music.

694
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,626
So I get you.

695
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:07,031
Those people will always exist.
There'll be people who think like that.

696
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,833
-Right.
-There'll be people who don't.

697
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,302
But there will also always be people

698
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:13,771
who consider those fields to be true art

699
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,473
and become the artists' fans.

700
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,341
-A lot of fans.
-Absolutely.

701
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,743
We do it for the people
who do recognize us.

702
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,278
-Exactly.
-Yes.

703
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:22,780
-That's how we should think.
-Yes.

704
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,148
That's all there is to it.

705
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,717
There's not much more.

706
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,626
Are you full? Are you okay?

707
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:37,962
This is perfect.

708
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,798
Leave a little.

709
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,334
We also have dessert.

710
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,970
I panicked for a second,
thinking I wasn't meant to finish this.

711
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:47,104
I've already finished it.

712
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,206
To see such empty bowls.

713
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,942
-That makes me ecstatic.
-It was so good.

714
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:53,944
Now, the dessert.

715
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:55,446
Let's do it.

716
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,283
Here.

717
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,118
Here's your dessert.

718
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,555
Wow, this is breathtaking.

719
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:06,290
In your order,

720
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,726
you mentioned cheap, instant iced coffee

721
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:11,662
that you would eat in secret.

722
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:12,863
This is that reimagined.

723
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:17,368
It's a coffee panna cotta
that you can enjoy proudly.

724
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,070
Now you're an adult,

725
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,706
please eat it proudly, out in the open.

726
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,042
How should I eat this?

727
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,311
-You can…
-The top layer is…

728
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,281
The top layer is sweet,

729
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:34,752
while the lower, darker layer
is slightly bitter coffee.

730
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:38,889
Please scoop both sweet
and bitter layers together to enjoy.

731
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:40,724
Sweet and bitter?

732
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,726
It's life in a cup.

733
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:44,728
Right, yes.

734
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:48,065
You'd need to check the texture
with your spoon.

735
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:48,966
Yes.

736
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,036
You're meant to scoop it,

737
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:53,370
and right now…

738
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,107
That should be sweet.

739
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:58,909
That layer's sweet.

740
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,377
-The sweet layer.
-It's so good.

741
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:02,479
It's delicious.

742
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:05,849
Then, scoop it with the bitter flavor.

743
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,620
-Yes.
-Wow.

744
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,958
Would you look at that? This is wild.

745
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:20,864
Now, you'll have a sense
of how to balance the layers as you eat.

746
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,766
This much of the bitter layer.

747
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,636
The flavors pair so well together.

748
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:30,975
You get a true sense of the flavors
when you scoop both layers together.

749
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,017
So you can eat coffee like this.

750
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,185
It's superb.

751
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:47,191
I think there's only one benefit
of growing old.

752
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,560
That you can eat anything you want.

753
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:50,894
I agree.

754
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,331
-No need for permission.
-Yes.

755
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:57,901
When I was in grade school,

756
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:01,071
I really wanted to try coffee.

757
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,574
-Because adults tell you not to.
-Right.

758
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,076
So I also sneaked a taste.

759
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,046
They would say, "You won't grow."

760
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,715
"If you eat coffee,
you'll stunt your growth."

761
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:13,050
-Exactly.
-They said all sorts.

762
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,418
Yes.

763
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:18,922
All the adults would say that,
which only made me want to try it more.

764
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,525
So I secretly drank a ton of coffee,

765
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:23,394
but the adults were right.

766
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:25,162
You don't grow.

767
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:26,630
Maybe that's why I'm also…

768
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:29,266
And I think that's why
I stopped drinking it at a certain point.

769
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,668
I could have grown taller,

770
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:32,536
but I kept drinking coffee.

771
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:33,671
Oh dear.

772
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,139
Back then,

773
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,676
if you did something you were told not to,

774
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,679
you were told off melodically.

775
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:45,382
-"You're in for trouble."
-"You're in for trouble."

776
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,918
-Like this.
-"Eh, eh, eh," like this.

777
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:50,621
-"You won't grow now."
-"You won't grow now."

778
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,856
"You drank coffee."

779
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:55,793
In any town, it was always this melody.

780
00:44:57,227 --> 00:45:01,265
It was a time when there were
so many things you were told not to do.

781
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:02,299
And so,

782
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:04,702
we did so much.

783
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:06,937
So,

784
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:11,241
there's something
I always thought to myself as a kid.

785
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:15,779
"When I grow up,
become an adult, and have kids,

786
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:17,081
I'm going to tell my kid

787
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:18,882
to just try everything."

788
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,784
"Then they wouldn't do it."

789
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:23,754
Because, back in our day,

790
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:26,724
there was so much we couldn't do,
so we did exactly that.

791
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,226
The kids from my generation.

792
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:32,730
And is that what you do now
with your daughter?

793
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:36,266
Yes, so I actually don't stop her
from doing anything.

794
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:41,772
I don't know how it will work out,
but I let her figure things out herself.

795
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,441
The thing I fear

796
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:50,447
is her having a lot of things
she needs to do in secret.

797
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:53,550
I think that would be far more dangerous.

798
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,787
The last thing I want
is for her to hide things from me,

799
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,990
so I try to avoid telling her
that she can't do something.

800
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,926
But who knows
if that's the right thing to do?

801
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:04,495
-I wouldn't know.
-Right.

802
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:07,264
-You can never know, really.
-Right.

803
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:11,602
It's good.

804
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:18,642
Wow.

805
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,345
-Are you finished?
-Yes.

806
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:26,049
Do you think the food you tried today
managed to breathe new life

807
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,285
into the flavors you remember
from grade school?

808
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:31,955
Yes, I actually like how the flavors
weren't exactly how I remember them.

809
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:34,358
Instead of simply

810
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:37,327
replicating old flavors as they were,

811
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:40,030
I think it's more meaningful
for food to continue to evolve

812
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:43,100
while just preserving
the essence of the past.

813
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,702
So you really blew me away
with the food today.

814
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:46,937
Right, thank you.

815
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:48,038
Thank you.

816
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:50,007
Let me clear your plates.

817
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:54,077
Should I now go in
and do the dishes before I leave?

818
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,713
-We do have one thing left.
-Right.

819
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:00,050
We don't accept payment for the food,

820
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:03,787
but we'd like to ask you
to name this dish.

821
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,189
Name today's course meal?

822
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:06,089
Yes.

823
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,198
Wow, there were a lot of dishes.

824
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,680
I gave it some thought,

825
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,383
and Epik High has a song
called "Almost Adulthood."

826
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,351
It's a song

827
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:37,955
about the exact time
I wrote about in my order, my childhood.

828
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:43,160
"Almost Adulthood, Part Two."

829
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:47,998
The lyrics were about how sad it is
that the friends I used to run around with

830
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:52,469
are all married with kids and busy now,
so we can't meet as often.

831
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,872
That was the premise of the song,

832
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:57,341
and the flavors I tasted today

833
00:47:57,407 --> 00:48:03,247
reminded me of the good old days
but were also reimagined into new flavors.

834
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:07,417
So the meal I ate today
felt as though I was tasting a lifetime.

835
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:09,686
So I decided on
"Almost Adulthood, Part Two."

836
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:11,922
-For the name of the meal.
-Right.

837
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:15,959
I really love the name
since I relate a lot to your story.

838
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:17,694
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

839
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,496
-Thank you for coming.
-Thanks.

840
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,530
I'll come again.

841
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:22,399
Even if you come again…

842
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,134
I'll come more often.

843
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:25,802
-You wouldn't be able to get in.
-Yes.

844
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,472
Still, I'll just… wait around outside.

845
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,641
Yes, please just hover.

846
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:32,476
Best of luck.

847
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:33,410
Thank you.

848
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,746
-Take care.
-Thank you for the meal.

849
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:37,981
Thank you for coming. Take care.

850
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:49,459
ALMOST ADULTHOOD, PT. 2

851
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:10,647
Our menu book has gotten so thick already.

852
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:13,283
This is how long we've been going?

853
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:20,991
Just feeling the thickness of the menu
between my fingers…

854
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:25,729
it felt worthwhile.

855
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:27,631
It was all worthwhile.

856
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,367
That's how it made me feel.

857
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:37,474
During this time, I spent all my days
thinking solely about food.

858
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:40,911
"Will this turn out right?"

859
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,680
I was constantly thinking,
"What if it tastes bad?"

860
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:51,054
In reality, running a restaurant
is about surviving in the wild.

861
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:54,324
It's a matter of survival.

862
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:57,894
In reality,

863
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:01,498
it would be impossible to run a restaurant
like The Blank Menu for You.

864
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:05,902
Surreal, maybe?

865
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:09,206
It was an opportunity
to run a surreal restaurant.

866
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,842
A fantastic experience, I guess.

867
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,916
Looking back on The Blank Menu for You…

868
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:27,324
the process of interpreting and bringing
other people's stories to life

869
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:30,293
was painstaking but also full of joy.

870
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:34,231
The act of having to think can be painful,

871
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,067
but the process has also been…

872
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:40,604
really enjoyable.

873
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:44,041
I've had a lot of fun.

874
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:46,009
Truly.

875
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,481
I learn something new on every job,

876
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:55,519
but here, I learned things
that can't be bought with money.

877
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:58,622
I think I take away
some truly priceless lessons.

878
