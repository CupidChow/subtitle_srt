1
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,808
Your story is served as today's menu in…

2
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,778
The Blank Menu for You.

3
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,182
It's well past winter now.

4
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:52,352
Those snowmen make me feel nostalgic.

5
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,220
Samchoon, do you like snow?

6
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,156
I do like snow.

7
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:01,127
I believe our guest today also likes snow.

8
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,732
This was sent from afar.

9
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,601
"I open the door, and there it is."

10
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,738
"Alaska's white snowy fields
and the wide-open sky."

11
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,441
"And in between them, a small cabin."

12
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,744
"If one dare say it looks lonely,

13
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,680
my warm, cozy home would feel quite hurt,

14
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,315
and so would I."

15
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:26,820
"Once again today, alone,
I've filled myself with books quietly,

16
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,755
and it's already 5 p.m."

17
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,091
"Is there something light I can eat?"

18
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:36,196
"Ever since I suddenly developed
an allergy to pork and eggs last year,

19
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,998
my meal options have shrunk considerably."

20
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:43,937
"But I can't settle for something flimsy
for my precious dinner."

21
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,107
"Yeah, I've been fooled
by the bright sky lately,

22
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:50,110
eating dinner too late,
leaving my stomach heavy."

23
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,280
"So how about a soup
to warm me from the inside?"

24
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:59,319
"A warm soup that'll keep me and my cabin
from feeling too alone."

25
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,721
"What kind of soup would that be?"

26
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,991
Is the guest coming from Alaska?

27
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,695
No, I think it's merely a symbol
of their state of mind.

28
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,663
Maybe they feel cold?

29
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,198
-The chills.
-The chills?

30
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,366
They got the chills.

31
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,501
They got the chills.

32
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,269
"5 p.m."

33
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,238
This guest is--

34
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,039
First meal of the day at 5 p.m.?

35
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:24,043
I think what they want
is to have an early dinner.

36
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,213
-"Is there something light I can eat?"
-Is there?

37
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,382
It means their digestion
has gotten weaker.

38
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,284
-So it has.
-Yes.

39
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,621
"I suddenly developed an allergy
to pork and eggs…"

40
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:37,524
The physical changes
are causing them stress.

41
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,993
A weaker immune system
can change how your body reacts.

42
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,762
Yes, and when you realize that,

43
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,565
you tend to be disappointed
by your fragility.

44
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,867
"Am I this weak?"
The guest is stressed right now.

45
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,235
-I see.
-Also…

46
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,039
"I can't settle for something flimsy
for my precious dinner."

47
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,107
Of course not.

48
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:59,546
Have you ever felt stressed
about having to eat every single meal?

49
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,051
Wait, is that…

50
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,221
Is that a cause of stress?

51
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,190
For some,

52
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,160
having to eat three square meals a day

53
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:17,363
might actually be a source of stress.

54
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm upset there are only
three meals in a day.

55
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,939
Breakfast, brunch, lunch, linner, dinner.

56
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:27,574
Late-night snack.

57
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,677
I don't see it as stress.

58
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,846
It's more stimulation and enjoyment.

59
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,715
That's what I find amusing.

60
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:41,020
Because for some people,
eating might bring great pleasure.

61
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,323
-But for others…
-It's stressful.

62
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,793
All things considered,
I'm guessing that the guest is feeling…

63
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,796
-Lonely.
-Lonely?

64
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,865
Right now, they seem to be
in a very lonely place

65
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,434
emotionally.

66
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:59,539
"A warm soup that'll keep me and my cabin
from feeling too alone."

67
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,075
They specifically asked for soup.

68
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,577
A proper soup,

69
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,948
as it should be,
must hold onto its warmth.

70
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,783
Starch helps with that.

71
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,585
So today,

72
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,355
I'm thinking of making a potato soup.

73
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,991
A WARM POTATO SOUP

74
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,660
It's light, yet it's not flimsy at all.

75
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,830
-We also need protein.
-Yes, we do.

76
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,098
For the protein,

77
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:29,202
I'd like to use something
that comes from Alaska.

78
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,136
Salmon?

79
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:31,904
Salmon's nice,

80
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,674
but I'm thinking of white fish.

81
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,809
-Cod?
-Cod?

82
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:37,744
From the deep sea.

83
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,481
Isn't that the fish that pops out
when a polar bear slams the ground?

84
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,483
-That's salmon.
-Oh, that's salmon.

85
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,986
So, cod for protein.

86
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,125
You can feel the loneliness
of someone enduring life alone in Alaska.

87
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,026
Right.

88
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,361
They say, "Don't call me lonely. I'm not."

89
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,697
But you can still sense
a hint of loneliness.

90
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,766
-A sense of emptiness.
-You felt it, right?

91
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:00,833
I felt it.

92
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:05,471
I want to give them a message
through the ingredients.

93
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,141
That's what I have in mind,

94
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,476
so I want to top it off with eoran.

95
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,378
What is eoran?

96
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,113
Is it like pollock roe?

97
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,948
It's gray mullet roe.

98
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,818
FISH ROE CURED WITH SALT AND SOY SAUCE,
THEN NATURALLY DRIED

99
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,887
You salt it and then dry it.

100
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,756
It is perfected through time,

101
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,626
forged in patience and solitude.

102
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,494
It's a true delicacy.

103
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,532
If the guest is truly feeling alone,

104
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,936
I'd like this dish to whisper,
"You don't need to feel that way."

105
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:37,870
I see.

106
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,172
STARCH: WARMTH THAT LINGERS

107
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,673
PROTEIN: LIGHT YET NEVER FLIMSY

108
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,842
EORAN: FLAVOR THAT EMERGES
AFTER ENDURING TIME

109
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,544
If you drink this soup,

110
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:48,715
the loneliness you're feeling now
won't end as just loneliness.

111
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,451
-Let's begin.
-I'm ready.

112
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:56,422
First, we need to make the base
for the soup.

113
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,826
Since making stock takes too much time,

114
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,294
I came in earlier and--

115
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,162
-You came in early again?
-I did.

116
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,207
CHICKEN BONE

117
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,690
CELERY

118
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,761
TUCK THYME INSIDE KOREAN LEEK
TO HOLD IT IN PLACE

119
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,136
BLACK PEPPER

120
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,371
BAY LEAVES

121
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,163
It's very rich.

122
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:15,835
Chicken stock changes so much
in color and flavor depending on

123
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,504
how long it's simmered.

124
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:22,208
Today, I'm going for something
light and clear.

125
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:24,911
Look at that meat.

126
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,649
I'll take out the bones.

127
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:33,052
-They don't have much meat on them.
-That's how they sell them.

128
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,321
-They sell the bones?
-Yes, chicken bones.

129
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:40,059
Stock tastes different when made
with bare bones compared to meaty bones.

130
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,195
-They're different?
-Yes.

131
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,797
Meat-heavy stock is rich in protein,

132
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:48,468
so it naturally tastes different
from bone-heavy stock.

133
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,102
Does bone stock taste better?

134
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:54,240
That depends on the cooking plan
you have in mind.

135
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,946
-Quite a collection, isn't it?
-Yes.

136
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,583
I'm removing
the heavier ingredients first.

137
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,087
This is cotton cloth.

138
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,157
-Could you hold it like this for me?
-Sure.

139
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,825
-I'll pour the stock through.
-Okay.

140
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:30,643
STRAIN OUT SMALL SOLIDS AND FAT
USING COTTON CLOTH

141
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,982
Season this stock,
and you've got chicken soup.

142
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,657
-I think we have enough.
-All right.

143
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,537
It's incredibly rich.

144
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:58,871
-Is it?
-Yes.

145
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,606
It has a strong chicken aroma.

146
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,975
Well, it's chicken stock.

147
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,586
It is chicken stock.

148
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,691
Now the base is ready.

149
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:22,094
I'm going to build it up
into a delicious soup.

150
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,029
Okay.

151
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,532
-Could you peel the potatoes?
-Okay.

152
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,401
-Watch your fingers.
-I will.

153
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,814
COD MEAT

154
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,054
SEASON WITH SALT
LEAVE FOR 20 MINUTES

155
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,130
Drop the cod in the stock.

156
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,999
SIMMER GENTLY IN THE CHICKEN STOCK

157
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:37,436
ADD GARLIC PURÉE FOR AN ENERGY BOOST!

158
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,806
SIMMER WHOLE GARLIC IN MILK

159
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,244
I'll let this boil.

160
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,455
I've never seen leeks this vibrant before.

161
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,824
That's because it's from overseas.

162
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,226
LARGER AND FIRMER THAN KOREAN LEEK

163
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,595
-It's not Korean leek?
-They're quite similar.

164
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,863
Try smelling them.

165
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,537
-Pretty much the same, huh?
-Yes.

166
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,374
I'll add some character with this.

167
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,845
CAULIFLOWER

168
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:22,948
Here's what I'm gonna do.

169
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,960
Cook them slowly over low heat.

170
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:35,861
Okay.

171
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,414
Gently stir the ingredients. That's it.

172
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,484
-It's starting to smell like soup.
-It is.

173
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:02,621
You can really smell
the natural aroma of the ingredients.

174
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:03,656
That's exactly it.

175
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,990
Their natural aroma.

176
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:11,464
Since the potatoes will go in later,
I'll slice them thinly.

177
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,534
Make sure to cook the vegetables well

178
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,672
so they can fully release
their flavor and aroma.

179
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,573
I got it.

180
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:25,611
Add some salt.

181
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,847
As for this…

182
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,050
COOK VEGETABLES WITH CHICKEN STOCK

183
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,253
We'll let them cook down until tender.

184
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,187
All right.

185
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,590
Could you clean up the side of the pan?

186
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,793
Next up, garlic.

187
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,234
-I'll go ahead and grind these.
-Okay.

188
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,491
Energy boost for the guest from Alaska.

189
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,800
The aroma is really strong.
Nothing else went in?

190
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:21,934
Yes, just…

191
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,404
That's because
I added the browned garlic too.

192
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,206
It really is strong.

193
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,340
Savory, isn't it?

194
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,209
-It's very savory.
-Yes.

195
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,312
-It'd go well with glazed fried chicken.
-That's a good idea.

196
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:37,483
It goes well with whatever food you like.

197
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,821
-Are you going to grind these as well?
-Yes.

198
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,625
Blending firm vegetables
won't give the right texture,

199
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:51,363
so I'm going to cook them first
until they are soft.

200
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,166
-The only chunks in the soup are the cod.
-Right.

201
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,435
But we have these vegetables

202
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,338
and the ingredients
that were used to make the stock.

203
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,041
Onion and herbs.

204
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,376
They are all doing their part.

205
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,580
It may look like a simple soup,

206
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,916
but it's supported
by a surprising number of elements.

207
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,285
-No room for loneliness here.
-None whatsoever.

208
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:17,022
It's that solidarity
that will help our Alaskan guest heal.

209
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,297
Why is this taking forever?

210
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,734
You know, this spatula used to have
four sharp corners.

211
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,470
After all the scraping,
one corner's basically gone.

212
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,774
Wait, let me check if they've gotten soft.

213
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,544
Yes. It's coming along fine.

214
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,546
-We're smooth sailing.
-Okay.

215
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,315
EORAN SLICE

216
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,050
-Have you tried eoran before?
-No.

217
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,652
Then this is your chance.

218
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,055
It's good to try new ingredients.

219
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,657
It looks like dried persimmon.

220
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:55,661
Other fish roe can be used for eoran,
but this is gray mullet roe.

221
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,264
Fish roe has blood vessels, right?

222
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,231
Yes, of course.

223
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,767
After soaking the roe in salt water,

224
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,370
you use a spoon to press along the veins.

225
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,307
If you press lightly,
the blood will slowly come out.

226
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,842
It's important to remove the blood.

227
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:15,314
After the blood is removed from the veins,
the roe is packed in salt.

228
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,851
The salting pulls out moisture,

229
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,220
slowly firming the roe.

230
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,856
After that, it's rinsed in alcohol

231
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:29,061
and carefully dried in a safe environment,

232
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,931
just like what our guest
seems to be going through now.

233
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:33,699
It's a lonely process.

234
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,168
-Oh, I see what you mean.
-The drying process.

235
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,370
That phase where the moisture evaporates

236
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,739
and the flavor deepens,

237
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,809
I think that's what the guest
is going through.

238
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,912
-Was that too dramatic?
-Not at all.

239
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,647
That's the impression I had.

240
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:56,822
EORAN, A CREATION FORGED
AFTER ENDURING LONELINESS

241
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:58,924
Feel it.

242
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:00,659
Wow!

243
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,094
You

244
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,898
are becoming seasoned, like this eoran.

245
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,266
We're not growing old.

246
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,234
-We're becoming seasoned.
-That's right.

247
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,545
What's the torch for?

248
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:20,746
Fun fact about eoran.

249
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:22,915
It comes with a skin.

250
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,250
You can peel it off

251
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,753
or give it a quick roast like this.

252
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,781
-Try it.
-Thank you.

253
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,951
That bite is worth 2,200 won.

254
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,020
How much is the big piece?

255
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,021
These two cost

256
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:03,922
200,000 won.

257
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,292
That's the going price for top quality.

258
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,896
-Tastes like cheese, doesn't it?
-Yeah!

259
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,333
We can use this in place of salt.

260
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,872
It's irresistible once you're into it.

261
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,242
-It pairs beautifully with wine too.
-Yes!

262
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,946
I'm a little concerned
it might have a fishy taste.

263
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,784
It's only about as fishy
as salted pollock roe.

264
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,019
It's milder than pollock roe, isn't it?

265
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,020
You're right.

266
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,488
And it has a deeper flavor.

267
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,591
-Then we'll just go with it.
-Sounds good.

268
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:44,329
Let's go with thin slices today.

269
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,230
Okay.

270
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,575
I'll add a personal touch by grinding it.

271
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,987
How does it smell?

272
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,523
-It smells amazing.
-Yes, I agree.

273
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,026
It looks very healthy too.

274
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:18,764
To be honest, soup tastes better
with some cream in the mix.

275
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:19,865
-Okay.
-And butter.

276
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:24,703
But because of that request from Alaska,

277
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,171
I didn't use much cream.

278
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,908
-Instead, I used natural ingredients.
-I see.

279
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,277
It's almost smooth now.

280
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,382
Let's put it in the blender now.

281
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:54,433
Why does rice taste so good
in the soup from pork cutlet places?

282
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,835
You put rice in the soup?

283
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,873
I thought everyone did.

284
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,310
I've never heard this before.

285
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,980
I found out two years ago

286
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,883
that the kelp noodle served
with raw fish is not for eating.

287
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,019
Well, how did you eat it?

288
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,320
With mayonnaise.

289
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,923
-Oh, you can eat it that way.
-Can I?

290
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,727
The stuff under the raw fish
isn't actually for eating.

291
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,328
It's for decoration.

292
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,731
It's mostly used for decoration.

293
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,399
You can eat it,

294
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,103
but depending on how it was handled,
it could be…

295
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,304
Well, you never know.

296
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:41,013
ADJUST THE CONSISTENCY
USING CHICKEN STOCK AND MILK

297
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,656
Use milk to adjust the thickness,
and it's done.

298
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:51,590
Okay.

299
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:56,428
BAMBOO SALT

300
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,496
Hey, it's bubbling.

301
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,431
Stir the soup well, would you?

302
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,399
Sure.

303
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,237
I thought about this earlier.

304
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:09,274
You know how they sprinkle pepper
on the soup at pork cutlet places?

305
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,876
-Yes.
-Shake shake.

306
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:12,911
Shake shake.

307
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,216
The starch is starting to activate now.

308
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,555
Try the soup with some eoran.

309
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:25,624
Give it a taste.

310
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,294
-It must be salty now.
-Okay.

311
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:32,164
It's hard to get the heat just right.

312
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,906
The eoran fits right in
with the mild flavor of the veggies,

313
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,343
like I'm playing a game of Tetris.

314
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,778
-So, is the eoran good?
-It's excellent.

315
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,887
The eoran is just…

316
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,589
It's delicious.

317
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,361
-Let's strain this through a sieve.
-Okay.

318
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,097
-This might be our final task.
-All right.

319
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,033
-Here we go.
-Okay.

320
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,501
-Careful. It's hot.
-Yup.

321
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,174
-I won't scrape the bottom of the pan.
-Okay.

322
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,883
Let's not tap the sieve.

323
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,253
Look at this.

324
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,857
The crispy bits at the bottom
are so good with rice.

325
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:35,193
Honestly, this is the good part.

326
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,266
I think so too.

327
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,201
-I'll have what's on the sieve.
-Sure.

328
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,269
Bring it over here.

329
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,273
-It's hot.
-Okay.

330
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,608
But it looks so good.

331
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,310
-Be careful.
-Okay.

332
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,784
-Do you mind?
-I'll be back.

333
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:04,723
I feel like I'm eating rice cake!
It's so tasty.

334
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,558
Yes.

335
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,860
It's the tasty part.

336
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,997
Would the guest enjoy this?

337
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,266
I think they definitely would.

338
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,469
So the soup's finally done.

339
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:23,008
That bit alone could be served as a dish.

340
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:27,946
COD MEAT

341
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,682
Now, onto the solid bits.

342
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,052
-Cod meat.
-Cod meat.

343
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,555
I'll separate the cod meat.

344
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,023
There.

345
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,094
-It should be tender now.
-Okay.

346
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,095
See?

347
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,697
Pull it apart gently along the lines.

348
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,167
-Into nice, big chunks?
-Yes.

349
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,507
I'll pour the hot soup over
and mix everything up.

350
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,408
Okay.

351
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,912
Later, I'll add plenty of eoran.

352
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,295
AS REQUESTED, WE PREPARED A SOUP
TO WARM YOU FROM WITHIN

353
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:20,298
WE'LL BRING IT TO YOUR CABIN IN ALASKA
FOR THE HOUSEWARMING PARTY

354
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,107
I gotta take a picture.

355
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,110
THE BLANK MENU FOR YOU

356
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,011
Let's go!

357
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,459
-Welcome to the Blank Menu for You.
-Hello.

358
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:48,994
-Hi.
-Hello.

359
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,830
-Welcome to the Blank Menu for You.
-Hello.

360
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:53,365
-Hi.
-Hello.

361
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,068
May I take your coat?

362
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:02,507
-Thank you.
-Please take a seat.

363
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,945
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

364
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,313
-I'm JISOO.
-Of course.

365
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:13,318
I saw you in Ddakdae last night.
This must be my lucky "dae."

366
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,420
Was the pun intended?

367
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,123
-Yes.
-Thank you so much.

368
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:23,328
OUR TENTH GUEST
JISOO

369
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,003
Water and a towelette for you.

370
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,071
Thank you.

371
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,751
WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF

372
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,688
REMEMBER, THERE'S NOTHING MORE PRECIOUS
IN YOUR LIFE THAN YOU

373
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,724
-Let me check your order for you.
-Okay.

374
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,293
Are you the one from a cabin in Alaska

375
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,563
who asked for soup
to warm you from the inside?

376
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,031
That's me.

377
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,133
We're pleased to have you.

378
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,705
Reading your order…

379
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:07,639
Yes.

380
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:11,142
…we got the sense
that you were going through a tough time.

381
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,745
-Really?
-So we were quite concerned.

382
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:18,016
I got that feeling
from the mention of "Alaska" as well.

383
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,486
I've always loved winter
since I was little,

384
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:26,558
so I used to dream of being alone
somewhere covered in snow.

385
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:30,562
I always used to say,
"I want to live in Alaska."

386
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:34,499
As I got into this line of work
and got very busy,

387
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,768
I think that wish only grew stronger.

388
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,804
I started craving
quiet time alone even more.

389
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,172
I'm a homebody, after all.

390
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,675
First,

391
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,279
you mentioned
wanting to have an early dinner.

392
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,481
Do you have any digestive issues?

393
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,349
I used to have something like that.

394
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,018
I get indigestion pretty often.

395
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,286
-Indigestion?
-Yes.

396
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:57,322
-I think we worried too much.
-We had to.

397
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,625
I noticed on your socials
that you were abroad.

398
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:01,793
Yes, I was.

399
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,396
And today, you've got a pop-up event.

400
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:05,330
That's right.

401
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,865
When did you return to Korea?

402
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,835
I returned two days ago

403
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,939
and went straight into a shoot
the next day.

404
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,675
-My body clock's been all over the place.
-Jet-lagged?

405
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,477
Even today, I woke up not too long ago.

406
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:25,116
Just like I wrote in the order,
it's 5 p.m., and this is my first meal.

407
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,955
The request was quite enigmatic,

408
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:34,192
but you specifically mentioned "soup,"

409
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,063
so I put together something light.

410
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:39,264
I love it.

411
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,800
Soup is one of my favorite foods,
and I thought

412
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:45,604
that if I could have a soup
made by none other than Chef Choi,

413
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,472
it would be something special.

414
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,841
It's just a regular soup.

415
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,277
I doubt it.

416
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,013
-Have you caught a cold?
-Yes, I have.

417
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,549
-Then this ingredient might help.
-Really?

418
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,817
It's garlic.

419
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,785
-So…
-Garlic soup?

420
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:02,887
-I'll serve the soup now.
-Awesome!

421
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,056
What's your favorite kind of soup?

422
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,458
My favorite soup?

423
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:08,727
I love potato soup.

424
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,363
What was that about?

425
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:12,964
I love onion soup as well.

426
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:16,568
They often serve soup on flights.

427
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:20,238
I always choose a different main,

428
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,908
but I make sure
to ask for soup every time.

429
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,911
Both potato and onion were used.

430
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,847
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

431
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:11,656
Our Samchoon puts
special care and thought into the dish

432
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,392
when an order includes

433
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,262
someone's story or emotion,

434
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,098
just like the one you wrote.

435
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,736
The color reminds me of Alaska.

436
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:58,803
Yes.

437
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,041
The plate is Alaska,

438
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,044
and the bowl is your house.

439
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,246
Oh, my cabin!

440
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:34,105
What I've prepared for you is potato soup.

441
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,075
Potato soup!

442
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,511
It was made with chicken stock.

443
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:43,948
The fish you see inside
might remind you of Alaska.

444
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,217
It's cod.

445
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,621
The cod was poached
with a clean, subtle flavor.

446
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,457
Feel free to season it with eoran.

447
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:54,926
This? Wait, is this eoran?

448
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,427
They both are.

449
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,429
In the bowl, you'll find sliced eoran,

450
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:02,100
and on the side, there's powdered eoran.

451
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,570
You can add a pinch at a time, like salt.

452
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:09,741
You don't have to force yourself
if it's not to your liking.

453
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,943
-Can I try it?
-Take your time and enjoy.

454
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:21,886
Delicious!

455
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,193
Cod.

456
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:37,936
Eoran.

457
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,811
If the cod and eoran
are not to your taste,

458
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:48,880
you can put them here.

459
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:53,718
If it suits your taste,
try small bites of the cod with eoran.

460
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,520
-Do I eat them together?
-Yes.

461
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,256
Think of it like cheese.

462
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:03,261
Like how we nibble on bits of cheese
to add saltiness to--

463
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,662
-Like garnish.
-Yes!

464
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:06,731
I'll take my leave.

465
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,356
It really is different from regular soup.

466
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,091
How should I put it?

467
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,493
It feels richer.

468
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:38,229
Since it's an early dinner,

469
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,833
it was made intentionally rich
to coat your insides.

470
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,137
The potatoes were cooked down
until extra thick.

471
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,206
-It's good.
-We used four potatoes.

472
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:49,908
It's nice and filling.

473
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,577
Personally,

474
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:56,915
I prefer soups that are on the richer side
rather than too watery.

475
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:00,451
I feel like most soup lovers
would say the same.

476
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:02,887
-This is delicious.
-Thank you.

477
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,291
-Does the eoran taste okay?
-Yes.

478
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:10,728
When I first tasted it,
the smell felt a bit too intense.

479
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,065
But I'm enjoying it now.
It really works with the soup.

480
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,868
The potato soup is quite rich,

481
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:21,339
so the eoran really helps
cut through that heaviness.

482
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:26,077
Let me explain the intention
behind the use of eoran.

483
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:30,114
Fish roe is filled
with countless tiny blood vessels.

484
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:33,918
First, each of them needs to be
carefully drained of blood.

485
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,955
Then the salting begins.

486
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:41,225
Once it's buried in salt
and allowed to absorb that salinity,

487
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,163
the roe starts to firm, firm, firm up,
and becomes more solid.

488
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,665
That's funny. "Firm, firm, firm up."

489
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:48,733
Firm up.

490
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,636
It firms up. The next step

491
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:55,073
is the drying stage.

492
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,476
It's not complete
until it's properly dried,

493
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,678
and JISOO seemed to be
in the drying stage.

494
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,048
-That's what she's doing in Alaska.
-In Alaska.

495
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,451
"I'm firming up right now."

496
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,052
"I need to firm up."

497
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,154
"But I'm alone."

498
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,255
Alone.

499
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:15,226
That was the feeling I got
when I read the order.

500
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,596
You're quite right, actually.

501
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:23,434
I've always been the kind of person
who needs alone time.

502
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:28,272
But work's been so hectic
that I've had very little of it.

503
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:32,343
If anything, I've been around people
even more than usual.

504
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:37,582
So I started longing for moments
where I could be completely alone.

505
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:40,118
That's where I was emotionally
when I wrote that.

506
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:46,891
You didn't have an allergy
to pork and eggs before, did you?

507
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,960
I think I just didn't realize I had it.

508
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,430
So you recently found out?

509
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:56,100
I got tested for allergies
during my health checkup.

510
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,770
It turns out some foods showed up.
"Wait, foods?"

511
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:03,574
Then it hit me
that I've always had indigestion.

512
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:05,376
Even when I didn't eat much,

513
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,845
I'd feel dizzy and nauseous
for some reason.

514
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:12,450
After getting the allergy test results
and cutting out those foods,

515
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:16,721
I noticed
I wasn't getting indigestion as often.

516
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,923
I think it was the allergies all along.

517
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:24,195
You can get really down
when there's a change in your body

518
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,731
or a health issue.

519
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,801
I thought you might've felt the same

520
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:33,004
when you found out about the allergy.

521
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,806
Yes, I felt really down.

522
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:39,377
I used to love those foods,
so once I cut them out,

523
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:42,780
I suddenly had almost nothing left to eat.

524
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,382
And it was just two things.

525
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,984
Eating is one of life's pleasures.

526
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,187
-I know.
-And it was taken away from you.

527
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,357
You might want to write up a list,
just in case.

528
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,559
-Okay.
-I mean…

529
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,694
-A list of substitutes.
-Substitutes?

530
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,963
You have to replace those foods,

531
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,332
or you'll feel a sense of loss.

532
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,867
Like something's missing, yes.

533
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,369
Precious eggs.

534
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,773
Team dinners, for example.
We often go to pork belly places.

535
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,842
I just sit there eating naengmyeon.

536
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:16,981
Yes, it really is a shame.

537
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:19,817
It's a loss.

538
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:21,552
That's right!

539
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,589
The cod is really good too.

540
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:28,693
I usually only had clear soups.

541
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:32,230
The only one with solid ingredients
I've tried was onion soup.

542
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,633
This is my first time having
a heartier soup like this,

543
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,435
and it works really well.

544
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:40,838
There are about ten ingredients in it.

545
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,809
They're all working together
to support the flavor you're tasting.

546
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,145
-Did you say ten?
-Over ten ingredients.

547
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,616
The chicken stock forms the base,

548
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,918
then the vegetables, the herbs…

549
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,419
Herbs?

550
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,788
They build up to that moment

551
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:02,059
where you take the first bite and think,
"Hey, this tastes nice."

552
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,562
I guess cooking

553
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:06,230
is a profound thing.

554
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,201
I believe the aspects of cooking

555
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:13,171
often reflect the way life works,

556
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,039
as we saw with the eoran.

557
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,577
Would you like a warm refill?

558
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:20,845
You mean this soup?

559
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,047
Yes, I need more of this soup.

560
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:27,185
-This is my first meal.
-We have more soup here.

561
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,123
There's plenty left,
so I'll give you just a bit more.

562
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,024
Okay.

563
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,361
Soup never lets me down.

564
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,165
To me, soup feels like gukbap.

565
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,300
What I mean is,

566
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,203
it fills more than just your stomach.

567
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,471
That's why you're drawn to soup, right?

568
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,739
That might be it.

569
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:52,210
Maybe that's why I asked for soup
out of all things.

570
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,080
This little handle is so cute.

571
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,450
Yes, it's attached to your cabin.

572
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,687
This time, try the powdered eoran.

573
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:03,588
This one?

574
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:06,524
Just add a small amount,
like seasoning with salt.

575
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:08,759
There!

576
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:16,234
You're both quite introverted, aren't you?

577
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:17,702
But this job

578
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:21,239
requires you
to constantly interact with guests,

579
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,474
so how do you cope with that?

580
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,142
We drink makgeolli before work.

581
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,043
What?

582
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,013
I mean…

583
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,320
-Are you drunk?
-No, it was a joke. I mean it.

584
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:41,792
You sent us a page from your journal
as your order.

585
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,428
Were you

586
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,897
feeling off when you wrote it?

587
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:48,666
No, I wasn't.

588
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,401
Were you feeling down?

589
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:53,437
I always describe myself as someone

590
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:56,974
who's kind of down all the time.

591
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:00,678
People often think I'm really energetic,

592
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,781
but the truth is,
I use up a lot of energy when I'm out.

593
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:07,251
At home, I'm actually pretty low-key.

594
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:10,388
Let's say this is where I'm usually at.

595
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,056
Here's my high. Here's my low.

596
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:16,160
I'd say my energy level
is always just a bit below normal.

597
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:19,697
So that's kind of my baseline.

598
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,266
My default me, if you will.

599
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,038
When you read that order,

600
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:29,907
did it feel like she was in a low mood?

601
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,644
I pictured someone heading into a battle.

602
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,346
-A battle!
-Yes, it felt serious.

603
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,516
It was as if the feelings
you were going through

604
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,818
in the moment

605
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:44,322
were reflected onto the page,
almost like a mirror.

606
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:45,923
Well…

607
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:48,259
I might be wrong.

608
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:51,996
I guess writing has a way

609
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,565
of letting your inner state seep through.

610
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,100
For example,

611
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,904
even when I'm casually writing something
to connect with fans,

612
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,640
they will say,
"You seem a little down today."

613
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,042
But to me, it wasn't anything serious.

614
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:08,179
It makes me wonder if it's unconscious.

615
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:11,649
Maybe my mood seeps into
my choice of words without realizing it.

616
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,784
It's kind of like cooking.

617
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:16,654
When you're feeling low,

618
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,056
you might suddenly crave something spicy

619
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,592
or end up adding extra heat to a dish.

620
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,461
It's like that.

621
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:25,363
How about you?

622
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,631
Do you think your cooking

623
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:31,502
reflects your emotions,
even when you're not aware of it?

624
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:37,808
I do think food and emotions
respond to each other.

625
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:39,810
I do.

626
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:44,081
Because every human act,
in one way or another,

627
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,016
reflects emotion.

628
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,786
The same goes for cooking.

629
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:54,825
So when I'm feeling bitter,
the dish ends up tasting bitter too.

630
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,028
There's definitely something to that.

631
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,897
Sometimes I cook with no emotion,

632
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:02,500
and when my mind's spinning,

633
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,035
the flavors go a little wild too.

634
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:06,437
I'm curious.

635
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,840
-Do you keep your emotions bottled up?
-Me?

636
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,077
No, I forget things easily.

637
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,880
-That's one of my strengths.
-It's a really good one.

638
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:19,283
In the past, I used to ask myself

639
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,553
if it was a good thing at all.

640
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,623
I used to be skeptical about it,

641
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,125
but with time, I've come to realize

642
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,394
that it's actually a blessing.

643
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:33,330
If all the bad memories stuck around

644
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,065
and never faded,

645
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,903
life would've been so much harder.

646
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:41,405
-They say forgetting is a skill.
-So true.

647
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,074
That's why
learning to let go intentionally

648
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,976
can be good for your well-being.

649
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:48,979
I wasn't good at forgetting before.

650
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:50,714
During those days,

651
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:55,186
the stress from training
and not knowing what lay ahead

652
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:56,921
really weighed on me.

653
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,490
I used to feel down a lot.

654
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:00,624
When I got depressed,

655
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:03,627
all the sad memories
would come flooding back,

656
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:06,197
circling in my head nonstop.

657
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:09,867
So I used to picture myself
with a giant eraser in my hands,

658
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:12,570
scrubbing out all those memories.

659
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:16,740
I didn't want to dwell on them,
but they wouldn't leave me alone.

660
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,243
So I kept imagining myself erasing them.

661
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,245
Maybe that kind of trained me.

662
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:23,981
Back then,

663
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:27,117
having to go through that
felt like a struggle of its own.

664
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:28,719
But now,

665
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,189
I forget things without even trying.

666
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,430
Does cooking help you release

667
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,533
what you've been holding inside?

668
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:46,070
When the cooking goes well,
it really is therapeutic.

669
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,573
Up until then,
I keep everything packed inside me.

670
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,310
But once I've seen the guest off,

671
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:56,514
I get to lay some of the weight down.

672
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:01,352
But most of your dishes
turn out great, so…

673
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:03,454
-Most of his dishes?
-Right?

674
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,089
All of his dishes, to be exact.

675
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:07,224
That must feel incredibly rewarding.

676
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,960
-Yeah.
-I mean, this is all creative work.

677
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,362
He's creating new dishes.

678
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,964
It must feel like
something entirely different

679
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,934
when people enjoy
something you created from scratch.

680
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:17,868
Definitely.

681
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:22,606
Did the soup warm you up today?

682
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:25,042
It was such a hearty meal.

683
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:29,313
-People don't expect much from soup.
-Yes.

684
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,749
-It's treated like an opener.
-True.

685
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:34,785
But today, with the fish in it and all,

686
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:36,954
it felt surprisingly hearty.

687
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:41,125
All credit goes to the 12 ingredients.

688
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:45,095
And the eoran
was way better than I expected.

689
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:49,533
I think the dish might have felt
a bit too mild without it.

690
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,135
They all came together

691
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,637
to make each spoonful whole.

692
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:59,176
If, by any chance,

693
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,612
you're feeling alone right now

694
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,048
in a place like Alaska,

695
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:06,550
I hope, in time,

696
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:09,053
that loneliness will carry
the flavor of eoran.

697
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:13,157
I'll be needing this.

698
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:17,795
Eoran, too, has to endure
a period of solitude and strain

699
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:20,564
before it gains its flavor
and becomes something valuable.

700
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:23,801
Yes. I wish you well.

701
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,170
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you.

702
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,504
Who…

703
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,944
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

704
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:40,150
In place of payment,

705
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:46,690
we kindly ask our guests
to name the dish they had today.

706
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:47,891
That's a challenge!

707
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:51,962
TANGJAGAM

708
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:53,864
What a cool name.

709
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:56,700
I can't come up with anything like this.

710
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,408
It's amazing how these names
have piled up over time.

711
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,811
Each one carries someone's story.

712
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:11,148
I'd like to think
they left with a little more peace.

713
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:17,187
Cabin, Alaska…

714
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,092
Eoran.

715
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:34,471
-Thank you so much!
-Sure.

716
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,407
Why, thank you.

717
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:48,485
"May eoran earn you peace."

718
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,057
A mantra for those
who try to endure life's loneliness.

719
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:54,491
"May eoran earn you peace."

720
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:59,329
I hope eoran earns me peace.

721
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:01,965
You will shine bright.

722
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,302
-Thank you.
-Thank you for coming.

723
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,304
Did the soup give you any comfort?

724
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,839
It sure did.

725
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,441
It was very comforting

726
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:13,544
to be able to eat a dish

727
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,580
that was inspired by my own story

728
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:19,516
and cooked with great care.

729
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:24,288
-Your words bring us comfort too.
-Yeah.

730
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:26,290
So it was give-and-take.

731
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:28,859
Thank you again.

732
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,928
Paid in full!

733
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:33,964
Oh my.

734
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,736
-It was an amazing dinner.
-Thank you.

735
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:40,671
Take care. Thanks for coming.

736
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:43,574
-Tell your friends.
-I will!

737
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,210
-Goodbye.
-Have a good night.

738
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,011
Bye-bye!

739
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:08,565
"A breakthrough on a plate
that makes you crave the unfamiliar."

740
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:10,200
Should I braise chicken?

741
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,401
You're finally at it again.

742
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:13,270
It may look familiar,

743
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:14,772
but it's something new.

744
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,640
The era of braised dishes is upon us.

745
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:18,876
It's Chef Choi's specialty.

746
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,811
-Is he braising stuff?
-Yes.

747
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:22,746
Ms. Joo Hyun-young. Dig in!

748
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:24,148
Digging in!

749
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,919
It's not the flavor I expected.
A bit strange, I should say.

750
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:35,058
It feels like I just got hit with a pop.
