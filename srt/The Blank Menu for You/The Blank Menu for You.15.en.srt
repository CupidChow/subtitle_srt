1
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:04,504
Please look that way.

2
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:33,033
Your story is served as today's menu in…

3
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:35,902
The Blank Menu for You.

4
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,240
Here.

5
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,047
FWIGHLING

6
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,848
My nostrils are

7
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,584
rather dark.

8
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:55,288
There's a lot of microdust these days,

9
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,291
so our nostrils tend to get very dark.

10
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,192
Right.

11
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,196
And my chin looks like it's broken,

12
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,531
but I quite like it.

13
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:05,899
Even at first glance,

14
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:08,768
you didn't compliment me on my drawing.

15
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,471
It's unique.

16
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,273
Right, this era does value uniqueness.

17
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,275
It's good in its own way.

18
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,912
Good in its own way,
but not objectively good?

19
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,046
It's unique.

20
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,214
Yes.

21
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,382
Let me take it back.

22
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,751
I'll just trash it.

23
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:25,652
Wait.

24
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,323
I'm only joking.

25
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,159
-Please hold onto it.
-I will.

26
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,630
You made such an effort,
so we shouldn't tear this up.

27
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:38,565
Right.

28
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,768
I'll treasure it. Right here, like this.

29
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,205
Shall we read today's order?

30
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,310
Their handwriting

31
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,646
is very poised, don't you think?

32
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,616
It reminds me of expressive calligraphy.

33
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:57,717
Right.

34
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,119
Like, swish.

35
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,820
-Swish.
-Rhythmical breathing.

36
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,823
-Just like this?
-A sense of breathing.

37
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,059
Right, well, I'll read it for us.

38
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,296
"I may be wrong today
even if I was right yesterday,

39
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,233
but I constantly strive
to improve my weaknesses."

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,904
"I remind myself that having flaws
means I have more room to grow,

41
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,841
but I sometimes worry
that it might be too late."

42
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,879
"When I spend my time
locked in a silent struggle,

43
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:30,116
it's easy to forget to take care
of my heart and even my meals."

44
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,586
"I would like to request a dish
that's good just the way it is,

45
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:38,658
even if it wouldn't be considered
perfect or complete."

46
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,026
"Thank you."

47
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:43,863
This is tricky.

48
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,534
They seem to be going through

49
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,737
a fierce internal struggle.

50
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:51,905
What kind of struggle?

51
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,907
-Like a battle?
-It could be.

52
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,209
We may not be hurling punches.

53
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,945
-But everyone has internal battles.
-Right.

54
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,948
We all endure those battles
during our lifetime.

55
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:02,849
Right.

56
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,451
So what are your thoughts
for today's menu?

57
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,420
-For today's guest?
-I think…

58
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,925
They said,
"A dish that's good just the way it is,

59
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,360
even if it wouldn't be considered
perfect or complete."

60
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,897
No matter how hard I think,
Korean curry, or kare, is the only answer.

61
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,166
Why? In what way?

62
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:21,601
When moms

63
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,771
go away on a trip somewhere,

64
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:29,042
they say,
"Honey. I've cooked you some curry."

65
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,579
The assumption is you'll be eating
curry for at least three days.

66
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:33,479
Right.

67
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,115
And when you eat
your first spoonful of curry,

68
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,218
sure, it's curry,

69
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:40,687
but slightly milder.

70
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,890
-Fresh curry?
-Yes, curry that's freshly made.

71
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:44,958
The next day,

72
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,559
you eat it again.

73
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,995
And today, it's perfect.

74
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,296
It's thicker.

75
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,434
On the third day, you eat it again.

76
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,536
"Hold up."

77
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,005
"This isn't the curry I had yesterday."

78
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,907
But it's ultimately

79
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,375
still curry.

80
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,144
-Curry is so overwhelming.
-Right.

81
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,614
Even if it's not perfect,

82
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:10,783
and even if it's not complete,

83
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,353
it's still curry.

84
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:17,257
CURRY TAKES MANY FORMS OVER TIME,
BUT IT ALWAYS SAYS, "IT'S ME… CURRY."

85
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,260
This guest of ours
may find themselves a little frail,

86
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,028
so we'll use bone broth.

87
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,897
A curry made from bone broth.

88
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,234
Then would it be heartier and thicker?

89
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,602
-Right?
-Very thick.

90
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,037
-Yes.
-Sounds great.

91
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,373
-With love and encouragement.
-Absolutely.

92
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,875
What do we say to cheer someone on?

93
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:37,377
Chin up!

94
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,445
We normally say

95
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,748
-Fi…
-Oh, hwaiting!

96
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,082
-That's it.
-Right.

97
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,118
Fight!

98
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:46,653
Fwight!

99
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,121
Life requires

100
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:50,390
fighting!

101
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,859
-Shall we start?
-Sounds great.

102
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,564
-We need some apples.
-Okay.

103
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,768
-Please grind them gently.
-Grind them gently?

104
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,770
-Sure.
-Then…

105
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:04,671
Fighling!

106
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,239
Emphasize the "f."

107
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,276
Fighling! Two, three. Fighling!

108
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,145
-"Ling…"
-Two, three. Fighling!

109
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,047
-But you…
-Two, three. Fighling!

110
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:15,648
Two, three.

111
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:17,750
Fight… Okay.

112
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,522
Fighling.

113
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:23,423
-But the…
-Yup!

114
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,924
Can't we say "fighting"?

115
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,459
-Instead of the "ling."
-"Ling"?

116
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:31,597
It starts with a fierce "f."

117
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,598
Right.

118
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,100
-It's "fight."
-Sure.

119
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,135
But the "ling" makes it…

120
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,038
-We lose momentum with the "ling"?
-Yes, we do.

121
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,474
-Then let's try with "ting."
-Sure.

122
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,343
Two, three. Fighting!

123
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,545
Two, three. Fighting!

124
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,547
Why aren't you saying it with me?

125
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:48,748
I am.

126
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,183
-Oh, okay.
-Deep down.

127
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,084
Sure.

128
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,318
I'm shouting it inside.

129
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,920
Then I'll say it inside too.

130
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,121
-Here we go.
-Here we go.

131
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:16,442
I thought only vegetables went into curry,

132
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,611
but we're also using fruits.

133
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,680
I've never seen this done before.

134
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:24,584
You can make a curry
in so many different ways.

135
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,687
In more ways than we know, right?

136
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:31,958
Exactly. There must be many ingredients
I still haven't tried putting in a curry.

137
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,494
-There's a lot you can try.
-Exactly.

138
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,931
We'll be using this as our protein today.

139
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,466
This takes the longest to cook.

140
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,801
So we want to parboil this.

141
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,803
-Sure. I'll be doing this.
-Great.

142
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,780
BEEF TENDONS

143
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,790
PARBOIL THE BEEF TENDONS
TO REMOVE ANY IMPURITIES AND EXCESS FAT

144
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:28,681
ADD CHEONGJU TO A PRESSURE COOKER
AND COOK THE TENDONS

145
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,731
We're going to add a lot of onions.

146
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,600
I love onions in curry.

147
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,036
Yes, they're great. Let's use a mandolin.

148
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:54,106
So we won't be dicing them
into large cubes?

149
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:57,543
We won't. We could,
but this will save us time.

150
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,678
Okay.

151
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,746
I'll slice these up for you,

152
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,348
so please sauté them.

153
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,416
-Sauté them?
-Yes.

154
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,986
What sauce will we sauté them in?

155
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,087
Today,

156
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,089
we'll be using lard.

157
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:10,990
Lard?

158
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:11,891
Lard oil?

159
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,494
It's my first time seeing this.

160
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,596
If we sauté the onions in this…

161
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,667
it's better than using
regular cooking oil.

162
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,504
How should I explain?

163
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:25,905
-It's pig--
-Pork fat?

164
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,106
Exactly, yes.

165
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,942
I've actually seen that some households

166
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,546
stock up on a lot of lard oil

167
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,815
and use it often in their cooking.

168
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,351
It's a condiment of sorts.

169
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,554
-So we'll be using lard.
-I see.

170
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,725
LARD

171
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,430
It's melting.

172
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,299
We melt down the oil.

173
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,967
Okay. I want to do a good job.

174
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,136
For starters…

175
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,542
-You need perseverance for this.
-Perseverance?

176
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,544
It takes a decent amount of time.

177
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,921
-If you keep stirring this up…
-Yes?

178
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,189
You'll need to stir it even longer.

179
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,959
If you keep moving it around,

180
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:21,727
the heat

181
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,864
won't distribute evenly.

182
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,099
-It won't cook all the way through?
-Absolutely.

183
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,402
-So just let it sit.
-Okay.

184
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,737
And give it a toss every once in a while.

185
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,940
-Is that okay?
-Sure, got it.

186
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:45,284
It has a slight buttery scent.

187
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,186
Onions

188
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:53,159
have a much more inviting scent
when cooked than when they're raw.

189
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,761
An inviting scent.

190
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,929
Yes, they do.

191
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:02,935
It's almost like they're trying to say,
"You can approach us now."

192
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,972
They're more welcoming.

193
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:09,742
They're usually not, but all of a sudden,
they become so inviting.

194
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,278
-"Welcome."
-"Welcome!"

195
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,947
"Is this your first taste of sweetness?"

196
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,718
As if to ask,
"Is this your first taste of sweetness?"

197
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,022
But our method of approach
is also important.

198
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:24,557
Method of approach?

199
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,593
Yes, take these onions, for example.

200
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,162
If we cook them slowly on low heat,

201
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:34,400
they'll start opening up to us
and giving off that inviting aroma.

202
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,936
-Yes.
-If we keep sautéing them…

203
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,571
The onions

204
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,842
will slowly develop a gentle sweetness
and release their aroma.

205
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:43,876
But say

206
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,380
we spiked up the heat and shoved them in.

207
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,682
If we toss them too vigorously,

208
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,451
we might not coax out
their natural sweetness.

209
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,956
So we need to be meticulous

210
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,592
in choosing our method of approach.

211
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,561
Right, just like you do with people.

212
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,368
CARROTS

213
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:14,740
As for the celery…

214
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,642
CELERY

215
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,647
GARLIC

216
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,123
Will we sauté these too?

217
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,291
We will, yes.

218
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,761
Once the onions have cooked down more,

219
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,163
we'll add these in.

220
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,064
Understood.

221
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,367
And we need the meat.

222
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,009
BEEF RIB MEAT

223
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,080
It looks delicious.
The marbling is stunning.

224
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,414
It should be delicious, yes.

225
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,455
BAMBOO SALT

226
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,059
They look delicious.

227
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,199
We'll lightly sear the meat,
then simmer everything together.

228
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,041
LARD

229
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,027
Earlier, it was the onions,
but now it's the meat.

230
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,898
The meat will take on an inviting
and approachable flavor too.

231
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,066
Right.

232
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,701
But in this case,

233
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,805
we want to be approaching
the meat with high heat

234
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,875
to bring out its wild charm.

235
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,043
Should we be a little rough with it?

236
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,679
Exactly. As with people,
when working with ingredients,

237
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:05,518
you need to find the right approach
to bring out their unique charm.

238
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,820
They'll show you everything.

239
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,529
Even if we completely cook the meat now,

240
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,665
this particular cut won't go tender.

241
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,067
-So we're searing the surface.
-Right.

242
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,304
Just a mouthwatering sear.

243
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:31,010
Now, the onions
are starting to stick to the pan.

244
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,611
Right. Hold up.

245
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,213
I think we're ready.

246
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:36,415
-Shall we add them?
-Let's add the veggies.

247
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,753
Do I keep stirring it as I've been doing?

248
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,654
Spot on, yes.

249
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,870
Let's take this seared beef.

250
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,638
-We want to add it in.
-Okay.

251
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:00,706
It's hot.

252
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,415
So it has pork fat and beef fat.

253
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,416
Yes.

254
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:11,350
Sounds indulgent.

255
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,486
-Now, next in line.
-Right.

256
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:15,654
In go the bananas.

257
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:31,503
This looks so good.

258
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:37,443
Those with different natures
find ways to coexist.

259
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,178
Even here in this pot.

260
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,379
Right, yes.

261
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,215
They all have their unique charm.

262
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,251
-But come together.
-Together.

263
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,953
-To form a small world.
-A small world.

264
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,457
Their own universe.

265
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,427
So this is a globe.

266
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,630
-A globe.
-Sure.

267
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,865
If you're alone in the kitchen
for too long…

268
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,202
-You become a storyteller.
-Right.

269
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,471
Then, in this world,

270
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,841
I will be these bananas.

271
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,709
-Bananas?
-I'll be these guys.

272
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,313
What will you be, Samchoon,

273
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,781
in this world?

274
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,818
I'll just be the least-used ingredient.

275
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,353
I'll be the garlic.

276
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,788
-The least-used?
-Yes.

277
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,390
But you pack a punch.

278
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,557
Wait, that's not good.

279
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,094
Doesn't garlic have a strong presence?

280
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,230
In that case,

281
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,865
I'll be the apples.

282
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:34,333
They're in there,

283
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,468
but some will never realize it.

284
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:40,372
Apples.

285
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,177
I'll just be doing
my duty as a member of society.

286
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,813
-You'll be doing your duty.
-But it's fine if I'm not recognized.

287
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,383
-Banana.
-Yes?

288
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,353
-A banana and an apple.
-Yes.

289
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:55,888
I love it.

290
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,427
If it's somewhat cooked down,
let's add in the broth.

291
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,528
Okay.

292
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,164
-I'll pour this in.
-Let me get this.

293
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,300
Is that fat on top?

294
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,702
BONE BROTH

295
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,837
No, a layer has formed on the broth.

296
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,073
The broth is rich.

297
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,241
It should be packed full of flavor.

298
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,877
It looks like cream.

299
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,080
-Next.
-Yes?

300
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,415
-Please scrape the bottom as you stir.
-Gently.

301
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,250
Scrape the bits stuck to the pan.

302
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,854
-Dissolve everything into the broth.
-Sure.

303
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:29,788
You've got it.

304
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,792
And some meat.

305
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,327
We'll add this in

306
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,662
and cook it together.

307
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,773
The juices from the meat.

308
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:50,275
Moving on.

309
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,846
After it's cooked for a while
and the meat is tender,

310
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,447
we'll add the curry and season it.

311
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,448
Understood.

312
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,285
BUTTER RICE

313
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,421
We need to cook some rice.

314
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,090
We're going to add
some butter to the rice.

315
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,091
-We are?
-Yes.

316
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,559
And, at the very end,

317
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,662
when the rice is steaming,
we'll add one last slab of butter.

318
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,197
The fragrant butter will…

319
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:17,202
So this butter rice will come together
with this curry sauce?

320
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,370
Exactly.

321
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,425
SAUTÉ ONIONS IN BUTTER, THEN ADD RICE

322
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,702
BONE BROTH

323
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,273
I've never seen rice
cooked in bone broth before.

324
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:57,776
Some bamboo salt.

325
00:17:59,044 --> 00:17:59,878
Bamboo salt.

326
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,587
And now, we'll cook it

327
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,290
on low heat.

328
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,560
-We won't stir it too much.
-Right.

329
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,295
Or else it would become a risotto.

330
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,764
Rice that is too sticky

331
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,700
would take the fun
out of mixing it with the curry.

332
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,735
The rice will be done shortly.

333
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,310
Is there anything else for us to do
while it's cooking?

334
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,311
Now, we…

335
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,546
-We need to work on this, right?
-Yes, we do.

336
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,349
I think we should blend it up.
Could you just take out the meat?

337
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,250
Sure.

338
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:39,985
Just the meat.

339
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,359
The meat looks good as is.

340
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,768
-Now, these guys.
-Those guys.

341
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,404
They'll become

342
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:01,974
a smooth soup.

343
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,408
Right.

344
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,776
-To become a curry.
-Yes.

345
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,050
Let's use this.

346
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,123
Wow. This looks delicious.

347
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,227
It doesn't have any bits,
but we'll have chunks of meat.

348
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,605
And now,

349
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,408
the tendons are nice and jiggly.

350
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,212
Would you look at that?

351
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,158
Let's do big chunks.

352
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,693
Great.

353
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,209
I think we should cook the meat more.

354
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:11,109
I see.

355
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,580
-But let's add them in for now.
-Okay.

356
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,489
-Next step.
-Yes?

357
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,226
Shall we try seasoning this?

358
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:28,961
What's that?

359
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,329
It's mango chutney.

360
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:31,763
Chutney?

361
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,899
This mango is what will elevate the dish.

362
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,400
It looks like jelly.

363
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,069
MANGO CHUTNEY
A SWEET, JAM-LIKE CONDIMENT

364
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,606
Now, let's add in the curry powder.

365
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,879
-Please stir that up.
-Sure.

366
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,314
Stir it up.

367
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,150
Let's also add some curry chunks,
one by one.

368
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,418
This looks so good.

369
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,922
They'll melt easily,
but still keep an eye on it.

370
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,260
-Shall I have a go?
-Sure.

371
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:02,661
Like this.

372
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:03,562
I see.

373
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,766
The color should be getting richer.

374
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,034
-Richer?
-Yes.

375
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,545
We want it to look
a little more like curry.

376
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,446
Right.

377
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:22,814
So we'll add more of this.

378
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,517
Will it make this thicker?

379
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,852
Yes, it should.

380
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,553
And the color a little richer.

381
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,689
Right, I think a true curry

382
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,759
gives you that instant feeling of
"Wow, this is super rich."

383
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:39,164
-The roux we added earlier has melted.
-Right.

384
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,300
Once the rib meat gets even more tender…

385
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,334
-Yes?
-We're done.

386
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,336
-Once the rib meat is tender.
-Yes.

387
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,947
THE BLANK MENU FOR YOU

388
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:09,061
THE BLANK MENU FOR YOU

389
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,742
Hello.

390
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,677
-Hello.
-Hello.

391
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,179
-Oh!
-Hello.

392
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,947
Hello, welcome.

393
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:29,848
Welcome.

394
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,752
The moment he walked through the door,

395
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,687
I thought, "Wow, how deep."

396
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,957
"His eyes are just so deep."

397
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,393
"How are they so deep?"

398
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,096
Man, this…

399
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:47,132
"Is this the way in? How deep can I go?"

400
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,904
OUR FIFTEENTH GUEST
YOO SEUNG-HO

401
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,172
-This way, please.
-Sure.

402
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,074
-Just there, yes.
-Should I sit?

403
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:57,909
Right.

404
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,711
I'm Yoo Seung-ho.

405
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:00,946
-I'm an actor.
-Yes.

406
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,248
Hello.

407
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,017
Welcome.

408
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:07,753
Thank you.

409
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,324
WISHING YOU A COZY NIGHT'S REST

410
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,225
This is cute.

411
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,730
-Welcome.
-Yes, hello.

412
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:20,832
I'm a little…

413
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:24,870
Yes?

414
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,806
It feels as though we grew up together.

415
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,375
I, myself, grew up in Songpa.

416
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:34,646
Right.

417
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:37,215
Do you have any relation to Songpa?

418
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:38,216
Not at all.

419
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:39,117
Right.

420
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,986
I'm a long-time resident of Gyeonggi-do.

421
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,053
Right.

422
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:44,623
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

423
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,426
-Hello.
-A meeting between Songpa and Gyeonggi.

424
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,463
-Your order was…
-Right.

425
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,499
-Is this the order I wrote?
-Yes, it is.

426
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,738
You asked for a dish
that's good just the way it is.

427
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:00,639
Yes.

428
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,742
-That was your order, yes?
-It was.

429
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,078
It's nice when a guest
requests a specific dish.

430
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:07,979
Right.

431
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:11,483
But it's also nice to get
the occasional order that makes me think.

432
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,384
Right.

433
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,553
I really quite enjoy the orders

434
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,055
that make me reflect.

435
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,992
Your order also gave me
a moment to reflect.

436
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,028
-Your order.
-Yes?

437
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,832
It seemed riddled
with some of your concerns.

438
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:30,802
-I felt compelled to share their weight.
-Right, thank you.

439
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:34,372
I didn't have any worries about the food,

440
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:39,110
so I thought I'd order something that
resonates with my thoughts and concerns,

441
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,414
although I suspect that made it
a more challenging order.

442
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,315
Right.

443
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:47,853
The dish we're going to serve
in response to your order is curry.

444
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,489
-I like it.
-I'll hurry to… Sorry?

445
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,657
-Very well.
-Sounds good.

446
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,162
You're okay with curry, right?

447
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,296
Of course, I like it.

448
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,594
-Samchoon and I…
-Yes?

449
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:33,198
We poured our heart and soul
into making it an inviting dish.

450
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,402
-Thank you.
-It's an inviting curry.

451
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,504
-Here's your inviting curry.
-Inviting.

452
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:40,405
Yes.

453
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,669
-To me, curry is…
-Yes?

454
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:14,172
It's dish that fulfills
the last sentence of your order.

455
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,809
It's dish that's good
just the way it is,

456
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:23,281
even if it isn't perfect or complete.

457
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,985
-The curry I cooked today…
-Yes?

458
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,854
I would sell starting tomorrow.

459
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,423
Okay.

460
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,558
Why would you cook it the day before?

461
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,061
I think that's what makes a curry

462
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,531
truly delicious.

463
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,465
Right.

464
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:44,736
But even though I'd sell it tomorrow,
it's still fine to eat today.

465
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,107
-Because it's curry.
-Right, it's curry.

466
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:50,742
So,

467
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,645
even if it's not perfect, it's good as is.

468
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,914
I can't wait to dig in.

469
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:58,984
So… thank you.

470
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,051
-Please enjoy.
-Sure.

471
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:16,968
You're drizzling it at the perfect height.

472
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,370
-Am I?
-Yes.

473
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,139
-It's the perfect height.
-Great.

474
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:26,678
Aren't there usually chunks
of potato or carrot in curry?

475
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,913
I thought that was standard.

476
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,814
Right.

477
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:31,049
It looks very different.

478
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:35,086
Yes, even in Mom's curry,
she would always add potatoes.

479
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:41,092
-My mom.
-Oh, right.

480
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,629
Right, Mom's curry.

481
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:49,467
I haven't met your mother… Never mind.

482
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,575
-Curry also…
-It's delicious.

483
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,110
Well, thank you.

484
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,479
We used a bone broth base.

485
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:04,516
You seemed a little

486
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,518
worn out.

487
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,555
Like you had a lot of concerns

488
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:12,390
about the future.

489
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,559
I sensed some worries

490
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,662
about how to prepare for the future.

491
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,265
-Of course, I may be wrong.
-Sure.

492
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,367
So

493
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:24,202
instead of "hwaiting…"

494
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,907
You know, "Fighting!"

495
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:29,808
Fighting!

496
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,812
We wanted to cheer you on
as you face the fight of life,

497
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,648
so it's a pick-me-up.

498
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:38,817
But honestly,

499
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:40,885
it's seriously good.

500
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:46,558
The onions were a little sharp when raw.

501
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,693
-Right.
-But we heated them up.

502
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,662
-So they've taken on an inviting aroma.
-I see.

503
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,063
"Welcome."

504
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,332
-"Welcome."
-"I'm an onion."

505
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,233
"I'm an onion."

506
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,603
They started exuding
a more approachable aroma.

507
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,504
I see.

508
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,941
And to that, we added garlic and celery.

509
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,042
-And carrots.
-Really?

510
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,643
-Yes.
-Yes, they're all in there.

511
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,214
And mangoes.

512
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,582
Mangoes?

513
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:11,649
Yes, and bananas.

514
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:13,184
And apples.

515
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,922
These are ingredients
you wouldn't notice unless we told you.

516
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,257
Wow.

517
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,592
Because…

518
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,163
the curry has taken them all
under its wing.

519
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,931
Right.

520
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:31,669
Even if they're less than perfect,
under curry's wing,

521
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,506
they're able to find their place.

522
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,121
If the scent of butter

523
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,791
is a little too overwhelming…

524
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,092
-We have plain rice.
-It's not.

525
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,327
Not at all.

526
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:58,463
They pair beautifully. It's so tasty.

527
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,668
It's seriously good.
The meat is so tender.

528
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,338
We've used two kinds of meat.

529
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,774
Beef seuji,

530
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,143
which are the tendons.

531
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,046
And we also added some ribs.

532
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,714
-Ribs?
-Yes, rib meat.

533
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:17,715
Right.

534
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:22,053
So those two meats
are also dressed in curry.

535
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:26,891
-It's truly delicious.
-Thank you.

536
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:34,899
I'm glad.

537
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,435
Is it okay without any side dishes?

538
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,805
Totally. Could I please have
some more rice?

539
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:41,840
Of course.

540
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:08,333
Did you rush through that?

541
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,634
-Are you okay?
-I'm good.

542
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:13,171
It's really good.

543
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,007
Please eat up.

544
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,612
When moms leave on a last-minute trip,

545
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,513
you end up eating curry alone at home.

546
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,115
Curry in a bowl.

547
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:25,650
You would roughly

548
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,319
serve yourself some curry in a bowl.

549
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,754
-Right.
-And mix it up.

550
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:30,922
A rough mix.

551
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:34,525
The curry you indulge in
when you're home alone.

552
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:35,727
Right, I get you.

553
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,330
Right.

554
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:17,602
You know that sense of knowing someone
you've never actually met?

555
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:18,503
Sure.

556
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:22,240
I've never felt that more than today.

557
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:26,311
I almost blurted out, "Come on in!"

558
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,746
Did you almost say "You're all grown up"?

559
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:29,914
Yes, almost.

560
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:35,620
I feel as though, in some way,
we grew up together.

561
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,855
I haven't felt that with a lot of people.

562
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,457
I understand.

563
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:40,625
Thank you.

564
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:41,759
I'm feeling a little…

565
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,963
It's making me quite sentimental.

566
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,433
After reading your order,

567
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:51,169
preparing something
for you today felt easy.

568
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:52,470
-I felt…
-You did?

569
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,405
-I did.
-What about my order was…

570
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,674
"Even if it wouldn't
be considered complete."

571
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:01,179
Often, when I'm cooking,

572
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,682
I obsess over the idea of completion.

573
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,219
I worry about
whether my customer will be satisfied.

574
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,120
But

575
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,290
the way you worded your order.

576
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,193
I felt like you were being
considerate of me.

577
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:19,130
At the end, you wrote, "Even if it
wouldn't be considered complete."

578
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,699
"Something that's good the way it is."

579
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,202
That phrase, in and of itself,

580
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:30,174
let me prepare the food
with a much lighter heart.

581
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:31,976
If I'm honest,

582
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:36,014
that's actually not my handwriting.

583
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,015
It isn't?

584
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:38,483
Did your manager write it?

585
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:42,153
No, my usual handwriting looks different.

586
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,856
I must have written that order

587
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,592
over twenty times.

588
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:50,661
It felt like an introduction,

589
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:54,632
like you could probably tell what kind
of person I am just from my handwriting.

590
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,568
So I wanted to make an effort.

591
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:01,572
I wanted my writing to be neat,
but I think I just messed it up.

592
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:05,309
So I did write it myself,
but it's not my true handwriting.

593
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,079
I tried to imagine who you'd be.

594
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,013
Sure.

595
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,015
-Your handwriting is powerful.
-I agree.

596
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,618
Like calligraphy,
handwriting with a sense of breathing.

597
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:14,786
I wrote with a heavy hand.

598
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,254
I think that comes across.

599
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:17,588
Right.

600
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:18,923
I felt a sense of rhythm.

601
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,726
-That's a good thing, right?
-Yes.

602
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,261
-Great.
-It is.

603
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:28,666
It's been about seven years
since I've lived on my own now.

604
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,636
It's been a good while

605
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:36,874
since I've had a meal
that's been made with so much care.

606
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:40,244
At first, I ordered a lot of takeout,

607
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,981
which created so much plastic waste

608
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:45,550
that I felt a little pathetic.

609
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:50,888
My inability to cook
was causing so much waste.

610
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,957
So I started cooking here and there,

611
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,960
learning from YouTube videos.

612
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:59,697
But whatever I cook,
it always tastes the same.

613
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,899
Whether I cook kimchi-jjigae,

614
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:06,137
doenjang-jjigae, or sundubu-jjigae,

615
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,706
it always tastes the same.

616
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:12,910
At a certain point, I started wondering
whether my food tasted good.

617
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,514
I'm a little curious

618
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:22,019
how kimchi-jjigae and sundubu-jjigae
can taste the same.

619
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:24,455
Mine do.

620
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:25,723
It sounds good, though.

621
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,625
-Doesn't it sound good?
-It does.

622
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,161
Even if sundubu-jjigae
tastes like kimchi-jjigae…

623
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,433
that's still your cooking.

624
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,036
-Something only you can cook.
-Exactly.

625
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:39,937
Ask anyone,

626
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,941
"Can you make kimchi-jjigae
taste like sundubu-jjigae?"

627
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,043
"I can."

628
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:49,313
"You can't, can you?" That sort of thing.

629
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,216
But would that still be considered
sundubu-jjigae?

630
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,151
That would be…

631
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,353
You can call it
Seung-ho's special sundubu-jjigae.

632
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,088
Let's do that, yes.

633
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,358
You don't have to live
by the world's definitions.

634
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:01,259
Right.

635
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,296
"Could you do this?"

636
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,838
-Are you speaking from experience?
-I guess I am.

637
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,173
If you…

638
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,708
Other people will see you

639
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,178
and think, "Hey, that's a skill."

640
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,480
I have a question.

641
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,650
There's something I always fail to do.

642
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:29,453
You know the order
of putting oil in a pan, sautéing kimchi,

643
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,290
adding the next ingredient, and so on?

644
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,191
Yes.

645
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:37,195
I get impatient
and do things out of order.

646
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:39,063
So I…

647
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,200
-You start with water?
-I just boil water.

648
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,169
Shove all the ingredients in,
then let it boil.

649
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,304
I see.

650
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,607
If that's the case, for your own good,

651
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,542
if you get impatient…

652
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:56,347
I want to eat quickly
and move on to doing other things.

653
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,417
I think you need rest.

654
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,018
He does.

655
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,753
You should rest.

656
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,223
You're right. He does, doesn't he?

657
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,658
The ingredients also need rest.

658
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,930
You can shove everything in
and cook it all at once.

659
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:15,032
-Right.
-You can.

660
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,400
It's perfectly fine.

661
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:19,470
But there are things
that should be cooked separately.

662
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:24,308
For example, if you cook
high-sodium ingredients with low ones,

663
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,776
it affects the final result.

664
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,846
-It makes the dish saltier.
-Right.

665
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,914
Because of the heat.

666
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:35,353
So, even if it feels a little frustrating,
you should set those ingredients aside.

667
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,154
Think about what to add in later.

668
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:42,260
If you consider such things,
you should get a better final result.

669
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:45,529
At the appropriate time,

670
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,998
you need to let things rest.

671
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:48,699
Let things rest.

672
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:53,204
You need to take some rest,

673
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:57,041
and the quality of rest is also important.

674
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:02,146
You need rest
that allows your heart to heal.

675
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,149
When you learn a skill…

676
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:09,487
Back in the day,
when I was learning how to fillet fish,

677
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,857
they would train us intensively
for a full week,

678
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,093
then tell us to rest for about three days.

679
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:21,098
The idea was that our bodies
would automatically absorb the skills

680
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,201
while we were resting.

681
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,204
Your body says,
"Thank you for letting me rest,"

682
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,174
and somehow, you seem to learn faster.

683
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,478
So if things feel monotonous

684
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,781
or if you feel uninspired,

685
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:41,519
you could consider ways
to give your heart some rest.

686
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,990
I think that might be helpful.

687
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:51,495
In your order,

688
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:54,932
you mentioned having flaws and weaknesses.

689
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,702
-I did.
-What might those flaws be?

690
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:03,841
I think, inevitably,
they're mostly related to my work.

691
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,209
Acting.

692
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,680
It's only been a couple of years
since I've found joy in acting.

693
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:12,116
I would say five years at most,

694
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,019
despite having worked for 28 years.

695
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,789
And what's hit me
are my shortcomings and flaws,

696
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:22,426
the ones I didn't even notice
when I had no real drive for acting.

697
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,362
I started noticing so many of them.

698
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,964
After hitting the age of 30,

699
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:31,902
I can sense a real difference
in the way I absorb things.

700
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:32,803
Back in the day,

701
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,905
I was very sharp.

702
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:37,074
Or, at the very least,
I could mimic things.

703
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,945
But at some point,
it hit me how much slower I am.

704
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:46,050
For a while,
I wondered whether it was all too late.

705
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,987
If I'd realized too late just how much
I still needed to learn and grow.

706
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:55,893
Earlier today,

707
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,928
this very morning,

708
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,865
while I was cooking the curry,

709
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,068
I wondered if it was too late

710
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,872
and if I had enough time
to complete the dish.

711
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:09,473
"Will it taste good?"

712
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:15,613
At the start of all journeys,
you're bound to have so many thoughts,

713
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,449
but just have certainty…

714
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,888
because you're revisiting
what you've already experienced.

715
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,055
Right.

716
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,891
-"I've made curry before."
-Right.

717
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:29,827
"Others may not know it,

718
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,663
but I've walked this walk before."

719
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,199
"So I can walk it again."

720
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,235
If you just have that in mind

721
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,104
as you approach your goal,

722
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,540
you'll arrive fine.

723
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,441
And maybe,

724
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:45,276
you're cooking a curry of your own.

725
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:46,944
Yes.

726
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,814
Maybe that will ease some anxiety.

727
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:53,250
It's still curry.

728
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,389
Am I talking nonsense?

729
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,390
Not at all.

730
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,225
-Then, let's say…
-Yes?

731
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:06,263
You've made a thousand curries,
and you know it's something you can do.

732
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:10,634
What if you make a mistake
on something that is a total no-brainer?

733
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:12,803
-A novice mistake.
-Right.

734
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,773
Do you find you can forgive yourself?

735
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,844
I can't forgive myself, no.

736
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,811
-Right.
-It's hard.

737
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:26,283
Especially if others are watching
when I make such a mistake.

738
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,420
First things first, I'm embarrassed.

739
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,754
Right.

740
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,558
But mistakes open the door

741
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,628
to discovering and gaining new tools.

742
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,564
You never know
when these tools might come in handy.

743
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,200
-Right.
-Let's say I'm chopping onions.

744
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:46,504
If you have the experience
of cutting your hand,

745
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,839
you might seek out another tool.

746
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,241
Maybe a mandolin.

747
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,343
That's why we used a mandolin today.

748
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:53,744
Right.

749
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:58,616
These tools
will eventually prove their value.

750
00:41:59,116 --> 00:41:59,950
Sure.

751
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:01,485
You're right.

752
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,822
Shall we cheer him up a little?

753
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,223
Sure, let's do that.

754
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:08,325
-Our own "fighting."
-Yes.

755
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,461
One, two, three.

756
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,170
I didn't say anything out loud,

757
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:22,106
but deep down inside…

758
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:25,643
I yelled "fighting" for you.

759
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,644
Right.

760
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,580
Did I receive it from you?

761
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:30,848
-You did.
-I did?

762
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,216
Did you not receive it?

763
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,285
No, I think I did. I received something…

764
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:40,324
Receive it this time.

765
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,225
Sure.

766
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,427
-Listen carefully.
-Okay.

767
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:44,695
One, two, three.

768
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,040
I almost broke my molars.

769
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:58,275
I heard a cracking.

770
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,377
Me too. I thought
that was the sound of my teeth.

771
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:02,146
I guess it was your teeth cracking.

772
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:10,054
Was today's meal good just the way it was?

773
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,524
Yes. It was perfect.

774
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:18,028
It's been a while

775
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:22,266
since I've had food
that felt like a proper meal.

776
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,467
It was so delicious.

777
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:28,672
You read my order and took it seriously.

778
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:32,209
You didn't just skim it
and serve a meal that sort of fit.

779
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,211
From beginning to end,

780
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:38,616
it's clear you put
so much thought into the food.

781
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:44,021
The curry you served me today
was so meaningful.

782
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,290
I'm truly grateful.

783
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,461
The thing with curry is,

784
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:52,663
because of its simplicity,

785
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,000
it's not normally considered a fancy dish.

786
00:43:56,533 --> 00:44:02,106
But you've gracefully called this curry
a "proper meal."

787
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,410
Thank you for calling it that.

788
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,416
If you're finished,
I'll clear your plates.

789
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,751
Yes, thank you.

790
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,121
It's really good.

791
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,257
So good.

792
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,328
Could I ask for a to-go box?

793
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:25,396
Of course.

794
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:30,901
I have a manager and staff
who have worked with me for years.

795
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:33,504
-We'll pack some up for you.
-Perfect.

796
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,205
I would be so honored.

797
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,474
There's enough curry to feed ten people.

798
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,177
We'll just pack that up for you.

799
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:42,179
-That should be fine.
-You can do that?

800
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:43,647
Thank you.

801
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:44,982
-It's nothing.
-I'll also…

802
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,584
I'll eat it again tomorrow.

803
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:53,223
As you eat, you could compare
the taste to today's curry,

804
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:57,094
and I think
you'll enjoy tasting the difference.

805
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:59,229
Understood. I'll do that.

806
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,434
-This is our menu.
-Right.

807
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,371
We don't receive payment for our food,

808
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,306
but we ask guests to name their dish.

809
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,274
Of course.

810
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:29,593
Yes.

811
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:31,829
Curry.

812
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,098
Is it kare or curry? Kare?

813
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:36,834
I think either works.

814
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,338
I want to come up with something…

815
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:44,808
that includes "curry."

816
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:58,589
-Are you done?
-Yes.

817
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:09,666
Right.

818
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:15,672
"Imperfectly Beautiful Curry."

819
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:19,143
It's imperfect but seems perfect.

820
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:22,146
It seems incomplete
but somehow feels complete.

821
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:25,215
You gifted me with
an incompletely complete curry,

822
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:27,951
and, to me, it was simply perfect

823
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:30,087
and complete.

824
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:33,624
It was incredible,
so I thought I'd name it that.

825
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:37,694
"Imperfectly Beautiful Curry."

826
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:41,965
You've used the character "mi,"
which means "beauty."

827
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:46,703
I thought you would name it,
"Imperfectly Insane Curry."

828
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:49,773
-Right.
-Well…

829
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,341
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

830
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:53,443
Thank you.

831
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:55,379
The food was delicious.

832
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:03,120
Here's the takeout you requested.

833
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:04,121
Thank you so much.

834
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:05,823
We'll enjoy this.

835
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:06,790
Thank you.

836
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:08,058
-Please take care.
-Take care.

837
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,426
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

838
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:20,637
INCOMPLETELY BEAUTIFUL CURRY

839
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,584
"Just for today, I would like to try
the epitome of fine dining,

840
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:36,119
so I won't go home and crave
something like cockle bibimbap."

841
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,689
Our own clam sot-bap.

842
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:40,724
We'll redefine "fine dining."

843
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:43,060
The silent outcry of umami.

844
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,962
Introverted MSG.

845
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,265
Oh, hello.

846
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:50,534
Can you see it?

847
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,202
This is fascinating.

848
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:53,937
Deep sea, shallow sea.

849
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:56,006
It feels like I just got out of the water.

850
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,474
It's such a pleasure.

851
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,842
You should tell the clams.

852
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,310
It's a pleasure to meet you!
