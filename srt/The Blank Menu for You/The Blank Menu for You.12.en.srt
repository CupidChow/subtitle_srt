00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,119
URGENT HIRING
HALL MANAGER/KITCHEN ASSISTANT

2
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,187
DISTANT FAMILY-LIKE TEAM
CLUMSY SLACKERS WELCOME

3
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:31,064
Your story is served as today's menu in…

4
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,034
The Blank Menu for You.

5
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:46,679
Hey, Samchoon.

6
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:48,348
You're in early today.

7
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:49,616
Yes, well…

8
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,017
I came in early today

9
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,953
and was just tidying up a bit
since it's my last day.

10
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:59,559
It is your last day,
so I suggest you take it easy.

11
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:05,665
Today is Sang-hoon's…

12
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:09,235
final day with us.

13
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,206
I think he said
he was going on a working holiday.

14
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,811
He hasn't been with us for long,

15
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,613
yet he's leaving.

16
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,350
It saddens me.

17
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:30,290
This is my last day
at the Blank Menu for You.

18
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,327
I've been here since the day
we first opened,

19
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,630
but I've decided to go
on a working holiday, and…

20
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,334
I'm heading to someplace warm.

21
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,039
Are you gonna be fine without me?

22
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,373
Of course not.

23
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,078
This is a moment that cannot be avoided.

24
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,048
-I have to be here.
-You do.

25
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,118
My name is still on the lease,

26
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,786
and yours isn't.

27
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:00,920
You're right.

28
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,623
And I have to pay the rent.

29
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,360
It's not like you gave me a raise
when it got busy.

30
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:09,362
Well, we were never busy.

31
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,497
True.

32
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,867
My wish is for you to make it

33
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:15,869
and hire me.

34
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,873
-I hate paying rent.
-Okay.

35
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:20,940
Hire me, please.

36
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,348
This is just the sad part of me talking.

37
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,818
"Stop calling me Samchoon!"

38
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,821
-That's how it all started.
-Yes.

39
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,789
Let's get going.

40
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,693
Let's set our feelings aside
and get to work for now.

41
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,829
-We'll say our goodbyes later.
-All right.

42
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:47,600
Yet again, an order came in today.

43
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:52,105
"I believe that a sense of fullness
is also a measure of taste and pleasure."

44
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,875
"I would love to enjoy
a luxurious bowl of mazesoba,

45
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:59,012
crafted generously
with your refined taste and skill."

46
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:03,349
"I hope for a bowl so delicious
that by the time I come to my senses,

47
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,618
I'll have finished
even the rice at the end."

48
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,487
"I'd prefer the dish

49
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:11,024
to carry more of a meaty aroma
rather than the scent of katsuobushi."

50
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:20,733
This handwriting looks quite familiar.

51
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,872
I know a guy named Nam-no.

52
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,373
I think it's his.

53
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,042
-Chef Yoon Nam-no?
-Yes.

54
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:33,413
Today's guest has quite an appetite.

55
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:38,551
He's someone
who places great importance on eating,

56
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,120
and I know him quite well.

57
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:42,956
Because today's guest…

58
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,292
is me.

59
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,760
Yes, finally!

60
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,563
One of my talents

61
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,833
is being able to mimic
different handwriting styles.

62
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,903
Now, I'm not sure
how Chef Yoon Nam-no writes, but…

63
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,138
"Wait, he thought of Yoon Nam-no?"

64
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,407
"Even better. This is going well!"

65
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,142
I'm going to fool him completely.

66
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,112
It can't be him.

67
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,649
But I do recognize that handwriting.

68
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,984
It must be him.

69
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,856
One thing's for sure.

70
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,560
This guest doesn't care
about anything else.

71
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,829
They just want the mazesoba.

72
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,297
That really shows.

73
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,532
Mazesoba.

74
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,368
"Maze" means "to mix."

75
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,204
A BROTHLESS JAPANESE NOODLE DISH
MIXED WITH TOPPINGS AND SAUCES

76
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,672
Do you like mazesoba?

77
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,173
I do, actually.

78
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,709
GARLIC CHIVES, BEAN SPROUTS,
EGG YOLK, CABBAGE, DRIED FISH POWDER

79
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,678
BAMBOO SHOOTS, PLENTY OF MEAT,
FRIED RAMEN CHIPS

80
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,313
I personally prefer mazesoba

81
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,915
with big pieces of meat
instead of ground meat.

82
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,218
-Like the kind in ramen?
-That's right.

83
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,020
I like chashu as well,

84
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:50,556
but I prefer the meat to be a bit thicker
and more tender.

85
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,260
In short, I like mazesoba
that's loaded with plenty of meat.

86
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,729
As for what else I like…

87
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,302
-A ball of sunshine.
-Egg yolk.

88
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,369
In bright orange.

89
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:09,108
You can add both the egg white
and the yolk,

90
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,044
but I prefer just the yolk.

91
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,981
Another thing I really like
is fried ramen chips.

92
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,984
Yes, they need to go in.

93
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,253
-Do you mean crumbs?
-Yes, extra crispy.

94
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,256
And top it off with cheese.

95
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,026
What matters most
is the sticky, chewy texture.

96
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,696
That's what you get
after you mix the ingredients.

97
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,165
-It's amazing.
-Okay.

98
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,766
Shall we get to it?

99
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,568
Very well. What's my task for today?

100
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,071
Before anything else…

101
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:44,010
Remember the first task you handled
on the day we first met?

102
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:51,417
I want you to bring back the memories
of removing anchovy guts, one by one.

103
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,754
-Ready to snap the heads off bean sprouts?
-Yes.

104
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,124
Here.

105
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,226
Bean sprouts

106
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:05,298
are much easier to eat
when the heads are removed.

107
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,634
-A subtle detail.
-I see.

108
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,204
-Sorry to work you until the end.
-Don't be.

109
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,272
Gotta end strong, you know.

110
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,208
-Leave on a high note, right?
-Exactly.

111
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,779
-Take it easy, okay?
-All right.

112
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:23,483
One more thing.

113
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:25,952
Look.

114
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,021
Do you like pork belly?

115
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,557
-I love it skin-on.
-Do you, now? I thought so.

116
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,559
-Look what I have here.
-Skin-on pork belly?

117
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,629
-The skin hasn't been removed.
-Right. We cook it whole.

118
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:40,233
Now we're going to sear the skin side
over high heat

119
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:43,035
to draw out color and aroma.

120
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,438
-Then we simmer it.
-Got it.

121
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:44,464
RINSE IN HOT WATER TO REMOVE EXCESS FAT

122
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,130
PRESSURE COOK FOR 1 HOUR WITH GINGER,
KOREAN LEEK GREENS, CHICKEN POWDER

123
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,906
It's not that much
once the heads are gone.

124
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,510
How does it look?

125
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,078
-It looks really neat.
-Yes.

126
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:35,414
You could say this kind of refinement
takes the dish to another level.

127
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,017
It's such a tedious task.

128
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,119
-Thank you.
-No problem.

129
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,990
Next, we'll need some flavored oil
to mix the ingredients.

130
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,258
Some oil with aroma.

131
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,959
Today, we'll be using lard.

132
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,327
WHITE, SEMI-SOLID FAT FROM PIGS

133
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,595
-Pig fat.
-Pig fat.

134
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,798
Using lard alone might feel heavy,
so I'll add some onions.

135
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,942
Plenty of onions to bring out the aroma.

136
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,515
COOK LARD AND ONIONS TOGETHER
TO MAKE FLAVORED OIL

137
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,088
Now,

138
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,559
we're going to make a sauce with soy sauce

139
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,827
to mix into the mazesoba.

140
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,964
-Soy sauce.
-Yes, soy sauce.

141
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,566
We'll use it as the base.

142
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,805
MIRIN

143
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,455
Sugar too.

144
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,591
And then…

145
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,895
Something that will make it
cling perfectly to your mouth.

146
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:56,896
MIWON

147
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,097
-Seasoning.
-Yes.

148
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,000
Now we simmer this…

149
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,106
to add just a touch of garlic
to the sauce.

150
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,757
Here's the onion and lard mixture.

151
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:29,629
We're going to blend this fragrant oil
into the mixture.

152
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,634
I can already smell
that rich, savory aroma.

153
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,435
-Makes you hungry, right?
-It does.

154
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,605
We need to scoop out the solids.

155
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,875
We're going to put garlic in this bowl.

156
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,011
-Okay.
-Fish them out like this.

157
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,523
Let's use this garlic as a topping.

158
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,326
-All right.
-Take just a bit of this and…

159
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,662
-Have you ever tried this?
-No, I haven't.

160
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,031
Grab a pinch.

161
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,337
It tastes like pickled garlic.

162
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,675
Just a small amount spices up the dish.

163
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,146
We'll use this sauce later.

164
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:27,286
This will be the main sauce
used for mixing the noodles.

165
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,156
We need to make another one
for seasoning the pork.

166
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,625
-So it'll be a rich sauce.
-Yes, quite so.

167
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,728
Soy sauce, 600 ml.

168
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,132
Add some water.

169
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,602
COMBINE SOY SAUCE, MIRIN,
KATSUO DASHI, CHEONGJU, AND SUGAR

170
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:44,503
Boil it.

171
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,856
ADD SCORED KOREAN LEEK, GARLIC, AND GINGER
BOIL TO MAKE PORK BRAISING SAUCE

172
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:08,994
-Wait until the sauce is seasoned.
-Okay.

173
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,098
Then we pull out the pork belly
and dunk it in.

174
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:18,370
There.

175
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:21,941
-I'll open it.
-Okay.

176
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,614
Goodness!

177
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,585
See this chunk of pork?

178
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,488
-We'll drown it in the sauce.
-Yes.

179
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:36,822
Let it absorb the flavor.

180
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:41,961
So tender.

181
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,931
It's only wobbling because I'm shaking it.

182
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,466
It looks delicious.

183
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,602
-It'll be delicious as is.
-I bet it will.

184
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,605
Just put it in your mouth
and press it with your tongue.

185
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,141
-Castella cake.
-It'll just melt away.

186
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,644
-It doesn't have to be ground meat.
-I see.

187
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,246
Look.

188
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,349
Time to put these in the sauce.

189
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,452
Just dunk them in nicely.

190
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:10,823
Now…

191
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,862
After the pork is seasoned,

192
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,498
we'll slice it into large pieces.

193
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,233
And when the guest arrives…

194
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,368
Dunk!

195
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,838
As the guest mixes the soba,
you'll hear the meat getting crushed.

196
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,140
-I can hear it now.
-That's it.

197
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,876
-It looks like the guest loves meat.
-Okay.

198
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,612
Let's make sure they can really savor it.

199
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,220
He doesn't know yet.

200
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:54,533
Just imagine.

201
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,137
When this rich oil is dancing
with the noodles,

202
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,672
it's going to be…

203
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,843
Thinking about health, this would be…

204
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,681
Even the smell is breathtaking.

205
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,065
It's not salty at all.

206
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,934
-Yes, well…
-The umami is just…

207
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:34,039
You know how you mix
the tenderized pork into the soba?

208
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:37,743
See this upper part attached to the pork?

209
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,078
The fatty part.

210
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:46,018
Personally, I think a lot of pork's flavor
comes from this fat.

211
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:50,890
That's why I chose to include
this fatty part generously.

212
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,158
Now, let's turn off the heat.

213
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,226
-Okay.
-And then…

214
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,035
Garlic chives are essential.

215
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,907
BAMBOO SHOOTS

216
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,380
And these here are fried ramen chips.

217
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,049
These add an interesting texture
when mixed in.

218
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,620
We're just about ready.

219
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,022
Garlic chives.

220
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,058
-We'll give these a quick blanch.
-Okay.

221
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,964
Remember how we simmered
the onions in lard earlier?

222
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:36,101
Add a bit of oil to the water
when blanching the vegetables.

223
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:37,770
It really boosts the flavor.

224
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,073
-No need for a full boil.
-Okay.

225
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,675
-Now we…
-Drop.

226
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,076
Yes, in you go.

227
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,947
-The buzzer goes off!
-Yes.

228
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,115
I'll just count to ten.

229
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:51,650
-Ten.
-Yes.

230
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:56,388
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven.

231
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:00,459
Six. Five. Four. Three.

232
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,128
Two. One.

233
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,730
-Shall we stop here?
-Yes.

234
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,565
Just like that.

235
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,668
See? Even the color looks different.

236
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:13,005
Vegetables taste better
when you blanch them with oil.

237
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:16,208
-It smells good too.
-Yes, look at that sheen.

238
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,277
I'd rather the guest arrived now.

239
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,179
Everything's at its best.

240
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,915
-But we have to stay on schedule.
-Right.

241
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,617
Bean sprouts.

242
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:32,658
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven.

243
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:36,528
Six. Five. Four. Three.

244
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,797
Two. One.

245
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,002
Flip them over before you take them out.

246
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,674
With pho, you just dip
the bean sprouts in for a second.

247
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,943
-That's right.
-Raw bean sprouts.

248
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,278
But you still want to keep
this level of crunch.

249
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:54,980
Okay, all done.

250
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,116
-Let's wait for the guest.
-All right.

251
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,616
Do you think it's a male guest?

252
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,786
It's definitely a guy.

253
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,222
He tried to hide his identity

254
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,890
with the heart shape.

255
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,594
-That chiseled heart.
-So it's definitely a guy.

256
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,267
Nam-no?

257
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,441
Seriously, how have you not
figured it out by now?

258
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,709
It's me.

259
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,377
I'm the guest today!

260
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,365
Is the guest at the door?

261
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,668
You can come in!

262
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,474
We're open.

263
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,012
You can come in now.

264
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:28,700
Is this the Blank…

265
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,436
Is this the Blank…

266
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,709
Is this the Blank Menu for You?

267
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,044
Hello.

268
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,079
Well.

269
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,119
-Hi there.
-Hi.

270
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,254
Did you know?

271
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,127
Did you know it was me?

272
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,066
Today's menu is simple. Mazesoba.

273
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,669
I once talked

274
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,139
about mazesoba with Sang-hoon before.

275
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,476
And now it's on the menu?
I figured that couldn't be a coincidence.

276
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,546
It had to be Sang-hoon.

277
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:19,184
OUR TWELFTH GUEST
MOON SANG-HOON

278
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,720
-I knew it was you.
-Did I give it away?

279
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,388
-Yes, of course.
-Oh no!

280
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,228
I could sense a somewhat…

281
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,699
odd, awkward vibe in the air.

282
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,434
You seemed quite restless.

283
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,570
Oh no.

284
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:42,574
I also remembered how you once said

285
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,980
you liked mazesoba when we talked before.

286
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,916
And the handwriting looked familiar.

287
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,818
Since when did you figure it out?

288
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,420
I've known for a while now.

289
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,191
Like, before today?

290
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,293
Yes.

291
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:05,831
Then how did you feel,

292
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:10,636
watching me desperately trying
to hide something you already know?

293
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,771
I admired your innocence.

294
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,976
Oh God. This is so embarrassing.

295
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,244
And your final act?

296
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,813
That was the best part.

297
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,617
"You can come in,"
followed by the most awkward exit.

298
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,291
How embarrassing.

299
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,727
I wonder why he even brought up

300
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,629
Chef Yoon.

301
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,336
I'll tell you how I feel.

302
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,106
Let's say I'm hiding
under a blanket, giggling,

303
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,975
while my parents are looking for me.

304
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,811
"I don't think he's under the blanket,"

305
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,413
and I'm giggling like this.

306
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,149
To think how all of that
must have shown on my face…

307
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,986
It's embarrassing. So, so embarrassing.

308
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,121
And I wish I could take it all back.

309
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,991
Let me check your order.

310
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,066
The truth is,

311
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:18,003
every time I interview a new employee,

312
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:22,407
I have a feeling
a day like this will come.

313
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,010
I've been through it many times,

314
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,080
and I'm sure this is not the last time.

315
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:32,951
It's been such a joy meeting you,
and it's been so much fun.

316
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,155
Are you the guest who ordered mazesoba?

317
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,623
-Yes.
-A sense of fullness?

318
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,558
Yes.

319
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:40,826
Complimentary rice.

320
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,628
And you prefer a meaty aroma
to the scent of katsuobushi.

321
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,865
Honestly,
you saw the whole cooking process.

322
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,534
-I bet it took away the excitement.
-Not at all.

323
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,508
I hope you enjoy the meal happily,

324
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,511
just like this smiling sun.

325
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,748
Should I go and fetch
my own water and utensils--

326
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,416
-They are self-service.
-Of course.

327
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:22,734
To be across from you like this…

328
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,202
-It's refreshing.
-Yes.

329
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,872
But I feel sad at the same time.

330
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,207
I'm overwhelmed with emotions.

331
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,078
I've had a bunch of moments like this.

332
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,881
People I used to work with
would show up as guests.

333
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,718
Did they quit to go on a working holiday?

334
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,319
Yes, then I'd run into them

335
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:43,522
around the block or at another restaurant.

336
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:23,929
I wonder how many guests have seen
the chef's back like that.

337
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:28,033
How many guests has he cooked for,

338
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:31,770
done the dishes for, wiped his hands for,

339
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,872
and prepared meals for?

340
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:39,611
It felt strange, grateful,
and deeply moving

341
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,480
because I was lucky enough

342
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:45,750
to have become
one of those countless guests.

343
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,584
I'll show you the whole thing.

344
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,721
First,

345
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,391
toss the hot noodles like this.

346
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:31,129
The heat melts the flavored oil,

347
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,532
and it wraps around the noodles.

348
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:35,767
This one first.

349
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,138
Just a bit of katsuobushi.

350
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,742
-Should I add a lot of chives?
-Yes, please.

351
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:52,484
Ramen chips might be a bit heavy.

352
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,220
-Let me know later if you need more.
-Okay.

353
00:25:56,821 --> 00:26:02,360
It might be a bit salty,
but the cabbage will mellow it out.

354
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:20,278
Here is the beautifully boiled pork belly

355
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,213
with the skin on.

356
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,119
A ball of sunshine.

357
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,990
-Is that white pepper?
-It is.

358
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,992
Just a little sprinkle over the pork.

359
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:36,494
Next.

360
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,533
Cheese.

361
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,669
It might not be for everyone.

362
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:48,673
When I was serving the other guests,
I used to think,

363
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,342
"If I ever got to be a guest,

364
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,410
I'd just dig in and wolf it down."

365
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:57,115
But after seeing the whole preparation,
it feels rude to just wolf it down.

366
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,685
You can eat like nobody's watching.

367
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:02,887
Thank you so much.

368
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:27,879
The dish is all yours.

369
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,316
So mix and enjoy it as much as you want.

370
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:33,718
-I'll get mixing.
-Sure.

371
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,529
Can I mash it all up while mixing?

372
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,798
Yeah, don't worry about keeping it pretty.

373
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:49,601
-Okay.
-If the fat smashes, let it smash.

374
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,470
If the meat breaks apart,
let it break apart.

375
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:53,872
Mash it all up.

376
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,243
If you need another yolk,
feel free to take one.

377
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:02,881
People actually add an extra yolk
for its rich, savory taste.

378
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,150
-I see.
-There are still two more left.

379
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,418
I'll keep that in mind.

380
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,300
Here I go.

381
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,884
I totally get why you added
the ramen chips.

382
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:41,986
I feel like

383
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:47,292
food's more fun
when it catches you off guard a little.

384
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:01,940
It's just amazing.

385
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,431
I'm actually crazy about mazesoba.

386
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,400
Whenever I see a place, I always try it.

387
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,468
I see.

388
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,270
This is the best one.

389
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,108
Hands down.

390
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,378
I've tried Menya Hanabi

391
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,914
and places in Japan too.

392
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,716
Yours is the best.

393
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,888
This is the best mazesoba
I've had in my entire life.

394
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,657
-No competition.
-Please stop!

395
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,526
No competition at all.

396
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,196
The ramen chips are seriously good.

397
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,599
Is grated cheese a nice addition?

398
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,401
The cheese is excellent.

399
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,770
Everything about this dish is excellent.

400
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,518
You can mix some rice with the sauce.

401
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:21,586
-May I?
-Sure.

402
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,189
-I would also like some more meat.
-Obviously.

403
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,456
-Please.
-More meat.

404
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:28,193
-And some egg yolk?
-I'd love to have more yolk too.

405
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,053
Here.

406
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,522
You can start all over again.

407
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:00,024
Thank you kindly.

408
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,268
See all that sauce around the edges?

409
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:11,870
-Yes.
-Scrape it all up.

410
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:13,538
And mix away.

411
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,073
Okay. I'll do that.

412
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:20,478
Nothing can top this.

413
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,154
Whenever I have mazesoba,

414
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,491
I love saving a bit of sauce

415
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:37,161
and mixing it
with the meat and rice at the end.

416
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,429
It's a pleasant treat.

417
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,032
I clean the whole thing out.

418
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:50,942
Do you remember
when we first worked together?

419
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,210
-Yes.
-You do.

420
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,313
Since this is our last day together,

421
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:59,918
I put on the same hat I wore back then.

422
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,454
Not a big deal, but…

423
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:08,793
After your first day of working here,

424
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,528
what were your thoughts?

425
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,497
To be honest,

426
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:17,769
I'm not great at talking smoothly
without tripping over my words.

427
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:22,740
So whenever I meet someone,
I always tell them,

428
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,510
"I need to stick to my own pace."

429
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:30,381
But every time
we were in the kitchen together,

430
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:36,788
I didn't have to slow down
or speed up my pace,

431
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:38,890
so I felt comfortable.

432
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:43,561
Your rhythm just clicked with mine
without us having to try,

433
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,230
so it was always comforting.

434
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,301
How did you find our first day together?

435
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,304
You know that feeling?

436
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:57,508
Like you're wearing clothes
that just don't suit you.

437
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:02,313
That's how I felt every time
I tried to do something.

438
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:07,385
But with you, every moment was fun.

439
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:13,124
And your quick thinking
caught me off guard so many times.

440
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:16,694
There were times in the kitchen

441
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,264
when you had to handle hot things.

442
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:24,602
You also had to cool blanched vegetables

443
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:27,038
in ice-cold water.

444
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:31,275
You made it look like it was nothing,
and I thought it was really cool.

445
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,612
Are you naturally good
at dealing with heat?

446
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,582
I wouldn't say I'm good at it.

447
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:42,186
My skin just got a little thicker,
enough to stand the heat for a bit.

448
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:44,789
Just for a bit.

449
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,292
But hot is still hot.

450
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:50,294
What I mean is…

451
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,034
Hot is hot for everyone,

452
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,970
and cold is cold for everyone.

453
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,107
There's no need to pretend like it's not.

454
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,613
But even for a humble man like you,

455
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,349
are there still things
that feel especially hot or painful?

456
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,217
Stuff you never really get used to?

457
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,753
This might sound ironic.

458
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,489
I get used to compliments from guests
pretty quickly,

459
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,925
but their criticism stings every time.

460
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,929
I never get used to being scolded.

461
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,065
Things like criticism, critique,

462
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:31,602
and other kinds of comments
that seem similar but hit differently…

463
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:36,908
I'm just not immune to taking in
that kind of negative energy.

464
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:38,943
It's difficult to get used to.

465
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,146
It slashes at my heart.

466
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:47,018
"I'm fine with fair criticism,

467
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,888
but I wish people would hold back
on reckless blame."

468
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,293
This was a famous line a while ago.

469
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,096
But I say,
"I'm fine without fair criticism."

470
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,899
"Pay before you speak."

471
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,036
That's what I think.

472
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:08,673
Do you also have a lot of enemies?

473
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,743
For me, the channel I post on

474
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,913
only shows videos to subscribers.

475
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,316
People have to look them up to find them,

476
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,452
so I guess I don't get that many haters.

477
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,255
But still…

478
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,258
Among a bunch of compliments,

479
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,661
there's always that one comment
that pokes at you.

480
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,330
-Yes.
-And…

481
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,300
A single word can leave a real scar
on your heart.

482
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:39,170
"Boring as hell." That did it for me.

483
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,440
"Boring" alone is a harsh word,
but "boring as hell"?

484
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,242
-"Boring as hell."
-That's hurtful.

485
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,710
"Boring as hell."

486
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:47,545
Hey, bug off!

487
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:49,780
Watch something else!

488
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,048
Bug off!

489
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,819
Get out.

490
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:05,897
If I may ask,

491
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,232
are you

492
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,967
ready to meet

493
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,503
your new partner?

494
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,404
Nope.

495
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,975
I feel like taking a short break too.

496
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,545
You might know this already,

497
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,814
but when going from elementary
to middle school

498
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:27,385
or entering a new classroom
in the next grade,

499
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,454
it's only the first hour that's hard.

500
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,724
Thoughts like "Last year was better"

501
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:37,195
or "I miss elementary school"
usually fade after about an hour.

502
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:41,732
A new partner will come,
and you'll prepare dishes together,

503
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,869
asking things like,
"Could you peel some potatoes?"

504
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,605
and chatting casually,
"What do you usually like?"

505
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,608
or "What's your favorite food?"

506
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,410
Before you know it,

507
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,612
I'll probably be forgotten.

508
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,517
My nine-year-old daughter

509
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,221
has these close friends,

510
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:09,260
and recently she's noticed
that two of them have become closer,

511
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,431
often hanging out without her.

512
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,266
She came to me and said,

513
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,202
"I feel like I'm being forgotten."

514
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:21,572
That's what she said to me.

515
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:23,574
The feeling of being forgotten.

516
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,779
That's what I'm feeling now.

517
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,817
Sure, we'll be forgotten.

518
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,588
-But our memories will last.
-Yes.

519
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,426
Go on your working holiday later.

520
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,129
You can stay here.

521
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:51,135
I'll be in charge
of cleaning the restroom, then.

522
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,641
Where are you planning to go?

523
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,542
I'm going to look into it now.

524
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,111
You're looking into it now?

525
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,546
It's not planned out?

526
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,283
I need to think about where I should go.

527
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,253
And about this…

528
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,255
Normally, the welcome messages

529
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,357
are for the guests,

530
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,626
but today, I wrote one for you.

531
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,228
-You can take it.
-Okay.

532
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:19,497
I've always wondered

533
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:23,167
what it'd be like
to get one of these myself.

534
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,972
"To Samchoon,
who gently stews all the awkward moments

535
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,107
of the world with so much care,

536
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,244
you always take the time

537
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,112
to explain your food to the guests,

538
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,181
yet you never forget to say,

539
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,851
'Please double-check,
just in case I'm wrong.'"

540
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,988
"So many people love you
for that thoughtfulness."

541
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:48,492
"To you, who finds fulfillment
in your guests' happiness,

542
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,496
I want to say thank you, from all of us."

543
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:54,532
"I wish you well."

544
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,138
My turn.

545
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:04,275
I'm…

546
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:08,012
I'm not sure what this feeling is,
but it made me write a letter.

547
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,747
Wow, this is…

548
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,084
"Under the influence"?

549
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,019
THE MEANING OF YOU
(WRITTEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE)

550
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,491
"Every task I entrusted to you, Samchoon,

551
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,827
held its own meaning."

552
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:26,864
"What I mean is, whether you made mistakes

553
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:28,499
or did well,

554
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,102
what I truly wanted was to experience

555
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:35,539
flavors crafted
by someone else's hands and process,

556
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,975
not my own."

557
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,645
Let's just say we are partners.

558
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,947
-Oh, partners?
-Yes.

559
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,749
-Samchoon!
-I like that.

560
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:45,883
-Do you like it?
-Yeah.

561
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,322
-I forgot.
-Yes?

562
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,392
I should've added the anchovies
to the broth.

563
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:08,205
-It should hold its shape now.
-All right, then.

564
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,009
Wait, we can use the whisk?

565
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,644
Of course we can.

566
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,713
Since when did you know we could use that?

567
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:18,983
It's meant to be done every day.

568
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:21,485
Every day?
Who in their right mind would do that?

569
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:24,321
There's the rough texture, and there's…

570
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,357
-The fine texture.
-That's it.

571
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,026
-Remember, cooking is about…
-Caring.

572
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,494
And it's about the hassle.

573
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:31,996
Cooking is about the hassle.

574
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,840
It's really good.

575
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:44,542
Seriously, it's amazing.

576
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:45,443
Oh my!

577
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:47,945
-Is it heavy?
-No.

578
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:49,413
Your hands are trembling.

579
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:57,021
Oh boy!

580
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,658
This is so delicious!

581
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,627
-Wash it gently, like brushing your teeth.
-Got it.

582
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,730
-So stay away from the bristles.
-Okay.

583
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,233
These sorts of tasks…
They're all about experience.

584
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,134
Right.

585
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:11,836
Grate a little and have a taste.

586
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,839
Then you'll remember
the taste of quality wasabi.

587
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,547
-A beautiful attempt.
-Yes.

588
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,817
"Many of the things we did here

589
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:30,588
were choices you and I made
to create dishes

590
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,990
that could bring real satisfaction."

591
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,393
"I could not have done it alone."

592
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,330
"You carried out the work
without complaint."

593
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,899
"You made the dishes come to life."

594
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,170
"And that is why, Sang-hoon,
you are full of worth."

595
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,073
A bit hard to follow, huh?

596
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,274
No, not at all.

597
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,742
It was written under the influence.

598
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:56,981
So, to sum up, after steadily walking
the path of cooking,

599
00:41:57,047 --> 00:42:00,451
you wished to witness with your own eyes

600
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:04,255
how that flavor could be achieved
through someone else's hands.

601
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:07,458
That's exactly what you did for me.

602
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,528
You know the word "kitchen assistant"?

603
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,597
The word "assistant"
carries a certain feeling.

604
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,934
And…

605
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:22,306
if you ever felt that role didn't matter,
I'm here to tell you it did.

606
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,542
I never felt that way, not once.

607
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:28,345
That makes you even more admirable.

608
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,214
I thought of myself as the sous-chef.

609
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:31,949
Not just an assistant,

610
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:34,351
but the sous-chef
working with the head chef.

611
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,688
-That's a great mindset.
-Yes.

612
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:39,823
In other words,

613
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,626
you mattered here.

614
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,829
-Thank you.
-It was my pleasure.

615
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,110
It's that time of the meal.

616
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:02,446
Here's your bill.

617
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,950
Honestly, I spent the entire day

618
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,719
just trying to come up with the name.

619
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,210
"Rok &amp; Roll Forever."

620
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,080
"Rok &amp; Roll Forever."

621
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:39,550
It was inspired by your name, Kang-rok,

622
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:42,686
and my hope
that this restaurant would last

623
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:44,355
forever.

624
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:46,890
Rok &amp; Roll Forever.

625
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:48,959
Thank you.

626
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,030
-I'll take my leave now.
-Yes.

627
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,132
I can't believe this is the end.

628
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:09,847
It feels like
I'm graduating from boot camp.

629
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,354
Thank you for everything.

630
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,323
I've learned a lot from you.

631
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:23,260
Goodbye. Thank you for the meal.

632
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,001
Bye, chef.

633
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:32,903
Stay well.

634
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,562
While working with Samchoon,

635
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:03,634
I truly got my first real taste

636
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,769
of what cooking is all about.

637
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:08,572
I learned so much along the way.

638
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,374
So,

639
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:13,911
with everything I've learned so far,

640
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:14,912
I decided

641
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,181
to open my own restaurant.

642
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:19,783
I'm the boss!

643
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:22,753
Come to my restaurant in Jeju Island,

644
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,389
"The Bulk Menu for You."

645
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,291
"Meat-heavy Mapo Tofu."

646
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,026
"Jeju Pig Unleashed."

647
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:30,994
Gulfweed soup on the house!

648
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:33,363
Pork shoulder bone stew too!

649
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,403
He didn't go on a working holiday.

650
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:44,074
He went to Jeju Island. "Welcome to Jeju"?

651
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:49,213
So far, four people have done this to me.

652
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:53,684
This guy's the fifth one.

653
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:56,086
Running a restaurant?

654
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:57,488
Good luck with that.

655
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:03,694
You spent money, so give it your all.

656
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:09,233
I hope you keep polishing your skills
and making something great.

657
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:16,073
Whether what you said to me
was real or not,

658
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:20,778
I'm just really grateful
for all the talks we had.

659
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:23,447
Thank you.

660
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:42,232
I'm Joo Hyun-young,
and I'm going to be working with you.

661
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,667
It's great to be here.

662
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:46,303
Welcome. I'll show you
what this place is really like.

663
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:50,507
"I want to eat a dish so good
that I could die happy right after."

664
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,209
No point if you're dead.

665
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:56,346
Why the long face?

666
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,015
This is actually my best face.

667
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:01,451
Please stay seated.

668
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,758
What is this?
