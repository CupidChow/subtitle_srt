1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:03,570
Hey, bananas.

2
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:06,172
Healthy, tasty bananas.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,712
If you eat that banana,
will you go bananas over me?

4
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:17,817
No going bananas?

5
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,895
Your story is served as today's menu in…

6
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:31,798
The Blank Menu for You.

7
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,503
I guess we've gotten pretty close.

8
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:39,906
You're even throwing
banana jokes at me now.

9
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,841
That was me trying.

10
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,510
I want us to be closer,

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,414
and I wondered
if dad jokes would do the job.

12
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,817
After a lot of thinking,
I decided to make that joke.

13
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,554
I don't need to eat any bananas
to go bananas over you.

14
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,771
If we get any closer,
we can start farting around each other.

15
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,239
Farting?

16
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,141
-I don't think we're there yet.
-Okay.

17
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,910
-That'd take a toll on me.
-Okay.

18
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,378
Even in my own home, I…

19
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,513
-You tread lightly in your own home.
-Yes.

20
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,551
We have another order.

21
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,755
It's short and simple.

22
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,593
"A gratin for a summer child
born in winter."

23
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,595
"Like."

24
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,064
"Tofu, broccoli, crown daisy,

25
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,799
potato, cabbage,

26
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,734
rice cake, sujebi, glass noodles."

27
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:45,004
"The kind of noodles you find
in hot pot and malatang."

28
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:46,406
"Hate."

29
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,775
"Mustard, wasabi,

30
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:49,876
tartar sauce."

31
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,512
"And I can eat them,

32
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,581
but I don't like beans and red beans."

33
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,082
Cool beans!

34
00:01:58,418 --> 00:01:59,352
Well…

35
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,521
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,324
-I'd love to try too.
-Yes.

37
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:05,892
But it takes courage.

38
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,427
I actually enjoy…

39
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,761
-This kind of joke?
-Yes.

40
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,830
Cool beans!

41
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,465
The guest doesn't like beans.

42
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,501
This caught my attention.

43
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,603
"A summer child born in winter."

44
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,938
Is that like "iced hot coffee"?

45
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,608
"A gratin for a summer child
born in winter."

46
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:23,643
This reminds me of

47
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,812
a mischievous kid.

48
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,215
I see a mischievous kid.

49
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,850
-A little rebel?
-Exactly.

50
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,952
-A summer child born in winter.
-Yes.

51
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,022
I see a kid holding a banana.

52
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,759
-"Catch me if you can!"
-How cute.

53
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,094
Did you draw that?

54
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,095
I did.

55
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,830
And the kid playfully shouts,

56
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,199
"I was born in winter,
but I'm a summer kid!"

57
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,401
-"Haha!"
-That's what I'm thinking.

58
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:49,836
That's why

59
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,506
I'm going to make banana gratin today.

60
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,575
Is it going to be a dessert, then?

61
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,076
No.

62
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:02,282
Bananas take on an intriguing flavor
when mixed with sauce.

63
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,084
I'm thinking of Japanese doenjang.

64
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,653
-Miso!
-Miso.

65
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,722
Adding a little banana to miso
changes the flavor entirely.

66
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,257
-Really?
-Yes.

67
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,026
Miso gratin.

68
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,627
-Miso gratin.
-It'll make you shout…

69
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,462
Another pun?

70
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,799
I'm afraid it is…

71
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,537
It'll make you shout, "Me so great!"

72
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:30,310
It says here, "born in winter."

73
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:34,314
Do you think that's a request
to use winter ingredients?

74
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,848
A winter-based dish?

75
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,718
We should use ingredients
that grow in winter,

76
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,187
but it's for a summer child,

77
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,256
and a summer child would love the sea.

78
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,425
So seafood.

79
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,595
Here is some winter seafood.

80
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,763
Olive flounder.

81
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,632
-Monkfish.
-Monkfish.

82
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,834
-Oyster. Cod.
-Oyster.

83
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,836
These are some popular winter seafood.

84
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,770
All right.

85
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,106
But I won't be using any of them.

86
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,213
What will we be using, then?

87
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,983
Since aquaculture is well-developed,

88
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,921
I'm going with seafood that maintains
a steady flavor year-round,

89
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,123
even if it's not strictly in season.

90
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,459
Abalone. Scallop.

91
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,827
-Cuttlefish.
-Cuttlefish!

92
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,061
Yes, and…

93
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,797
What's the bird that flies over the sea?

94
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,866
-Seagull?
-Seagull.

95
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,867
Seagull meat?

96
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,669
Naturally, we should,

97
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,971
but we can't use seagull meat.

98
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,907
There is an alternative that we can use.

99
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,610
-Something with wings.
-A bird?

100
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,612
-Chicken.
-Chicken, it is!

101
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,482
We're going to use a bit of chicken too.

102
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,385
-The guest's favorites. Broccoli.
-Broccoli.

103
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,053
-Cabbage.
-Cabbage.

104
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,055
-Asparagus.
-Asparagus.

105
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,790
And mushroom for texture.

106
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,792
For the base sauce,

107
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:56,429
we'll be using miso
to make a special sauce.

108
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,498
Banana sauce goes on top of that.

109
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,333
Banana sauce on the top?

110
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,401
It'll form a layer.

111
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,569
Next comes cheese.

112
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,104
-Pizza cheese.
-Pizza cheese.

113
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,107
-It will drape over the gratin.
-Like a blanket.

114
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,243
-Shall we begin?
-Sure.

115
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,377
-Let's go.
-Yes.

116
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,316
The first order of business
is the miso sauce.

117
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,818
-So this is miso?
-It is.

118
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,821
Go ahead and take a bite of it.

119
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,623
-I'll give it a try.
-All right.

120
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,827
For tasting, I always go
with the back of the spoon.

121
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,096
The usual way can look a little messy,

122
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,766
but when you scrape with the back,
you get a clean, perfect bite.

123
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,501
Show me. Oh, I get it.

124
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,671
It's not too salty.

125
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,906
-That's right.
-Yes.

126
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,374
It's sweet doenjang.

127
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,842
That's what I thought.

128
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:47,347
It feels closer to jam
than what we'd normally call a paste.

129
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:50,016
-Some use it as a spread too.
-Do they now?

130
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:50,917
Yes.

131
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,852
It feels like cream cheese too.

132
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,521
That's why it goes so well
with dairy products.

133
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,789
I can see why.

134
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,991
But there's one concern.

135
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,228
Even with all this sweetness,

136
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,165
some people still say it's salty.

137
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,968
-It's not salt-free, after all.
-Right.

138
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,170
So that worries me.

139
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,907
I trust you will find a way
to tackle that problem.

140
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,510
-It's all on me?
-Nope.

141
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,280
-Let's add all the ingredients now.
-Roger.

142
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,448
Are we using all of it?

143
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,317
-Yes, all of it.
-Amazing.

144
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,052
-This is miso.
-Yes.

145
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,389
-A bit of cheongju.
-Cheongju.

146
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:30,890
And then…

147
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,059
-Rice wine.
-That's it.

148
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,794
Rice wine for cooking.

149
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,216
Time is money, isn't it?

150
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,985
Do I look funny?

151
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,586
No, it's just…

152
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,055
It'd be faster to just open the lid!

153
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:08,127
I can clearly sense your frustration,
Samchoon.

154
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,595
It cracks me up.

155
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:12,632
You're right.

156
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,234
-I should've just opened the lid.
-Yes.

157
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,504
-Rice wine.
-Rice wine.

158
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,840
-Then there's…
-Egg yolk.

159
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:21,908
Egg yolk.

160
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,779
Next.

161
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,481
Sugar.

162
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,386
The key is to add everything into a pot
and mix it well together.

163
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,787
-You mean, stir it?
-Yes.

164
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,255
I'll take over now.

165
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,257
-Please stir softly.
-Sure.

166
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,061
Keep stirring until the ingredients
come together as one.

167
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,996
MIX UNTIL WELL COMBINED
HEAT AFTERWARD

168
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,999
-Okay. Do I leave the heat off?
-Yes, for now.

169
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:54,106
I'll get the banana sauce ingredients
cut and ready.

170
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,776
-All right.
-Banana's a given, obviously.

171
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:57,977
Yes.

172
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:01,113
Bananas were hard to come by
back in the day.

173
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:06,085
Sure, it's nice to just bite
into a banana, but…

174
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,820
-Try slicing it.
-Okay.

175
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,957
-Lay it on its side.
-Wow.

176
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,660
-Give it a gentle press.
-Wow!

177
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,396
This pressed banana tastes different.

178
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:23,169
Press it all the way down.
It makes the texture more interesting.

179
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,040
It feels different
compared to eating it as-is.

180
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:30,510
-I prefer it this way.
-It's quite interesting.

181
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,083
Banana.

182
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,156
What's that?

183
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,626
This is mayonnaise.

184
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:51,631
The guest wrote in the order
that they didn't like tartar sauce,

185
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,834
which is a mayo-based sauce.

186
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,238
But, strictly speaking,
tartar sauce isn't mayonnaise.

187
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,473
That's right.

188
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,508
Let's say,
"You didn't say you hated mayo."

189
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:03,676
Good.

190
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,678
-That's a good idea.
-Yes.

191
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,959
I could've just used a spoon for this.

192
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,460
You picked the smallest nozzle.

193
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,397
I need about 200 mL.

194
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,303
I'm moving it again. How inefficient.

195
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,307
You should use the banana
to scrape up the last bit

196
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,675
like the Buddhist monks do.

197
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,843
You know, they do that during their meals.

198
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,579
I haven't thought of that.

199
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,814
I'll scrape what's on the spoon.

200
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:48,788
Maha prajna paramita

201
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,289
That's it.

202
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,861
I will hold back on the jokes.

203
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,331
No, you shouldn't!
I'm enjoying it very much.

204
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:02,735
There's not a single person in this world
who wants you to hold back.

205
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,571
There's probably not a single person

206
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:09,108
on the entire planet
who wishes you'd tone it down,

207
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,409
not even one.

208
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,146
That's very encouraging.

209
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,492
Adding miso in here too.

210
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:32,698
Which sauce are we going to use?
This one or that one?

211
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,001
We'll be using both.

212
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:36,869
This one

213
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,506
will act as the béchamel base
for the gratin.

214
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,308
MILK-BASED WHITE SAUCE
FRENCH MOTHER SAUCE

215
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,709
-Béchamel?
-Correct.

216
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,345
-Simply put, it's a white sauce.
-Okay.

217
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,614
You have to keep stirring
without stopping.

218
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,582
Understood.

219
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:54,754
It's clumping up.

220
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,155
-That's bad, right?
-Stir harder.

221
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,291
-It shouldn't clump up.
-It shouldn't.

222
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,827
Do you know what happens if it clumps up?

223
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,363
-We do it all again?
-We have to run it through a sieve.

224
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,332
No can do. I won't let that happen.

225
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,234
I'll tell you what we're looking for.

226
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,369
-Remember how thick the miso was?
-Yes.

227
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,071
-Is that even possible?
-Yes.

228
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,173
It's like making porridge.

229
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,109
-Keep stirring, and it will get thicker.
-All right.

230
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:24,817
Funny how your job always seems to
involve never stopping, isn't it?

231
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:25,718
It sure is.

232
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,789
It's time for me to blend the banana mix.

233
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,101
Banana sauce.

234
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,676
What's the reason
for using two sauces here?

235
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,979
This gratin is the one and only dish
we're offering, isn't it?

236
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,047
That's right.

237
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,416
That's why we're building
layers of flavor.

238
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,555
I didn't want the texture
to feel like mayonnaise.

239
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,690
-Okay.
-So I went heavy on the banana.

240
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,595
And…

241
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,798
-Well, this is the key flavor.
-I get it.

242
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:16,669
Banana is the highlight,
and this sauce serves as the base.

243
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,438
And the sweetness is gone.

244
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,708
-Only the aroma of the banana remains.
-That's right.

245
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,910
-Kind of like vanilla beans.
-Yes.

246
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,378
The aroma is there.

247
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,415
That's the picture that we're going for.

248
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,417
The guest will go bananas over us today.

249
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,853
-No going bananas?
-Go bananas.

250
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,023
Has it gotten thicker?

251
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,825
-It's quite thick now.
-Okay.

252
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,036
It kind of feels like peanut butter.

253
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,906
Not in flavor,
but it reminds me of peanut butter.

254
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:58,577
I thought it was soft before,
but now it's even more refined.

255
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:02,615
We'll be adding cream later,
but shall we stop here for now?

256
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:03,749
All right.

257
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,119
-Make sure to get every last bit.
-Okay.

258
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,723
Having the base sauce ready
really puts me at ease.

259
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,192
-It does.
-This is what we needed.

260
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,465
Hey, that's abalone.

261
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,768
Time to clean the abalones.

262
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,504
-They are good-sized ones.
-They are huge.

263
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,139
Now…

264
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,340
Do we stun them?

265
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:29,809
Well…

266
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,211
Sprinkle a bit of salt on them,

267
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,346
and they will curl up like this.

268
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,820
-That's a good amount of salt.
-Sprinkle them evenly.

269
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,756
-Then the abalone flesh will firm up.
-Okay.

270
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:45,457
Right?

271
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,227
They used to be all limp.

272
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,563
See how they've gone firm.

273
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,164
Now we…

274
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,134
-We wash them?
-We wash them.

275
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,203
We're going to cook them,

276
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,805
so no need to scrub them
until they're gleaming white.

277
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,542
But try to clean them
like you're brushing your teeth.

278
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,312
That's the mindset you need.

279
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,213
Roger that.

280
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:14,320
They'll keep changing as you wash them.

281
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,454
Do they bite?

282
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,056
They don't bite.

283
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:21,694
But don't hold the toothbrush
too close to the bristles.

284
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,097
Hold it too short, and you might end up
where the shell is.

285
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,032
-Ouchie. I'll be careful.
-It'll cut you.

286
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,735
-So stay away from the bristles.
-Okay.

287
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,771
-You want this part clean.
-All right.

288
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,506
Turn the water on just a little.

289
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:37,009
-Wash it gently, like brushing your teeth.
-Got it.

290
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,221
I need to prep the veggies first.

291
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,730
BROCCOLI

292
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:05,838
ASPARAGUS

293
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,211
KING OYSTER MUSHROOM

294
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,720
CHICKEN THIGH

295
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:33,699
Great job.

296
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,068
-You're done.
-Yes.

297
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,138
-Time for the next step.
-Yes.

298
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,374
Get tasty, guys.

299
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,009
Yes, get tasty, guys.

300
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,946
-We'll steam them with alcohol.
-All right.

301
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:54,586
PLACE ABALONES IN PRESSURE COOKER
STEAM WITH CHEONGJU AND WATER

302
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:55,654
Thanks, guys.

303
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,223
Yes, we should always have a sense of…

304
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,825
-Gratitude.
-That's right.

305
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,227
Toward the ingredients.

306
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,704
I think the dish is coming together now.

307
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,439
Shall I invite the guest in?

308
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,474
-Not just yet.
-Okay, not yet.

309
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,077
-I'm still a bit nervous.
-I understand.

310
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,693
Here is the next set of ingredients.

311
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,162
-Just lightly pan-fry this one.
-Okay.

312
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,831
-One ingredient at a time.
-Sure.

313
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:39,965
-Prawns.
-Yes.

314
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,433
-These are scallops.
-Okay.

315
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,870
The cuttlefish here
has already been sliced.

316
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,140
Overcooking will make it shrivel up,

317
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,876
so cook it just until it starts to curl.

318
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,011
All right.

319
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,081
-Just don't overcook it.
-Okay.

320
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:56,982
And…

321
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,518
-Not there yet.
-You can stop now.

322
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,652
Can I? Okay.

323
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,187
It's slightly curled up.

324
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,174
Samchoon, is this cooked enough?

325
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,308
It's perfect.

326
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,910
-See the drippings?
-Yes.

327
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,146
-I want you to…
-Pour them?

328
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,680
Yes, just a little.

329
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,483
The scallop juice
is too good to throw away.

330
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,418
Okay.

331
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,127
Is this what you're looking for?

332
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,462
-Yes.
-Nailed it.

333
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,663
Nice and toasty.

334
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,334
Some salt here.

335
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,641
When you salt mushrooms as they cook,

336
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:59,545
it speeds up dehydration
and helps them cook down deliciously.

337
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,413
That's how you fry them.

338
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,452
COAT THE PREPARED CHICKEN IN FLOUR
THEN PAN-FRY

339
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,427
It's so satisfying when you flip the meat

340
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,730
and see that perfectly appetizing color.

341
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:19,965
Totally.

342
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,312
Let's see how the abalones turned out.

343
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:39,785
See that?

344
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,854
It has a rich smell.

345
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,832
I love to bite
into big, chunky pieces of abalone.

346
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:54,967
It's a delight.

347
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,302
Cut the mouth off.

348
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,904
REMOVE MOUTH FROM ABALONES

349
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,273
Come on out.

350
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,408
This part has to go.

351
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,412
This is what abalones use to eat with.

352
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,747
-Right here.
-Yes.

353
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,516
There.

354
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,484
Okay.

355
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,953
-You want big pieces?
-Yes.

356
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,321
In that case,

357
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,423
I'll cut it in four.

358
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,062
-About this size.
-Awesome.

359
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:25,197
Nice, big pieces.

360
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,301
Look at all the ingredients.

361
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,436
-We're nearly there.
-Yes.

362
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,572
Let's bring it to a beautiful close.

363
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:35,841
Add cream

364
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,044
to thin the sauce.

365
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,114
-This is the right thickness.
-Okay.

366
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,189
It reminds me of sweet potato.

367
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,125
-It's got that soft texture.
-Like sweet potato mousse.

368
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,394
Should I mix them?

369
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,863
-Yes, gently.
-So it coats all the pieces.

370
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,830
Here I go.

371
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,943
-I'm trying not to crush them.
-You're doing great.

372
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,272
MISO SAUCE

373
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,313
BANANA SAUCE

374
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,500
THE BLANK MENU FOR YOU

375
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,505
-Yes.
-Things like jalapeño too.

376
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:52,110
-Hello!
-Hello.

377
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,580
-Hello!
-Hello.

378
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,349
Welcome to the Blank Menu for You.

379
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:03,955
OUR EIGHTH GUEST
SANA

380
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,058
-May I take your jacket?
-Yes, thank you.

381
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:07,626
I'll put it on the coat rack.

382
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,628
-Thank you so much.
-You must be cold.

383
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,797
-Please take your seat.
-Okay.

384
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:15,233
-Well, hello there.
-Hi!

385
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,168
Hi.

386
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,771
May I sit down?

387
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,906
-Of course.
-Please do.

388
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,510
-Let me check your order for you.
-Yes, please.

389
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,746
Am I speaking with the summer child
born in winter?

390
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,081
Yes, that's me!

391
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,483
-And you ordered gratin, correct?
-Yes.

392
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,951
We are happy to have you.

393
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,096
Is it always this quiet here?

394
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,997
Yes. Would you like some music?

395
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,400
-No, that's okay.
-You're okay without it?

396
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,704
Your water is ready.

397
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,039
Thank you.

398
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,708
NICE THAT A SEASON REMINDS ME OF YOU
WINTER-BORN, NAMED "SUMMER"

399
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,744
I'LL ONLY NEED TO THINK OF YOU
IN SPRING AND FALL

400
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,745
STAY WELL

401
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,715
-Did you draw the smiley face?
-Yes, I did.

402
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,918
It's the cutest smiley face
I've ever seen.

403
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,587
You should make merch out of it.

404
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:10,889
My goodness, you're too kind.

405
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,158
-We call him Samchoon.
-Pleased to meet you.

406
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,228
-Hello. It's a pleasure.
-Yes, hello.

407
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:21,600
I received your order,
and I've given it a lot of thought.

408
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:25,203
You described yourself
as a summer child born in winter.

409
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,372
And that expression

410
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,809
inspired me to come up with this drawing.

411
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,144
That's so cute!

412
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,448
-A yellow banana!
-Yes.

413
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:39,251
"A summer child born in winter."

414
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,586
I figured a summer child
would love the ocean,

415
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:45,290
and that message felt like
it was written by a mischievous kid.

416
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,358
-Really?
-Yes.

417
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,460
The gender of the kid was unknown,

418
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:52,864
but I pictured a child at the beach,
holding a banana in hand.

419
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:57,402
My birthday is in winter,
but the character for "summer…"

420
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,037
SANA MINATOZAKI
NA = SUMMER

421
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,439
…is part of my name.

422
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:03,375
My mother also loves summer,
so that's part of the reason.

423
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:07,913
I was born in the middle of winter,
but my name has "summer" in it, so…

424
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:08,847
So…

425
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,782
That's me.

426
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,319
-I'm so honored to be here.
-Thank you.

427
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,655
I'm also honored.

428
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:19,791
Yes.

429
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,182
I haven't had gratin in so long.

430
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,284
You can't find it often in Korea, right?

431
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,686
-No.
-I thought so.

432
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,617
Have you done any part-time work before?

433
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,686
I once worked
at a Korean full-course restaurant.

434
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,990
I think it was only for about a week.

435
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:29,528
Was that the only part-time job you had?
A week at a restaurant?

436
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,196
That's right.

437
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,467
You can kind of tell.

438
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,337
I thought I was pulling it off smoothly.

439
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:40,605
What do you mean?

440
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:44,476
You looked stiff,
even just handling the food!

441
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,745
-I'm sorry!
-That's fine.

442
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,780
-I just thought it was cute.
-Of course.

443
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,649
Samchoon will now
introduce the dish to you.

444
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,917
-Okay!
-Yes.

445
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:58,523
What I prepared for you today is a gratin
for a summer child born in winter.

446
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:09,634
The cheese on top
gives it that gratin feel.

447
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,705
Underneath is the banana sauce,

448
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:16,441
which rests atop a layer of miso.

449
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,578
"Miso" means "smile" in Korean.

450
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,580
It will make you smile.

451
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,483
Just hearing about it makes me smile.

452
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,354
It will make you smile even more
when you eat it.

453
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:35,026
You can have it on some bread,

454
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,362
or taste a little and see how you like it.

455
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,430
Okay.

456
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:40,665
Please enjoy.

457
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,301
Thank you. I can't wait!

458
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:53,078
I can't smell the banana at all.

459
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:54,846
That's only natural.

460
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,451
What's this?

461
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,052
Ike-ike.

462
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,321
-Ika.
-Ika.

463
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,625
Ike-ike?

464
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:07,525
Ika.

465
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:08,493
CUTTLEFISH

466
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,450
Is this the banana?

467
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,319
I believe that's a scallop.

468
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,321
-Hotate.
-Hotate.

469
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,537
It's got abalones in it?

470
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,007
Gratin is covered in cheese, right?

471
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:59,210
I thought of it as a food adventure.

472
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:02,480
There's fun in digging through
and discovering the ingredients.

473
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,683
Let me tell you what you can find inside.

474
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:05,950
Abalone.

475
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:08,687
Scallop.

476
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:10,455
Cuttlefish.

477
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,190
And

478
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:15,860
one of the things
we can find by the sea is a seagull.

479
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:16,861
Yes.

480
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:19,197
Chicken was used in place of seagull meat.

481
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:24,002
While you continue eating,
I'll explain everything one by one.

482
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,404
So far, I've gone over the seafood.

483
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:34,012
This is so cute.
I think kids would love eating this dish.

484
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,616
Every time I lift the cheese lid,
a different ingredient appears.

485
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,116
It's so yummy.

486
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,451
Why are you two glancing at me?

487
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,654
I didn't want to make you uncomfortable.

488
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,691
If it helps, we can face the other way.

489
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,959
Please don't!

490
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,230
Each ingredient
has its own distinct flavor.

491
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,633
That's what makes gratin so special.

492
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,636
The sauce may cover everything,

493
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:36,508
but the individuality
of each ingredient is so strong,

494
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:40,478
and they all shine
through the flavor of the sauce.

495
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,448
Feel free to have it with some bread.

496
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,668
I tasted the banana just now.

497
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,103
You're not mistaken.

498
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,772
That shift in flavor is the key.

499
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,743
Picture the waves

500
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,346
a summer child would adore.

501
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,149
Banana notes rise with the swells.

502
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,754
Where the water is calm, there's seafood.

503
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:28,726
Imagining such a story while eating
makes it all the more delightful.

504
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:33,965
Honestly, it feels like a treasure hunt.

505
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:35,967
Every bite reveals something new.

506
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,902
It's rare to find a dish

507
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,873
where so many different charms
come together like this.

508
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,744
It might be rare, but it does exist.

509
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,047
Because you can make it.

510
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:50,682
I see.

511
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,452
Thank you very much.

512
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:58,857
-Please, go ahead.
-Okay.

513
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:04,362
And I also love that the broccoli
comes in such big chunks.

514
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,198
I missed eating it like this.

515
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:11,135
Another great thing about gratin
is that it stays warm for a long time.

516
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,338
-That's right.
-Thanks to the built-up heat.

517
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:15,473
It keeps the veggies warm.

518
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,948
Are the ingredients cooked to your taste?

519
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,483
It's so delicious.

520
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,986
You mentioned you like broccoli,

521
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,521
so I went ahead and added it to the dish.

522
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,223
This is the first time

523
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:37,896
someone listed both their likes
and dislikes on the order form.

524
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,564
Come to think of it,

525
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:43,301
it's a random list of foods
that aren't related.

526
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,771
I just wrote down things
that came to mind.

527
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:50,942
Why don't you like tartar sauce?

528
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:51,943
To be honest,

529
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:54,512
ever since I was a kid,

530
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:58,249
I've never liked mayonnaise-based sauces.

531
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:03,288
But I do like it when mayo
is mixed with other ingredients,

532
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:06,257
like the sauce they drizzle
on takoyaki or okonomiyaki.

533
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:08,660
That's a mix of mayo and something else.

534
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:12,196
I enjoy that combination,
same with mayo mixed with soy sauce.

535
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:16,267
But tartar sauce?
That's a mix of all the rich, heavy stuff.

536
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,770
It's a bit too much for me.

537
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:19,871
As a matter of fact,

538
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,341
there's a bit of mayo
mixed into this banana sauce.

539
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:24,742
That's why I thought

540
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:28,146
this sauce might not quite
be to your taste.

541
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:30,648
But do you find it okay?

542
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:33,384
I love it when mayo's blended
with other flavors.

543
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,554
Have you always liked gratin?

544
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,357
Yes, I've loved it ever since I was a kid.

545
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:44,829
There's this small frozen gratin
they sell in Japan

546
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,264
that I used to enjoy.

547
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,999
I also liked the restaurant versions.

548
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,068
I've enjoyed it in all kinds of ways.

549
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,836
-You went to school in Osaka.
-Yes.

550
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:52,904
Hai.

551
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,973
Where in Osaka did you stay?

552
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,241
I stayed in Abeno.

553
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,645
That's right near my hometown.

554
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:02,447
Sou.

555
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:03,915
Could you chat with him in Japanese?

556
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,685
He said he studied in Japan,
but I've never heard him use any Japanese,

557
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,554
so I'm not sure if it's true.

558
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,824
Choi Kang-roku.

559
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:14,625
But that's…

560
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,361
-That's your name!
-Yes.

561
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,997
Moon Sang-hoon!

562
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:21,933
Choi Kang-roku?

563
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,535
Anyone can say their name in Japanese!

564
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:27,739
-True.
-The pronunciation is the key.

565
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,640
That's how they say my name.

566
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,678
Choi Kang-roku.

567
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,215
-Roku!
-Yes, that sounds about right.

568
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:41,552
Come on, speak Japanese already.

569
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,688
Don't just say your name in Japanese.

570
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:48,292
So, if I were to speak to you in Japanese,

571
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,228
would you understand everything?

572
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,363
-Just a little.
-A little?

573
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,767
I'm only familiar with words
that are related to cooking.

574
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,770
How did your stay in Abeno treat you?

575
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,672
-It was great.
-Was it?

576
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,007
Yokatta?

577
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,143
What makes you say that?

578
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,248
Choi Kang-roku.

579
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:12,884
Stop that!

580
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,219
Show us what you've got.
You were doing great.

581
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,021
-But--
-What does "yokatta" mean?

582
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,089
"It was great."

583
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,927
-I haven't spoken Japanese for a while.
-It's all right!

584
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,196
-So the word order confuses me.
-Don't worry.

585
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,666
-Still--
-I know it's similar to Korean.

586
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,069
Tell us what you liked about Abeno.

587
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,804
First, I was in Tokyo--

588
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,839
Come on! In Japanese.

589
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,474
I'll mix the two, then.

590
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,643
-Sure.
-Humor me, please.

591
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:41,345
After Tokyo, I went to Osaka

592
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,682
and found this little burger spot.

593
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,351
I was so happy I got to eat a burger.

594
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,192
The food in Tokyo and Osaka
is a bit different, isn't it?

595
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,193
Yes.

596
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,262
Which one do you personally prefer?

597
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:02,600
I actually prefer Kyoto.

598
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,435
-Kyoto?
-Yes, Kyoto.

599
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,304
Osaka and Kyoto--

600
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:09,474
You were killing it!

601
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,043
-You're very good!
-What stopped you?

602
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,845
Your Japanese is excellent.

603
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,580
Well, it's just…

604
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:18,316
There are so many words
I can't quite remember.

605
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:19,317
Yes.

606
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,320
That's what happens
when you don't use them.

607
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,288
I'm very curious

608
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:27,892
about how you managed to learn
Korean so quickly.

609
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:32,296
I've always enjoyed
talking and connecting with people.

610
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:35,633
And as a child,
I had a real love for writing.

611
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:38,169
I never would've guessed.

612
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,105
I didn't expect the person who wrote that…

613
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:44,275
-To be a foreigner?
-Yes.

614
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,943
It blew my mind.

615
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,648
Do you still find some things hard
when speaking Korean?

616
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,384
Now I don't care like I used to.

617
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:55,853
I'll tell you why.

618
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,124
Most of what I do is with my team,

619
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,326
so I'm usually with my teammates.

620
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:05,129
Even if my pronunciation is a bit off,

621
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:08,733
they understand me
since they're used to how I speak.

622
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:11,435
So that's just how I go about things.

623
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:15,640
Is there an expression or word you use
when you just can't be bothered?

624
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:22,213
My go-to phrase
when I can't be bothered is,

625
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,114
"You know."

626
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,483
-"You know"?
-"You know, that thing."

627
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,351
"You know, such-and-such."

628
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:28,519
Yes, exactly.

629
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:29,654
"That's too… you know."

630
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,722
I didn't use it at first.

631
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,859
A few years back,
I didn't talk like that at all.

632
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,661
But my teammates kept using it,

633
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,263
and it eventually rubbed off on me.

634
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,167
-"It'll be fine. I mean… you know."
-Right.

635
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:44,902
"You know." "Such-and-such."

636
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:46,837
"That's too… you know."

637
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:49,974
There was a time when I realized
that these expressions

638
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,976
could actually be a form of consideration.

639
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,077
Okay.

640
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:55,279
I was at my friend's place,

641
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,949
and his mom brought out a watermelon.

642
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:01,986
She chopped it into neat little cubes,
handed me the biggest piece, and said,

643
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,655
"You take the big one because… you know."

644
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,724
This is a true story.

645
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,093
"Have the big piece. You know why."

646
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:21,005
Well…

647
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:26,244
The way you two just sit there
like nothing happened is hilarious.

648
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:30,248
We're actually looking down out of guilt.

649
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:31,716
-Yes.
-For interrupting your meal.

650
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,584
I don't like being watched while I eat.

651
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,353
Really? In my case,

652
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:40,291
even when I go to a restaurant,

653
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:44,228
I often end up chatting with the owner.

654
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:47,565
Same with taxi rides.
I tend to talk with the driver.

655
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,433
That's just how I am.

656
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,736
Your MBTI type?

657
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,872
-Is it ENFP?
-It is.

658
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,508
INFP.

659
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,613
I know I have an I in mine.

660
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,683
-That's for certain.
-Yes, I remember you saying that.

661
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,186
Let me take a guess.
Do you imagine things a lot?

662
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:10,254
I do, yes.

663
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,456
-He does.
-Things that are distant from reality?

664
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:14,191
They are not realistic.

665
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:15,393
-I thought so.
-Right.

666
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,061
-So that's I and N.
-N.

667
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:20,831
Are you an empathetic person or not?

668
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:27,104
I feel like even if you empathize a lot,
you probably don't show it much.

669
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,240
I'm not the most expressive person.

670
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,909
-But you do feel a lot on the inside?
-Yes.

671
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,779
-That's I, N, and F so far.
-F?

672
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,981
-I think he's a J type.
-I think so too.

673
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,716
Look at how well-prepared he is.

674
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,018
So you must be an INFJ.

675
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,254
That's your type from now on.

676
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,655
I'm an INFJ.

677
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,825
-Yes.
-I'm an INFP.

678
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,728
I have a question for Chef Choi.

679
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,830
Did you know who I was?

680
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,632
-I did.
-Really?

681
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,137
Was that "Heart Shaker"?

682
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:01,539
Yep.

683
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:04,342
I know most of the songs.

684
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,911
Do you? Thank you so much.

685
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:11,382
I even watched your concert
in Japan on YouTube.

686
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,918
I really appreciate that.

687
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,387
I knew who you were.

688
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:23,627
-Sana, did you debut as a trainee in 2015?
-Yes.

689
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,730
-That's ten years.
-Ten years.

690
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,198
It amazes me too.

691
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:31,702
It means we've spent a long time
and accomplished a lot together.

692
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:35,039
Is there anything that is hard
to get used to, even now?

693
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,608
Hard to get used to?

694
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,345
As you know,
we start working on our albums

695
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:44,181
months ahead of time,

696
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,783
so the season doesn't match.

697
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,153
It's freezing cold,

698
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,956
but I have to wear
a sleeveless shirt or lace dress.

699
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:54,091
-For a music video shoot?
-Yes.

700
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:58,396
It's still a struggle for me,

701
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,665
but that comes with the territory.

702
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,370
It kind of reminds me of what you wrote.

703
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:09,106
"A summer child born in winter."

704
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,809
I'd say that's the story of your life.

705
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:12,877
I guess so.

706
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,414
Wait, did you think
what I said sounded like a stretch?

707
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,350
That's what your smile is telling me.
Am I wrong?

708
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:20,751
You're wrong.

709
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,559
What's this?

710
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,328
You mentioned that you liked cabbage.

711
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,265
-Red cabbage.
-Right.

712
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:37,334
Purple is my color in the team.

713
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,804
Purple…

714
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:42,106
I knew that was your color.

715
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,041
You did? How?

716
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,443
I just know.

717
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:48,579
Yes, I do.

718
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:54,819
Going with red cabbage instead of
the regular one was a good call.

719
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,087
-It was a coincidence.
-This reminds me of the sea.

720
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,990
It has so many colors.

721
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,627
I'd like to ask the summer child.

722
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,666
Did you enjoy the dish?

723
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:15,272
It feels like it belongs
to a whole different genre of gratin.

724
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:18,576
It works as both dessert and main.

725
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,312
One dish that satisfies everything,

726
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,181
that's the gratin I had today.

727
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:27,551
I think the credit really goes
to your order.

728
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,355
"A gratin for a summer child
born in winter."

729
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:35,226
That phrase is what inspired me
to create this dish.

730
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:39,430
This meal was like a treasure hunt
from start to finish.

731
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:43,167
I hope the next ten years of your life
are like a treasure hunt.

732
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:48,839
That was such a beautiful thing to say.
What's with the awkward face?

733
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:51,609
Okay.

734
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:56,947
-Thanks for the food.
-Thanks for enjoying it.

735
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:03,854
-One last thing.
-Yes.

736
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:07,591
We actually don't charge our guests.

737
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:11,161
-But instead, we have a favor to ask.
-Okay.

738
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,297
This menu features

739
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,367
the names of dishes given by our guests.

740
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:20,671
We'd be grateful
if you could name the dish you just had.

741
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:22,172
What should I call it?

742
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:32,149
Treasure Chest Gone Bananas.

743
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,252
Treasure Chest Gone Bananas.

744
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,520
-I like that.
-Right?

745
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:38,055
Treasure 'Tin Gone Bananas.

746
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:41,191
-'Tin for gratin?
-That's a good one.

747
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:04,381
"Treasure 'Tin Gone Bananas."

748
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:09,186
Dig through the bananas to uncover

749
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,522
the delicious treasure hidden underneath.

750
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,058
Treasure 'Tin Gone Bananas!

751
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,594
Thank you.

752
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,898
-Thanks for having me.
-Thank you.

753
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,633
-Thanks.
-Thank you again.

754
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,501
-Take care.
-Bye!

755
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,893
"Cold buckwheat noodles and pork cutlet."

756
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,496
"To me and my dad, it was comfort itself."

757
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:54,231
Today's order is all about

758
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:55,633
memory.

759
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:58,335
This food may feel quaint and dated,

760
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:00,037
but it's just right.

761
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:03,440
May your memories and ours
carry the same warmth.

762
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,876
Hello.

763
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,379
It really brings back memories.

764
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:11,849
Your personal touch hit the mark.
