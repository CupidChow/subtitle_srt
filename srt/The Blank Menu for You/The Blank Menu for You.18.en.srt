1
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:02,635
Look at the camera.

2
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:04,771
One, two…

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,341
Right now, you are too much

4
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,477
like a robot.

5
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:15,482
-If you could smile a bit…
-This is my brightest smile.

6
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,617
All right. Here's an idea.

7
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,286
Say "cheese" after I count to three.

8
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:22,622
-Got that?
-Chee… Okay.

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,491
Give me a nice and long "cheese."

10
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:26,326
One, two, three!

11
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,794
Cheese.

12
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,829
Cheese!

13
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:43,209
Your story is served as today's menu in…

14
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,112
The Blank Menu for You.

15
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,089
My lips are…

16
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,258
What do you think?

17
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,660
Well, they are…

18
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,395
They are uneven.

19
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,997
-Uneven Steven?
-Yes.

20
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,168
Still, saying "cheese" helped.

21
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:09,869
Kinda.

22
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:12,072
I look like I'm smirking at someone.

23
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,107
Looking down at someone?

24
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,577
Exactly. That's why even my lips
are looking down.

25
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,746
No way!

26
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,215
What a coincidence.

27
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:26,119
Today's order slip also mentions cheese.

28
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:29,389
-I'll read it out for you.
-Okay.

29
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,026
"Hello, Chef."

30
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,331
"Even with appetizers,
five small plates can make a full meal."

31
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:44,304
"I'd love to enjoy a variety of dishes
that bring out the best in each other."

32
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:48,341
"I care a lot about the order and pairing
of what I eat

33
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,543
like sweet and salty or tofu and kimchi."

34
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,081
"I'd like you to tie the dishes together
with cheese, one of my favorite foods."

35
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,950
"And I'd appreciate it

36
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:59,619
if you could avoid
using sugar and carbohydrates."

37
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,355
There it is.

38
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:06,126
That's a unique request.
It's not about having a regular meal.

39
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,496
The guest is asking you to prepare cheese.

40
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,802
You see, not everyone wants
the usual rice-and-soup combo these days.

41
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:19,472
Some prefer meals
with a different structure.

42
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:23,243
Unconventional meals
that reflect their tastes.

43
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,845
-Right.
-The guest has made various requests.

44
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,882
And the way they requested them
feels a bit Western.

45
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:29,983
Western?

46
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,484
How so?

47
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,721
Imagine walking into a McDonald's
in the US.

48
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:37,824
Their menu is layered with choices.

49
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,225
Customization.

50
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,795
People often ask to leave things out.

51
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,299
"Cook it this way."

52
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,502
They are designing a personalized set

53
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,237
through carefully chosen details.

54
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,074
-They know exactly what they want.
-Yes, precisely.

55
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:58,144
The order starts with a suggestion.

56
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,681
"Five small plates can make a full meal."

57
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:02,982
Meaning, "Cook five dishes."

58
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,919
-It also says, "Use cheese."
-Right.

59
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,253
Do you get it?

60
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,656
-It's very clear.
-Yes, very straightforward.

61
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,392
It makes you want to say that.

62
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,801
-The order slip gave me an idea.
-Okay.

63
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,270
-I thought of a kingdom.
-My!

64
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:26,406
What is this?

65
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,478
-It's French.
-Right?

66
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,546
How do you say it?

67
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,982
-What?
-What?

68
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,754
Let's just call it "Ordevre."

69
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,457
-It's French for "appetizer."
-Oh, appetizer.

70
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,659
HORS D'OEUVRE: FIRST DISH
IN WESTERN-STYLE COURSE MEAL

71
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,362
Today's guest must be from Cheese Kingdom.

72
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,263
Cute!

73
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,266
Maybe a princess or prince
with a tiny appetite?

74
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:57,170
A light-eating princess or prince
from Cheese Kingdom?

75
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,071
Yes.

76
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,107
This is the map of Cheese Kingdom.

77
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,276
There are five kinds.

78
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,647
Instead of going for overly niche cheeses,

79
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:11,884
I figured it'd be better to stick
with five well-known ones.

80
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,520
Using cream cheese,

81
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,457
I'm going to make gyeran-jjim.

82
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,792
And with mascarpone,

83
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,563
maybe a cheese mash? A cheese salad?

84
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,331
-A cheese mash?
-Yes.

85
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,768
I'm going to use Haloumi as well.

86
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,838
-I've never heard it before.
-Along with ajillo.

87
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,140
-Garlic oil.
-All right.

88
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,575
Haloumi with ajillo.

89
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,811
Mozzarella will be paired up with natto.

90
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,881
You don't like natto?

91
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,049
It's not that.

92
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,385
I'm not sure if those two could get along.

93
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,720
They are both fermented foods.

94
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,491
-So they are similar, after all.
-Yes.

95
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,227
With mozzarella,
I'm going to make natto noodles.

96
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:58,364
Lastly, Grana Padano in a salad.

97
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,699
Salad!

98
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,468
-Shall we start making them?
-Sure!

99
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,470
We have so many things to make!

100
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,607
-Yes, so we need to hurry.
-We do.

101
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,676
Do you have to put it there?

102
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,678
Let's hurry!

103
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,451
We are going to make gyeran-jjim
using cream cheese.

104
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,388
CREAM CHEESE

105
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,591
Take the gelatin and…

106
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,431
-Soak it in ice water.
-Okay.

107
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,166
Give it a firm squeeze.

108
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,935
-And…
-Plop.

109
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,871
MIX KATSUOBUSHI BROTH, SOY SAUCE, MIRIM,
AND CHEONGJU, AND ADD GELATIN

110
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,477
I think gyeran-jjim and cream cheese
would go really well together.

111
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,979
Like a proper cheesecake?

112
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,782
-Exactly!
-I think they are a great pair.

113
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,420
Now I'm going to add the mixture
to the cream cheese

114
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,789
and whisk to dissolve it.

115
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,595
POUR THE MIXTURE
INTO LIGHTLY MICROWAVED CREAM CHEESE

116
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,330
MASH UNTIL SMOOTH

117
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,969
Poke and swirl.
Keep going until it's smooth.

118
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,574
Should it turn completely creamy?

119
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,009
-It should come together as one mass.
-One mass.

120
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,094
-Slowly.
-Got it.

121
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,662
-One mass.
-One mass.

122
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,633
-It looks just like cheesecake batter.
-Right.

123
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,770
Imagine a cheesecake batter with no flour,

124
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,304
not baked but steamed.

125
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:46,706
That's the vibe.

126
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,578
Is it one mass now?

127
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,481
-Almost there.
-Okay.

128
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,284
-We will be straining it later.
-Oh, we will?

129
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,087
When we see how much solid is left behind,

130
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,290
we'll know if you stirred it well enough.

131
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,565
JELLY TOPPING SAUCE

132
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,567
SIMMER KATSUOBUSHI BROTH
WITH MIRIM AND SOY SAUCE

133
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:19,872
GELATIN

134
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,773
Drop that in.

135
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,712
It will thicken as it cools over time.

136
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,452
Is it starting to set?

137
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,520
I'm not sure yet.

138
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,457
But this feels kind of strange.

139
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,226
-The way the bits are floating…
-Yes.

140
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,694
I know it feels strange.

141
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:42,895
At one point,

142
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,064
it goes all soft and curdy.

143
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,265
Soft and curdy.

144
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,279
Has it become one mass now?

145
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,882
Yes, this is more than good enough.

146
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:03,783
Okay.

147
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,571
-Let's see.
-All right.

148
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,043
-Is it ready?
-Yes.

149
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,121
You don't see it?

150
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,157
Actually, I thought it would thicken more.

151
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,092
Right.

152
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,294
But it just went
from water to cooking oil.

153
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,863
It will get thicker than this.

154
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,832
-That was the signal.
-Okay.

155
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,134
It's telling us, "You can pour me."

156
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,845
-See that?
-I get it.

157
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,380
Soft and curdy.

158
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,582
-It looks like it's in…
-Pre-jelly stage?

159
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,817
CHILL THE JELLY SAUCE
IN THE REFRIGERATOR UNTIL SET

160
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:17,456
Now…

161
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,100
-Let's cool it in here.
-All right.

162
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,438
Next up. Do you know cheese fondue?

163
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,040
-Yes, you dip it.
-Right.

164
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,475
Let's try and make the sauce.

165
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,746
HEAVY CREAM

166
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,084
MILK

167
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,085
-Now…
-Yes?

168
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,921
I'll reduce it first,
then add butter and let it melt.

169
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:49,989
Sounds delicious.

170
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,159
It's best to keep the heat low.

171
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,027
Add everything in and take it slow.

172
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:56,495
Got it.

173
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:12,878
-Now this.
-Yes.

174
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,650
GRANA PADANO

175
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:18,784
This is Grapano?

176
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:19,852
Grana Padano.

177
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,521
-Put it in.
-Grada Padano?

178
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,623
Grana Padano.

179
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,091
Gra… Grana Padano.

180
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,693
That's right.
Now melt it slowly, bit by bit.

181
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,761
Okay.

182
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,432
-Reminds you of fondue, doesn't it?
-It does!

183
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,968
It's got the same thickness.

184
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,407
A bit more.

185
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,311
-This is pure cheese.
-Cheese.

186
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,979
A sauce made with just cheese.

187
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,515
Take your time.

188
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,991
This is butterhead lettuce.

189
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,127
BUTTER-SOFT LETTUCE,
SWEET WITHOUT BITTERNESS

190
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,529
The leaves are tender,
and it's got good taste.

191
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,042
Do you dip tomatoes in fondue too?

192
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,311
-Yes.
-That's got to be good.

193
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,817
It's better to trim off the tougher parts.

194
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,351
-Okay.
-Right up to here.

195
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,959
-That looks almost ready.
-Really?

196
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,866
How about softening it up a bit more?

197
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:14,767
Okay.

198
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,524
-It's become a sauce now.
-I see.

199
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:40,993
Now…

200
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,230
Do you like cheese?

201
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,098
I do. I love it so much.

202
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,340
-Here's your fondue.
-Thank you.

203
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,676
Try chilling the sauce

204
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,613
and dipping fresh salad into it.

205
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,883
It goes very well with ripe tomatoes too.

206
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:07,253
Eat it cold.

207
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,158
It goes so well with the cold lettuce.

208
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,261
You can serve the sauce warm like fondue

209
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:19,932
and dip blanched potatoes
or fresh vegetables into it.

210
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,503
Since we are serving the sauce
in a bowl today,

211
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,438
let's cool it down and serve it cold.

212
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,339
All right.

213
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,010
Cheese number three is mascarpone.

214
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,478
It looks like this.

215
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,214
This cheese blends well with tofu.

216
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,250
They have surprisingly similar textures.

217
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,187
-The recipe is quite simple for this one.
-Okay.

218
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,456
Dump it all in, give it a whiz,
and it's done.

219
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,125
-Dump, whiz!
-Yes.

220
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,260
Tofu!

221
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,496
-So silky.
-It really is.

222
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,032
This tofu has been lightly drained.

223
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,672
-That is 30 grams of mascarpone.
-All right.

224
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:02,408
Add 20 grams of tahini.

225
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,015
DRAINED TOFU, MASCARPONE, TAHINI,
SOY SAUCE, SALT, HEAVY CREAM

226
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,550
The guest asked for no sugar,

227
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:15,988
but just a little was added
because it was really necessary.

228
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,390
It wasn't added
to make it intentionally sweet.

229
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,725
That's right.

230
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,995
-Good enough.
-For the sake of the balance.

231
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,698
-We must not lie to the guest.
-Of course not.

232
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:31,136
Mascarpone is usually quite mild
and subtle on its own.

233
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,037
I see.

234
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:36,976
But when you mix in something like tofu,
it takes on a unique character.

235
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:40,346
Cheese isn't there to stand out.
It's there to support.

236
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:52,358
This dish is
more of a dessert-like appetizer,

237
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,760
so it goes nicely
with Shine Muscat grapes.

238
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,997
The firmer the grape,
the better it tastes.

239
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,082
-Dried persimmons.
-Okay.

240
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,052
They have a strong flavor,
so we want them in small slices.

241
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,988
The rich sweetness of concentrated fruit

242
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,291
works really well with cheese.

243
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,592
It looks amazing.

244
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,664
We are going to mix these together.

245
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,098
There.

246
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,875
It's best to start by making garlic oil.

247
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,946
If you rush to extract the flavor,
it won't taste right.

248
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,081
We need to cook it slowly.

249
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:51,517
Thoroughly.

250
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,018
Chili pepper.

251
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,631
-This one's a grilling cheese.
-Yes.

252
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:07,733
HALOUMI

253
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,401
-Gr-chee?
-What was that?

254
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,370
-Brie cheese?
-No, like Gucci.

255
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,006
It's luxurious.

256
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,075
Grilled cheese is fancy like Gucci.

257
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,343
-Luxurious?
-Yes.

258
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,255
Could you cook them
until they are golden brown?

259
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,457
No problem.

260
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,527
Oh no!

261
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,670
-You can just toss them around.
-Like this?

262
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:45,871
Hum a little tune too.

263
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,677
But they need to be flipped.

264
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:57,249
-Yes, I like that color.
-Right?

265
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,319
A guest might see this

266
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:04,023
and ask if this is burnt cheese.

267
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,592
-Then tell them this.
-Right?

268
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,994
"It's been browned to look just right."

269
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,869
I flipped this piece too late.

270
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,537
-I'm sorry.
-What's wrong?

271
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,005
I think I burned this one.

272
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,673
That is totally fine.

273
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,475
-What?
-It will taste even better.

274
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:30,783
Oops.

275
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:36,889
I'll heat up the garlic oil later
and pour it over the top.

276
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:41,827
Moving on to…

277
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,663
MOZZARELLA

278
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:53,605
Natto.

279
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,951
You smell that, don't you?

280
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,720
-Yes, the funky smell.
-Funky.

281
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:13,358
Natto tastes much better
when it's stir-fried.

282
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,531
WHITE WINE

283
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,668
-Let me.
-Sure.

284
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,072
-Mash the natto?
-Yes.

285
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,274
We are letting the acidity cook off

286
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:30,742
and turning it into a sauce.

287
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:42,488
That's it.

288
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,223
-Can I give it a try?
-Yes.

289
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,729
When I'm alone in the kitchen,
I end up doing all kinds of weird things.

290
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,064
It gets boring.

291
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,933
That grunt just now was one of them.

292
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,805
But that was straight out of an anime.

293
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,808
-I see what you mean.
-You know?

294
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,445
You could say
it's my way of coping with loneliness.

295
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,882
-It's about standing alone.
-I guess it's a battle of your own.

296
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,383
Of course.

297
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,452
I can't let the kitchen overwhelm me.

298
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,187
-I cannot give in.
-Right.

299
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,858
YUZU KOSHŌ

300
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,132
Plenty of pepper.

301
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:30,469
And then…

302
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,876
-We just have to stir it well now.
-It's starting to stick.

303
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,778
Take it off the heat for a while.

304
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,079
Can I? Okay.

305
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,414
-Do this.
-Right.

306
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,149
There's that grunt again.

307
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,490
Look how it stretches.

308
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,593
I bet you've never seen
anything like this.

309
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,962
Cheese and soybean.

310
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,096
Natto.

311
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,233
-Cheese and soybean…
-And noodles later.

312
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,135
-We will mix all of them.
-Noodles too.

313
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,305
Just a touch of noodles.

314
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,306
Just a touch.

315
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,107
Shall we sign it off here?

316
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:10,442
Cool.

317
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:40,639
Such a charming little alleyway.

318
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,842
Gosh, it's so pretty.

319
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:48,914
This must be the place.

320
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,382
"The Blank Menu for You."

321
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:51,717
I'm here!

322
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:01,793
Welcome.

323
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,862
Hello, everyone.

324
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,165
Welcome.

325
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,234
Hello, everyone.

326
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,169
-Hello!
-Hi.

327
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,274
How charming.

328
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,776
-Thank you.
-A place of charm.

329
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,145
Let me show you to your seat.

330
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,046
Welcome.

331
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,948
-Hi there.
-Hello.

332
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,017
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

333
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:30,522
OUR EIGHTEENTH GUEST
JUNE KANG

334
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:35,594
I feel like I have been given
such a precious seat.

335
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,197
This is a beautiful restaurant.

336
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:44,169
I can't believe a place like this exists.

337
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,308
I almost feel bad sitting here
all by myself.

338
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,375
Oh, do you?

339
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,277
-We are really fine.
-It's too…

340
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,413
Please make yourself comfortable.

341
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,248
Thank you so much.

342
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:00,185
-My goodness!
-Water and a warm towelette for you.

343
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,453
Why, thank you.

344
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,456
LIKE A ROSE, A MAGNOLIA, A LOTUS

345
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,191
YOU ARE FRAGRANT ALL SEASONS
AND STRONG TOO

346
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,126
This looks like me. Oh my!

347
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,728
It's gorgeous.

348
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,068
-Yes.
-This is awesome too.

349
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,806
-I'm very excited now.
-Oh, are you?

350
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:25,344
Well, big expectations
can lead to very big disappointments.

351
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,846
-Don't say that.
-If you could enjoy it as is…

352
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,182
Sure, I appreciate that.

353
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:34,353
-Let me check your order for you.
-Please.

354
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,056
First of all,

355
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:43,295
"Even with appetizers,
five small plates can make a full meal."

356
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,364
-That was your first remark.
-Yes.

357
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,234
You also wanted all the dishes
tied together with cheese.

358
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,570
"I'd appreciate it

359
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,340
if you could avoid
using sugar and carbohydrates."

360
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,341
Yes.

361
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,477
-That was your request.
-Spot on.

362
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,546
Your order slip brought to my mind

363
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,916
the princess from Cheese Kingdom.

364
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:05,817
Oh my.

365
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,388
The princess of Cheese Kingdom
with a tiny appetite.

366
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,924
I felt that someone just like that
would walk in today.

367
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:14,159
Oh my goodness.

368
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,129
To the light-eating princess
from Cheese Kingdom.

369
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,198
Is that too childish?

370
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:27,139
It's divided into five types of cheese.

371
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,474
-Yes, it's a fictional land.
-Cheese Kingdom.

372
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,610
This is amazing.

373
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:34,513
-So…
-Thank you.

374
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,249
-Wait just a moment, please.
-All right.

375
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,539
I really enjoy cooking too,

376
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,542
but it's my first time
just watching and waiting

377
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,444
like this.

378
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,515
I feel like he'll put a lot of care
into his food.

379
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,685
He strikes me as someone

380
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,455
who is incredibly meticulous.

381
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,557
Not at all, to be honest.

382
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:14,579
It is fascinating to see the process

383
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:19,117
of such beautiful dishes coming together.

384
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:37,235
Good.

385
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,152
This must be the Cheese Heaven.

386
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:56,354
Today is Cheese Day.

387
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,590
-A happy Cheese Day.
-Cheese Day!

388
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:07,632
So charming.

389
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:21,012
-Here is the menu you ordered.
-Thank you so much.

390
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,383
This is art.

391
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,943
All of the dishes were created
within the category of appetizers,

392
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,513
and I used five different types
of cheese throughout.

393
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:59,517
First, we have gyeran-jjim
made with cheese.

394
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,586
The next one features cream cheese.

395
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,155
Right beside it is Grana Padano.

396
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:07,158
The one that looks
like a potato salad on top

397
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,160
is cheese that's been chilled and set.

398
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,161
I see.

399
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:14,299
Take small pieces of the cheese
and enjoy them with some veggies on top.

400
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,468
The mascarpone

401
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:21,006
is mixed with Shine Muscat grapes
and dried persimmons.

402
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,675
-Impressive.
-It may come off as a bit intense.

403
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,578
The sweetness of the fruit
will balance it out.

404
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,113
I would love that.

405
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,581
You said no carbohydrates,

406
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:33,218
but I thought a little noodle at the end
wouldn't hurt.

407
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,587
So there's just a bit underneath,

408
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,722
and it's topped with mozzarella

409
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,391
and natto.

410
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,061
-Gosh.
-It's an unusual combination.

411
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,630
But I tried it before, and it worked well.

412
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,466
That over there is Haloumi.

413
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:49,834
It's a grilled cheese.

414
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,804
I've soaked it in garlic oil

415
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,939
for you to enjoy now and then.

416
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:02,881
Just something I made
from the inspiration you gave me.

417
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,416
You have made it come to life.

418
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:05,684
Princess of Cheese Kingdom.

419
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,352
Please enjoy, Your Highness.

420
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:08,887
Do enjoy.

421
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:10,689
Thank you very much.

422
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,223
-You know what, Chef?
-Yes?

423
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,693
I'm going to tie my hair first.

424
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:18,730
I want to focus on the meal.

425
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:19,798
Ready for battle.

426
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,234
I'm really looking forward to it.

427
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:24,836
I mean, just a little.

428
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:27,172
-Okay.
-Not too much.

429
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,774
-I'll start with gyeran-jjim.
-Okay.

430
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,910
Look at this pottery.

431
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:34,279
This is exceptionally cute.

432
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,214
The way the lid opens…

433
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,182
Oh dear!

434
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,717
It looks so good,

435
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,986
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to eat it.

436
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,888
You can eat it.

437
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:48,259
There's a light sprinkle
of lime zest on top.

438
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,862
Underneath is steamed egg
made with cream cheese.

439
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:54,632
And the one on top of it
is made with katsuobushi broth.

440
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,801
-It's jelly.
-Jelly?

441
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:02,907
Katsuobushi has such an appealing aroma.

442
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:17,589
The combination of cream cheese and egg
in a chilled steamed dish,

443
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,858
paired with the katsuobushi seasoning,

444
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,494
the jelly's texture,
and the cool temperature…

445
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,662
It's all so charming.

446
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:25,930
-I see.
-Yes.

447
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:32,170
It's a cool appetizer,
just right for summer.

448
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,638
Wow, this is…

449
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,974
It's incredibly fresh,

450
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,543
and the flavor

451
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,446
is quite elegant.

452
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,282
It feels like I'm dreaming.

453
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,383
I find myself

454
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,120
wishing this moment would never end.

455
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,957
It's a one-time-only dish,
made just for today.

456
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,225
-Is it?
-Yes.

457
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,427
-A dish just for me.
-That's right.

458
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:57,996
It's absolutely delicious.

459
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:01,299
Now, I'm going to move on
to the next dish.

460
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:02,200
Okay.

461
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:07,772
Just like you would dip into ssamjang,

462
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,242
you can place a vegetable
or a slice of tomato on the cheese.

463
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,777
-Just a bite first.
-Sure.

464
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:21,319
If you're a cheese lover,
just one bite will say it all.

465
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,290
I have to say,

466
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,160
that just launched me into the sky.

467
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,097
This flavor is just…

468
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:34,833
So,

469
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,937
I started off
with this amazing, elegant gyeran-jjim

470
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,339
and then moved on to the next dish.

471
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,741
I think that kind of flow really matters.

472
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:46,611
There is such a thing
as the right order of flavors.

473
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,846
Of course.

474
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,048
The fact that you planned that sequence

475
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,083
is just so charming.

476
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,751
For this dish,

477
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:58,723
you have paired the fresh texture
of the vegetables

478
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,792
with this Grana Padano

479
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,528
to create a wonderful combination.

480
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:16,407
The cheese on its own is so delicious,

481
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:21,079
you could honestly just eat it by itself.

482
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,146
I see.

483
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,015
So this pairing?

484
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:28,419
It goes without saying
that it's absolutely perfect.

485
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,171
This is right up my alley.

486
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,573
-I see.
-So…

487
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,708
I can't stop

488
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,044
eating this.

489
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:57,782
I see you've given the cheese
a firmer texture for this dish.

490
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:01,519
-You can, of course, serve it warm.
-Okay.

491
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,789
But even when served cold like this,
it has its own unique charm.

492
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:07,258
If you serve the cheese warm,
would it melt a bit?

493
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,259
Yes, just slightly.

494
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:09,594
-Would it spread?
-Yes.

495
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:12,664
-The warm cheese will have its own…
-Charm.

496
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,732
-It will taste great.
-Obviously.

497
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,703
-I'll move on to the next one.
-Of course.

498
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,306
You might not be too familiar
with this one.

499
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,741
I used mascarpone here.

500
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,945
As the mascarpone blends with the tofu,

501
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:30,548
I feel like it brings out
the tofu's flavor even more.

502
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,152
-It's a fruit salad.
-Okay.

503
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:38,856
The sweetness that comes through
as you chew

504
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,325
is the highlight of this dish.

505
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:44,495
I know you are not fond of sugar,
but I did add just a little.

506
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:45,430
Okay.

507
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,765
But I used xylitol
instead of regular sugar.

508
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,400
-Thank you.
-Only 20 grams.

509
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,336
-I appreciate that.
-I didn't use the whole pack.

510
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:52,403
I understand.

511
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,452
Yes, the combination…

512
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,587
It's unfamiliar, but not entirely.

513
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:11,489
Honestly,

514
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,927
I never would've thought
of this combination.

515
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,328
I was like, "Mascarpone?"

516
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:19,998
"The tiramisu cheese?"

517
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,199
I get it.

518
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:24,736
But here, you've paired it with sweetness.

519
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,138
-Yes.
-And it works beautifully.

520
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,142
Yes, I tried to explore

521
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,211
some new combinations.

522
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,580
You are a true genius.

523
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:36,914
Not at all!

524
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:40,585
You've come up with these combinations.
That is totally genius.

525
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:44,122
Well, I did come up with
a lot of new combinations.

526
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,125
I mean,

527
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,494
I feel incredibly happy right now.

528
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,870
-Her words just make you happy.
-I'm so happy.

529
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:00,538
-Don't they?
-Yes.

530
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,443
That kind of refined compliment…

531
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,246
I haven't received many like that.

532
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:11,182
Inside, I was more than thrilled,

533
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,185
but I couldn't show it properly.

534
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,254
I just kept twitching a smile instead.

535
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,324
I couldn't even make eye contact.

536
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:21,993
Not that I ever could.

537
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:24,796
What a charming meal.

538
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,765
I'm on a pleasant journey right now.

539
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,335
Let me move on to this dish now.

540
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,738
-Are these noodles?
-Yes, they are.

541
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,541
It's a wide udon-style noodle,

542
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,977
paired with cheese and natto.

543
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:43,381
There's spicy chili tucked inside.

544
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,917
-Inside?
-Yes, and scallions are sprinkled on top.

545
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:49,954
-So these are natto and cheese on top?
-Yes.

546
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,389
-What kind of cheese?
-Mozzarella.

547
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,757
-Mozzarella.
-Yes.

548
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:06,370
The thing about cheese is
that it can get a bit too heavy,

549
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:10,441
but the chili inside really cuts through

550
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:12,577
all that richness

551
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,713
and brings balance to the whole dish.

552
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,951
-This is also an excellent combination.
-Thank you.

553
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,219
Just excellent.

554
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,054
I'm so…

555
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:26,224
Oh my God. This is too good.

556
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,227
And I have to say this about the noodles.

557
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,097
The noodles are very charming.

558
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:36,100
-Yes, they are udon noodles.
-Udon noodles.

559
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:40,004
You might want to try stir-frying them.

560
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:43,541
-Lightly?
-They are going to feel quite different.

561
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,577
Cheese pasta.

562
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:57,855
I mean it.

563
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,991
Chef, this is really…

564
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,293
Hold on, this calls for…

565
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,329
-An applause.
-Thank you.

566
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,732
-It's incredible.
-I've never been applauded before.

567
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:10,001
Really? It's incredible.

568
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,271
-It's so delicious, chef.
-Thank you.

569
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:17,008
I feared it might have been a mistake
to serve noodles.

570
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:18,609
No, you shouldn't.

571
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,578
I actually love noodles.

572
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:24,282
That's my problem.
I just love carbs way too much.

573
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,616
I see.

574
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,818
I only asked you to avoid using carbs

575
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,488
because I wanted to hold myself back.

576
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:34,125
Allow me to move on to the next one.

577
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:38,763
To me, this feels like a piece of art.

578
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,432
You can enjoy it piece by piece.

579
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,502
Garlic and grilled cheese.

580
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:46,037
The texture.

581
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,039
Haloumi.

582
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:56,914
This is also art.

583
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:01,652
Samchoon here grilled it
to a beautiful color.

584
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,388
-Getting the right color is important.
-Samchoon!

585
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:07,325
Did you grill this yourself?

586
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,927
Yes, I gave it a try.

587
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,096
-It's amazing.
-Really?

588
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:13,497
-Yes, really.
-That's a relief.

589
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,167
I mean, this is a gorgeous color.

590
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,769
It looks so appetizing.

591
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,238
That's kind of you.

592
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:23,241
A quick sear wouldn't have done the trick.

593
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:26,978
This pretty color comes
from grilling it with real care.

594
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,312
That's the perfect color.

595
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:31,616
Look how mouthwatering this is.

596
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:35,886
-It's beautifully grilled.
-This is just so…

597
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:36,988
It's so tasty.

598
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,624
I feel like I'm on a trip.

599
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,225
I see.

600
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,693
Chef,

601
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:45,129
this is my first time

602
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:52,303
experiencing such a variety of cheeses
in a single meal.

603
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,204
Oh, is it?

604
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:58,109
Being able to pair
such a variety of ingredients

605
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:00,444
in your own ways to create new flavors,

606
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,380
that's pure creativity.

607
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,581
You flatter me.

608
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:06,517
It takes a truly creative mind

609
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,853
to pull something like this off.

610
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,557
The truth is, whenever I cook for someone,

611
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:18,663
I'm always curious to find out
whether they enjoy the food or not.

612
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:19,730
-Always.
-Yes.

613
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:23,601
But guests don't usually give
real feedback.

614
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,069
Now that's a shame.

615
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:31,208
Honest feedback can really make
a cook's day, you know.

616
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:34,478
But giving feedback is not that easy.

617
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:37,348
I think it's something
you have to get used to.

618
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,950
If you haven't had much practice,
it's hard to do.

619
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:41,952
-You're right.
-Right?

620
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:52,129
I've been making meals for people,

621
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:56,901
but I don't think I've ever received
a lot of detailed feedback.

622
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:58,736
Not many at all.

623
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,540
So more often than not,

624
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:07,878
I had no idea
what kind of impression my food made.

625
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:11,215
But then you shared all this with me.

626
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,552
-Yes.
-How touching.

627
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:19,223
Being invited
to such a special occasion today,

628
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,893
I felt I had to express myself in a way
that was truly mine.

629
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,961
-Yes.
-And…

630
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,431
This food moves me to say something.

631
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,333
-Okay.
-You can feel the care.

632
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,104
So much thought went into preparing this.

633
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,306
-That's true.
-It really shows.

634
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:37,675
I'm grateful.

635
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,510
-My goodness.
-I'm really…

636
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,979
I'm so moved right now.

637
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,250
Funny thing is…

638
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:49,954
Samchoon said
that after reading your order,

639
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:54,158
he assumed you might be
a guest from overseas.

640
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,128
The level of detail was…

641
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,664
Your requests were specific and clear.

642
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,832
Did you catch that?

643
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,769
Yes, it sounded like
how you would place an order abroad.

644
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,837
I see. Okay.

645
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:10,040
-Did you live abroad before marriage?
-Yes.

646
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:13,144
So I was born in Canada.

647
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,311
Okay.

648
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:17,648
I was living in Canada until I was 23

649
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:21,452
and met my husband
during a visit to Korea.

650
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,053
-I read it in the papers.
-Did you?

651
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,555
"A Love Story for the Ages."

652
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,357
-At the time?
-Yes, well…

653
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,759
-That's right, I…
-Yes?

654
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,328
I followed the story closely.

655
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:32,963
Oh, did you?

656
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,900
I've been a fan

657
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,602
since your husband played Daebal.

658
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,471
-Oh, yes!
-No, before that.

659
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,173
-You were a fan?
-Yes.

660
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,073
Were you?

661
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,576
He was the best in The Terrorist.

662
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:47,445
I remember The Terrorist.

663
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:52,550
It was a year into our marriage
when he filmed that movie.

664
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,786
-That's when he did Sandglass as well.
-Of course. Sandglass.

665
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,956
-I guess I'm a bit of a relic myself.
-I guess so.

666
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:01,659
-You seem to know everything.
-Why do I remember Daebal?

667
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,394
This is exhilarating.

668
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,296
Yes, it really is.

669
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,365
-We share the same memories.
-Yes.

670
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,201
-I find that fascinating.
-I see.

671
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,069
I've felt that
since I started working here.

672
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,105
I think of that as

673
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,274
the scent of an era.

674
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:18,742
-Right.
-And that's…

675
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:22,913
The scent of a certain time really exists.

676
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:29,620
The first time I came to Korea was

677
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:33,591
in 1977, when I was just seven.

678
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,327
It was my very first visit,

679
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:41,732
and I never thought that one day,
I would spend 30 years of my life here.

680
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:42,633
Yes.

681
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:47,438
And being here today
got me thinking about cooking.

682
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:52,309
Korean food, to be honest, has been
a bit of a painful subject for me.

683
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:55,613
Because before that,
I had never actually cooked Korean food.

684
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,514
Okay.

685
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,916
But then I met my husband and…

686
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,520
-He's quite old-fashioned.
-Old-fashioned.

687
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:06,123
So I guess he assumed
I'd know how to cook Korean food,

688
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,058
at least to some extent.

689
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:09,860
But I didn't

690
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:14,331
because I got married
right after finishing university.

691
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:17,735
So I had to learn Korean cooking
from scratch,

692
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:22,006
all while trying to match
my husband's picky taste.

693
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:25,042
And he's not the type to eat

694
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:29,547
and compliment the food
or even say it's good,

695
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:31,382
regardless of my effort.

696
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:34,385
"This isn't how doenjang-jjigae
is supposed to taste."

697
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:37,788
"This doenjang-jjigae is not quite right."

698
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,891
I must have heard that hundreds of times.

699
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,828
So, to keep up with my husband's taste,

700
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:48,232
I had to put in quite a lot of effort

701
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:51,368
when it came to cooking.

702
00:42:55,873 --> 00:43:00,544
Consideration stems from empathy.

703
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:03,113
And to empathize,

704
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:07,484
you have to understand
the effort that goes into cooking.

705
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:09,987
Today's guest…

706
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,693
has clearly done a lot of cooking.

707
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:20,064
That is why she can naturally
understand the work

708
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:21,732
that goes into each dish.

709
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:25,736
You can't be considerate without empathy.

710
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:28,405
They go hand in hand.

711
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:39,617
There are five cheese appetizers here.

712
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:40,517
Yes.

713
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:43,387
Would this be enough for you as a meal?

714
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,623
It's more than enough for me.

715
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:51,562
It's well-balanced
in both nutrition and portion.

716
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,963
It's just right.

717
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,898
For me,

718
00:43:55,566 --> 00:44:00,371
this is the perfect kind of meal.

719
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:01,839
-Thank you.
-It is.

720
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,775
Today must've been therapeutic for you.

721
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:06,710
Yes, well…

722
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:08,779
As always,

723
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,714
compliments

724
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:12,750
are good for us.

725
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,886
I was really touched today.

726
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:17,988
You made me think

727
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:21,859
I should take the time
to savor my food like you did.

728
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:24,662
-My goodness.
-You are so inspirational.

729
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,598
-You are far too kind.
-I was really moved.

730
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,532
Please.

731
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,902
You invited me to such a precious place

732
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:36,140
and, even without knowing who I was,

733
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:42,746
prepared every dish
with such care and thoughtfulness.

734
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:47,184
It made me feel
deeply cared for and loved.

735
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:48,585
-Thank you.
-Yes.

736
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:51,155
This is all so heartwarming.

737
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:52,222
Thank you.

738
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,626
-I appreciate that.
-I'm touched.

739
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,696
Back when I used to run a restaurant,

740
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:02,099
I would say,
"Thank you for eating wholeheartedly."

741
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,835
-I'd say that to my customers.
-That's sweet.

742
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,371
-It always gave them a chuckle.
-Yes.

743
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:11,308
Eating takes a lot of energy, after all.

744
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:14,812
So, thank you for eating wholeheartedly.

745
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,413
-Thank you.
-Not at all.

746
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,217
Thank you for preparing
such a precious meal for me.

747
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,124
Where is my…

748
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:28,926
-Oh, your bag?
-Where is my bag?

749
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,261
Would you like your bag back?

750
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:32,663
-Thanks.
-No problem.

751
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:40,137
Our payment system
isn't working at the moment,

752
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,873
so we won't be charging for the food.

753
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,007
Instead,

754
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,009
in place of a bill,

755
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,613
we'd like to ask you
to give this dish a name.

756
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,215
I can't do that.

757
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:52,883
-Yes, you can.
-I have to pay.

758
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,651
-We insist.
-Yes.

759
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:55,919
-Gosh.
-Please sit.

760
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:58,956
-But it's such a precious meal.
-Please take a seat.

761
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:02,459
I can't just leave without paying for it.

762
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:03,527
That's fine.

763
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,729
-But this isn't a payment.
-It's okay.

764
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:07,598
-This isn't how we pay.
-It is for us.

765
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:09,333
-This is how we take payments.
-But still…

766
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:11,034
This place is full of surprises.

767
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,236
Is it?

768
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:14,371
I feel bad.

769
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:18,909
For the record, you're the first guest
who's reached for their wallet.

770
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,911
-Really?
-You are the first.

771
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:21,979
I mean,

772
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:27,751
what kind of restaurant
are you running here?

773
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:30,587
-Just a moment, please.
-Sure.

774
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:34,458
So you write down
all the dishes you've made.

775
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:36,727
That's right. That is our menu.

776
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:39,363
And the meal you had today?

777
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:42,432
It was a one-day-only offering for you.

778
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:43,467
Oh my.

779
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:44,668
We call it a menu,

780
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:49,039
but really, it's a collection of dishes
that can never be ordered again.

781
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:50,407
I see.

782
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:52,943
So precious.

783
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:58,415
Oh my goodness.

784
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,085
Dear me.

785
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,456
Gosh, this is…

786
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:07,791
Wow!

787
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:13,297
Everyone came up with such great names.

788
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,301
There are so many amazing dishes too.

789
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,871
Am I supposed to write the name down?

790
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:24,308
-Yes, your own name for today's menu.
-All right.

791
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:40,490
Are you done?

792
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,227
Okay.

793
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:45,329
Yes.

794
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:53,403
"A Cheese-Fueled Journey of Love."

795
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:55,739
Is that the impression you got?

796
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,175
-Yes.
-I guess you've been on a journey.

797
00:47:58,242 --> 00:47:59,610
-Yes.
-All right.

798
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:04,748
It was a meal that really filled my heart.

799
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:09,887
My time here gave me so much peace.

800
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:13,290
All I can say is thank you.

801
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,693
We were touched by your energy
just as much.

802
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,328
-Yes, we were.
-Thank you.

803
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,130
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

804
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:22,332
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

805
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,168
-Can I take this with me?
-Of course you can.

806
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,704
-Please take it.
-I will. Thank you.

807
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:30,507
-Hold on to it, please.
-Thank you for everything.

808
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:31,942
I think

809
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:36,079
I'm going to carry this memory
with me forever.

810
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:37,147
So thank you.

811
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,216
We thank you for coming.

812
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:42,486
Have a safe trip home.

813
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:53,196
I think I've just been blessed.

814
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,044
Last day of business.

815
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,445
Business as usual.

816
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:12,749
"Bring back my old elementary school days
through the flavors of now."

817
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:15,085
-The age of the guest…
-Around my age, I think.

818
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:18,555
I'm going to take saury,
a fading memory from our tables,

819
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,190
and make a saury rice bowl.

820
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:24,227
Who could it be that went
to elementary school back in the old days?

821
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:26,997
Hello!

822
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,100
It definitely brings back old memories.

823
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,436
Would it be weird if I cried now?

824
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:34,171
Yes. Please don't cry.
