1
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,390
Your story is served as today's menu in…

2
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,526
The Blank Menu For You.

3
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,233
I prepared some flowers for today.

4
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,635
Your hospitality services are great.

5
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,470
Yes, I prepared them specially.

6
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:41,374
I thought no order could top Queen Gabee's
in terms of glamour,

7
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,910
but we've received an order
that's glamorous in a different way.

8
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:44,944
Right.

9
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:48,014
They have excellent penmanship
and are a great writer.

10
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,451
-Their handwriting is beautiful.
-Exactly.

11
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,789
"Dear Chef, can you bring on the heat?"

12
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:00,460
"I'm dreaming of a dish that is both
a feast for the eyes and the mouth,

13
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,229
a glamorously spicy dish."

14
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:06,266
"I absolutely adore spicy food,

15
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,268
but I don't get to eat it often."

16
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,437
"While I have the chance,

17
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:13,006
I'd love to try various spicy flavors."

18
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,208
"I'm a pro when it comes to spice,

19
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,945
but it would be nice to have something
to cool my burning tongue."

20
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,415
"As for texture, I love anything chewy,

21
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,085
but I have trypophobia,

22
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:29,289
so I dislike foods
that look like clustered circles."

23
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,159
"I'm a Chatty Kathy, so I'm sorry
my order is so long. And thank you!"

24
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:35,962
If they want spice,

25
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,364
we could just call Chef Kang Leo again,
don't you think?

26
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,834
-Yes, he really brings the heat.
-Really packs a punch.

27
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,402
Samchoon, are you good with spicy food?

28
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,305
I don't eat spicy food that often.

29
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:46,506
Why not?

30
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,741
-My insides don't like it.
-Right.

31
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,244
-And my personality…
-Yes?

32
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,280
-I feel spice makes me hot-tempered.
-It does.

33
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,417
-It gets me riled up.
-Right, I get you.

34
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,620
I'd rather not feel like a steam train.

35
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,055
-Right.
-So I don't eat it often.

36
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,791
I quite enjoy spicy food myself,

37
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,560
but I start to sweat
just looking at it on a menu.

38
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,896
Just the thought gives me the sweats.

39
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,932
My father's the type to sweat
even while eating shaved ice.

40
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:16,469
Seeing how they like chewy textures,
I think they're a Millennial or Gen Z.

41
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,038
-A younger guest?
-Yes.

42
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,041
Even the fact that they have trypophobia
is very millennial.

43
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,643
I'd never heard of that before.

44
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,245
-Trypophobia?
-Yes.

45
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,579
Trypophobia is totally real.

46
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,148
It's not technically a phobia,

47
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,716
but it's a very valid discomfort.

48
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:32,285
A really good example
is a cluster of blackheads.

49
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,254
Look at my nose pores right here.

50
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,155
Right.

51
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:40,827
"Spicy food I like. Mapo Tofu."

52
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,030
"Has spice and can be served
in a fancy dish."

53
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,432
"Can also add ingredients
that are chewy in texture."

54
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,967
"Mapo Tofu."

55
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,471
All roads seemed to lead to mapo tofu.

56
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,307
What comes to mind
when you think of a chewy texture?

57
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,709
-Rice cakes?
-Ah, yes.

58
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,144
Rice cakes come to mind.

59
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,580
I think their experience
with tteokbokki is quite extensive.

60
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,550
-I agree.
-I don't want to just serve rice cakes.

61
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,219
Perhaps we could make something
to use for the mapo tofu

62
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,822
that looks like tofu
but has a unique chewiness to it.

63
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,324
-Really?
-Yes.

64
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,561
Maybe we could make something like that.

65
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,796
-It wouldn't actually be tofu.
-Right.

66
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,365
But because the shape looks similar,

67
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,167
let's just call it tofu.

68
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,735
-Right.
-We'll say it's tofu.

69
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,573
Let's make various types of tofu together.

70
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,876
-To start, we need tofu for the main dish.
-Yes.

71
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,978
Then, we need tofu for the dessert.

72
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,179
So two types of tofu.

73
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,083
Will the dessert be a special something
to cool our guest off?

74
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,620
It will, but we'll need to serve it
near the end of the service.

75
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,922
-So we'll serve them some Coolpeace.
-Sure.

76
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:43,856
Sounds great.

77
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,226
Spicy food and Coolpeace
are a match made in heaven.

78
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,927
-Coolpeace…
-Yes?

79
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,463
It's more for the nostalgia.

80
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,564
It is.

81
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,700
Here's to another good service.

82
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,668
-For starters…
-Yes.

83
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,737
Let's start with the dessert tofu.

84
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:58,905
-Right.
-We should hurry.

85
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,107
We need to boil it and then cool it.

86
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,408
DESSERT TOFU

87
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,177
To put it simply,

88
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,746
this is a milk jelly that has gelatin.

89
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:07,647
Okay.

90
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,983
Will it taste sweet like condensed milk?

91
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:11,317
It will.

92
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:12,885
It will be sweet.

93
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,255
-But just using milk's a little boring.
-Right.

94
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,424
If you read this too fast,

95
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:19,859
it becomes "ses-me."

96
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,930
Black sesame?
Say it fast and it becomes black ses-me?

97
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,431
Yes, ses-me.

98
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,332
Right.

99
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,508
SUGAR

100
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,443
-When you're using sugar…
-Yes?

101
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,078
You need to melt it down completely.

102
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,417
ADD SUGAR TO HOT MILK AND STIR

103
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,985
Once the sugar's all melted…

104
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,053
-Yes?
-We add heavy cream.

105
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,289
-Wow.
-Just a splash.

106
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,990
-Turn off the heat.
-Right.

107
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:52,392
Then we add this.

108
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,827
Wow.

109
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,900
You can smell the black sesame, right?

110
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:01,801
Yes.

111
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,637
-It smells like a mill.
-It does, doesn't it?

112
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,873
This smell. The smell of sesame…

113
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,046
Do we add the gelatin to this?

114
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,447
Yes, we add it in here,

115
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,050
let it dissolve,
and then leave it to cool.

116
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,419
-Then it should harden on its own.
-Right.

117
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:24,824
GELATIN SHEETS BLOOMED IN WATER

118
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,234
-I'll put it in.
-Yes.

119
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,236
-Does it dissolve easily?
-Yes, it does.

120
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,137
I see.

121
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,274
At this temperature,
it will dissolve quickly.

122
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:42,742
Wow, you're right.

123
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,112
-It's dissolved already.
-It dissolves quickly.

124
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,082
So now, this is a gelatinous liquid.

125
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,951
-We could add some honey to this.
-Wow.

126
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,822
But we'll take this,
and here, give it an ice bath.

127
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,694
On the bottom here,

128
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,629
it should harden like jelly.

129
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,998
-I'll stir it until it solidifies.
-Exactly.

130
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,301
I'll stir it a little first, because…

131
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,169
-It's hard work.
-Right.

132
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,205
-I'll do the hard work.
-It's okay.

133
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,574
-Things will get even harder later.
-All right, then.

134
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,277
We're getting there.

135
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,114
It's like jelly.

136
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,252
Once it sets, we can't change its shape.

137
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,293
Whoa!

138
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,335
How fascinating.

139
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:43,836
Wait, we should…

140
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,172
We're a tad late.

141
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,976
It would have been nice
for the surface to be flat and pretty.

142
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,546
But let's just finish this off.

143
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,447
All right.

144
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,556
I'm going to take this

145
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,192
and let it sit in the fridge.

146
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,467
-Can I try some of this?
-Of course.

147
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,436
Grab a spoon.

148
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,081
Are you hungry?

149
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,086
Let's eat more later.

150
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,054
Yes, Chef.

151
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,024
It'd be nice to add
some soybean powder.

152
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,660
Next, the tofu for the main dish.

153
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:41,761
Tofu for the main dish.

154
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:42,762
MAPO TOFU

155
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,730
USE ARROWROOT STARCH
FOR A CHEWIER TEXTURE

156
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,631
In here…

157
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,573
KELP BROTH

158
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,744
For this, we need to use our hands.

159
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,513
-Right, got it.
-Break it up a little.

160
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,448
Dissolve it.

161
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,987
You need to break it down
until you can't feel any lumps.

162
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:09,989
To this,

163
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,860
we'll add some of this.

164
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:14,927
What does this taste like?

165
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,828
SESAME SEED PASTE

166
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,697
It tastes like 100% sesame.

167
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:18,598
Yum!

168
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,266
It's not sweet.

169
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,836
There's absolutely no sugar in this.

170
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,571
It's quite like peanut butter.

171
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,273
Yes, it has that nutty scent.

172
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,542
Now, that one's sesame.

173
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,044
-I'll make one with black sesame.
-Right.

174
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:32,945
Black sesame.

175
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:40,720
One second.

176
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,824
I don't think this will work.

177
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,666
See? There are still so many lumps.

178
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,601
Dip that in the water slightly

179
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,970
and break down the lumps.

180
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,006
-We don't want any lumps.
-Okay.

181
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,477
This is satisfying.

182
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,411
-Isn't it?
-Yes.

183
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,157
Now we need to mentally prepare ourselves.

184
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,058
All right.

185
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,227
-No rest, just stirring.
-Okay.

186
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,995
Now, we turn on the stove.

187
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,834
-When you're doing something like this…
-Yes?

188
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,137
-You keep getting reality checks.
-Right.

189
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,440
You find yourself asking,
"Why am I still stirring this?"

190
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,509
When you're working alone,
you start to feel lonely.

191
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,410
Right.

192
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,413
What's on your mind at times like that?

193
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,681
What music do you listen to?

194
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,715
-At times like that?
-Yes.

195
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,317
-Jaessbee's…
-Yes?

196
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,485
-"Every Moment With You"?
-That's the one.

197
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,321
-It's a good song.
-It is.

198
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,590
Who came up with the melody?

199
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,426
-The melody is great.
-It is.

200
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,596
Hold up!

201
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,864
-Why?
-We're getting a reaction.

202
00:09:58,931 --> 00:09:59,899
We are.

203
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,467
Now,

204
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,969
you need to make sure

205
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:04,971
you scrape the bottom.

206
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,440
-This won't scratch the pan.
-It looks delicious.

207
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,709
-It's thickening like porridge.
-It is.

208
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,445
-Now, you need tenacity.
-Tenacity!

209
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:15,047
-Tenacity and energy.
-Right.

210
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,782
-You can't stop.
-All right.

211
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,385
-Think to yourself, "I'm a mixer."
-A mixer.

212
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,124
Shall I keep going?

213
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,359
Ten minutes more.

214
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:27,693
-Ten minutes?
-Yes.

215
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,628
Okay.

216
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,171
When you watch cooking shows,

217
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:42,074
they say things like,
"Here's one I made earlier."

218
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,342
Can't we do that?

219
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:46,679
The thing is,

220
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,082
you'll taste the difference
when you try it fresh.

221
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:51,584
This…

222
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,786
It's meant to be done every day.

223
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:54,687
Every day?

224
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,389
Who in their right mind would do that?

225
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,291
-It's crucial for the texture.
-I see.

226
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,627
They do this every day for the texture.

227
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,229
People do this every day?

228
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,532
We're in an age
where robots fry us chicken,

229
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:07,667
but people do this daily?

230
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,735
You could do this with a machine.

231
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,137
-You can?
-Yes, you could.

232
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,673
But today, we're using our tenacity.

233
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,276
Shall we try swapping?

234
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,745
-Isn't this one easier?
-No, it's not.

235
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,914
-It's not, right?
-This one will be easier to stir.

236
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,883
I'm sorry for doubting you.

237
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,051
At the core of human affairs

238
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:26,385
is distrust.

239
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,789
Now, give it more elbow grease.

240
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,232
These are nonstick pots,

241
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,934
so this is on the easier side.

242
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,137
But be careful of cramping up.

243
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,506
My gosh.

244
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,210
My arm's cramping up. Hold up.

245
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,945
My finger's busted.

246
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,013
At my age, it's…

247
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,781
-Once you hit 40…
-Yes?

248
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,616
Cramps are an old friend.

249
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,018
It's okay.

250
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,153
No, I'm telling you I'm not okay.

251
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,489
You should do this. Like this.

252
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,990
This is more important.

253
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,465
Now,

254
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,366
if that's about done…

255
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,003
Samchoon, you need to keep going.

256
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,252
There.

257
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,788
You need to pour it in one go.

258
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:36,922
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

259
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,365
How was that?

260
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,700
We'll take this, and…

261
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,978
Samchoon, when you're stirring
things like this…

262
00:12:59,044 --> 00:12:59,879
Yes?

263
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,914
It's rather strenuous and dull.

264
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:02,815
Yes.

265
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,350
What do you think about?

266
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,222
To master a single skill like this,

267
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,925
it takes around one hundred tries.

268
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,562
So I think to myself
how near I am to my 100th try.

269
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:20,266
Have I done enough to make myself proud?

270
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,268
That makes it a tiny bit better.

271
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,970
Perhaps I'll be at my 50th try.

272
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:25,871
Right.

273
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,007
I've always thought to myself,

274
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,509
let's just repeat everything
one hundred times.

275
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,813
Everyone has their goals and targets.

276
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,282
Even if you're not at your 100th try,
if you just keep going,

277
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:37,750
I think you're good.

278
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,820
Once it's laid out flat,

279
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,255
we're going to cool this.

280
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,392
-In the refrigerator.
-Okay.

281
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,537
They're cooled already?

282
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,673
-Well, these ones here…
-Yes?

283
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,376
They're ones I made yesterday.

284
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,544
Right.

285
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,979
The texture

286
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,849
will be best if it's freshly made.

287
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,684
But to use it in a dish,

288
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,054
it's a little too soft,
which makes it difficult to shape.

289
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,456
So we won't be using these.

290
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:18,858
Right.

291
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,468
In life,

292
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,204
there are hardships you must experience

293
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,807
and ones that aren't entirely necessary.

294
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,009
I can't help but think

295
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,445
that stirring tofu was a hardship

296
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,280
we could have done without.

297
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,949
We didn't need to make tofu today,

298
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,818
but we can use it tomorrow.

299
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,293
SESAME TOFU
LEFT TO SET FOR A DAY

300
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,194
Wow.

301
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,496
-Shall we try it?
-Yes.

302
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,332
Wow.

303
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,538
It's a different type of tofu

304
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,773
from the sweet tofu earlier.

305
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,843
-Try pressing it hard with your tongue.
-Yes.

306
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:14,847
Tasteless, right?

307
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,814
Yeah, it is.

308
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:21,053
-This won't have much flavor either.
-Right.

309
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,156
But it will be good for the aesthetics.

310
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,703
Why, thank you.

311
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,076
-No taste at all, right?
-Yeah.

312
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,111
It's like eating edible mud.

313
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,881
It's like when you go to the seaside,
maybe Boryeong,

314
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,684
and they tell you,
"Just eat it. It's good for your health."

315
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,651
You can eat it.

316
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:53,652
Is it that bad?

317
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,661
You'd feel a little guilty
asking a friend, "It's tasty, right?"

318
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:03,562
Yes.

319
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,097
But it's strangely addictive.

320
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,398
I keep grabbing more.

321
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,668
-We wouldn't want to sweeten it.
-No?

322
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:10,970
You'd get bored of it fast.

323
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,171
I think so too.

324
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,440
For it to work well with other sauces,

325
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,609
you want to reduce its distinct taste.

326
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:18,510
Absolutely.

327
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,879
Let's try to finish the dish.

328
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:21,780
Sure.

329
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,316
TOFU FOR THE MAIN DISH

330
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,019
RED SAUCE

331
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,522
I've never seen you use so many sauces.

332
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,224
It's for a variety of spicy flavors.

333
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,158
Wow.

334
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,995
First, I'll add some oil to the pan.

335
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,163
-Add some ginger.
-Yes.

336
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,969
Ginger is also spicy.

337
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,270
Ginger is spicy, yes.

338
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,006
And so is garlic.

339
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,307
So is garlic, yes.

340
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,543
-Green onions tend to burn fast.
-They do.

341
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,245
So we'll sauté them gently.

342
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,082
-Do you like the spice of toban djan?
-Of course!

343
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,052
-We're going to sauté toban djan.
-Right.

344
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,186
It'll make it delicious.

345
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,989
Just smelling it,
I already want to eat it with rice.

346
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,624
It's already perfection.

347
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,093
Just among these everyday spices,

348
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,962
there's a variety of spicy flavors.

349
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,063
Exactly.

350
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,031
A lot of meat?

351
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,465
-A lot of meat!
-A lot of meat.

352
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,502
This is stir-fried meat.

353
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,406
-Some black bean sauce.
-Black bean sauce.

354
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:23,142
I want to add eggs and rice
and stir it up like this.

355
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,476
You could do that, yes.

356
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,013
The smell is just…
How can something so delicious be so easy?

357
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,583
Once it's all cooked down,
we're going to add the broth.

358
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,818
Understood.

359
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,520
Here comes the broth.

360
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:35,988
Here it comes!

361
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:36,889
Three, two, one.

362
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,792
CHICKEN BROTH

363
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:41,760
To this,

364
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,463
we'll add some sugar

365
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:45,831
and some pepper.

366
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,433
-A lot of pepper.
-A lot.

367
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:48,333
Pepper's also spicy.

368
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,436
And some laochou.

369
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:51,703
What's laochou?

370
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,272
It's a dark soy sauce.

371
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,340
A Chinese soy sauce. And then…

372
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,511
Some Sichuan pepper.

373
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,147
We'll stop there.

374
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:03,649
Let this sit.

375
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,953
What about the pale sauce?

376
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,521
The spicy flavor in this

377
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,924
isn't a wham-bam kinda spicy.

378
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,925
Right.

379
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,727
There'll be a subtle spice
from the peppers.

380
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:16,728
Sounds great.

381
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,131
Because our guest asked
for a variety of spicy flavors.

382
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,032
They did.

383
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,234
Wow.

384
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,041
BONITO FISH BROTH

385
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:29,975
This looks good.

386
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,745
What's that?

387
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:34,980
They're garlic sprouts.

388
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:40,119
We have the kick of ginger, garlic,
and now, garlic sprouts.

389
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,821
And now for a kick.

390
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:43,856
What's that?

391
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:48,427
Oh!

392
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,395
A more direct kick.

393
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,663
What is this?

394
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,432
This has Cheongyang chili peppers.

395
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,401
Yuzu peels, salt,
and Cheongyang chili peppers.

396
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,537
We used it in the first episode.

397
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,038
-To make Jang Ki-ha that…
-Yes!

398
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,974
-The clear gamjatang.
-Of course.

399
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:06,979
If we add this to give it another kick,
it will create this unique flavor.

400
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,313
It's quite delicious.

401
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,648
It's the sort of spice I wanted.

402
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:10,649
-It is?
-Yes.

403
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,251
-You're sweating.
-I am.

404
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,887
-I'm sweating.
-Is it spicy?

405
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:15,854
Yes.

406
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:19,391
If we add a lot of this,
it creates this unique scent.

407
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,161
It's rather addictive.

408
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,376
It's good.

409
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:38,777
-Is it done?
-Yes, it's done.

410
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,079
You should just taste it for seasoning.

411
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,184
Yes.

412
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:47,719
Is it good now?

413
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,154
-I think it's just right.
-Okay.

414
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,624
When we add in the starch,
it will suck it right up.

415
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,360
But it's quite good.

416
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,730
This is great in its own right,
and so is that.

417
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,966
-I feel good.
-It does feel good.

418
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,034
Let's keep it simple.

419
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,603
-Yes.
-We'll take the tofu and fry it.

420
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,471
Then just slap the sauce on top.

421
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,273
And obviously,

422
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:09,708
Coolpeace.

423
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,110
-Let's think about presentation.
-Yes, sir.

424
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,446
So they can drink Coolpeace elegantly.

425
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:15,347
Sounds good.

426
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,499
AND SO, YOU STIR MY CURIOSITY

427
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,935
I ASK YOUR NAME, BROUGHT TO ME
IN THE FORM OF A WINDOW FRAME

428
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,905
Is it here?

429
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:44,743
So it is.

430
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,947
THE BLANK MENU FOR YOU

431
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,853
I feel most nervous
just before our guest arrives.

432
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,358
Hello.

433
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,560
Hello. Welcome to the Blank Menu for You.

434
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,695
-Hello. I have a reservation.
-Hello.

435
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,130
Yes, please take your seat here.

436
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,131
Right.

437
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,433
Wow.

438
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,002
I'll take your coat.

439
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,004
Thank you.

440
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,639
If you're cold, you can keep it on.

441
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,607
-I'm not cold.
-Okay.

442
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:16,608
Thank you.

443
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,977
The service here is great.

444
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,047
-Hello. Welcome.
-Hello, Chef.

445
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,684
The Influencer.

446
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,553
I first saw her on that show.

447
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,088
What?

448
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,556
-RISABAE!
-Hello.

449
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,594
-My little ladies and gentlemen.
-RISABAE!

450
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,963
We're going to do very light eyebrows.

451
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,264
We'll shade it up to the end.

452
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:43,201
Thank you for saying I look like
a rich lady who lives in Cheongdamdong,

453
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,103
but I'm not there yet.

454
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,740
…to teach a wide audience of people
how to do their own makeup.

455
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,710
I can confidently say
I've been a trendsetter in my field.

456
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:56,682
OUR FIFTH GUEST
LEESABAE

457
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,885
Can I just check that you're the guest

458
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,688
who asked our chef to "bring on the heat"?

459
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:07,159
Yes, I ordered a very spicy dish
that's also glamorous.

460
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,528
Yes, and you prefer a chewy texture?

461
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,363
-Yes.
-And you have trypophobia.

462
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,331
Absolutely.

463
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,965
I understand. Okay.

464
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,303
What's this?

465
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,507
"And so, you stir my curiosity."

466
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,077
Normally, we don't have place mats.

467
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,012
Those flowers are fresh too.

468
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:28,814
-They're just for me?
-Yes.

469
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,782
This and this too?

470
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,517
The cutlery is new too.

471
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,553
It's totally my style.

472
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,124
Did you wear that just for today?

473
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,460
I prepared this for today.

474
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,128
-It looks so pretty.
-Thank you.

475
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,096
Thank you.

476
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,231
Wow.

477
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,334
It's right up my alley.

478
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,669
If it's all right,

479
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,071
I'd like to ask you some questions
while Samchoon cooks.

480
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:53,972
Ask me anything.

481
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,475
I have a lot of body heat,
so my skin gets really dehydrated.

482
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:59,311
If I eat something spicy, I get roseola.

483
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,113
Your skin gets red?

484
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,080
Exactly.

485
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:05,484
Do you tend to bottle things up?

486
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,719
I do, a little. How did you know?

487
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:11,556
People who tend to have a lot of body heat

488
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,091
often bottle things up.

489
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:17,662
Because they can't get angry,
it bubbles up inside of them.

490
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,663
Yes.

491
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,500
That affects a lot of different things.

492
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,401
Oh dear.

493
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,136
I bottled a lot of things up today too.

494
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:26,405
Don't swallow your feelings.

495
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:27,539
I'm only joking.

496
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,208
Your skin is flawless.

497
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,010
Mine? Why, thank you.

498
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,445
Do you take care of your skin?

499
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,815
I try to be diligent with moisturizing.

500
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,083
Right.

501
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:40,719
You mustn't just moisturize.

502
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:41,620
Oh?

503
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,756
In the colder months,
you also need to nourish your skin.

504
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,260
You keep bowing.

505
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,295
We keep bowing to each other.

506
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,298
We should be talking together,
but I'm just so excited to see you.

507
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,733
-Yes.
-I've left Samchoon to work.

508
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,170
I also want to talk a lot today.

509
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,594
It's spicy.

510
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:07,639
STIR IN STARCHY WATER
TO THICKEN THE SAUCE

511
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,552
I wonder if our chef
is good with spicy food.

512
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,187
He's coughing!

513
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:24,623
Oh no.

514
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,527
Chef, are you not good with spice?

515
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,463
I've never tasted something so spicy.

516
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,731
Really?

517
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,271
I wonder what it is.

518
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,907
I've never seen something like this.

519
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,681
CHILI OIL

520
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,770
Wow.

521
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,009
Chef, I'm so honored.

522
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:18,944
Not at all.

523
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,345
-Thank you.
-Please enjoy.

524
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:27,018
Wow.

525
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,623
It might be spicy, so…

526
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,394
We prepared something glamorous.

527
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,831
I can see that.
I love how glamorous it is,

528
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:41,399
but what is it?

529
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:44,436
It's something to ease the spice with.

530
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:47,272
Coolpeace.

531
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,909
It is the best remedy.

532
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,711
-Exactly.
-Thank you so much.

533
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,214
In your order, you asked us

534
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,649
to bring on the heat.

535
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:00,452
But in reality, I can't bring the heat.

536
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,421
Heat can only be felt.

537
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:06,491
You're right. I made a mistake.

538
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,361
I'm not saying it was a mistake,

539
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:11,329
I'm just…

540
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:16,067
He's also often dehydrated
because he has a lot of anger.

541
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,769
These days, yes.

542
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,172
We weren't sure
what type of spice you'd like…

543
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,107
Yes?

544
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:25,276
So I thought about spicy food
that I enjoy.

545
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:26,211
Great.

546
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:29,214
Today, we have some mapo tofu for you.

547
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,850
So this is mapo tofu? Wow.

548
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,619
But… it's eaten with a knife and fork.

549
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:35,520
It is?

550
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:39,324
It's shaped like tofu,
but it's actually muk.

551
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,160
Wait, so it's a jelly shaped like tofu?

552
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:43,528
-Yes.
-I see.

553
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:47,599
Then sitting on top of it, is this meat?

554
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,801
It's meat and various spices.

555
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,237
Garlic, ginger, and green onions.

556
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,506
Various ingredients that have a kick

557
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:57,509
and other spices
that have a different kick.

558
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,711
The seasoning may be a little strong,

559
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:02,213
but please eat it with the tofu

560
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,282
by slicing it up like a steak.

561
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,289
Wow, it's so jiggly.

562
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:25,537
Whoa.

563
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:26,705
What is this?

564
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,175
The muk is really nutty.

565
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,911
It's nutty,
but it just melted in my mouth.

566
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:36,347
It melted away too quickly,
so I'll take another bite.

567
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,251
Is the outer layer fried?

568
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,020
-Yes.
-It seems fried.

569
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,221
We fried it

570
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:47,325
so the sauce could stick
to the outer surface better.

571
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,795
Chef, this is so delicious.

572
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:54,899
I've never tried spicy food
that tastes like this before.

573
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,268
The best type of spice

574
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,238
has to be the spice of life.

575
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,372
Of course.

576
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,307
-Yes.
-Yes.

577
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:05,477
I couldn't exactly serve that to you here,

578
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,413
but I've tried to replicate that kick.

579
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,215
Pain!

580
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,218
The pain that grows
on the tip of your tongue.

581
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:16,888
Right now, it's a very delicious spice.

582
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:20,525
I don't find it overly spicy.
It's the perfect amount of heat.

583
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:22,894
But honestly,

584
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,297
it has this lovely, toasty aftertaste.

585
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,700
-Coolpeace is there to help you.
-Yes.

586
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,470
But the sesame is also there
to help cool you down.

587
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:33,972
It's spicy, but not.

588
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,508
-It's just on the cusp of spicy.
-Exactly.

589
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,877
I'll try this now too.

590
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,881
This one is also very bouncy.

591
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,716
That was the work of our Samchoon.

592
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,455
Have you heard of yuzu koshō?
It has yuzu and Cheongyang peppers.

593
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:52,090
It's slightly tangy.

594
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:56,394
You can smell and taste the citron.

595
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:00,031
I've never tasted
anything like this before either.

596
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:03,334
But I don't find this one spicy.

597
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:05,804
Or maybe

598
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:08,439
it is spicy?

599
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:11,442
My nose is starting to run,
so maybe it is spicy.

600
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,579
The peppers hit you after a while.

601
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,714
-Cheongyang peppers.
-Cheongyang peppers!

602
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,716
I can taste the Cheongyang peppers.

603
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,722
These dishes
complement each other so well.

604
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,692
Now that I've eaten half of this,
I want to go back to this one.

605
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:28,993
You eat one,

606
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,662
then you eat the other.

607
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,597
Then you drink some Coolpeace.

608
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,374
You obviously love spicy food.

609
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,977
Isn't it hard to stick to
such a strict diet

610
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:48,079
where you only eat spicy foods
once a year?

611
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:53,151
I normally have a shoot
or some sort of work every day.

612
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,119
My work requires a lot of close-up shots,

613
00:30:55,186 --> 00:31:00,124
so it's easy to spot when I'm puffy
or if I have a breakout.

614
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:04,028
So I watch what I eat mainly for my work.

615
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,564
I also have a YouTube channel,

616
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:10,001
and the scary thing
about having a YouTube channel

617
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,769
is that someone can do everything right.

618
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:13,338
They could be super diligent.

619
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,006
Let's say they worked really hard,

620
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,008
but one day, their views started to drop.

621
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,377
-Right.
-There's nothing you can do.

622
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,779
RISABAE's one of the first-gen YouTubers.

623
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:23,982
-Yes.
-And there aren't many left.

624
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,817
There aren't many YouTubers from then

625
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,286
who are still working at the rate you are.

626
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:30,054
So I had a lot of questions for you.

627
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:35,260
You're doing so great, so I don't think
there's much that I can tell you.

628
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,930
I've been in several makeup teams,

629
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,733
from special effects to working at a salon

630
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:44,135
where I did beauty makeup.

631
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:48,406
I think that's why there's a lot
that I can do in this field.

632
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,709
I have a wide range of experience,
so I have a lot to show people,

633
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:54,245
which is something
I'm really grateful for.

634
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:58,149
Which came first?
Realizing that you enjoyed doing makeup

635
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,118
or realizing that you were good at it?

636
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,722
I've always liked drawing.

637
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:09,294
Ever since I was young,
I enjoyed drawing people and characters.

638
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:12,497
I heard that was what
a special effects artist does,

639
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,999
so I signed up for an academy.

640
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,468
And in my first class,

641
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,438
I felt that I was pretty good.

642
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,273
I think that drew me to the work more.

643
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,643
It felt like it was my calling.

644
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,614
Since then, I've powered on
without ever really doubting myself.

645
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:34,419
In terms of the technical skills
that you have right now,

646
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,322
do you think you've mastered everything?

647
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:38,623
Not at all.

648
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,125
I think I have a long way to go.

649
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,226
-Still?
-Yes.

650
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,897
But don't you think
you've hit some sort of threshold?

651
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,566
-I think I've just hit a threshold.
-Right.

652
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:53,404
I guess ten years can be deemed
as some sort of a level.

653
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:57,775
I've been doing makeup for 15 years,
and my current work for ten.

654
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,644
So in that regard,

655
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:03,548
I guess I have just about reached
some sort of threshold.

656
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,750
As for me, in terms of cooking,

657
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:07,585
when I was about 34,

658
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:11,322
I thought I had mastered all the basics.

659
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:17,161
There was this moment when I felt
I'd hit some sort of threshold.

660
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:18,596
But now,

661
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,999
another decade or so later,

662
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:25,370
the threshold's had an upgrade.

663
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:28,339
I can see a higher threshold
that I need to reach

664
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:29,907
in terms of technique.

665
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,443
I totally feel you.

666
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,179
When I first entered this line of work,

667
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,949
I thought I was incredibly talented.

668
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:40,485
Me too. When I was 34,

669
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,287
I had my nose in the air.

670
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,525
But for people who master a skill

671
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,594
and take years to hone it,

672
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:52,063
I think times like that are necessary.

673
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,766
You feel some sense of accomplishment.

674
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,501
-An inflated ego.
-Exactly.

675
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:59,237
I think I also went through that.

676
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,606
During those ten years,
have you never felt worn out?

677
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:05,176
Since I started working,
I've never taken time off.

678
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:09,814
Because makeup studios
are even busier during the weekends,

679
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,749
and you pull all-nighters every day.

680
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,251
Even if you take a day off,

681
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,888
if your customer comes in,
you need to go and do their makeup

682
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,756
because they have busy schedules.

683
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,025
So I've never taken a proper rest.

684
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:25,396
And while I do feel
that my energy is not what it used to be,

685
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,067
I've never found the work
exhausting or tiring.

686
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,736
I think that's also because

687
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:34,572
the people who watch me

688
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,075
constantly send me comments and love

689
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:39,143
that I can instantly feel.

690
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:43,614
So it feels like
I should never say I'm exhausted.

691
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,751
And I think I power through
because they shower me with so much love

692
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,753
that I don't even have the time
to feel exhausted.

693
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,355
I don't think I know
what burnout feels like yet.

694
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,525
Have you experienced that before?

695
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,462
I experienced severe burnout once, yes.

696
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,362
Really?

697
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:00,898
When was this?

698
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,034
About three years ago.

699
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:06,003
-That's fairly recent.
-Yes.

700
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:09,941
I felt so helpless during the pandemic.

701
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,576
-Right.
-I agree.

702
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:15,480
Being placed in a situation
where you can't do anything…

703
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,383
I would try to comfort myself

704
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,553
by reminding myself
that everyone's going through this,

705
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,989
but I couldn't stop feeling helpless.

706
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:28,659
Would you like a shot of soju?

707
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:29,694
Two shots, please.

708
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:34,232
How did you overcome that?

709
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,300
I looked toward my family.

710
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,403
I think having kids gives you

711
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:43,040
a newfound strength
that you don't have when you're alone.

712
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,609
Right.

713
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:45,510
"Yes."

714
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:47,979
"My life is you."

715
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:49,814
"For you."

716
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,316
"But also for me."

717
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:53,317
Right.

718
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,286
Do you have one child?

719
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,254
Yes.

720
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,422
-A daughter?
-A daughter, yes.

721
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,291
You just sounded like a girl dad.

722
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:01,959
She'd love your autograph.

723
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:04,629
How old is your daughter?

724
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:05,563
She's nine.

725
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,765
-She's nine, but she knows me?
-She does.

726
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,933
Please.

727
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,669
Of course. I can sign 100 autographs
if you'd like.

728
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,540
If I look at you, Chef…

729
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:22,079
I tend to speak to people
while making heavy eye contact.

730
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,915
-And I'm avoiding it.
-Yes.

731
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:24,815
Me too.

732
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:28,452
So earlier, I actually pretended
to avoid eye contact.

733
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,421
I thought that you might find

734
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,757
my eye contact a little too strong.

735
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:35,760
My eye makeup's pretty fierce too.

736
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,395
Three seconds seems to be my limit.

737
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,364
I'll make eye contact
for three seconds, and then…

738
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:41,699
We're good, though.

739
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,603
Is that true? So you two
have no issues seeing eye to eye.

740
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,605
Have you two always known each other?

741
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,574
We newly met through this…

742
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,042
You met through this show?

743
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,681
It's like you two are newly dating
or something.

744
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,616
We haven't yet passed gas
in front of each other.

745
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,184
That's…

746
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,819
You're right.

747
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:07,024
I think the spice is building, Chef.

748
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,795
Earlier, it was just
a tasty amount of heat.

749
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,663
I didn't think it was that spicy.

750
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,999
It felt like I was casually
swimming in spice,

751
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,102
but now it feels like
it's swallowed me whole.

752
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:21,072
The heat in this dish
will continue to build.

753
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:22,673
I think it is, yes.

754
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,877
It's built to the point that my ears
feel like they're burning.

755
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:28,412
I love it.

756
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:31,148
Please don't force yourself to eat.

757
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:32,583
I can't force myself to eat.

758
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,418
-She's eating really well.
-Yes.

759
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:37,989
Having these bigger chunks of meat

760
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:40,524
makes it even spicier, which I love.

761
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,561
You said I should eat more of the sauce
if I prefer it spicier.

762
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:46,264
I think my nose is sweating.

763
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,733
I'm happy that you seem to be
enjoying the food.

764
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:49,800
It's so tasty.

765
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:51,669
It's really delicious.

766
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:55,139
I think that cooking and makeup

767
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,675
have quite a lot in common.

768
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:00,478
The food you cook disappears
once you eat it.

769
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,246
As for makeup,

770
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,448
it flows down the drain.

771
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:05,583
Right.

772
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,487
So you can only experience it
once on that day,

773
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:10,821
and then it's gone.

774
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:15,293
But I think they're similar
in that the emotions remain,

775
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,827
even after it's gone.

776
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:19,997
I ate all of it.

777
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:23,901
I don't think I've ever eaten so much.

778
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,187
Coolpeace was the cherry on top.

779
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,336
What's that pretty little thing?

780
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,506
Is this also that muk?

781
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,816
This is the sesame tofu
from the mapo tofu earlier.

782
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:12,717
Yes?

783
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:15,152
It's the black sesame jelly
in a dessert form.

784
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:16,554
I see.

785
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,357
Thankfully, you seem
to have enjoyed the main dish.

786
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:20,358
Yes.

787
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:21,992
So with the memory of that dish,

788
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:25,796
I hope this dessert
will round out the meal nicely.

789
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,099
Great, thank you.

790
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,767
You don't have to finish it all.

791
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:30,968
All right.

792
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:35,573
It looks hard,
but I think it will be squishy.

793
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,910
Whoa.

794
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:43,314
How it breaks apart smoothly as I slice it

795
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,550
is incredibly satisfying.

796
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:47,651
Right.

797
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,393
How is it so nutty and sweet?

798
00:39:55,926 --> 00:40:00,064
It's five times as decadent
as black sesame rice cakes.

799
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:03,300
You said the heat was starting to kick in,

800
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:05,202
so please use the sweetness

801
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,304
to dampen the heat a little.

802
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:08,773
I should eat in smaller bites.

803
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,208
-I just shoved it in my mouth.
-That's fine. Please enjoy.

804
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:15,546
It's nutty and sweet.
You've totally nailed my vibe today.

805
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,649
In the order you wrote,

806
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:21,752
you emphasised
that you wanted something glamorous.

807
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,989
I was really curious who you might be.

808
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,091
-The care you took in writing it.
-I see.

809
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:29,693
The paper was too small.

810
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,196
I wanted to write a lot more.

811
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,866
But I guess it wasn't really necessary.

812
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:39,103
You really nailed my taste with this dish.

813
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,504
Oh my.

814
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:43,040
Is your heart fluttering?

815
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:46,243
I think I can hear your pulse.

816
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:50,781
We don't charge for our meals.

817
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:51,916
I'll pay you, though.

818
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,585
No, we don't charge.

819
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:58,222
Or you can slip it to me later.

820
00:40:58,722 --> 00:40:59,857
Slip it to you?

821
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:00,991
But,

822
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:05,095
since you're the first and last guest
to be tasting that dish,

823
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:08,165
we'd like to ask you to name your dish.

824
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:11,368
-Would that really be enough?
-Of course.

825
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:14,438
-We're so happy you enjoyed the food.
-I would like to pay you.

826
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:17,541
You can flip through
and look at the previous dishes.

827
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:18,442
Sure.

828
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:34,124
You're the first guest
to write without any hesitation.

829
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:40,631
You asked me a lot about my job today,
so I thought I'd…

830
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,772
"Fiery passion is sweet."

831
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:54,044
It felt like a dish that encompassed me,
my love for spicy food, and my passion,

832
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:58,883
as well as Chef Choi's
and Sang Hoon's passion.

833
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:01,852
So I decided to call it
"Fiery passion is sweet!"

834
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,456
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

835
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,892
Have you ever seen Case Closed?

836
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,527
Of course I have.

837
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,161
What you just said,

838
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,931
the tone with which you said that is…

839
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,699
-Did I sound like Detective Conan?
-Yes.

840
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:18,102
When he says, "The culprit is you!"

841
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,203
"The culprit is you"?

842
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,105
The culprit is me.

843
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,341
I had such a lovely meal.

844
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,780
Thank you for the food.

845
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,715
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

846
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,985
My belly's bulging.

847
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:40,391
-From the front and sides…
-Please don't say that.

848
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,026
I didn't…

849
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,894
Sabae, you're all right.

850
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,430
Thank you for coming today.

851
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,365
Thank you so much for the meal.

852
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,768
You're such a gentleman.

853
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,204
It's a shame it's only one day,

854
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:57,575
but I'll remember today
with such fondness.

855
00:42:58,976 --> 00:42:59,944
I wish you the best!

856
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,079
I'll see you all again.

857
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,787
"Fiery passion is sweet!"

858
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,392
FIERY PASSION IS SWEET

859
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,371
"Do you know about the bass guitar?"

860
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,007
"It may not stand out,
but you know when it's missing."

861
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:31,442
Rice?

862
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,944
It's a course meal,
so we'll have five or so dishes.

863
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,579
-There's a lot to do.
-Time is short.

864
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,549
Maybe you talked too much…

865
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,451
This is my first ever nosebleed.

866
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:42,753
Hello.

867
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,422
It's a perfect match with the rice.

868
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,925
This course meal is incredible.
