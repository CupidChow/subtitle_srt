1
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:24,724
TODAY'S SCHOOL MEAL!

2
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,501
Your story is served as today's menu in…

3
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,504
The Blank Menu for You.

4
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:40,874
Samchoon.

5
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,409
-How have you been?
-Good.

6
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:46,312
Do you know
what Finger-licking Wednesday is?

7
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,115
Is it a clean-your-plate day?

8
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,287
You got it.

9
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,624
I thought you were going to say,
"Is it when you lick your fingers?"

10
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,926
Remember our school days?

11
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:03,263
The best lunch menus
always showed up on Wednesdays.

12
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,999
My generation brought our own lunches.

13
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:09,936
The old days?

14
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,205
Yes, the old days.

15
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,010
-You said you packed your own lunches.
-Yes.

16
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,679
Then how do you know
about Finger-licking Wednesday?

17
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:23,083
After I graduated from school,

18
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:26,686
the part-time job I had
actually served meals to employees.

19
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,389
And even in university…

20
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:30,890
Cafeteria food!

21
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,792
Campus food.

22
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,061
Cafeteria food?

23
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:36,963
Campus? Cafeteria?

24
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,998
Something around there.

25
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,335
Today's order came in.

26
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:43,369
Yes, indeed.

27
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,372
And it reminded me of my school days.

28
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,775
I'll read it for you.

29
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:52,612
"I'm someone
who takes food very seriously."

30
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:56,082
"Even when I make sure to eat
a hearty breakfast in the morning,

31
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:59,853
by the time the first period starts,
my stomach's already rumbling."

32
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,922
"After sitting through classes
and chatting with friends,

33
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,792
I hear the sound
that gets me super excited."

34
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,461
"The bell signaling lunchtime."

35
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:12,565
"At our school, there's always
a popular, delicious side dish served,

36
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,734
but since many students have to share,

37
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,936
it's not easy to eat as much as you want."

38
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:17,837
"Sad face."

39
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:22,342
"So today, I would really love to enjoy
tasty sides to the fullest."

40
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:26,012
"Chef, please treat me
to your special school meal today."

41
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:29,015
"Ha-ha. Wow. Yum-yum."

42
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,586
Then there's you and me.

43
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,188
Chicken drumsticks.

44
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,456
A frying pan.

45
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,391
They even added some shading.

46
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,226
Great detail,

47
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,495
yet they made you a stick figure.

48
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,130
Do you know Zolaman?

49
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,331
-I do.
-All right.

50
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,833
HYUN-YOUNG

51
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,901
-I'm bald.
-Yes.

52
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,269
CHEF

53
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,804
You're unrealistically smaller
than the chef's toque.

54
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,072
Meaning I'm short?

55
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,774
This guest is something else.

56
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,442
-Well…
-Don't you think?

57
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,343
You're bald.

58
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,250
Now…

59
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,186
Any guesses about today's guest?

60
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,855
-I'll tell you what I think.
-Okay.

61
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,892
This guest really got into
the spirit of our place.

62
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,029
I think they went all in
with their imagination.

63
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,697
So it's not a student?

64
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:18,765
It's a grown-up.

65
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,969
They even made their handwriting
look childlike.

66
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:29,108
So this is an adult
who wants to relive their childhood?

67
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,344
Someone who's nostalgic for school meals.

68
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,749
The thing about school meals
is that they are made in bulk.

69
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:37,850
That's right.

70
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,185
School meal

71
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:43,256
is a world of its own.

72
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:49,963
Cooking pretty food
in a so-called gourmet restaurant,

73
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,764
that's one thing.

74
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,833
And school meal

75
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,437
is another precious world of its own.

76
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,338
Okay.

77
00:03:58,838 --> 00:03:59,772
I'll tell you why.

78
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,774
That order holds

79
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,143
some really great memories.

80
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,846
-So it's a really special kind of food.
-That's it.

81
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,114
YOUR SPECIAL SCHOOL MEAL

82
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,415
A special school meal.

83
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,418
I was wondering what special meal to make.

84
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,153
Maybe

85
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,623
a Western-style school meal platter?

86
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,192
This menu still sticks in my memory.

87
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,526
-Spaghetti?
-Yes.

88
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,861
-And pasta too.
-Awesome.

89
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,764
Everyday food is great, yes,

90
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,300
but switching things up like this

91
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,738
makes eating so much more fun.

92
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,107
Let's leave Korean food out this time.

93
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,042
So, a traditional Western course?

94
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,844
-Not exactly traditional.
-Okay.

95
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,445
But it will be proper Western.

96
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,414
-PW?
-PW.

97
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,449
We're going PW today.

98
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:44,350
Password?

99
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,453
THE BLANK MENU FOR YOU

100
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,856
TODAY'S MENU

101
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:53,059
FEAT. ROOKIE OF SCHOOL MEALS

102
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,627
So…

103
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,431
What's on today's menu?

104
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,933
Today's menu…

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,469
Can you please catch that one?

106
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,538
-Catch what?
-That was an impersonation.

107
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,241
What's on today's menu?

108
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,285
-Who is that?
-You really don't get it?

109
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,286
No.

110
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,722
What's on today's menu?

111
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,024
Bugs Bunny?

112
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,859
I can't…

113
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,062
-Did you not watch the show?
-Which show?

114
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,030
The one you appeared in.

115
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:31,964
I did?

116
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,204
Anyway…

117
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,407
Shall we write down today's menu?

118
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,344
Let's fill up the tray
and see what we'll be making today.

119
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,244
Cool.

120
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,446
First up…

121
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,583
-Rice goes here.
-Rice.

122
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,853
Rice and beef Stroganoff together.

123
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,455
-I've never heard of it.
-Yeah?

124
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,623
-Beef Stroganoff?
-Yes.

125
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,226
This is a Russian dish.

126
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:04,297
This dish works great

127
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,334
spooned over rice
and mixed together like curry.

128
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,404
-Is it kind of like stew?
-You could say that.

129
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,439
-And?
-And…

130
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,907
EGG, BUTTON MUSHROOM, BACON

131
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,309
Eggs en cocotte.

132
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,343
Eggs en cocotte.

133
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,246
I find all of these dishes unfamiliar.

134
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,351
You bake the eggs in a water bath
until they are just softly set.

135
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,487
-I love soft-set eggs.
-Yes.

136
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,890
Then, you pour the sauce on the eggs.

137
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:31,791
Okay.

138
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:35,728
You scoop up the soft-baked eggs
with sauce using a spoon.

139
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:37,497
That sounds delicious.

140
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:41,734
We're making fish and chips too,
but we'll be using flounder.

141
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,238
Why are you going with flounder?

142
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:48,307
Because it is tender and delicious.

143
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:54,914
As for the sides,
we're preparing grated carrot salad.

144
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,483
To be served with unlimited refills.

145
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,153
CARROT, BLUEBERRY, ORANGE

146
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,954
It says, "Well, almost unlimited."

147
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,556
Almost unlimited refills.

148
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,491
We want the guest to feel at ease,

149
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,061
so it's another way
of saying we'll serve generous portions.

150
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,463
-Sure.
-Unlimited refills.

151
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,899
Then there's dessert.

152
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:13,900
Dessert!

153
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,902
Do you know fruit jelly?

154
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,370
Fruit jelly!

155
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,206
You can serve various flavors in a basket

156
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,408
so the guest can pick one for themselves.

157
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,477
-All right.
-Done.

158
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,512
Now this looks like…

159
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,215
-A perfect school meal.
-It's complete.

160
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,349
TODAY'S SCHOOL MEAL!

161
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,752
-Do you think the guest will enjoy it?
-Very much.

162
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,021
-Shall we get started?
-Yes, let's go.

163
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,090
-I'll make grated carrot salad.
-Sounds good.

164
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,127
-Let's cut the carrot first.
-Okay.

165
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,130
If the pieces are too long,

166
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,399
it'd be tricky to eat.

167
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,868
-That looks good.
-This long?

168
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,079
When I was in school,

169
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,949
grated carrot salad was never on the menu.

170
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,852
They usually served pickles.

171
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,920
Menus change with the times, that's why.

172
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,292
Nowadays, they even serve malatang.

173
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,497
-I guess they keep changing.
-I see.

174
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,901
These need to be pickled first.

175
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,136
Sugar.

176
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,772
ROASTED SALT

177
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,673
Salt.

178
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,510
-I'll mix them now.
-Sure.

179
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,379
Think about how we prepare cabbage
when we make kimchi.

180
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,114
-We pickle it.
-Right.

181
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,048
It's like that.

182
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,317
We're wilting the carrots a bit.

183
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,922
When you sprinkle sugar and salt,
it draws out moisture.

184
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,123
Okay.

185
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,392
You'll see carrot juice
collecting at the bottom.

186
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,594
-The juice tastes amazing too.
-I bet it would.

187
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,397
I used to watch my mom do it,

188
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,267
but this is the first time
I'm getting hands-on myself.

189
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,869
Gloves are common these days,

190
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,738
but you'll hear chefs say

191
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,441
it's best to feel the ingredients
with your bare hands.

192
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,976
-To understand them?
-Right.

193
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:06,612
That looks good.

194
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,481
Time to make the sauce now.

195
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,019
Mustard.

196
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,556
Wine vinegar.

197
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,157
It's white wine vinegar.

198
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,228
OLIVE OIL

199
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,129
In one go.

200
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,765
Give it a good, slow stir.

201
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,835
Some zest from a well-washed orange.

202
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,604
Orange zest?

203
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,410
Remember,

204
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:40,212
the white part of the peel is bitter.

205
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,248
-So just the outer layer?
-Yes.

206
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,456
-Give it a good stir now.
-Okay.

207
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,662
As for what's left of it,

208
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,799
we'll use just the pulp.

209
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,319
-Add some sugar.
-Okay.

210
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,788
PEPPER

211
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,490
And then…

212
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:26,859
SALT

213
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,097
-Look.
-Yes?

214
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,900
It's been about ten minutes,
so let's strain the juice now.

215
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,801
Okay.

216
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,305
Don't squeeze too hard,
just enough to keep a little moisture in.

217
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,206
All right.

218
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,983
-Pour it in here.
-Okay.

219
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,121
There.

220
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:56,656
Blueberries.

221
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,524
DRIED BLUEBERRIES SOAKED IN WATER

222
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,425
Next,

223
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:00,926
orange.

224
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,132
I'm going to add lemon juice as well.

225
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,804
And finally, the sauce.

226
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:27,219
We'll be sprinkling
some parsley at the end,

227
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,955
but let's add a little now
to bring out the aroma.

228
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:30,856
Okay.

229
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:32,625
So pretty.

230
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:35,928
We've added vinegar,

231
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:40,399
so if we put in the leafy greens early,

232
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,136
they will lose their color
and turn dull and dark.

233
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,037
So for now,

234
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:48,107
we're adding just a small amount
for its aroma.

235
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,008
Got it.

236
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,676
-Why don't you try it?
-Okay.

237
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:57,116
The carrots are not totally raw,
just gently pickled,

238
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,719
and the orange aroma kicks in.

239
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,087
It's good!

240
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,056
Let it sit for a bit,
and it gets even better.

241
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,392
-They blend naturally.
-Okay.

242
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,328
-Let's put this in the fridge.
-Okay.

243
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,330
HOT BEEF STROGANOFF

244
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,600
The next dish has a difficult name.

245
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,001
Beef Graffstuchino.

246
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,738
Stroganoff.

247
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,673
-Beef Stroganoff?
-Yes.

248
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,674
Let's get to it.

249
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,210
I will separate…

250
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,346
all the layers.

251
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,855
Aren't you curious
why I'm going through all this trouble?

252
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,590
-As a matter of fact, yes.
-Right?

253
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,358
"Is he going to chop them?"

254
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,560
"Or boil them as they are?"

255
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,162
That's what I'm wondering.

256
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:46,098
It's so I can cut them like this.

257
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,002
I didn't chop them because…

258
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,506
-They'd look messy?
-Then they'd all look different.

259
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,841
That's why I cut them one by one.

260
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,778
Button mushrooms.

261
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:03,783
Samchoon,

262
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,019
do you also drink
the mushroom juice after grilling?

263
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,757
I heard this over and over
when I was growing up.

264
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,425
"All the good stuff is in the juice."

265
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,795
Yeah, they say, "You have to drink it."

266
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,530
"Never throw the juice away."

267
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:20,866
But actually,
over 70% of a mushroom is water.

268
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,835
This is all water.

269
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,471
-So…
-So it's just a ritual.

270
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,739
-That's right.
-Right?

271
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,809
No special meaning behind it.

272
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,385
We have some tenderloin here.

273
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,992
Across the grain.

274
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,764
We want thick cuts.

275
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:11,917
These need to be seasoned a bit.

276
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:21,093
SEASON THE MEAT
WITH BAMBOO SALT AND PEPPER

277
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,632
We'll let this rest for a while.

278
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,633
Okay.

279
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,534
Now.

280
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,836
Butter.

281
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,304
That's a lot of butter.

282
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,573
This is actually a bit…

283
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,946
Once the aroma comes up,

284
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,147
add the meat.

285
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,050
-Looks tasty! Oh my God!
-Gently stir it.

286
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,352
Be cautious.

287
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,930
What we want is just to brown the surface.

288
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,474
Amazing.

289
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,511
Doesn't it take some skill
to cook this much at once?

290
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,147
Give the ingredients some time to heat up.

291
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,185
And make sure
to control the heat carefully.

292
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,086
Okay.

293
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,265
This is cream.

294
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,035
HEAVY CREAM

295
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,206
And just a bit of this.

296
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,274
SOUR CREAM

297
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,943
We'll add the mustard in later.

298
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,016
BAMBOO SALT

299
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,085
PEPPER

300
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:56,255
We're not seasoning it all the way.
Just a light touch for now.

301
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,257
-Enter mustard.
-Okay.

302
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,762
MUSTARD

303
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,021
This level of doneness
for the meat and onions

304
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,524
is not a bad choice at all.

305
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:33,425
Onions.

306
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,128
Too salty?

307
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,531
That's what I was aiming for.

308
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,269
Cream is best when reduced.

309
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,739
-It's so delicious.
-Reduced cream.

310
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,075
-It tastes quite different, doesn't it?
-Yes.

311
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:53,946
If this showed up on a lunch tray,
it'd be a huge hit.

312
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,550
Some might take a bite and go,
"What is this?!"

313
00:16:58,617 --> 00:16:59,952
Because it's unusual.

314
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,320
To them,

315
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,156
just say, "It is what it is!"

316
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,425
"What is this?!"

317
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,559
"It is what it is!"

318
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,162
-Like a fun little back-and-forth.
-Yeah.

319
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,967
We'll heat this up later
and serve it as a meat dish.

320
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,504
Next on the menu is eggs en cocotte.

321
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,707
What does "cocotte" mean?

322
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,643
This bowl is what we call a cocotte.

323
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,179
Eggs en cocotte.

324
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,247
We coat the inside…

325
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,086
with butter.

326
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,622
Is it to keep eggs from sticking?

327
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:37,890
That's right.

328
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,359
And the butter adds great flavor too.

329
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,229
Pepper.

330
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,974
-See that?
-Yes.

331
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,177
-Then we add cream.
-Okay.

332
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,080
HEAVY CREAM

333
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,815
We'll steam it now

334
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,484
and add the sauce afterward.

335
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:27,873
And now…

336
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,808
-Now we make the sauce.
-The sauce.

337
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,410
-For the cocotte.
-Yes.

338
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,682
-Cook it gently, will you?
-No problem.

339
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,069
Now that the garlic's in,

340
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,305
please stir gently
to keep it from burning.

341
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,546
Isn't it fun how the aroma changes
with every new ingredient?

342
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:08,680
Very.

343
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,483
It already smelled great,
but with the garlic in,

344
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,885
it just got even better.

345
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,688
-Right about now.
-Yes.

346
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,058
Add the cream and simmer it.

347
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,361
It looks amazing.

348
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,733
-We simmer it.
-Yes.

349
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,334
-Give it some time.
-Season it.

350
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:33,372
Then we taste it, and for one last time…

351
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,573
-We simmer it.
-Yes.

352
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,643
We'll finish this sauce

353
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,312
and pour it over the eggs
we steamed earlier.

354
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,816
Then, you scoop up the bacon and mushrooms

355
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,885
together with the egg and enjoy.

356
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:48,987
No way.

357
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,455
With a piece of carrot on top.

358
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,791
-Yes, with the sides.
-All in one spoon.

359
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,662
-Give this a taste too.
-Sure.

360
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,801
-We have to know how it tastes.
-All right.

361
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,806
Let's check
if it needs more salt or pepper.

362
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,707
Let's see.

363
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:25,591
With the bacon and mushrooms,
it will get even more savory.

364
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,460
-Does it need anything else?
-Sorry?

365
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,495
It's perfect.

366
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,297
-I think we're good now.
-Okay.

367
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,735
I want to stop the time right now.

368
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:37,869
No, you can't.

369
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,207
I want to be the only person who can move.

370
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,475
Yeah?

371
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,910
So I can eat all of this.

372
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,914
Share it with me.

373
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,115
-Should I?
-Yes.

374
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,984
I'd have to cook it all over again.

375
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,555
But it's just that good.

376
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,558
We'll warm this up later
and spoon it over the egg.

377
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,961
Do you think
I could make this sauce at home?

378
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:04,863
If you think about it…

379
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,931
I mean, look.

380
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,934
Cream-based sauces like this
are very simple to make.

381
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,469
Sauté the ingredients.

382
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:14,673
Add aromatics if you like,
and stir gently to keep from burning.

383
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,810
Simmer and reduce with butter and cream.
Season with salt and pepper.

384
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,213
-Step by step.
-That's it.

385
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:22,981
If you sum it up,

386
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,117
it's a really simple recipe.

387
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,952
-I'm going to give it a try.
-Great.

388
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,355
-Fish and chips.
-Yes.

389
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:32,591
Please shake it.

390
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:33,492
WEAK FLOUR

391
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,400
STARCH

392
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,102
-This is baking powder.
-All right.

393
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,306
Mix a bit of this into the batter.

394
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,206
Okay.

395
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:51,877
That way, the fried food stays crispy
even after some time.

396
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,013
-So the crispiness is the key.
-Yes.

397
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,048
BAKING POWDER

398
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:06,058
ADD SALT, WATER, AND OLIVE OIL
TO THE BATTER MIX

399
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:11,263
For fish and chips,
you have to season the batter itself.

400
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,298
-The batter?
-Yes.

401
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,668
OLIVE OIL

402
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:24,543
We're going to add garlic and chili powder
to olive oil to infuse some flavor.

403
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,178
After that,

404
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,747
we'll grind the mix.

405
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,515
Yes.

406
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,722
-We have to hurry.
-Okay.

407
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,857
Or the chili powder will burn.

408
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,960
-There. That's right.
-Speed is what counts.

409
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,403
Make sure the garlic is nicely ground.

410
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,171
SUGAR

411
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,007
-Dried shrimp.
-Yes, put them in.

412
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:57,976
And then…

413
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:00,979
NAM PLA

414
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,182
This scent will probably
remind you of Southeast Asia.

415
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,753
All this flavor and aroma
is going straight into the batter.

416
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,123
Grind it once more to make it smooth.

417
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,501
We've made a paste.

418
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,568
Check its scent.

419
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,606
-Shrimp.
-It's just perfect.

420
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:28,507
And some

421
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:30,475
fish sauce.

422
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,090
See the color?

423
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,692
-It looks tastier.
-It does.

424
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:55,934
FLOUNDER

425
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,238
There are some bones left.

426
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,174
Why is that?

427
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,309
It's just careless prep.

428
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,147
If you want your food

429
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,716
to be enjoyable,

430
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:16,054
just leave out anything
you wouldn't enjoy when you eat it.

431
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:21,660
You don't like bones in your fish?

432
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:25,063
Then make sure to remove them
when you're cooking.

433
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,798
Yes.

434
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,701
-So just add what you like, right?
-Exactly.

435
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,170
I've noticed people tend to enjoy dishes

436
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:36,308
that leave out the things
I've personally found off-putting.

437
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:40,812
Because if I don't like something,
others probably don't either.

438
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,722
THE BLANK MENU FOR YOU

439
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:58,723
Is it here?

440
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,576
Hello.

441
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,045
Hi there!

442
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,715
-Welcome!
-Good to see you.

443
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,417
Hello.

444
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:26,751
Hello.

445
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,420
Hi.

446
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,799
That was not at all
who I expected to walk in.

447
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,470
She's grown so much already.

448
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,007
I guess the time really slipped by.

449
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:53,712
OUR SEVENTEENTH GUEST
PARK SOI

450
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,780
Yes, it's great to have you here.

451
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:57,882
Here.

452
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,818
A blanket for you.

453
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,019
Thank you.

454
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:05,423
-Hi, Chef.
-Yes, hello.

455
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:09,861
I'm Park Soi,
and I'm number 12 in grade 1, class 1.

456
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,031
Are you in high school?

457
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,633
Grade 1 in middle school.

458
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,939
Please give me a second.

459
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,274
TO THE GIRL WITH THE SWEETEST EYES
YOU DESERVE 100 TREATS

460
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,876
CAN'T WAIT FOR THE DAY WE MEET ON A SET

461
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,915
Let me check your order first.

462
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:31,816
Okay.

463
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,986
Are you the one
who takes food very seriously?

464
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:35,887
That's me.

465
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,324
You make sure to eat your breakfast
in the morning,

466
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,726
but your stomach already rumbles

467
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,029
by the time the first period starts.

468
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,065
And your favorite time of day
is lunchtime.

469
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:52,470
Chef Choi has prepared for you today
a special school meal.

470
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,007
You left some drawings on the order.

471
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,046
Do you like to draw?

472
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:04,716
I only draw sometimes.
Stick figures, mostly.

473
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:05,784
I thought so.

474
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,953
I noticed Samchoon is bald
in your drawing.

475
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,023
I wonder why.
I've got a full head of hair, you know.

476
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,026
I just don't know how to draw hair.

477
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,462
It's a remarkable drawing.

478
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,464
-Thank you.
-Thank you for the drawing.

479
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,233
Your order slip

480
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:26,604
really showed how serious you are
about school meals.

481
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,873
I'm also serious about school meals.

482
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:33,878
I always waited for school lunches
with a serious heart.

483
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:37,282
I really looked forward to it
every single morning.

484
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,184
So today,

485
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:42,987
I made this meal
with that same feeling in mind,

486
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,691
remembering how happy I felt
when I finally got to eat.

487
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,960
The food might be new to you,

488
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,729
so take your time.

489
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:52,263
You don't have to eat it all.

490
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,066
I'm so excited.

491
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,137
Did you see this?

492
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,272
-Is this today's…
-Yes.

493
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,608
It's today's menu.

494
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:04,676
TODAY'S SCHOOL MEAL!

495
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,144
DESSERT: YUM-YUM FRUIT JELLY

496
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,979
DEAR STUDENTS: EAT HAPPY, EAT WELL!

497
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,647
Did you draw this?

498
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,884
I wouldn't really call it a drawing.

499
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,753
It's more like a scribble.

500
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,155
Yes.

501
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,056
This rice

502
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,159
is sprouted brown rice.

503
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,295
Do you prefer white rice?

504
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:27,232
At home, we usually eat brown rice.

505
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:28,433
You eat brown rice?

506
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,667
-Yes.
-That's great.

507
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,239
Is there any food you don't like?

508
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,276
I don't like mint chocolate.

509
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:39,677
-Mint chocolate?
-Yes.

510
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:42,781
Nani ga suki?

511
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,783
Sorry?

512
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,723
I shouldn't have…

513
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,831
I thought everyone knew the…

514
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,701
When she mentioned mint chocolate,

515
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:07,038
I caught a glimpse of a smile on her face.

516
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:10,108
So I thought, "That's my cue."

517
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:14,479
I took that as a signal to say
what popped into my head

518
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:15,680
and just ran with it.

519
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:17,382
Nani ga suki?

520
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,085
I realized that

521
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,488
it's a popular meme.

522
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,092
I figured he's pretty up-to-date
with what's trending.

523
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,470
It's almost ready.

524
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,710
Do you find it fun?

525
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,246
You find me fun?

526
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:22,847
Are you asking if I'm fun?

527
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,616
Is it fun working here?

528
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:25,516
Working here?

529
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,051
It's super fun.

530
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,287
It looks fun.

531
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,089
Yes, it is.

532
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:32,690
And Samchoon here…

533
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:33,591
He's…

534
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,860
He's very delicate.

535
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:36,761
Sorry?

536
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:38,830
He's delicate.

537
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,666
He's a sweet man.

538
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,601
You can serve the whole tray.

539
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,945
Here's your school meal.

540
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,346
Thank you.

541
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,482
Enjoy.

542
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,041
Back in the day, at school,

543
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,645
we were given a choice
between Korean and Western food.

544
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,947
And I still remember

545
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,517
how excited I'd get
whenever they served Western dishes

546
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,252
since they didn't come around often.

547
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,587
I see.

548
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,656
So I've prepared a Western-style meal.

549
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,194
When you're holding a lunch tray,

550
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,130
it's hard not to get greedy.

551
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,933
You just want to pile on more than usual.

552
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,135
So I went ahead and piled it on.

553
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:26,137
-Thank you.
-Not at all.

554
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,742
This is sprouted brown rice
with butter mixed in.

555
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,443
And instead of soup,

556
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,647
that creamy dish over there
made with beef tenderloin is called…

557
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:38,716
Well, it's a Russian dish.

558
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:42,153
You might notice a bit of tang.
That's from the mustard.

559
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,689
You can mix it with your rice,

560
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,958
put it on top, or just eat it on its own.

561
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:49,694
This one here is fried fish.

562
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,496
It's called fish and chips.

563
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:53,631
I fried the flounder
and made it nice and crispy.

564
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,899
The seasoning

565
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,869
is a bit on the salty side.

566
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:00,271
-So we'll serve you a dipping sauce.
-Here.

567
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:04,008
It's actually vinegar.
It will give it a whole different flavor.

568
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:06,210
Try dipping just a little.

569
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:09,347
That one is great for snacking on
like a side dish.

570
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:10,948
Grated carrot salad.

571
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,852
It's made with oranges and blueberries.

572
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,523
You can scoop up a big bite
or just enjoy a little at a time.

573
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:19,891
Next.

574
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:24,128
You can't have a school meal
without an egg dish, right?

575
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,298
I steamed some eggs for the base
and poured

576
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,234
bacon and button mushroom sauce on top.

577
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:33,037
Give everything a little taste first,

578
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,372
then dig in all you want.

579
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,273
Okay.

580
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,743
I'm a rookie of school meals.

581
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,947
I'll leave you to it.

582
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,225
Looks tasty.

583
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:56,561
Please enjoy.

584
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,731
Thank you for the great meal.

585
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:34,232
This is…

586
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,469
"This is too sour." Is that it?

587
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:40,204
It is sour,

588
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,507
but it tastes so good.

589
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,844
The salad might taste unfamiliar,

590
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:49,247
but once you get used to
its natural taste,

591
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,782
it's actually really nice as a side dish.

592
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:55,953
Have you had grated carrot salad before?

593
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,322
No, this is my first time.

594
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,559
This one has oranges in it.

595
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,730
I'm trying so many new things today,

596
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,131
and they're all delicious.

597
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,065
Really?

598
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:18,276
They are delicious.

599
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:24,148
Can you tell me what the yellow thing is?

600
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:25,416
That's egg yolk.

601
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,618
-Yolk?
-It's egg.

602
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,922
You eat it by scooping the egg.

603
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:34,792
It will give a slightly complex feeling
in your mouth.

604
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,609
Can you eat chili peppers?

605
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:56,280
I've tried dipping mild chili peppers
in ssamjang many times.

606
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,749
I'm not sure if I can eat this kind.

607
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,820
Shishito peppers can be a bit of a gamble.

608
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:04,822
Some aren't spicy at all.

609
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,092
That's why it's hard to recommend them.

610
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:13,197
If you feel nervous,
it's totally okay to set them aside.

611
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,098
So,

612
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:17,501
some are spicy and some aren't?

613
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,569
That's right.

614
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,105
Angry person…

615
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:26,210
Angry person.

616
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:27,612
-Good person.
-Good person.

617
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,347
-Sad person.
-Happy person.

618
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:33,784
Even vegetables have
their own personalities too.

619
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,055
I kinda want to try it, but I'm not sure.

620
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:39,557
Give it a try.

621
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,893
Try nibbling just the end first.
See how it goes.

622
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,800
Shishito peppers taste really good
when they're fried.

623
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,004
Don't eat the whole thing at once.

624
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:54,639
Take your time.

625
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,215
I think I picked the mild one.

626
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,051
Looks like the one you picked

627
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,387
is a mild little shishito.

628
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:14,258
You might find an angry shishito
in the bunch.

629
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,206
The fish tastes great.

630
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,108
It's really crispy.

631
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,679
I think that's why it's so good.

632
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:36,681
When we fry stuff in this restaurant,

633
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,716
the crispiness…

634
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,651
-Lasts longer?
-It's three times crispier.

635
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:41,552
Three times?

636
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:45,690
It lasts three times longer.

637
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,224
So, three stars?

638
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,327
-Five stars.
-Five?

639
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:50,961
Like the Jacksons.

640
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,229
Three times.

641
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:55,666
BARLEY VINEGAR

642
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:00,571
I thought vinegar wouldn't go well,

643
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,506
but it tastes really good together.

644
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:10,081
When you said you'd use vinegar
as a sauce earlier,

645
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:13,184
I was wondering
if it would really go well.

646
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,653
-But is it good?
-It's really good.

647
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:23,361
Do you think these dishes would be popular
if they showed up in school lunch?

648
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,296
They would be super popular.

649
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,566
These are foods we really love.

650
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,869
They all taste amazing.

651
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:35,306
I keep wondering what I should eat next.

652
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:39,443
So that's why you're thinking
before every bite, huh?

653
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,511
Yes!

654
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,446
It's always exciting to eat.

655
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,916
I thought this was pasta

656
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,719
when you were scooping it up earlier,

657
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,321
but it's carrot.

658
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,356
At first…

659
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:59,130
everyone just takes a tiny bit
to see how it tastes.

660
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:00,464
And if it hits the spot,

661
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,333
they keep grabbing more.

662
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,601
That's what I'm doing.

663
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:05,736
They grab more and more.

664
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:09,373
Yes, I noticed her picking up
one little strand at first.

665
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,575
But now, she's picked up…

666
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,677
-This much.
-Right.

667
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:23,421
-You've entered middle school this year.
-Yes.

668
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:27,558
What are some big changes
from when you were in elementary school?

669
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,695
The biggest change
is wearing a school uniform.

670
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:35,766
It felt weird at first
because everyone looked the same,

671
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,102
but now I actually love it.

672
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:41,572
Did you look forward to wearing one?

673
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,973
Yes, I did.

674
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:46,811
The night before school started,
I kept thinking,

675
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:50,347
"How do I even wear a uniform?
What if I do something wrong?"

676
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,516
-I couldn't sleep.
-Oh dear.

677
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,051
And I usually sleep well.

678
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,522
I can't really recall those days anymore.

679
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,491
What about you?

680
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,527
On the very first day,

681
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,096
I ruined my uniform in the wash,

682
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:07,932
and the color totally faded.

683
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,067
-It turned purple.
-Oh my.

684
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,136
I had to wear it for three whole years.

685
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:14,371
-So you were Tinky Winky?
-Yes.

686
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,440
My blazer turned all purple.

687
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,743
I remember wearing that.

688
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,612
-What a bummer.
-I washed it wrong.

689
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,615
-On your first day?
-Yes.

690
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,152
For me, well…

691
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,487
In the "old days,"

692
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,490
we had this thing called CA.

693
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:35,025
-Is it still a thing? Club Activity?
-Yes.

694
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,463
It's basically time for doing club things.

695
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,600
-We also do peer counseling.
-Peer counseling?

696
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,668
We may not be peers,

697
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,838
but can I ask you for some advice?

698
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:48,973
Yes, sure.

699
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,708
Speak casually?

700
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:52,610
If you'd like.

701
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:54,645
Sure.

702
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:59,383
Soi, I need your help with something.

703
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:05,389
I have 524 unread messages
just sitting on my phone.

704
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,526
What should I do?

705
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:12,463
It's giving me a headache.

706
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:19,336
If it's something
you don't really need to reply to or read,

707
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,739
maybe you can just ignore it.

708
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:24,842
What if I'm not sure if I should read it?

709
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,078
I don't know
what kind of messages they are,

710
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:29,880
but go with whatever feels right.

711
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,483
Whatever feels right?

712
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,252
I appreciate your advice.

713
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,023
I'm going to do just that.

714
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,825
Why haven't you read the 524 messages?

715
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:44,528
I never got around to deleting them.

716
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:45,529
And I thought,

717
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:49,600
"I'll answer them later."
I just kept putting them off.

718
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:52,836
-So you missed the timing.
-You're right.

719
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,772
It can get quite complicated too.

720
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,640
I heard there was "read-and-ignore."

721
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,243
In my case, it's "ignore-without-reading."

722
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,578
"Ignore-without-reading."

723
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:01,579
"Read-and-ignore…"

724
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:04,949
Just pick a day

725
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,184
and empty your inbox.

726
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,153
-Empty it?
-Yes.

727
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:10,754
If it's not urgent, delete it.

728
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:15,192
If they really need to reach you,
they'll text again.

729
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,661
Did you use to be a peer counselor?

730
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,663
I once had 624 unread messages.

731
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:21,565
Yeah.

732
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,636
Do you have any questions?

733
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,006
Hi there.

734
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:31,375
I'm thinking…

735
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:37,014
If I had a time machine,

736
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:38,415
and I could

737
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,685
go back to any time,

738
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,790
I'd want to go back
to my middle school days.

739
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,459
-Why is that?
-Well…

740
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:51,362
I was healthier back then.

741
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:53,764
Healthier?

742
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,499
I think it'd be really fun…

743
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,036
to relive those times.

744
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:02,840
As a peer counselor,

745
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:05,909
what would you say to a friend
who wants to go back to the past?

746
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,946
Well…

747
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:10,681
You can give me harsh advice.

748
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:13,317
"Snap out of it."

749
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,856
We can't really go back to the past,

750
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,425
but we can cherish our memories

751
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,294
and focus on what we want to do now.

752
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,664
What do you think?

753
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:31,935
The right answer.

754
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,938
Let's treasure our memories
and live doing what we want.

755
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:41,845
Your daughter is nine years old,
isn't she?

756
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:44,248
Yes, she's nine.

757
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:45,382
Right?

758
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,251
My younger brother

759
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:50,387
is in fourth grade right now.

760
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:51,522
I see.

761
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,892
Are you two close?

762
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:57,895
I think we get along well.

763
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,563
Are you close with your dad?

764
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,700
Yes, every night before I fall asleep,

765
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:06,637
I get this itch to talk to my dad.

766
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,207
When I'm struggling with studying,
he'll be there to help.

767
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:15,112
He also plays with me
and chats with me all the time.

768
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:18,315
What do you enjoy doing most
with your dad?

769
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,717
Talking about baseball.

770
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:21,885
Baseball? So you like baseball.

771
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,487
Yes, I like baseball.

772
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,456
You two are like best friends.

773
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:27,357
-We are.
-Right?

774
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,995
I have those moments with my daughter too.

775
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,864
We like to wrap up the day

776
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:36,734
by chatting about what happened.

777
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:41,772
It's been fun starting to have
real conversations with her.

778
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:46,410
At first, I used to talk
in that funny baby voice.

779
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:49,847
You know, the kind you use with babies.

780
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,015
-"Who's a little cutie?"
-That's it.

781
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:55,018
As my daughter grew up,

782
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:56,820
it was really fun

783
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,424
noticing how our conversations started
to make more sense.

784
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,360
"Wait, she knows this stuff too?"

785
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:06,730
"Wow, she learned this?"

786
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:10,701
The joy is in watching my child grow.

787
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:14,638
I'm done growing, but she's not.

788
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:20,310
So I enjoy seeing that.

789
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:24,448
"Do I have any wisdom to pass on?"

790
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:27,251
Thinking about that is fun too.

791
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:32,990
I imagine your father might have
similar thoughts too,

792
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:35,993
wondering what kind of things

793
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,796
he can teach his daughter.

794
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:46,904
So, how was today's special school meal?

795
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:52,342
These were all new to me,
but they were so good I was surprised.

796
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,413
I think I'll remember for a long time.

797
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,183
Usually,

798
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:03,053
there's a main dish
in every school meal, right?

799
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,021
The main menu.

800
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,790
Please pick which one you think

801
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,693
should be the main dish today.

802
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:26,510
They were all so tasty.

803
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:31,782
I think my friends
would really like this fried dish.

804
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:34,117
The fried fish?

805
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:36,119
And the beef…

806
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,023
Well, everything tasted so good
that I can't choose just one.

807
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:47,197
School meals always have
a bunch of different dishes, right?

808
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,098
But

809
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:50,934
the most special part of today's meal

810
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:55,205
is the person who enjoyed it,

811
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:56,874
and that's you.

812
00:47:58,876 --> 00:47:59,810
You are the star.

813
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:06,516
The real star of any dish
is always the person who eats it.

814
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:08,518
So thank you.

815
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:10,487
Thank you.

816
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:14,157
Instead of charging you for the meal,

817
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:17,327
we ask that you name today's menu.

818
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,797
You'll find many names in here
that other guests came up with,

819
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:22,165
so take a look.

820
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:33,644
Here it is.

821
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:44,988
-Am I supposed to write it here?
-Yes.

822
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:58,502
I did it.

823
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:02,739
Thank you.

824
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:07,978
The last page.

825
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,689
"School Meal Champ."

826
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:26,863
It's a meal that's sure
to win every student's heart,

827
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,833
like the champion of all meals.

828
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,469
So I named it "School Meal Champ."

829
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:36,773
What a proud name
for a meal made by a rookie.

830
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:39,176
Thank you for this.

831
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:46,149
Finally, we prepared a dessert for you.

832
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:51,822
Yum-yum fruit jelly.

833
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:54,257
You can choose

834
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,027
whichever flavor you want.

835
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:58,228
Can I?

836
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:03,066
-I'll take this one.
-All right.

837
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,802
Thank you.

838
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:07,070
One for your brother.

839
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:10,374
For my brother? Well…

840
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,342
And your mom too.

841
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:17,681
-And your dad?
-One for your dad.

842
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:20,150
-Oh, my dad?
-Yes, pick one for your dad.

843
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,486
-The pineapple one, then?
-Can she?

844
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:25,288
Thank you so much.

845
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:26,990
I've got four!

846
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:34,531
-Goodbye.
-Bye!

847
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:36,366
Thank you for coming.

848
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:38,268
-Watch your step.
-There's a step.

849
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:40,771
Have a safe trip home.

850
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:43,373
-Goodbye.
-Take care.

851
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:05,729
"I'd love to share some small dishes
that complement each other."

852
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:08,031
"Hopefully with some cheese I love."

853
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:09,966
-I thought of a kingdom.
-My!

854
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,302
This is the map of Cheese Kingdom.

855
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:15,138
I've picked out
five iconic kinds of cheese.

856
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,240
I bet you've never seen
anything like this.

857
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:18,708
This is pure cheese.

858
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:20,310
A sauce made with just cheese.

859
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:21,812
My goodness, hello!

860
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:22,813
Hi.

861
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:24,281
Thank you so much.

862
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,116
This is art.

863
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:27,050
Chef.

864
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:30,387
That just launched me into the sky.
