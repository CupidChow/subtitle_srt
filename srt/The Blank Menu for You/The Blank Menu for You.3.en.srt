1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,570
THE BLANK MENU FOR YOU

2
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:10,443
I CALL YOUR NAME
THOUGH I KNOW YOU CANNOT HEAR ME

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,845
WHEN NIGHT FALLS…

4
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:37,037
Your story is served as today's menu in…

5
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,040
The Blank Menu for You.

6
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:59,059
The atmosphere's
somewhat different at night.

7
00:00:59,125 --> 00:00:59,959
Indeed.

8
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,195
It's our first-ever dinner service.

9
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,229
Yes, it is.

10
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,432
If you look here,

11
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,034
there's a dinner-specific order.

12
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,036
The order itself…

13
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,205
The order is very colorful.

14
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,908
"These days, I'm so busy gal."

15
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,211
"Chef, please cook me a midnight snack

16
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:22,482
that Paris Hilton or Kim Kardashian
might eat with beer

17
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,484
after a long day's work."

18
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:28,088
"I'm on a keto diet,
so I'd like lots of meat."

19
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,389
"Especially beef."

20
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,591
"And fewer carbs, please."

21
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:32,592
"By the way,

22
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,561
I hate coriander."

23
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:36,930
Cory Ander?

24
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,399
-Is that a person?
-No.

25
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,468
-I don't think so.
-Of course not.

26
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,636
Do you have any thoughts
upon seeing the order?

27
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,438
"Busy gal."

28
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,674
Back in our day,

29
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,710
gal was used to tell someone off.
You'd simply say, "Gal!"

30
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,479
-The character gal meaning scold?
-That's it.

31
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,280
-I'm sorry.
-"I'm so busy gal."

32
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,782
They don't like coriander

33
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,551
and are on a keto diet.

34
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,953
What's a keto diet?

35
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,721
From my understanding,

36
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,690
it's a diet that's low in carbs.

37
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,859
-Fewer carbs.
-And high in protein.

38
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,727
Can you have a lot of protein?

39
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,862
A lot, well…

40
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,897
If I knew that, I wouldn't…

41
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,001
They're on a keto diet
but like late-night snacks.

42
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,936
And in terms of carbs,

43
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,639
it's not a no, but just fewer?

44
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,441
-It's not a no.
-All right, then.

45
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,744
Let's fry jeonbyeong,

46
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,214
but to lower the carbs,
we won't use regular flour.

47
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,682
Buckwheat.

48
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,784
We'll use buckwheat flour.

49
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:32,952
That sounds great.

50
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,154
-How's that?
-Great.

51
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,455
And we'll also add

52
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,824
an indulgent slice of beef.

53
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,461
We'll grill a big piece of beef.

54
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,830
And they can wrap the beef
in the buckwheat jeonbyeong.

55
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,532
Almost like a burrito?

56
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:46,866
Something like that, yes.

57
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,169
-A burrito or a taco?
-Exactly.

58
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,237
We keep wrapping things up.

59
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,805
There'll be a wrap today too.

60
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,508
But today, we won't be doing the wrapping.

61
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:58,811
They'll wrap it for themselves
on the spot.

62
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:00,547
-All right.
-Great.

63
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:01,548
For our busy gal.

64
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,416
-Busy gal.
-Busy gal…

65
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,219
-Here's to another good service.
-Another good service.

66
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,023
-Last service, you earned a star.
-I did.

67
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,225
-You're a barley-sta.
-I'm a barley-sta, yes.

68
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,294
This time, we're making jeonbyeong.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,830
Do you think there's a title
we could make for you?

70
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:18,965
Yes, let's think.

71
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,433
The maker of jeonbyeong.

72
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:22,902
The wrapper of wraps.

73
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,605
The wrapper.

74
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,340
Like a wrap god.

75
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,277
I apologize.

76
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,379
Let's say "wrapster."

77
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,480
Sure.

78
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,015
I actually like jeongbyeong.

79
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,017
-They're like pancakes and crepes.
-Crepes.

80
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,420
-With this swooshy thing.
-Yes.

81
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:43,022
Spreading it real thin on low heat.

82
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,657
-You wait for it to cook.
-Yes.

83
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,859
-Flip it and wait some more.
-Yes.

84
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,194
Then you put it on a plate.

85
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,128
-That process…
-Yes.

86
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:52,332
It is rather emotionally strenuous.

87
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,233
I agree.

88
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,934
Don't lose the emotional battle.

89
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:55,969
-I won't.
-Good.

90
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,671
I'll make a pile of jeonbyeong this high.

91
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,772
-Really?
-Yes.

92
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,040
I'll make tons.

93
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,375
-Great.
-Okay.

94
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,545
Shall we measure out the ingredients?

95
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:09,048
Using just buckwheat flour can work fine,

96
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,783
but let's mix a little regular flour.

97
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,619
-Just a little?
-Yes, we'll do that today.

98
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,088
-150 grams of buckwheat flour.
-150 grams?

99
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,924
-And 50 grams of regular flour.
-Copy that.

100
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,963
I measured out exactly 150 grams.

101
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,099
It seems today will be
a great day for you.

102
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,334
Thank you so much for saying that.

103
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,770
It's pretty much the end of the day,

104
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:34,274
but still, the rest of the evening
could be great.

105
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,809
The night is longer than you'd think.

106
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,344
I love that saying.

107
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,046
-"The night is long."
-Right.

108
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,982
-I'll add 50 grams of this.
-Yes.

109
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,520
Just looking at it,
regular flour looks tastier.

110
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,323
If we don't include any,
our guest won't be satisfied.

111
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,658
Of course.

112
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,494
Keto, shmeto. Flour is still the yummiest.

113
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,063
But the star of the dish
will be the buckwheat.

114
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,164
The buckwheat.

115
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,800
Do we add cooking oil?

116
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,168
We need some oil in there.

117
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,436
That way, the batter…

118
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,840
I wouldn't want to put off our guest,

119
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:11,110
but if they knew all the ingredients,
they might lose their appetite.

120
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:14,080
-Then they should cook for themselves.
-You're right.

121
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,015
-If you order from us…
-Exactly.

122
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,850
-You should trust us.
-Absolutely.

123
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,086
-A little oil won't kill you.
-Of course.

124
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,625
Let me.

125
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,126
Please stir this lightly

126
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,628
so it's textured like cream.

127
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,096
-Okay.
-Thank you.

128
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,498
I think it's actually more fun

129
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,834
teaching someone
than cooking the food myself.

130
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,202
That's true for anything.

131
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,303
-Is that right?
-Yes.

132
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:44,544
BREW A BROTH WITH KELP AND BONITO FLAKES

133
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:53,953
I think it's almost done.

134
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,621
I'll be right over.

135
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,497
KOREAN RICE WINE FOR COOKING

136
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,568
DARK SOY SAUCE

137
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,271
STEWED EGGPLANT SAUCE

138
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,754
-This consistency is good.
-Okay.

139
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,922
Pour a little.

140
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,458
-Then quickly spread it out.
-Okay.

141
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,494
Use your wrist to spread the batter thin.

142
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,395
Right.

143
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,531
-I'll try.
-Good.

144
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,033
You must not fear failure.

145
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,301
I'm well aware.

146
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,203
-And failure's fine.
-Okay.

147
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,872
We can just turn away our guest.

148
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:46,773
Of course.

149
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,644
I'm reminded of something
my mother said to me 20 years ago.

150
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,379
"Don't go to tuition. Quit studying."

151
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,015
"If this is your best, there's no point."

152
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,484
What she meant to say
was failure isn't an option.

153
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,153
So I instinctively knew what Chef meant.

154
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,893
I'm going to make a soup-like sauce.

155
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,794
All righty.

156
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,763
Those are onions.
What's that white broccoli?

157
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,365
They're cauliflower.

158
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,299
I see.

159
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,737
I can't possibly tell you
everything they're good for,

160
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,038
but the internet's your friend.

161
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,140
-A very good friend.
-They know everything.

162
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,110
I believe cauliflower's a superfood.

163
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,244
Is it sold at supermarkets?

164
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:26,646
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,248
No, that was great just now.

166
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,217
That was hilarious.

167
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:38,357
PUT CAULIFLOWER, ONIONS,
AND BUTTER IN THE THERMOMIX

168
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:57,543
Wow.

169
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,480
It's not easy, is it?

170
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,951
-You're okay.
-I'm sorry.

171
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,997
They're turning out like this?

172
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,202
-Why don't you try again?
-Sure.

173
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,037
-There's a first for everything.
-Exactly.

174
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,740
I've got the hang of it now.

175
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,040
I think I need…

176
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,642
-Sorry?
-I need help.

177
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,278
-What's wrong?
-It's too difficult.

178
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:09,682
Let me try.

179
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,086
I'm feeling toasty.

180
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,230
-Let's not fry too many.
-Okay.

181
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,199
Let's just do three.

182
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,100
I love three.

183
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,036
-We'll make three great ones.
-Great.

184
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,171
Oil the pan well.

185
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,208
-Be careful not to burn yourself.
-Right.

186
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,177
Then just pour

187
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,846
this amount of batter, maybe.

188
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,417
Then take it off the fire
and keep swirling the pan.

189
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:45,651
Okay, I'll try that.

190
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,655
It's okay if you mess it up.

191
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,223
We can skip the jeonbyeong.

192
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,026
We could make the wrap
out of instant noodles.

193
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,095
-There's no pressure.
-Okay.

194
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,064
"It's okay to mess up."

195
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,433
"We can turn away our guest."

196
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,668
That's a load of crap.

197
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,537
You never turn away a guest.

198
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,738
They agreed to come.

199
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,975
That would be the opposite of a no-show.

200
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,712
I'm sure he understood what I truly meant.

201
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:12,204
FRY THE EGGPLANT
THEN DUNK IN WATER TO CUT THE GREASE

202
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,174
FOR OUR GUEST WHO'S ON A KETO DIET!

203
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,885
STEW THE EGGPLANT IN THE PREPARED SAUCE

204
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,858
I'll just cover this with foil.

205
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,362
Pierce a few holes.

206
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,899
WRAP THE EGGPLANT IN FOIL
SO THE UNCOVERED PARTS SOAK UP THE SAUCE

207
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,658
Don't you feel accomplished?

208
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,494
I think I do, a little, yes.

209
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,965
This is only your third try,
so you're obviously a natural-born talent.

210
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,566
I'm sure of it.

211
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,903
A wrap god. Thank you.

212
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,505
Jeonbyeong…

213
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,407
"Mom, I made it to the hotline
in just three episodes."

214
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,143
I felt elated.

215
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:03,616
-Samchoon, can you do the thingy?
-Oh, that?

216
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,993
Thank you.

217
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,701
-We're using skirt steak today.
-Right.

218
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,471
I've marinated it

219
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,740
in anchovy sauce.

220
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,876
It's a marriage between the land and sea.

221
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:31,911
I see.

222
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,112
It may not sound it,

223
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,214
but I think it works well.

224
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,558
This grilled meat alone
is probably delicious.

225
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,126
I don't doubt it.

226
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,623
The soupy sauce.

227
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,693
This smells…

228
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,200
You need to taste it for seasoning.

229
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,937
The seasoning is phenomenal.

230
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:08,240
The sauce shouldn't overpower
the beef or the buckwheat wrap

231
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,975
when you dip them.

232
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,914
I think it's about done.

233
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,191
-Is it okay?
-Yes.

234
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,160
Our guest won't sleep tonight.

235
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,663
Their taste buds will be awake all night.

236
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,097
I almost feel bad.

237
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,466
-We only have three jeonbyeong.
-Yes.

238
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,903
I think this brilliant food
could use some embellishing.

239
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,406
-What…
-We could put on a slight show.

240
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,340
Right.

241
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,281
It's a late-night snack after work.

242
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,182
Yes.

243
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,819
Let's create an atmosphere
where they can enjoy that alone time.

244
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,155
Would you like a glass of midnight blues?

245
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,190
-Our busy gal.
-Yes.

246
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,692
How about a glass of solitude?

247
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:00,592
Yes, do that.

248
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,561
The gentleman over there sent this over.

249
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,242
THE BLANK MENU FOR YOU

250
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:20,813
-Was it tough?
-Not at all.

251
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,048
The time just flew by
because I was exhausted.

252
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:23,949
Our wrap god…

253
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,019
Welcome to The Blank Menu for You.

254
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,789
Welcome to The Blank Menu for You.

255
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,658
What's wrong?

256
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,497
Oh dear, did something happen?
Let me take your bag.

257
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,366
-Oh my God.
-Oh my.

258
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,835
I'm so exhausted.

259
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,937
-Has it been a rough day?
-My phone, yeah.

260
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,107
-I'll take your coat too.
-My outer, here. Oh my God.

261
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,450
I nearly crawled into the oven.

262
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,154
It was just a little…

263
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:04,823
I just…

264
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,658
I couldn't bear to watch.

265
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:08,927
Was it just me?

266
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:14,500
OUR THIRD GUEST
GABEE

267
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,169
Oh my God. You know me!

268
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,238
-Do you speak…
-You know me, don't you?

269
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,539
-Right.
-House Manager Moon!

270
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,908
Yes, I apologize, ma'am.

271
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,945
-Please take a seat here.
-I'm so exhausted.

272
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,181
We'll be ready shortly.

273
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,684
Oh my God, Chef Choi, hi!

274
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,253
Long time no see.

275
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,220
Wait, I just…

276
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,922
I missed you so much.

277
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,490
Can you look at me?

278
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,325
Yeah, hi!

279
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,827
-Here's a blanket.
-Thank you.

280
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,001
In case your hands are cold,

281
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,070
here's a warm towelette.

282
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,137
Thank you.

283
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,441
You haven't changed a bit,
House Manager Moon.

284
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,708
So great at your job.

285
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,910
I trust you've been well?

286
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:58,911
Sure.

287
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,479
I'm gonna tip you later.

288
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,448
You're doing great today.

289
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,883
-Thank you.
-It's nice and warm.

290
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,151
Love this towelette.

291
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,886
Let me go over your order.

292
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,254
Would you be "busy gal"?

293
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,255
Busy girl.

294
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,790
-Busy gal.
-No, girl.

295
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,025
-Oh, busy girl.
-Yeah.

296
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,160
I'm a busy girl. So busy.

297
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,795
Lately, oh my God.

298
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,998
I'm so busy
that I can't even think straight.

299
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,266
It seems so.

300
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,669
You asked for a late-night snack

301
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:27,239
that Paris Hilton or Kim Kardashian
may eat after work.

302
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:31,677
And so we've prepared a dish
to pair with a fresh lager for you.

303
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,412
Are you sure that's my order?

304
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,680
Yes.

305
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:35,581
Show it to me.

306
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,715
Here it is.

307
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,517
Then I guess it is!

308
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,452
House Manager Moon,
you'd never make a mistake!

309
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,487
I love you, Moon.

310
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:42,988
-Thank you.
-So much.

311
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:43,922
I love you too.

312
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:45,924
You know that you're cute, right?

313
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,494
Where are you from?

314
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,429
Oh my God.
Why are you acting like a stranger?

315
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,064
You've been my house manager

316
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,632
since I was three.

317
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:54,566
Right, I was.

318
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,635
I was her butler.

319
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,037
House Manager!

320
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,507
If Gabee calls for me like so,

321
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,909
I need to be smooth and go with the flow.

322
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,979
That way, the conversation
will enrich, deepen, and grow funnier.

323
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,549
But my legs were trembling
because I felt so drained.

324
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,151
I felt a little queasy.

325
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,653
Yeah, he's my butler.

326
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,854
And Chef Choi!

327
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,489
-Oh my God.
-Yes, hello.

328
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,091
How have you been, Chef Choi?

329
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,693
I missed you so much.

330
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,263
I'm so… It's a pleasure to meet you.

331
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,932
Why are you acting like we just met?

332
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,568
You've been my private chef
for a long time.

333
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,742
While Samchoon was a chef at Ms. Gabee's,

334
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,076
a pan fell on his head.

335
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,478
Oh my God, yes!

336
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:40,946
-Since then, he can't remember…
-Yes.

337
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,848
You need to call him Samchoon.

338
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,552
I'll call you Samchoon, then.
How's your head where the pan hit you?

339
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,487
He's been wearing hats ever since.

340
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,490
Oh dear, yes.
I'd totally forgotten about that.

341
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,893
Well, then, if we slowly start…

342
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,061
But why were you crying?

343
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,497
Because today's been so rough.

344
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,399
I worked so hard today.

345
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,468
I cried because I'm so exhausted.

346
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,904
I need some food
that will lift my spirits.

347
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,349
-Here's your beer.
-Thank you.

348
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,961
Oh my God, I love it.

349
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,362
Wow.

350
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,870
-Are you both okay?
-Yes.

351
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,272
I won't do the Queen Gabee thing.

352
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,241
No, please keep it going.

353
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,508
We love Queen Gabee.

354
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,876
I'll come back to Gabee.

355
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,311
These are our happy faces.

356
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,448
-I'm ecstatic.
-Are you okay?

357
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,416
I'm a huge fan of yours.

358
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:52,618
-We've waited all day.
-Yes.

359
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:53,752
-Really?
-For our busy gal.

360
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,520
-So we've been…
-Busy girl, yeah.

361
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,056
As our queen is on a keto diet…

362
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,225
-Yes, I am.
-We've paid extra attention.

363
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,628
-Easy on the carbs.
-Yes.

364
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,964
And easy on the sugar.
But I can't say no to beer.

365
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:06,932
-Right.
-You get me?

366
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:47,873
Wow.

367
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:48,974
This looks great.

368
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,427
Oh my God, love it.

369
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,162
For our keto dieter,

370
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,332
we used not just regular flour
but also buckwheat flour

371
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,866
in this jeonbyeong.

372
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,369
And we heard you liked meat.

373
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,938
So this dish is for you
to enjoy your own company

374
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,107
after a long day's work.

375
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,108
Perfect.

376
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,377
I think it would be best

377
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,312
if you took the tasty jeonbyeong
and wrapped it.

378
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,213
Thank you.

379
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,915
And no one's watching,

380
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:34,286
so please try the soup,
which may or may not be high in calories,

381
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,054
with that spoon there.

382
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,223
I should dip and also drink it?

383
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,391
-Yes, dip it.
-Got it.

384
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,993
-And also scoop it with a spoon.
-Thank you so much.

385
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,295
The beef is skirt steak.

386
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,396
-Oh!
-Skirt steak.

387
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,331
-Skirt?
-Skirt.

388
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,700
Can you give me some tissues, please?

389
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,435
-Tissue.
-Yes, tissue manager.

390
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,771
My house manager
is really like working well.

391
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:53,672
Tissue manager.

392
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:54,973
Yes, tissue manager.

393
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,042
House Manager Moon, love you!

394
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:58,677
Love you too.

395
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,347
Thank you so much for the food.

396
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,149
-One second!
-Yes?

397
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,618
To welcome Queen Gabee
to our restaurant today,

398
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,487
we've prepared a special something.

399
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:10,322
What?

400
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,457
Samchoon?

401
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:19,831
What?

402
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:23,869
Please start the show.

403
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:27,005
Are you going to sing
"Happy Birthday to You"?

404
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:27,973
-No?
-Right.

405
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,810
Happy end-of-the-workday to you

406
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,613
Today was so rough.

407
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,516
So what's the special something?

408
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,485
Please think that you're eating
in the comfort of your own home,

409
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,188
as you're watching something, maybe.

410
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,924
-We prepared this for you.
-Oh my God.

411
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:46,825
Please use this.

412
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,460
How did you know I watch while I eat?

413
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,896
Who doesn't watch something
while they eat?

414
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,666
Please enjoy your time entirely,

415
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,301
and call us if you need us.

416
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,069
Okay, thank you.

417
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,072
I must say,

418
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:03,608
this looks divine.

419
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:05,944
I can't wait.

420
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,150
Oh my god. Wow.

421
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:25,564
I haven't even taken a bite,
but I'm already so happy.

422
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,275
It's so good.

423
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,582
Why won't you look at me?

424
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,351
It's so good, honestly.

425
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,788
It's very soft.

426
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,356
Yes, the skirt steak is soft.

427
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,291
And the eggplant

428
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,560
doesn't have that distinct scent.

429
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:58,230
-The beef is the showstopper.
-The showstopper.

430
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,098
-It melts in the mouth.
-Yes.

431
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,766
-Manager Samchoon.
-Chef Choi, oh my God.

432
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,436
You're so good, honestly.

433
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,806
A late-night snack
should be eaten without restraint.

434
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,741
-Don't worry about making a mess.
-Yes.

435
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,743
Please don't worry about anything

436
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,578
and enjoy the atmosphere.

437
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,348
You should relax
when you're off the clock.

438
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:17,415
Absolutely.

439
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,694
This is delicious too.
It's like a soup, not a sauce.

440
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,263
You can eat it as a soup.

441
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,402
It's delicious.

442
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,671
-Would you like another?
-Yes, please.

443
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,708
But Ms. Gabee, Manager Samchoon here
doesn't have the keenest eyes.

444
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,744
-Could we turn on the lights?
-Please do.

445
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,312
What makes me happiest

446
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,548
is when Manager Samchoon

447
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,383
makes me great food.

448
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,461
How did you grill the skirt steak
to taste so great?

449
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:04,496
It's so good.

450
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,265
Did you make the tortilla too?

451
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,367
-Yes.
-It's perfectly thin.

452
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,703
That's the work

453
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,806
of our Samchoon here.

454
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:18,443
He put a lot of love and time
into making them.

455
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,379
You can probably taste that in the food.

456
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,786
Let me know if you would like more meat.

457
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,721
We can just grill you more meat.

458
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,332
That's so good.

459
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,435
How is it so tasty? How did you grill…

460
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,837
We used a pinch of salt,

461
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,174
and we marinated it in anchovy sauce.

462
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,378
The process was similar
to that of making ham.

463
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:57,882
It's a slightly luxurious cut
to eat late at night.

464
00:26:58,717 --> 00:26:59,818
-Skirt steak.
-Yes.

465
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:02,654
I never knew skirt steak was so delicious.

466
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,523
It's decently fatty.

467
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,491
It's so good.

468
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:07,459
I like that cut.

469
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,261
I can't stop dipping it in the sauce.

470
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,464
-It's not over-seasoned.
-It's not.

471
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,833
-It's not too heavy.
-Not at all.

472
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,168
It really complements the meat flavor.

473
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,472
We thought you may be a foreigner,

474
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:24,342
but the order
was so clearly written by a Korean.

475
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,613
When we read your order,

476
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,115
we wondered,

477
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,751
"What do they mean by busy gal?"

478
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,519
And our Samchoon here…

479
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,322
Back in the day, "gal" was used

480
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,924
to scold or reprimand someone.

481
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,793
-The character gal…
-What are you…

482
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,128
I've never heard of that.

483
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,131
A Gen Z kid taught me that.

484
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,033
-Gal?
-Gal meaning to scold.

485
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,668
Perhaps he was learning Hanja.

486
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:51,269
-Gal, to scold!
-Maybe.

487
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,771
A Gen Z or Zalpha kid.

488
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,040
-Mu, to be absent!
-Yes, speaking in Hanja.

489
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:56,241
Learning Hanja…

490
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,811
My Instagram handle is "gabeegal."

491
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,047
Back in the day,

492
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:05,884
Rihanna had her Instagram handle
as "ririgal."

493
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,754
So I thought that Americans
use "gal" as slang for "girl,"

494
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:12,090
and I wanted to act like an American.

495
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,792
So not girl, but "gal."

496
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:18,029
I was actually curious
whether Chef Kang-rok would know me.

497
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,031
-Well, I, erm…
-You didn't know me, right?

498
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,232
I saw you on that "Street…"

499
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,301
-That street?
-Yes, that show.

500
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,404
-I saw that.
-You did?

501
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:29,074
-So you knew me?
-Yes, I did.

502
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,709
That dance competition.

503
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,812
-Competitions are…
-Yes?

504
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,481
-They're so painstaking.
-Absolutely. I empathize with you.

505
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,117
I wanted to ask you how it felt.

506
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,719
-The competition?
-Yes.

507
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,455
Well, the hours of filming

508
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,857
aren't set in stone, for one.

509
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:48,793
We would film all day,
so we'd be exhausted all day.

510
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,428
We'd suddenly be given missions.

511
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,764
-Right.
-And sudden rule changes.

512
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,366
Then they would suddenly ask us to battle.

513
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,002
It was so draining.

514
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,238
But I'm sure it was the same
on Culinary Class Wars.

515
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,307
I heard that you shot for 18 hours.

516
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:03,341
Yes,

517
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,176
but I was eliminated early on,

518
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,445
so I didn't experience the worst of it.

519
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:08,713
Right.

520
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,916
For starters, we weren't told in advance
that we'd be split

521
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,318
into black and white spoons.

522
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,254
Although I was introduced
as a veteran chef,

523
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:19,124
I did doubt whether I should be
among the white spoons.

524
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,160
I urgently reflected on my career.

525
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,195
That doesn't mean

526
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,898
I offered to go over to the black spoons.

527
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,602
Of course not.
You were acknowledged as a veteran chef.

528
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,704
So I stayed put.

529
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,307
I thought I could go further
if I tried my best,

530
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,343
but I was eliminated pretty early on.

531
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:41,246
But the toughest thing on that show

532
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,214
was feeling so self-conscious.

533
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:45,650
-You compare yourself.
-Exactly.

534
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:46,751
I understand.

535
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:49,954
You're constantly compared and critiqued
on your technical skills.

536
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,624
-Right.
-It's unavoidable.

537
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,126
I'm sure people argue
about which style of dance is best.

538
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,327
Constantly.

539
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:58,530
We live in a time
when comparison is so rampant.

540
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,464
We do.

541
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:02,333
So I found myself questioning

542
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,570
whether I felt confident

543
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,306
in the face
of that comparison and criticism,

544
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,042
and whether I could overcome
that critique.

545
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:12,544
Those worries

546
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,079
constantly haunted me.

547
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:20,318
It is agonizing,
but you're also there to be judged.

548
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,553
Yes, it's unavoidable.

549
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,188
You can't run away from it.

550
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:28,026
Everyone ranks others
based on their preferences.

551
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:31,996
But in such a time,
I think it's even more important

552
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,565
to be satisfied with yourself.

553
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:35,533
I think that's…

554
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,102
It seems important to consider

555
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,271
how you can protect yourself.

556
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,372
-I agree.
-Yes.

557
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,009
Since you were on Street Woman Fighter,

558
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,512
you've been constantly pushing uphill.

559
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,447
-You wear a lot of different hats.
-Yes.

560
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,982
You have your crew, La Chica,

561
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,717
and you're Queen Gabee.

562
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,285
And now you're in Jaessbee.

563
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,121
They're all great achievements,
so giving one up wouldn't be easy.

564
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,089
Yes.

565
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,425
What brings you
the greatest sense of accomplishment?

566
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:04,829
If I consider
the strongest public reaction,

567
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,332
it would be the other two,

568
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,401
but personally, my priority is dance.

569
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,737
Dance is my identity,

570
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,340
so without it,

571
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,575
I would lose my identity.

572
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,345
That's why I try to hold onto it.

573
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:23,815
Despite how tough it's been,
I've continued working as a dancer

574
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,217
because I want to do my main job justice--

575
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:29,187
You do far more than just justice!
This year alone…

576
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,256
-You've had so many hits this year alone!
-This year?

577
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,491
-We actually won an award.
-Exactly!

578
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,226
For the first time ever,

579
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:38,096
there was an award show
for choreographers.

580
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,197
La Chica won an award…

581
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,065
Please, go into detail.

582
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:44,302
We actually won the grand prize.

583
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,371
Could you tell us what you won it for?

584
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,706
La Chica choreographed
some of Aespa's songs.

585
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:50,708
-This move in "Whiplash."
-Right.

586
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,543
And this part in "Supernova."

587
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,578
-Right.
-Yes.

588
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,546
You're so great.

589
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:57,649
-You're amazing…
-You really are.

590
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,150
-But you…
-Thank you.

591
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,151
I think…

592
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:01,519
Oh my.

593
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,557
I think I'm seeing stars.

594
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,726
Did you just give a compliment
and get flustered?

595
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,730
-It's normally the other way around.
-And I'm over here, celebrating.

596
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,800
But yes, we choreographed
those Aespa songs.

597
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,869
Many, many congratulations.

598
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,271
That gives me
the greatest sense of accomplishment.

599
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,307
Everything else I do is also great.

600
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:25,777
Sang Hoon, may I ask
how you define yourself?

601
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,712
A YouTuber? Or a TV star?

602
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,481
-I think I'm a comedian.
-A comedian.

603
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,383
-A comedian.
-Right.

604
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,186
At least, I claim to be a comedian.

605
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,388
That's not a claim.
You're absolutely a comedian.

606
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,424
And you would be a chef, of course.

607
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,826
I normally describe myself
as a food prepper.

608
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,328
-A food prepper?
-Yes.

609
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,864
The word "chef" holds greater meaning

610
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:48,833
when you're in a team.

611
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,469
-I don't have a team yet, so…
-Food prepper.

612
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,638
Well, cooking…

613
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,074
I'm a little embarrassed to say
that I cook.

614
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,509
Why would you be embarrassed?

615
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,346
This is a dish you cooked.
What else would you call this?

616
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:05,850
I just think I should brush up some more.

617
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:06,751
You do?

618
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,420
When might you feel comfortable
calling yourself a chef?

619
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,789
When I'm 50, maybe?

620
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:13,691
-Really?
-Yes.

621
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:14,592
So, a food prepper.

622
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:16,961
Yes, a food prepper for now.

623
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,463
Food prepper is a great title.

624
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:19,764
Of course it is.

625
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,800
Prepping food evolves into cooking,
which becomes cuisine.

626
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,902
I understand you, though.

627
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:28,473
It took me a while
to finally call myself a choreographer.

628
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,375
So I get you.

629
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,776
Even to this day,

630
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,946
I constantly question
whether I'm a good choreographer.

631
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:39,150
I was always simply called a dancer,

632
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,752
but as I did more and more choreo,

633
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,987
I eventually claimed
the title of choreographer.

634
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,455
So I understand you completely.

635
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,025
I always wondered
if I was even creating choreography.

636
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:47,925
Right.

637
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:52,897
There will always be
talented new choreographers

638
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,499
who work their way up

639
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:57,702
from the bottom
as they refine their skills.

640
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,837
But obviously, our bodies have limits,

641
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,572
often determined by age.

642
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:06,110
How do you overcome the fear of that?

643
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,011
Fear?

644
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:13,317
I've often thought about
how much longer I'll be able to dance.

645
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:17,622
But I don't think it's a question
about how long I want to dance

646
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,891
because I think dance chooses you.

647
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:22,860
Even if you want to dance,

648
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,496
the situation may simply not allow it.

649
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,734
If people don't seek you out,
there's no stage for you to dance on.

650
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,703
In a way, I feel like dance chose me.

651
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:37,775
So, as long as dance wants me,
I want to dance.

652
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,811
But there's a lot I want to try.

653
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:43,147
There are a lot of new things
I want to tackle.

654
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:47,085
But I don't think
I'd want to give up dancing.

655
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:47,985
Ever.

656
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:50,521
Dance is like my first love.

657
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,161
Maybe it's because the theme
was a late-night snack,

658
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,864
but today's service feels really relaxed.

659
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,332
Like a late-night chat.

660
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,534
-It feels very chill and relaxed.
-Does it?

661
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,602
It does.

662
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,504
Thank you for the great food, Chef.

663
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:09,340
The food's slightly colder,
so it's nice to have this sauce to dip.

664
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,575
It warms it up.

665
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:15,780
As today's meal was a late-night snack,
we wrote you a goodnight note.

666
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,616
We hand these out
toward the end of the meal.

667
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:19,550
Right.

668
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:23,554
"I call your name,
though I know you cannot hear me."

669
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:27,058
"When night falls,
I find myself reaching for the phone."

670
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,528
"Though my phone never rings,
whenever night falls."

671
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,197
"Jo Deok-bae. 'When night falls.'"

672
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:35,533
They're lyrics of that song.

673
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,568
-These are song lyrics?
-Yes.

674
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,037
The lyrics are so wistful.

675
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,773
What phone call do you look forward to?

676
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,343
A favorite of mine is,
"I'm outside your door

677
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:47,178
with your chicken takeout."

678
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:50,848
"What's the entry code to your building?"

679
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,955
-Gabee.
-Yes?

680
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,857
-We don't have a bill.
-Right.

681
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,727
But as Samchoon said earlier,

682
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:06,898
you are the first and last guest
to enjoy this meal.

683
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:08,266
Must I go?

684
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,334
We ask our guests for a favor.

685
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,270
I don't want to go.

686
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,071
You can stay if you'd like.

687
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:15,540
But we'll be going.

688
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,708
Gabee, stay here.

689
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,076
We'll be off.

690
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,281
Name of the dish?

691
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,457
Thank you.

692
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,036
QUEEN'S PUFF-FREE BANQUET

693
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:47,238
Whenever I eat late-night snacks,

694
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,640
I worry about getting puffy.

695
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,742
The food was perfectly seasoned.

696
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,612
It wasn't too salty, nor was it bland.

697
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,447
The food was so delicious,

698
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,349
so it feels free of any calories.

699
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,618
Eat this and feel puff-free.

700
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,353
Puff-free!

701
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,655
You need to say it with the hands.

702
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,623
Try it again, please.

703
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,791
-Me?
-Yes.

704
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,393
The Queen's Puff-free Banquet!

705
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,294
The Queen's

706
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:11,896
Puff-free Banquet.

707
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,031
I'm sorry.

708
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:16,901
Thank you.

709
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,436
I guess it's time for you to close.

710
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:19,937
Thank you for the delicious meal.

711
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:22,873
-Shall I put it on?
-Yes.

712
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:27,245
I don't want to leave. I have to, right?

713
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,680
-Our chef needs to go home.
-Tomorrow's a new day.

714
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,415
House Manager Moon needs to go home.

715
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:33,584
-All right?
-Yes.

716
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,019
I'll head out, then.

717
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,555
Thank you so much, guys.

718
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,690
I love you so much.

719
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,691
I love you too.

720
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:44,362
Thank you, truly.

721
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,630
-House Manager Moon.
-Thank you.

722
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,832
I'm gonna hug you so hard. Come on.

723
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,601
-Thank you.
-Love you.

724
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:51,569
Thank you.

725
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,337
-Love you, Chef.
-Thanks.

726
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,006
I'll be off.

727
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,908
I look forward to more great food

728
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:59,644
the next time I call you guys up.

729
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,545
-Anytime, ma'am.
-Whenever.

730
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,947
Please take care.

731
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,248
-I'll head out now.
-Bye.

732
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:05,950
Should I really go?

733
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,485
Yes, please take care.

734
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,254
Are you really just letting me leave?

735
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,889
Take care on your way out!

736
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:13,924
-Chef Choi.
-Yes?

737
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:15,259
Love you so much.

738
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,361
Can you say you love me?

739
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,131
I'm sorry, one sec…

740
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,536
You've always been so cold, Chef Choi.

741
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:26,504
Thank you, bye.

742
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,571
-Goodnight.
-Bye, now.

743
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,773
I'm going to bed now.

744
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,078
Goodnight.

745
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:36,681
Love you.

746
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:39,083
-Goodnight.
-Have a great night.

747
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,117
-Bye!
-Bye.

748
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:50,995
I think I'm an inch shorter.

749
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,577
I would like to try
an unforgettable tilefish dish.

750
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,446
An innovative dish from Chef Choi.

751
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,480
They want a fight.

752
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:10,481
It's a provocation.

753
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,116
The handwriting is familiar.

754
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,585
After a lot of thinking,
I've decided to go ham.

755
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:15,886
I've never seen this before.

756
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,088
-Do you feel it?
-Yes.

757
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:18,189
Did you know it was me?

758
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,191
Am I tearing up?

759
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:23,828
I was so curious what dish
Chef Choi would come up with.

760
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,264
Perhaps I asked for too much.
