1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,205
Hello, Samchoon.

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:06,773
-Right.
-Hello.

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:08,375
How are you?

4
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:12,979
I'm fine.

5
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:14,614
Thank you.

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,548
And you?

7
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:21,054
I'm fine, thank you. And you?

8
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:23,289
I'm fine.

9
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,191
Thank you. And you?

10
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,363
I'm fine, thank you. And you?

11
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,466
I'm fine.

12
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,436
Thank you. And you?

13
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:39,839
I'm fine, thank you.

14
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:43,843
And you?

15
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:58,725
Your story is served as today's menu in…

16
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:01,594
The Blank Menu for You.

17
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:04,798
We could keep going.

18
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:08,668
If I may ask,
why are you suddenly acting like this?

19
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,036
-Today…
-Yes?

20
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:14,641
We should all feel our "finest."

21
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,576
So, today, we need to be our finest,

22
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:20,146
so we kept repeating,
"I'm fine, thank you. And you?"

23
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,649
"I'm fine, thank you. And you?" Right?

24
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:23,983
That's right.

25
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:28,555
We engaged in a pointless battle.

26
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,423
-No, it wasn't pointless.
-Wasn't it?

27
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,160
Today's order mentions the word "fine."

28
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:35,595
It does.

29
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,264
Then let me read the order
in my finest voice.

30
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,399
-Please.
-Okay.

31
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,768
Would you like me
to read it any particular way?

32
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,437
Well, could you give me a few options?

33
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,539
-Then how about two versions?
-Sure.

34
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,540
The first one is…

35
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,975
"Occasionally, I…"

36
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,844
I call it the "voice actor's voice."

37
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,880
And the other I like to call
the "radio DJ voice."

38
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,951
"Occasionally, I eat a second dinner…"
Or along those lines.

39
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,454
I've always dreamed of a voice
like the first one.

40
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,024
-I quite like…
-It's unexpected.

41
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,127
I've dreamed of such a restaurant

42
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,396
where they explain the menu
in that first voice.

43
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,599
-Like a voice actor?
-Exactly.

44
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:13,867
-Let me try, then.
-Okay.

45
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:19,506
"Occasionally, I eat a second dinner."

46
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,941
-That's spot on!
-Did I hit the spot?

47
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,045
"After returning home
from a luxurious meal

48
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,081
at a fine dining restaurant,

49
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:32,218
I can't help but finish the day
with ramyeon or cockle bibimbap."

50
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:36,122
"This doesn't happen when I eat
pork backbone stew or blood sausage soup."

51
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,058
"It's not like the meals aren't filling,
so I don't know why

52
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,227
I keep seeking out more food."

53
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,865
"For once,
I'd love to have a fine dining experience

54
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:49,769
that doesn't leave me yearning for
instant noodles and cockle bibimbap."

55
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:52,805
How was that?

56
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,974
I liked this.

57
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,043
-You liked this too.
-And I thought it was…

58
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,680
It was a shame
that I was your only audience.

59
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,415
Is that so?

60
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,584
After reading today's order,

61
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:06,986
I felt that today's guest

62
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,989
is someone
who goes to fine dining restaurants

63
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,592
to eat cockle bibimbap.

64
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,596
If a friend invites them
to a fine dining restaurant,

65
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,699
their immediate train of thought is

66
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,135
"Dang. Guess I'll be eating
cockle bibimbap today."

67
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,104
So every dish they eat at fine dining
is an appetizer for them?

68
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,106
-An appetizer, yes.
-I see.

69
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:31,878
All the other food they may eat
is a mere stepping stone

70
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,313
toward cockle bibimbap.

71
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,048
-A stepping stone.
-Yes.

72
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:38,651
I'M HAVING DINNER
AT A FINE DINING RESTAURANT TODAY

73
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,588
WHICH MEANS I'LL BE FINISHING THE DAY
WITH COCKLE BIBIMBAP

74
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,023
CONFESSIONS OF A COCKLE BIBIMBAP LOVER

75
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,392
There are conventionally intense flavors.

76
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,396
Foods like ramyeon, Korean noodles,
or the sauce in cockle bibimbap.

77
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,534
Pork backbone stew and blood sausage soup
are dishes that are easily accessible.

78
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:58,304
As soon as you put them in your mouth,
there's an instant burst of flavor.

79
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,505
-Absolutely.
-Yes.

80
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,475
-I think they enjoy intense flavors.
-Right.

81
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,613
We'll emulate that in our own way.

82
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,513
In our own way?

83
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,183
We'll have a dish full of umami flavors

84
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,953
that are stirring up a silent riot.

85
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,889
-Right.
-Clam sot-bap.

86
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,460
In it, we'll be adding abalones, scallops,

87
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,096
egg cockles, which are in season now,

88
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,465
surf clams, and pen shells.

89
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,334
Is everything going in the rice?

90
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,704
On top of that,
we won't be using these clams alone.

91
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,573
We'll have umami from kelp.

92
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,974
-Right.
-And from mushrooms.

93
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,343
-We'll also be using bonito broth.
-Sure.

94
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,146
-All of this.
-We'll be adding in all of this?

95
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,181
Yes, so that once you put the rice
in your mouth,

96
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,384
you'll taste the silent outcry of umami.

97
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,656
But people who like these flavors

98
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,392
tend to be addicted to the taste of MSG.

99
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,293
Yes.

100
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,462
Is there anything
that could replace said MSG?

101
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:59,565
Well, we're essentially using
nature's MSG.

102
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,670
Introverted MSG.

103
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,172
-With an introverted Myers-Briggs type?
-Yes.

104
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,974
-They're a little shy.
-Shy, yes.

105
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,710
-Sure.
-They have a lot to offer.

106
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,246
But they prefer not to stand out.

107
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,581
-Because they're shy.
-Sure.

108
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,216
-Because they're shy.
-Yes.

109
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:22,021
But they don't cover
their faces like this.

110
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,623
-No?
-More like this.

111
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,824
What's the difference?

112
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,193
-If you cover your face like this…
-Yes?

113
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,028
-You cover your entire face.
-Right.

114
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,930
But like this,
you can see between your fingers.

115
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,565
-They're shy.
-Yes.

116
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,335
-But they're still interested?
-Yes.

117
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:36,302
I…

118
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,408
Okay, I get what we're going for.

119
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,343
Great.

120
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,646
Now then, shall we get to finessing
this fine dining experience?

121
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:47,880
We should…

122
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,416
We'll try our "finest."

123
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:54,320
The first thing we should do is make sure
we ourselves are feeling fine.

124
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,621
It may not seem like a big deal,

125
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,224
but we should be feeling our finest.

126
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,526
F-i-n-e.

127
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,729
F-i-n-e? Oh, "fine."

128
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,465
-Then… shall we start?
-Shall we…

129
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,600
-Try our finest.
-Our finest clam sot-bap.

130
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:08,668
-Clam sot-bap.
-Yes.

131
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,069
-Pot rice?
-Yes.

132
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,003
-Okay.
-Let's do it.

133
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,138
-Sure.
-Great.

134
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,513
-With Sang-hoon samchoon…
-Yes?

135
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,715
I gave him radishes like this.

136
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,051
For him to grind
because his hands are large.

137
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,519
-Right.
-But…

138
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,287
-Samchoon, you…
-Yes?

139
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,491
-You have relatively smaller hands.
-Right.

140
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,092
Understood.

141
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,428
This is so "fine."

142
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,830
From the first step of cooking,
we're doing so "fine."

143
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,731
Right.

144
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,642
These radishes.

145
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,344
They're not

146
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,480
going into the clam sot-bap, are they?

147
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,683
Radishes are one of our "fine" ingredients
that will elevate the clams.

148
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,053
-They are?
-The clams in the clam sot-bap.

149
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,955
-Are they for the sauce?
-No.

150
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,625
-We'll be steaming abalones later.
-Right.

151
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,127
And we'll be putting these radishes
above the abalones.

152
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,763
-Covering them up?
-Yes, we'll cover them up.

153
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,799
-I see.
-And we'll be cooking them up.

154
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,567
-Steam the abalones covered in this?
-Yes.

155
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,637
If we do that,
the radishes will do multiple things.

156
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,972
-They'll affect the flavor.
-Right.

157
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,542
And, as they're covering the abalones,

158
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,577
they'll prevent abalones from drying out.

159
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,712
-From drying out like prunes?
-Yes.

160
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,080
Keep them nice and moist.

161
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,048
Nice and moist.

162
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,184
-Understood.
-Good.

163
00:07:55,408 --> 00:08:00,213
BOIL CHEONGJU (RICE WINE), KELP, AND CLAMS

164
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,990
CHEONGJU

165
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,369
PEN SHELL SCALLOPS

166
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,638
-These are pen shells.
-Right.

167
00:08:59,138 --> 00:08:59,972
Here.

168
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:04,143
-There's a thin skin here.
-Oh, wow.

169
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,946
It's important to remove this
for the texture.

170
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,149
We want to pay attention to these details.

171
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,130
Let's salt these lightly.

172
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:28,834
Make them "fine."

173
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,673
-Now, once the grill's hot…
-Yes?

174
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,575
Once the grill's hot, we'll put these on.

175
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,475
Okay.

176
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,010
Take these little guys…

177
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,445
Sizzle.

178
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,380
-Although we can't hear the sizzle…
-Yes?

179
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,382
-It's actually incredibly hot.
-Okay.

180
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,618
Sizzle.

181
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,888
The last thing we want
is to overcook them.

182
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:52,458
If you overcook pen shells,
they can get really tough.

183
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,963
They're starting to gain some color.

184
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,332
-Right.
-We want this aroma.

185
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,232
Right.

186
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,567
This is exactly what we want.

187
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,869
-The aroma of pen shells cooking.
-I see.

188
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,540
We'll stop about now.

189
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,944
-This looks good.
-Okay.

190
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,279
-Wish me luck.
-Good luck!

191
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,851
What clams are those again?

192
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,019
These are egg cockles.

193
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,091
These should be bursting with flavor
as they're currently in season.

194
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:30,696
It's better to butterfly the meat.

195
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,603
Here, you'll find these impurities.

196
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,841
We'll be parboiling these in water.

197
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:42,742
Okay.

198
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,979
May I ask why we only sauté the scallops?

199
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,448
-In the case of pen shells…
-Yes?

200
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,717
-Rather than cooking them in water…
-Yes?

201
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,620
Cooking them by fire
scorches the outer surface,

202
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,623
giving them a great aroma
and improving their texture.

203
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,557
-Right.
-Yes.

204
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,163
We want a little color on them.

205
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,064
I get you.

206
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,166
-I want to pop one in my mouth.
-Exactly.

207
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,002
Since they're already somewhat cooked,

208
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:13,205
we wouldn't want to torch them
for too long.

209
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,373
-Right.
-Just slightly.

210
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,878
These are all steamed now.

211
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,748
Shall we cut them into thirds?

212
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,456
We want this side facing up.

213
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,143
As for the scallops,
we'll cut them in half.

214
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,793
Scallops.

215
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,530
They look so delicious.

216
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,734
-We'll be parboiling these.
-Okay.

217
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,271
-They're sashimi-grade.
-Right.

218
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,241
So we want to avoid
using high heat for scallops.

219
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,177
-We wait for the water to go cloudy.
-Okay.

220
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,459
One little guy at a time?

221
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,795
Yes, cook them one by one.

222
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,171
Like shabu-shabu.

223
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,207
It is like shabu-shabu.

224
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,944
Right, so we're just parboiling them
and taking them out?

225
00:12:59,011 --> 00:12:59,879
Like shabu-shabu.

226
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:01,614
And now…

227
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:04,583
we have these.

228
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,438
We're going to separate
the leaves from the stems.

229
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,339
Okay.

230
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,377
Just like this.

231
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:34,446
They're damp.

232
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,118
How will we be using these…
Oh, in the sot-bap?

233
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,352
Yes, in the pot rice.

234
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,555
-For their aroma.
-Right.

235
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:43,789
And this time of year…

236
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,759
-These guys are in season.
-Right.

237
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,328
We're greeting our guest
with seasonal greens.

238
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,331
So they'll say "hello"
from inside the sot-bap

239
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,500
and say, "It's me, aralia sprout"?

240
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,602
-No.
-No?

241
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,604
"It's me, ground aralia sprout."

242
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,441
-We should be specific, right?
-Absolutely.

243
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,344
What type of aralia sprout are you?
Do you sprout from trees?

244
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,879
"No, I sprout from the ground!"

245
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:07,913
That's exactly it.

246
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:13,152
We're only lightly blanching the leaves,
so we'll keep them separate.

247
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,155
They all cook at different speeds.

248
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,657
-The leaves cook faster?
-Exactly.

249
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,193
We'll blanch the stems for longer.

250
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,929
-So we can use them right away.
-Sure.

251
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,481
They're so fragrant.

252
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,116
We just want to soften them up.

253
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,686
-These are a little tougher.
-Right.

254
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,088
-So a little longer?
-Yes.

255
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,760
-They smell lovely.
-They do.

256
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,234
Bite-sized pieces?

257
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,538
They remind me of garlic scapes.

258
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,474
We'll sprinkle them all over the rice.

259
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:13,445
Three.

260
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,748
ADD MIRIN AND SOY SAUCE TO BONITO BROTH

261
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,684
We're going to let
the aralia sprouts sit in this

262
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,386
so they're mildly seasoned.

263
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:26,492
STEEP THE GROUND ARALIA SPROUT STEMS
IN BOILING SOY SAUCE WATER

264
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,227
-These aralia sprouts…
-Yes?

265
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,796
They discolor fast.
They're very quick to brown.

266
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:35,868
It would be hard to preserve
their fresh greenness.

267
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:40,572
THROW IN THE GROUND ARALIA SPROUT LEAVES
ONCE THE WATER HAS COOLED

268
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,441
-And now…
-Yes?

269
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,219
Do you see how they've popped open?

270
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,228
They can be hot, so let them cool.

271
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,129
Okay.

272
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,891
-I've shucked all the clams.
-Great.

273
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,667
FILTER THE CLAM WATER
TO REMOVE ANY IMPURITIES

274
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,911
MISO

275
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,719
SESAME OIL

276
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,821
This much, maybe? And I'll mix.

277
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,091
SCALLOP JEOTGAL (FERMENTED SCALLOP)

278
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,497
OIJI (FERMENTED CUCUMBER PICKLES)

279
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,137
-Done?
-Yes.

280
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,108
BONITO BROTH

281
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,878
We need to mildly season the sot-bap.

282
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,012
-The rice?
-Yes.

283
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,550
We'll season this

284
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,385
with clam broth.

285
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:38,524
This much.

286
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,226
Thirty.

287
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,263
And 30 ml of cheongju.

288
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,406
BONITO AND CLAM BROTH FOR THE RICE WATER

289
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,442
-We'll use this to cook the rice.
-Okay.

290
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,143
Give it a thorough mix.

291
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:02,107
CLOSE THE LID AND STEEP FOR 10 MINUTES

292
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:30,202
THE BLANK MENU FOR YOU

293
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,377
They'll be tasting
all sorts of umami flavors today.

294
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,686
-Hello.
-Hello. It's lovely to meet you.

295
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:48,987
-Welcome.
-Hello.

296
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,155
Welcome in.

297
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,125
Welcome.

298
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,160
-It's lovely to meet you.
-Lovely to meet you too.

299
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,563
Wow, this is incredible.

300
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,865
Please take a seat here.

301
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,934
-Is this my seat?
-Yes.

302
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,569
-Yes, hello.
-Hello, Chef.

303
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:04,770
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

304
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,178
I was taken aback.

305
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,813
"What should I do?"

306
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,051
"Search your memory
to figure out who he is."

307
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,386
"Hurry and figure him out!"

308
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,559
Are you all right?

309
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,027
-I'm good.
-Have some water.

310
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,263
-Hey, it's warm.
-Yes.

311
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,770
-Did you work today?
-Yes.

312
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,709
I spent today
preparing for my lectures tomorrow.

313
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:44,776
The entire day.

314
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,079
-I guess you must work every day.
-Of course.

315
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:51,183
"Please, keep talking
so I can figure you out."

316
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,621
"Please keep talking. Just don't ask,
'You don't know who I am, do you?'"

317
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:57,222
"Please."

318
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,628
You don't know who I am, do you?

319
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:04,896
No, I do.

320
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,832
I didn't think you would.

321
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,800
He said, "No, I do."

322
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,702
Yes, he did.

323
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,670
You don't, do you?

324
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,305
No, I… I do.

325
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,710
He's a math lecturer.

326
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,145
-Right.
-I'm a math teacher.

327
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:23,315
But he's super famous.

328
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,616
Right.

329
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,320
When you first saw me,
what job did you think I had?

330
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,391
I know the song by XY…

331
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,761
Oh? You know of XY?

332
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:36,795
I do.

333
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,664
You know XY?

334
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,798
-Yes.
-It's him.

335
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,233
Am I "X" or "Y"?

336
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,267
You're "Y."

337
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,736
And who is "X"?

338
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,171
Jeong Hyung-don.

339
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,273
Hello.

340
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,508
INTRODUCING THE BAND

341
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:52,377
I'm "X" of the rookie group XY…

342
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:56,548
And I'm "Y" of the rookie group XY,
math teacher Chung Seung-je.

343
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:57,449
Thank you.

344
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,619
I previously saw him

345
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,422
wearing these dark sunglasses.

346
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:04,856
Wait, no.

347
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,925
They were just slightly tinted.

348
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,497
Either way, I just couldn't put
two and two together.

349
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,501
OUR SIXTEENTH GUEST
CHUNG SEUNG-JE

350
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,070
Oh, so you do know me.

351
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:19,838
He knows you as a singer.

352
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:20,872
I do.

353
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,643
Well, that's me.
And I'm also incredibly hungry.

354
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,179
Then shall we start
by checking your order?

355
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,548
-Sure.
-Let me check it for you.

356
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,685
You said you sometimes eat
a second dinner.

357
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:34,586
I do.

358
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:38,423
And that even after a night out
at a fine dining restaurant,

359
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,892
you come home
and eat ramyeon or cockle bibimbap.

360
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,527
-I do.
-Is that correct?

361
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:43,428
-Yes.
-All right.

362
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,664
-It's not that I'm hungry.
-Right.

363
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,232
But I feel like I haven't eaten.

364
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,401
So, today, you've requested a dish

365
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,204
that doesn't remind you
of ramyeon or cockle bibimbap,

366
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,639
a fine dining experience
that leaves no regrets.

367
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,808
-I did, yes.
-So that was your order.

368
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,044
Instant noodles.

369
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,479
Yes?

370
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,614
-Pork backbone stew or blood sausage soup.
-Yes?

371
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:06,017
They're foods that hit you
with an instant punch of…

372
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:07,085
-Intense flavor.
-Yes.

373
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,988
I thought you were someone
who felt immense satisfaction

374
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,492
after a meal
that's packed full of intense flavors.

375
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,626
You're spot on.

376
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:15,627
-Okay.
-Yes.

377
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,162
-But…
-Yes?

378
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,431
Knowing your tastes,

379
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,534
making you eat a meal that's fitting
of a fine dining experience may…

380
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,535
Yes?

381
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:24,870
I thought I could be a little…

382
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:26,838
-A little forced?
-Yes, exactly.

383
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,641
-I thought it might feel a little forced.
-Right.

384
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,977
-So it's not exactly fine dining.
-Okay.

385
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,514
But we've prepared food
that will make you feel your finest.

386
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,748
Is that so?

387
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,284
That was the goal we had in mind
for today's meal.

388
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,986
-I've thought about it.
-Yes?

389
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,455
And the reason
you seek out fine dining experiences

390
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,091
seems to be to give yourself an excuse

391
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,293
to eat cockle bibimbap.

392
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,761
I see.

393
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,564
So am I eating cockle bibimbap?

394
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,133
Of course not.

395
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:00,472
Our samchoon isn't one
to go with something so glaringly obvious.

396
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,041
Will I be eating
ramyeon and cockle bibimbap?

397
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:07,112
You seemed to love
cockle bibimbap so much.

398
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,246
-Yes.
-I do.

399
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,881
-I love it.
-Right.

400
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,149
So we have clams.

401
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,050
Oh my!

402
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,387
I've prepared a dish
to replace cockle bibimbap.

403
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,889
A rice dish that, in my opinion,

404
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:23,929
is packed full of intense flavors
and is brimming with umami.

405
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,230
Thank you.

406
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,834
For starters, the moment I open this lid…

407
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,734
Yes?

408
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,003
The rice will taste its finest.

409
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,372
Right. Well, thank you.

410
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,641
-To start…
-This is such an honor.

411
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:40,178
Like this.

412
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:41,746
Can you see?

413
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:43,615
Wow.

414
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:51,623
-We have umami-packed clam broth.
-Okay.

415
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,626
And various other flavorful ingredients
that went into this rice.

416
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:09,441
That looks delicious.

417
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:11,443
Do I also see abalones?

418
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,645
-Yes, we added abalones.
-They're expensive.

419
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,285
The rice has a soft, creamy tint.

420
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,821
It seems as though
the ingredients on top seeped through.

421
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,756
Well, we seasoned the rice.

422
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,726
We used shiitake mushroom broth
and clam broth.

423
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:28,660
Oh my.

424
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:29,895
Then some bonito broth.

425
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,355
There's a guk.

426
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,157
Every meal needs a soup.

427
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,163
I truly love guk.

428
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:08,567
My mouth is watering.

429
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:13,872
My word.

430
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:25,517
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

431
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,041
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

432
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,277
-Thank you for the food.
-Please enjoy.

433
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,244
Wow.

434
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,237
One moment, please.

435
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,257
Does the taste bring
an immediate smile to your face?

436
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,634
Wow, this is…

437
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,303
The first bite and second bite
taste different.

438
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,441
It's quite fascinating.

439
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:12,557
Chef, it's delicious.

440
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,660
It feels like I'm under the sea.

441
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,131
To tell you
about the heart of today's dish…

442
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,266
Yes?

443
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:25,103
We've taken every umami flavor
one could get their hands on

444
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,706
and put it into this dish.

445
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:29,274
I totally get that.

446
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:30,809
That's why this dish…

447
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,012
If I try to put my finger on the taste…

448
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,914
When you dive into the ocean,

449
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:39,250
you're met with
this magnificent sight underwater.

450
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:43,054
But when you dive deeper,
more underwater wonders are revealed.

451
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,756
Right.

452
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,357
Deep ocean, shallow ocean.

453
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,760
Then it also feels
like you're eating at shore.

454
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,129
The innate saltiness of the clams

455
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,231
combines with the seasoned rice

456
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,566
to create this new flavor.

457
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,235
It feels like an endless exploration.

458
00:28:57,302 --> 00:29:01,339
I could give you a nudge
that may guide you in that exploration.

459
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,375
Do you know the Tortoise and the Hare?

460
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:05,710
I do.

461
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,546
I know both the hare and the tortoise.

462
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:11,850
We've even included
umami flavors found on land.

463
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,918
-It's combined with the ocean royalty.
-Right.

464
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,921
I'm not quite sure
where the earthy taste is coming from.

465
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:17,822
Right.

466
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,493
Shiitake mushrooms have immense umami.

467
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,865
The dried shiitake mushrooms
brought over by the hare.

468
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:28,199
Yes.

469
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,636
Lured by that flavor,
the hare entered the depths of the sea,

470
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,005
never to return again.

471
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,209
-Perhaps it liked it there.
-Yes.

472
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,544
The meeting of two worlds.

473
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,718
But if you eat ramyeon,
the hare will be coming back to land.

474
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:49,120
I won't be eating ramyeon today.

475
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,557
I guess that explains
the blend of ocean and earth.

476
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,728
Even the jeotgal is made of clams.

477
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,397
So you're telling me that you used

478
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,901
all sorts of umami-packed ingredients
found on land and at sea?

479
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:03,802
Yes.

480
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:09,741
This is seriously delicious.

481
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,945
Wow, this is awesome.

482
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,252
How is it?

483
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:22,921
There's a slight…

484
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,456
-Crispness?
-Yes, what is that?

485
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,993
I feel like I'm roaming grass fields.

486
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,128
-Right.
-I'm a hare!

487
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,498
-It's ground aralia sprout.
-Ground aralia sprout?

488
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,966
This is tasty too.

489
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,369
The clams are the heroes of this dish,

490
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,706
but we wanted to give you
a seasonal greeting.

491
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,442
-There are a lot of aralia sprouts now.
-It's in season?

492
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:48,913
Yes, so we wanted to greet you
with ground aralia sprouts.

493
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,151
I'm so glad to meet this aralia sprout.

494
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,453
Please tell it to the sprouts yourself.

495
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,754
I'm so glad to meet you.

496
00:30:58,656 --> 00:30:59,591
This is lovely.

497
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,695
Could I ask you a favor?

498
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,063
Yes.

499
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,599
-There's only a little left.
-Right.

500
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,767
Could I possibly have a little more?

501
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,103
-We'll prepare you some more.
-Wow, thank you.

502
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,114
It's so delicious.

503
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,287
It's so good.

504
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,590
You know kongnamul-bap?

505
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:33,524
Right, yes.

506
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:36,661
When we eat bean sprout rice,
you can see the soy sauce.

507
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,897
The fascinating thing about this dish

508
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,334
is that I can't see any sauce,
and yet it's perfectly seasoned.

509
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,670
What blows my mind even more

510
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:47,939
is how balanced the dish is.

511
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,108
Until now,

512
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:51,910
whenever I ate bibimbap,

513
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,145
it was always
about mixing everything together.

514
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,713
But now, each and every ingredient

515
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,650
seems to be in its designated place.

516
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:01,319
Each bite feels like I'm eating everything
in the perfect order.

517
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:03,888
Are you finished with this?

518
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:05,590
Are you done?

519
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,025
Okay, then.

520
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:09,193
-I'll take this.
-Thank you.

521
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,228
My pleasure.

522
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,562
-Thank you.
-Here you are.

523
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,131
I'll put this here.

524
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,439
If I'm honest,

525
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,742
I can't even eat two packets of ramyeon.

526
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,211
The last time I ate two bowls of rice

527
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,883
must have been
back when I was in the military.

528
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,018
I rarely eat that much.

529
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,355
It was so delicious
that I cleared my plates.

530
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,391
This drawing is so adorable too.

531
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:44,162
You read my mind
and drew me saying, "I love MSG."

532
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,565
-Eating a lot of umami…
-Yes?

533
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,001
It's said that it makes you

534
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,104
sleepy.

535
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,640
-That sounds right.
-Yes.

536
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,644
I think that's also because
umami makes you eat more.

537
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,546
And when you're full, you get…

538
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,915
You shouldn't lie down
after a big meal, right?

539
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:06,451
-They say it's the worst.
-The worst, right.

540
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:10,355
I really love eating on my back.
I know it's an unhealthy habit.

541
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,424
Whenever I order steamed mandu or kimbap,

542
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,660
I'll eat lying down.

543
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:18,796
Does it make you feel cozy?

544
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,398
The feeling in that position.

545
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,201
Eating like this
while I'm working on math problems.

546
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:27,071
I have a mini fridge beside my bed.

547
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,072
I eat like this.

548
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,341
And then I'll find,
"Oh, I've finished everything."

549
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:31,275
That sort of thing.

550
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,243
I love it.

551
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,848
Everyone knows you're incredibly busy.

552
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:39,851
How do you find the time
to come up with such savvy recipes,

553
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:42,186
like your kimchi fried rice recipe

554
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,355
and the way you eat jam on bread?

555
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,024
They're not recipes per se.

556
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,925
There are a lot of Shorts trending now.

557
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,061
-There are.
-But they're from a decade ago.

558
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,529
They're not recent.

559
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,365
The key to kimchi fried rice
is using scissors.

560
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,367
Come on, look at this.

561
00:33:56,434 --> 00:34:00,505
The more time you take with your scissors,
the longer you're cooking your kimchi.

562
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:04,542
You want the cheese
to ooze out around the ham.

563
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,179
Almost like they're escaping.

564
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,983
I've tried 20 seconds and 18 seconds.

565
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:16,554
But it tastes so much better
when it's bubbling from the sides.

566
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,956
Take out the boiled mandu
and coat them with sauce.

567
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,491
Almost like spreading jam.

568
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,594
If you coat it with soy sauce
and eat it right away,

569
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:24,796
it's perfectly bouncy.

570
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,331
What do you think encouraged you

571
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:32,036
to experiment with food
and come up with these combinations?

572
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:33,938
Was there a particular reason?

573
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:34,939
Going on diets.

574
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,774
Diets?

575
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,911
I've been on many diets,
then gained the weight back.

576
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:44,115
For about 20 years, I've been dieting
and gaining the weight back.

577
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,784
Whenever I'm on a diet,

578
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,088
I only eat a single meal. Dinner.

579
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:52,156
They normally advise you to skip dinner,

580
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:56,094
but on days I have a class
or am recording a lecture,

581
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,797
I feel much better going on
an empty stomach.

582
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:03,401
I like to eat dinner with a beer
after I'm done with work.

583
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:07,305
That's the only solace of my day,

584
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:10,842
and I couldn't stand the thought
of eating a less-than-delicious meal.

585
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:15,746
That led me to think about
how I can enjoy each and every meal.

586
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:17,849
I also love pizza.

587
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:21,953
People usually take the crusts
and dip them in the garlic sauce,

588
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,556
but each pizza place
has a slightly different dip.

589
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,458
So, on Coupang,

590
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:31,429
I ordered every dip I could buy in Korea.

591
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:35,299
I try each and every sauce
to find the most delicious one.

592
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,570
I'll leave bottles of it
in my office and various other places

593
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,205
so I can dip my food anywhere.

594
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:44,575
I did that sort of thing repeatedly
for ten years or so,

595
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:48,179
which has helped me develop
a database of sorts

596
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,381
of the most delicious food combos.

597
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:53,384
-I guess that's how it happened.
-I see.

598
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,721
Samchoon, of the foods you've cooked,

599
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,890
was there a dish
that you thought to yourself,

600
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:02,059
"Man, this is awesome"?

601
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:08,299
Well, although cooking is my job…

602
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,200
Yes.

603
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,903
I don't think I've ever felt like that.

604
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:15,339
What about something
that others may have disliked,

605
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:18,743
but, to you, it's something
that suits your tastes perfectly.

606
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,378
Something that's to your taste.

607
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,347
When I cook ramyeon…

608
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,350
-I cook the noodles, then grab some eggs.
-Yes?

609
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,585
I turn the stove off,

610
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,455
then crack two eggs and whisk them up.

611
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,926
I pour them in and mix everything up
so it becomes a porridge.

612
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,094
And then I slurp it up.

613
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:40,798
I think I make that dish really well.

614
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,234
It probably has a texture like pasta.

615
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,003
-Yes, it's really thick.
-Right.

616
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,338
Like a thick carbonara.

617
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,940
I imagined it would be.

618
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:50,408
-It's just like that.
-Right.

619
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:56,614
The eggs absorb all the flavors
of the instant noodle seasoning pack.

620
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:57,715
That's got to be good.

621
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,518
I really love noodles cooked that way,

622
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,754
and I think I make them well.

623
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:07,024
So professional chefs also enjoy ramyeon?

624
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,059
We do, yes.

625
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,028
And you'll give it an edge, right?

626
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:13,130
Yes, exactly.

627
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,433
-I'll try it your way.
-Please do.

628
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:16,367
Thank you.

629
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:21,372
Then, if I may ask,
have you ever found yourself

630
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,208
conflicted between what you're good at

631
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:27,111
and what you want to do?

632
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,580
Ever since I was very young,

633
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:32,049
I've always been confident
at teaching math.

634
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,785
Whenever I would explain math
to my friends,

635
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:38,256
they would tell me,
"Hey, you're better than our teacher!"

636
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:41,659
So I thought, "Okay, I'm good at this.
This should be my job."

637
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,962
I thought I would keep music,
what I enjoy, as a hobby.

638
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,331
I thought that at a very young age.

639
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,301
I think you can judge aptitude

640
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:53,304
by how you view others
already in that field.

641
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:56,040
If you find yourself thinking,
"How are they so great?"

642
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,608
then maybe that's not for you.

643
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:01,979
If you believe many people out there
excel at what they do,

644
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,650
it might mean
you think you can't do the same.

645
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,787
If only I were talented…

646
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,456
What I have really enjoyed most
ever since I was a kid

647
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,326
was meeting up with my friends,

648
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:18,763
heading to the beach,
and pulling out a guitar.

649
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:23,000
The sound of waves pairs exquisitely
with the strumming of a guitar.

650
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,835
I would play the guitar and sing.

651
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:28,272
Kim Kwang-seok's songs, you know?
Songs meant for guitar.

652
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,607
I loved that sort of stuff.

653
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,676
I remember always loving music,

654
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,377
ever since I was young.

655
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,447
These days,
it must feel like you're living a dream,

656
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,449
being able to promote your music.

657
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,051
I feel like I'm on cloud nine.

658
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,419
Nowadays,

659
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:45,589
I have at least one day off
from giving math lectures.

660
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,124
I use those days off

661
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:50,861
to do TV appearances
and promote our group XY.

662
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:54,465
The way Hyung-don describes it,

663
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,500
I look so different

664
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,570
on the days we have a band gig.

665
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:00,871
It just flows out of you.

666
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:05,276
Because I'm so overjoyed.
It's truly how I find my peace.

667
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:11,115
Samchoon, did you always think
you were meant to be a chef?

668
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,119
I tried to get away a couple of times.

669
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,288
-You did?
-I sure did.

670
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:21,092
But, after everything I've been through,
I'm still here now.

671
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:22,360
Right.

672
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,063
-About three or four years ago…
-Yes?

673
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:30,634
I made up my mind to commit to food
and to being a chef.

674
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:34,138
I decided to do my utmost
to make a name for myself as a chef.

675
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,809
I set it as my firm goal.

676
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,345
I see.

677
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:46,016
Was there something else you loved
as I always have with music?

678
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,485
There was, yes.

679
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,686
What was it?

680
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,188
I think it must have been music.

681
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,157
-Yes, well, I…
-An album?

682
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,426
-Yes, back in the day…
-So, it is.

683
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,728
I used to be a drummer.

684
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:59,296
Is that true?

685
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,364
I thought

686
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,700
I would love to become a drummer.

687
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,568
I held onto that dream for a while,

688
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:07,872
but it never came true.

689
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:10,107
Then were you in a band?

690
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:11,275
Yes, for a while.

691
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,811
They just let me come along for the ride.

692
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,513
-So you were in a band.
-Yes.

693
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,917
If there's such a thing
as another life, then maybe…

694
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:21,685
I'll be the vocalist.

695
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,254
-Yes, please do.
-In another life.

696
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,355
-Yes.
-Okay.

697
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:27,324
I'll send you my coordinates
in that other life.

698
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:28,926
-Sounds great.
-XY.

699
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,094
Oh my!

700
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,095
Count me in too.

701
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,030
-Really?
-I'll be your dancer.

702
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,865
Then you'd need to audition.

703
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,300
Oh…

704
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,601
In autumn,

705
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:39,804
we're intending to release another album

706
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,472
with a new member, "Z."

707
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,707
-We're recruiting now.
-Right.

708
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,109
You should apply.

709
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:46,410
Zoo Hyun-young.

710
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:47,578
-Sorry?
-"Z."

711
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,213
-XY…
-Exactly.

712
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,514
-Zoo…
-Zoo Hyun-young?

713
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,082
Yes, you'd be welcome.

714
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:54,051
And you, Chef.

715
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,687
I'm "C," so…

716
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,622
Choi Kang-roku.

717
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,057
Right, Roku-chan.

718
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:03,093
Then we can go by "CXYZ."

719
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,196
CXYZ.

720
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:06,330
Yes.

721
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:07,765
Let's do it.

722
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,304
How was today's meal?

723
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,139
It was so delicious.

724
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:18,142
To think that this dish
will never be made again…

725
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,412
It's been such an honor,
and it feels like a huge shame.

726
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,847
I think I'll miss this dish.

727
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,016
I heard that in the US,

728
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:29,620
death row inmates
are granted their desired last meals.

729
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:34,058
I've always thought about
what I would request as my last meal.

730
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:37,161
And, right now,
if it means I could try this again…

731
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:39,930
-Not that I intend on getting locked up.
-Right.

732
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,866
Death row meals are a big deal, though.

733
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,934
I think I'd request this.

734
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,503
-That's nice of you.
-Honestly.

735
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:48,038
-As my last meal.
-Thank you for saying that.

736
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:49,807
Please don't eat ramyeon tonight.

737
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:50,708
I sure won't.

738
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,078
Recently, I've been feeling a little low,

739
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,113
but this food's been a reminder

740
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:00,284
that I should live my life happily
and to the full.

741
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,786
I think it'll put a pep in my step.

742
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,256
-These flavors of umami.
-Yes?

743
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:09,159
They all carry
a silent outcry of their own.

744
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:13,397
In their own way,
these flavors have their own struggle.

745
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,301
Please don't feel low.

746
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:20,704
The food was obviously a huge comfort,

747
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,908
but so were your words,
so thank you very much.

748
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,610
Thank you for enjoying your meal.

749
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:28,546
Thank you so much.

750
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,923
We don't take payment for our food,

751
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:41,725
but we ask you
to kindly name your own dish.

752
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,298
So this is… Wow.

753
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,505
Hey, it's a curry!

754
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:58,809
Here it is!

755
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,312
What should I call this?

756
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,026
-I'm done naming it.
-Great.

757
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:20,798
Okay.

758
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:27,438
"The variable between me and the sea."

759
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:33,744
In math, we sometimes use a variable
to connect X with Y.

760
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:34,645
Right.

761
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:36,113
And today, this dish

762
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,984
connected me with the sea
in a very intimate way,

763
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:41,685
so I thought I'd name it that.

764
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:43,587
Thank you.

765
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,122
-It's been…
-Thank you.

766
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:46,991
-Everything you said.
-Yes?

767
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:51,562
And the name of the dish, everything.
Thank you so much.

768
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,998
Thank you. The food was truly lovely.

769
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:55,799
You seem to be in a rush.

770
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,803
You're not off to second dinner, are you?

771
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:00,971
Absolutely not.

772
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,344
Thank you so much for the food.

773
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:08,579
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

774
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,947
-Please take care.
-Take care.

775
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:11,548
Yes, thank you.

776
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:20,157
THE VARIABLE BETWEEN ME AND THE SEA

777
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,303
"Today, I'd like to request
a school meal cooked specially by you."

778
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,205
What's on the school menu today, Chef?

779
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:39,209
I remember getting excited

780
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,612
when the school lunch menu
featured something new.

781
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,681
So today, we're going full Western.

782
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:48,052
-Hello.
-Welcome.

783
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:50,788
I don't like mint chocolate.

784
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,356
-Mint chocolate?
-Yes.

785
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,624
What do you like?

786
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:54,792
Sorry?

787
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:58,362
I'll excuse myself.
