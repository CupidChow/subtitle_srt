1
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,684
Notice anything different today?

2
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,723
Yes, that accessory of yours…

3
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,192
Well, it suits you.

4
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,660
-I got it for myself.
-Okay.

5
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:30,196
-It matches the color of the apron.
-Yes.

6
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,631
It…

7
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,099
-Is it okay?
-It looks good.

8
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,102
Can you tell me
if it should be tilted left or right?

9
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,238
-The angle.
-Yes?

10
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:42,108
If you want your hat to show
that you are feeling lonely,

11
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:45,979
wear it so it covers your eyes,
casting a shadow over your face.

12
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:47,981
-A shadow?
-Yes.

13
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,382
Like this?

14
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,684
If you want to open up to people,
then stretch it up.

15
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:53,219
-I'll do that for today.
-All right.

16
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,954
-I'll open up.
-You do that.

17
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,222
Okay.

18
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,323
Wait.

19
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,560
What's wrong?

20
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,263
-Nothing.
-Did I open up too much?

21
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,131
There's a basin on top of your head.

22
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,301
-To look professional…
-Show some confidence and seriousness.

23
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,870
-Confidence and seriousness.
-Lower it a little.

24
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:11,905
-There.
-Good.

25
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:12,839
Good now?

26
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,642
Yes, I…

27
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,077
Fashion is all about confidence.

28
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,079
-Confidence.
-Confidence.

29
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,848
Yes, I…

30
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,218
CHOI KANG-ROK

31
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,724
Your story is served as today's menu in

32
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,694
The Blank Menu for You.

33
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,800
Our second order has arrived.

34
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,304
"Can one dish break stereotypes?"

35
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,607
"'Tasty food makes you gain weight.'"

36
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,944
"'Meat tastes better than vegetables.'
Misconceptions like these."

37
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,479
"For the main dish,

38
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:55,148
I want to eat a delicious
and greasy meat dish

39
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,484
that doesn't make me gain much weight."

40
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,219
We have a greedy guest today.

41
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:01,855
"For the side dish,

42
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:05,925
please note that I love vegetables
as much as I love meat."

43
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,994
"And Korean leek is my favorite."

44
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:11,197
"Please come up with a dish
that can break stereotypes."

45
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:15,301
"P.S. I'm a big eater
who's in love with food!"

46
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,771
-I'm thrilled to serve this guest.
-Yes.

47
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,908
Is it likely for a big eater
to be physically big?

48
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,383
I think I must break my stereotypes first
before making today's dish.

49
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,620
I've got a question for you.

50
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:37,023
Is there a preconception about you
that you'd like to get rid of?

51
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,292
For example,
"I actually have good eyesight."

52
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,829
"I actually don't like wearing a hat."

53
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,164
"I'm actually eloquent."

54
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,532
That… Yes.

55
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,002
People think I'm inarticulate,
but in truth…

56
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,105
-You're eloquent?
-I'm a good talker.

57
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,607
Good but only slow?

58
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:58,077
As I got older,
I have come to talk more slowly.

59
00:02:58,645 --> 00:02:59,712
I may talk…

60
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:04,584
slowly…

61
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,456
I may talk slower now,
but I do know how to talk.

62
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:17,030
After hearing today's request,

63
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,332
it makes me feel like being rebellious.

64
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,366
Why is that?

65
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,403
I brainstormed a bit
after going over the order.

66
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,304
Okay.

67
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,373
-"Tasty food makes you gain weight."
-Yes.

68
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,010
If that's a problem,
we can give only a small portion of food.

69
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:35,715
Then the chances of gaining weight
would be lower.

70
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,418
-I think you're on the wrong track.
-Am I?

71
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,019
-Was I too rebellious?
-That's okay.

72
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:43,223
Just tell me everything
that popped into your head, Samchoon.

73
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,291
"Meat tastes better than vegetables."

74
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:49,195
Think about barbecue restaurants.

75
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:53,032
-They advertise meat as their main dish.
-That's right.

76
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,834
-But Korean leek?
-Yes?

77
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,570
It's never been the main dish.

78
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:58,671
Never.

79
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,073
So let's just switch them.

80
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,541
COULD MEAT COMPLEMENT LEEK?

81
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,876
Korean leek as the main dish
and meat as the side dish?

82
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:04,777
Right.

83
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,680
It's like switching
the main and side dishes.

84
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,749
Korean leek can be the main dish.

85
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,118
Let's focus on the leek
that the guest likes.

86
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,586
LIKES KOREAN LEEK
A BIG EATER

87
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,289
What if it feels too plain?

88
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,858
Hey, that's your problem, not mine.

89
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,593
What? Don't make me sweat.

90
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,764
Here.

91
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,769
Smells nice.

92
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,070
Should I get these ready?

93
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,405
I have a job for you.

94
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:33,806
Finally.

95
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,242
Do you know what "barley-sta" is?

96
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,243
-Barley-sta?
-Yes.

97
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,845
-You mean barista.
-Barley-sta.

98
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,747
I don't know what that is.

99
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,816
A barley-sta brews barley tea
like a barista brews coffee.

100
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,120
I totally get what you mean.

101
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,589
-We'll be serving cold tea as the drink.
-Yes.

102
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:53,726
And hot barley tea will be the dessert.

103
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:58,431
I've never seen a restaurant
that serves barley tea and has bad food.

104
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,767
I'd like to entrust you with that job.

105
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,069
Barley tea, it is, then.

106
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,138
I shall now devote myself to brewing it.

107
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,452
Aha.

108
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,022
I spotted an extraneous matter
among the grains.

109
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,360
-I'll remove the over-roasted grains.
-All right.

110
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:31,431
The selection of barley should be done
just like sorting coffee beans.

111
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,432
-I see.
-Yes.

112
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,336
With persistent dedication,
a delicious barley tea will be created,

113
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,272
and this place will be known
as a barley tea hotspot.

114
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,376
And then "barley-sta"
will become an actual job.

115
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,844
-Barley-sta?
-Yes.

116
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:46,813
Be a star.

117
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,841
I noticed that you're using
only the white parts.

118
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:15,775
You're right.

119
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:19,112
The green leaf and white bulb of leek

120
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,949
differ in texture and flavor.

121
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:26,386
The bulb has
the natural sweetness of vegetables,

122
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:29,122
so I plan to use it
as the main ingredient.

123
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:33,760
The green leaf, on the other hand,
can become quite slimy.

124
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,161
It can be slimy.

125
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,897
It also has more zing to it.

126
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:41,200
I haven't seen many chefs shed tears
while cutting leeks.

127
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,136
-Right.
-Is there a good tip?

128
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,405
Do you put toothpaste under your eyes?

129
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:49,442
I'm afraid I have no tips.
I just let myself tear up.

130
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,879
-This reminds me of a famous dialogue.
-What is it?

131
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,680
"Why are you crying?"

132
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,849
"The leek made me cry."

133
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,885
"I'm not a leek." Get it?

134
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,025
-I replaced "onion" with "leek."
-Of course.

135
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,960
-"The onion made me cry."
-Yes.

136
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,829
"I'm not an onion."

137
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,465
Korean Leek.

138
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,271
-We're funny, aren't we?
-Yes.

139
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,709
Is it fun working with me?

140
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,977
It's so fun.

141
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:26,913
Thank you.

142
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,383
-How about you, Samchoon?
-I'm happy.

143
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,136
Got it.

144
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:04,784
LEEK SOUP TO GREET THE GUEST
MAKE BROTH WITH KELP AND CHILI PEPPER

145
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:22,468
THINLY SLICE THE LEEK BULB
SIMMER IN BROTH

146
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,816
-I didn't know leek was this sweet.
-Right?

147
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,986
The sweetness of vegetables
is quite impressive.

148
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,721
It still needs to be seasoned with salt.

149
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,891
If you add salt,
I think I'd mistake it for seolleongtang.

150
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,828
This proves that vegetables can be
just as tasty as meat.

151
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,164
I'm going to finish it with salt later

152
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,100
and serve it as today's greeting dish.

153
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,604
MAIN: GRILLED KOREAN LEEK

154
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,606
I'm going to grill some leek today.

155
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,207
How long should each piece be?

156
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:44,550
Three to four centimeters would be nice.

157
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,720
Three to four centimeters is correct.

158
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,389
It's the perfect length to eat gracefully.

159
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,225
Wait, why did I ask him that?

160
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,740
Korean leek is most commonly
served with meat,

161
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,942
so eating leek
instantly reminds me of meat.

162
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,579
That's actually the intention
behind today's dish.

163
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,014
Did you know about it?

164
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:16,349
Not at all.

165
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:19,919
-Think of this leek as meat.
-Okay.

166
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,723
I'm going to simmer it
until its flavor is extracted,

167
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,057
kind of like meat broth.

168
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:26,792
I'm impressed.

169
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,961
It's only our second guest,
and we're in sync.

170
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,732
I think we're getting close too quickly.
Easy come, easy go, they say.

171
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,134
Well, some get close quickly

172
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,004
and continue to get along
for a good long time.

173
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,139
-Let's try to get along, then.
-Sure.

174
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,145
SIDE BY SIDE?
MAKE A TOWER?

175
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,813
-Should we stand them up?
-Let's do that.

176
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,714
SIDE BY SIDE!

177
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,966
This piece seems a bit too long.

178
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,169
Good.

179
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:13,773
-I think that's enough for the bulb.
-Okay. Stop now?

180
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,774
Yes.

181
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,109
-Today's main course.
-Here it is.

182
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,681
The meat looks first-rate.

183
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:25,885
I did make the bold decision
to switch the main dish and the side dish.

184
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,221
-But that might infuriate the guest.
-That's right.

185
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,524
So the side dish has to be better
than the main.

186
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,858
SERVE PLENTY OF SIDE DISH

187
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,261
A better side dish
and even better barley tea.

188
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,195
Precisely.

189
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,397
We're getting it done one by one.

190
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,367
For our one and only guest.

191
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,334
LAST NIGHT, THE OPERA SINGER WHO'LL TOUCH
YOUR HEART HAD RICH EMOTION AND VOLUME

192
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,136
UNPREDICTABLE EMOTION
YET, MOST LIKELY, THAT WE ALL KNOW

193
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,304
A DARK SIDE BY KIM HAENG-SOOK

194
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,848
"The Blank Menu for You."

195
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,832
Welcome to The Blank Menu for You.

196
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,134
Hi.

197
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,803
Welcome to The Blank Menu for You.

198
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,973
-Hello.
-It's cold outside, isn't it?

199
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,841
-Your seat is right there.
-Hello.

200
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,042
May I take your coat?

201
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,012
-Where should I…
-Let me.

202
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,213
No, I'll do it.

203
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,616
Please. This is all part of the reception.

204
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,284
-Really?
-I won't charge you.

205
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,353
Oh, okay.

206
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,856
-Here. Thank you.
-Thank you.

207
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,225
I'll be with you shortly.

208
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,027
-Hi.
-Hello.

209
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,029
-Nice to meet you.
-How do you do?

210
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,599
When he came in,

211
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,102
I couldn't look him in the eye.

212
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,206
I just took a peek at him instead.

213
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,976
He has this unique smile I really like,

214
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:33,646
and I wanted to see it.

215
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,017
OUR SECOND GUEST
JUNG HAE-IN

216
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:40,252
Okay.

217
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:52,331
-Who wrote this?
-It's a welcome message.

218
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:55,134
LAST NIGHT, THE OPERA SINGER WHO'LL TOUCH
YOUR HEART HAD RICH EMOTION AND VOLUME

UNPREDICTABLE EMOTION
YET, MOST LIKELY, THAT WE ALL KNOW

220
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,170
A DARK SIDE BY KIM HAENG-SOOK

221
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,142
-Here's a hot towel.
-All right.

222
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,211
-To warm your hands.
-Thank you.

223
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,180
-How have you been?
-Good. How are you?

224
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,250
-Why are you acting so…
-I know, right?

225
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:15,087
We've prepared
quite a lot of delicious food today,

226
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,156
so I'm hiding my excitement a little.

227
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,793
-I'm very hungry.
-You must be.

228
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,463
-Barley tea.
-Thank you.

229
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,066
This towel is a nice touch.

230
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:28,901
It certainly is.

231
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,108
-This place is remarkable.
-Isn't it?

232
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,446
You ordered a dish
that could break stereotypes.

233
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:44,583
A delicious and greasy meat dish
that doesn't make you gain much weight.

234
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,185
-Yes.
-Am I correct?

235
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:50,189
Well, I love eating so much,

236
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,659
and when I eat too much,
it shows right away,

237
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,395
so I try to hold myself back
once I start filming.

238
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,065
-You mentioned that you love leek.
-I'm a huge fan.

239
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:05,137
So the chef has become a geek for leek
to seek various ways to cook it.

240
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,139
-I know he likes leek.
-He does.

241
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,174
-"It's me. Leek." You know?
-Right.

242
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,976
It's "perilla oil," actually.

243
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,451
-Here.
-Yes.

244
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,154
It's hot.

245
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,490
The cup is hot.

246
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,395
-Thanks.
-The cup is hot.

247
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,930
-Okay.
-Let me just…

248
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,002
-I suggest you take a sip first.
-All right.

249
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,137
May I

250
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:42,074
take pictures of the food for me to keep?

251
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,343
Of course you can. I'd be honored.

252
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,879
You get a free soda if you write a review.

253
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,948
-Oh, do I? Okay.
-Yes.

254
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,724
This has

255
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,294
a strong Korean leek scent.

256
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,306
It's good.

257
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:17,776
So good.

258
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,180
You like Korean leek,

259
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,750
so I used leek and nothing else.

260
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,218
-Really?
-Yes.

261
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:31,190
It's possible to use leek alone
to bring out the flavor of meat broth.

262
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,792
You didn't use any other broth?

263
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:37,129
I had to add some umami to the taste,

264
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,065
so kelp was used for that purpose.

265
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:45,671
A huge amount of leek had to be used
to give it such a strong flavor.

266
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:53,946
Your request for a dish
that breaks stereotypes

267
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,483
caused quite a bit of turmoil
inside my head.

268
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,419
I can't wait to find out.

269
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,723
Great expectations are known to lead us
to great disappointment.

270
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,892
Yes, I'm well aware of that.

271
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,163
-Now, you ordered a meat dish.
-I did.

272
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,399
But we chose to go with leek.

273
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,000
-I like that.
-Like a couple of rebels.

274
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,635
I love it!

275
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,637
-So, grilled Korean leek.
-Thank you.

276
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,039
-Let us begin.
-Okay.

277
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,671
-On the left, we have leek kimchi.
-Yes.

278
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,707
Leek pickle, leek jangajji.

279
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,642
This is Maldon sea salt.

280
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,311
PYRAMID-SHAPED SALT MADE BY BOILING BRINE

281
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,979
We also have roasted Maldon sea salt.

282
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,047
SMOKED MALDON SALT

283
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,482
And purple bamboo salt.

284
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,852
-It'll taste different based on the salt.
-Yes.

285
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,928
If you want to taste
the true flavor of leek,

286
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:51,964
try the core.

287
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,033
Okay. I'll dip the core piece in the salt.

288
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,803
-Thank you for the meal.
-Sure.

289
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,947
This is it.

290
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,252
Funny how it tastes like meat.

291
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,754
-You're on the mark.
-As expected.

292
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,325
It was cooked in suet
to add a hint of meat scent.

293
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,394
-Did you say suet?
-Suet.

294
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:26,532
It's a beef cut used as cooking oil
in barbecue restaurants.

295
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:29,935
If any other cooking oil,
such as soybean oil, was used,

296
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,237
the dish would've been incomplete.

297
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,274
As the last piece of the puzzle,

298
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,743
suet was used.

299
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:48,220
This is amazing.

300
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,323
Is the leek too tough to chew?

301
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,391
No, not at all.

302
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,194
It's delicious.

303
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,064
The combination of the scent, rice,

304
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,200
and saltiness

305
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,803
opens up the possibility of another dish.

306
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,339
I'm speechless.

307
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,708
Would you like more rice?

308
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:10,776
-Yes, please.
-Okay.

309
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:17,449
Thank you.

310
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:22,154
Some restaurants express their heart
through their food.

311
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,691
Today's dish expresses my heart
to offer you as much as I can.

312
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,826
-The tender parts…
-Thank you.

313
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,727
You're welcome.

314
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,963
I'll give you more of the tender parts.

315
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,107
Seriously, I'm blown away.

316
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,843
And I keep tasting meat from this.

317
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,190
It kind of worries me
that the viewers will see me

318
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,958
enjoying leek like this

319
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:04,296
and think,
"That guy has a peculiar taste in food."

320
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,466
I believe there are
many ingredients out there

321
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,601
that taste great on their own.

322
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:13,872
People just haven't had the chance
to experience them,

323
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,007
and that includes me.

324
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,845
You seem to be enjoying
the food very much.

325
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,614
I'm doing a little jig on the inside.

326
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,682
It's really good.

327
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,619
-I mean it.
-Thank you.

328
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,691
I don't feel guilty eating leek
because it's not so rich and heavy.

329
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:33,692
Exactly.

330
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,595
-I can't gain weight on it.
-Exactly.

331
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,698
Excuse me, chef?

332
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,135
-What I had earlier…
-Yes?

333
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,704
-The soup?
-Do you have more of it?

334
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,172
-Sure, I do.
-Please.

335
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:48,674
Thank you.

336
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,252
This is very sweet.

337
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,059
How about we turn things around here?

338
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,602
Enter meat!

339
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:21,273
A meat dish to complement the leek.

340
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:43,962
Do you not eat undercooked meat
by any chance?

341
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,631
-I'm not particular about food.
-All right.

342
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,912
The leek I'm grilling right now

343
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:06,918
was used as the ingredient
to make the broth you are enjoying.

344
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,187
You might think they are out of juice,

345
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,423
but they are not done yet.

346
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:35,814
Why are you…

347
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:37,749
Thank you.

348
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,555
I'm really looking forward to this.

349
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,243
Were those used

350
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,345
for the soup?

351
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:08,847
Yes.

352
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:12,117
So, I cut the leek into very thin slices

353
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,753
and squeezed the juice out of them.

354
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,656
They released all their flavor.

355
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:18,824
Then how…

356
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,828
They are in such large quantities,
so the taste might feel intense.

357
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,097
Is that cut strip loin?

358
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,899
-Yes, it is.
-You're right.

359
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,034
You know it.

360
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:34,105
I feel rewarded as a chef
whenever a conversation flows like this.

361
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:38,743
-You chose strip loin for today's dish.
-Yes.

362
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,612
I think it's a lovely choice.

363
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:43,315
It works wonderfully with the leek.

364
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,018
This tastes amazing.

365
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:57,963
Thank you very much
for enjoying the food so energetically.

366
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,297
It's so delicious.

367
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:06,571
In addition to the strip loin,
we've also prepared eight plates of loin.

368
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,273
-What?
-So indulge yourself.

369
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,175
We are ready to accommodate a big eater.

370
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:11,243
Okay.

371
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,979
-In that case, please keep them coming.
-I will.

372
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:18,850
Okay.

373
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,053
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

374
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,399
I'm so glad I get to enjoy such a treat.

375
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,470
My initial idea was to serve only the leek

376
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,740
so I could get a reaction out of you
and make you pout.

377
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:43,742
That was my…

378
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,678
Your goal was to get a reaction out of me,
not impress me?

379
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,346
Yes, just to push your buttons.

380
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,417
"This isn't what I ordered.
Are you kidding me?"

381
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,753
-That's the reaction I wanted.
-Okay.

382
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,691
You have a great sense of humor.

383
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,359
-He very much does.
-Yes.

384
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,363
-I'll go get the bulgogi.
-Okay.

385
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,972
I'm a bit embarrassed and cautious
to say this to you.

386
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,641
You know how they say
that leek purifies our blood?

387
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:19,511
After I appeared in D.P.,
my friends would ask me,

388
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,980
"What's Jung Hae-in like?"

389
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,049
Every time, I would tell them

390
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:27,385
he's an actor who makes
those around him feel purified.

391
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,254
-Did you?
-Yes, how should I put it?

392
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,056
You're

393
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,258
what I aspire to be.

394
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:37,228
Thank you so much.
That's a wonderful preconception about me.

395
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,565
The nature of my job as an actor

396
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,568
leaves the audience
with certain impressions about me.

397
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:48,039
I'm talking about the different characters
I have to portray on screen.

398
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:53,011
And every time I get to show
new, diverse sides of myself

399
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,213
that I haven't shown before,

400
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,584
it satisfies me to find out
that there are parts of me

401
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,287
that even I didn't know about.

402
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:05,957
I bet people would understand that
if they saw you on I, the Executioner.

403
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,927
I've been offered
a lot of villain roles after that.

404
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,964
I feel like I always have
a sense of curiosity

405
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:17,802
and a desire to challenge myself
with things I haven't tried yet.

406
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,904
It doesn't matter what genre.

407
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:24,976
Even if it's a genre I've already tried,
a new cast and director

408
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:29,514
create a different synergy,
so it's always a new experience.

409
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:33,184
-It's like I'm constantly changing jobs.
-I see.

410
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,281
Careful. It's hot.

411
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,489
-This dish is today's finale.
-Yes.

412
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,792
It's Korean leek bulgogi.

413
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:52,197
This dish is the climax of today's meal,
which uses all parts of the leek.

414
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:56,401
The leek soup you had earlier
was used as the base of this dish.

415
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,937
-I've added a tiny bit of soy sauce.
-To this?

416
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:01,806
Yes, to make it taste like bulgogi.

417
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:06,478
-Now, garlic is normally used for bulgogi.
-Right.

418
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:10,548
But I thought that it might drown out
the flavor of the leek,

419
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:14,285
so I omitted the garlic
and doubled down on leek instead.

420
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,287
There sure are a lot of leek in here.

421
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:20,759
If you stir a piece of leek in the broth,
it will give you a stronger taste.

422
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:24,496
The soup…

423
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:29,033
The core pieces are hidden underneath.

424
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:31,569
This is the real deal.

425
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,271
You've added the grilled pieces.

426
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,140
Yes, they are not completely white.

427
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:38,676
I've selected the core pieces
that have hints of green in them

428
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:41,346
and drowned them in the broth.

429
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:42,247
These are…

430
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,116
I actually love eating leek like this.

431
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:49,454
I've seen grilled leek
drowned in baeksuk before.

432
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,390
This is going to be good.

433
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:57,295
The food might be a bit mild,

434
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:01,466
so try eating it with the sides
or adding salt as needed.

435
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,445
Do you have soju?

436
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,283
I mean…

437
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,320
I love how it's not too salty.

438
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:27,258
I intentionally held back on the seasoning
to let you fully savor

439
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,161
the natural flavor of the leek.

440
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:31,262
This is really good.

441
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:36,434
Did today's dish break any stereotypes?

442
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,335
Definitely.

443
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,637
-Mission accomplished.
-Yes.

444
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:44,676
Is there a prejudice or preconception
people have about you

445
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:47,312
that you find hard to accept?

446
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:48,379
Well…

447
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,050
They say I'm not a good talker.

448
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:56,120
A lot of people think that,
and I tried to overcome it

449
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,256
to no avail.

450
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,793
-You're not a good talker?
-I talk slowly, to be exact.

451
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,797
As I get older, I need to take time
to choose my words carefully

452
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,366
and make sure what I say is actually true.

453
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,701
And…

454
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,904
That just shows
you understand the power of words.

455
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:15,773
I used to just blurt out
whatever I wanted to say.

456
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:18,743
Then one day, someone told me,

457
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:23,481
"Deceiving others with false information
is worse than stealing their money."

458
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:27,252
I was filled with the fear
that I could do something like that.

459
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,154
So I told myself,

460
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:35,026
"Never let your words lead others
to believe in something that's not true."

461
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:38,830
I think it's because of that caution
that I started to stutter.

462
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:41,666
I stutter.

463
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,668
-You can be like ChatGPT.
-How?

464
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,604
If you just constantly feed others
with nothing but lies,

465
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:50,141
they won't believe a word you say,
and you'll find your peace.

466
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:54,579
Hae-in, most preconceptions
people have about you

467
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,247
are more positive than negative.

468
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:59,050
Do you still wish to correct any of them?

469
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,054
I actually agree with what the chef said.

470
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,990
Words are important, of course,

471
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:09,594
but I think actions are just as important.

472
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,196
We all have

473
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,967
things we say and do unconsciously.

474
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,835
No matter how we try to hide them,

475
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:19,771
they show.

476
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:20,905
You're right.

477
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:25,009
So whether we're at home
or in front of a camera,

478
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:29,414
we have to try to live the life
that we want others to see.

479
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,583
The image that people expect from me

480
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,319
is that of a stand-up guy,

481
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,021
and at first, that was overwhelming.

482
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,557
"Do I have to live up
to that expectation?"

483
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,192
But

484
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,028
the upside is that it makes me

485
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,365
want to be a better person.

486
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:49,000
That's true.

487
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:50,902
This is amazing.

488
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,305
The variety of textures is impressive.

489
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:11,189
You know what?

490
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,057
This isn't blank. It's blissful.

491
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,593
-I see what you did there.
-Yes.

492
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:18,830
This is a dish that can please anyone,

493
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:19,897
hands down.

494
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:22,500
Just watching you enjoy my food…

495
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,635
Well, it doesn't make me feel full.

496
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,271
-But it makes me happy.
-Yeah.

497
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,543
I can't pretend something's delicious
just because I'm on camera.

498
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,012
-Okay.
-It would show.

499
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:36,414
I hope you're enjoying it for real.

500
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:37,882
I am enjoying it.

501
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:43,221
Whenever I'm acting in a scene

502
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,690
where I have to eat,

503
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,059
I really want to enjoy the food.

504
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:53,765
But it's not easy since we have to
take breaks for the shots.

505
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:55,166
Now I have no regrets.

506
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:09,614
Thanks.

507
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,861
What a meal. That was incredible.

508
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,365
How much did I eat?
Was I here for an hour?

509
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,467
That'll be 980,000 won.

510
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:36,207
Just joking.
Actually, we don't charge our guests.

511
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:40,211
But we will ask you to name the dish.

512
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:41,345
-A name?
-Yes.

513
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:45,016
You can name one of the dishes
or even the entire course.

514
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:49,554
Leek…

515
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,235
There you go.

516
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,304
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

517
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,349
"Dramatic Bleekthrough."

518
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,717
Yes.

519
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:25,123
So…

520
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:30,094
Once I receive the guests' orders,

521
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:34,499
I start to feel the pain and stress
that bring joy to me in the end.

522
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,568
But whenever I feel overwhelmed,
a thought comes to my mind.

523
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,839
"I can't wait to see
the guest finishing their meal."

524
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,775
I kept imagining that very moment

525
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:47,678
while preparing today’s dish.

526
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:53,084
One scene from today
is still vividly stuck in my mind,

527
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,753
and it's when you enjoyed
the grilled leek.

528
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,688
That moment

529
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,224
lingers in my head.

530
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,331
All thanks to you.

531
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,501
It's been a blast.

532
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:11,736
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

533
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,004
Can I take this with me?

534
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,138
-Sure.
-Of course.

535
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,308
-It's such an inspiring passage.
-You flatter me.

536
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,311
-I had a great time.
-Thank you.

537
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,080
-Goodbye.
-Thanks for coming.

538
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,424
I saw it.

539
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:34,992
I saw his smile.

540
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,261
It was the smile I knew.

541
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:38,863
It's possible

542
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,465
that he was acting.

543
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,470
It could have been an insincere smile.

544
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:49,874
But I really

545
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,744
want to believe that it was real.

546
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:54,946
It made me feel great.

547
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,548
DRAMATIC BLEEKTHROUGH

548
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,193
"Paris Hilton, who got off work late"?

549
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,394
A person of wealth, maybe?

550
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,063
Drink beer when you're on a diet?

551
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,498
-A walking contradiction.
-I'm eager to meet the guest.

552
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,134
Welcome.

553
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:18,469
But you know me!

554
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,104
House Manager Moon!

555
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:21,505
Can you look at me?

556
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,873
Are you two okay?

557
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,409
Wait, I think I'm about to black out.
