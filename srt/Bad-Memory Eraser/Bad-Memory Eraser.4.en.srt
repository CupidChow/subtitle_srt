- Who's first?
- How is Lee Shin's condition?

197
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:48,700
Pretty good, next.

198

The player, Lee Shin.

199
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,200
He looks a little bit nervous
for a world-class player.

Oh, yes.

poker face during matches?

New shoes are uncomfortable
because they are not worn in.

00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:14,300
You should've given them to him
earlier so he could get used to them.

207
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,133
Since these shoes are tailored for Shin,

- there won't be any discomfort.
- No way.

Oh, 1 billion won?

363
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:46,800
If I get injured and break down,

364
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,667
it means the end of my sports career.

365
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:50,933
Wait a minute.

366
00:26:50,933 --> 00:26:54,967
Do you really believe that just because
one egg is broken, it will be that bad?

367
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:57,867
You said I have OCD.

368
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:00,067
That's not jinx, right?

369
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:02,400
It's all psychological.

370
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,867
I'll take care of all the things.

371
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:08,400
Since I don't have time, let's do some
counseling on the way to hospital…

372
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,300
Are you hurt? Apply some ointment first.

373
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,533
Apply it?

374
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:13,067
Does that mean I'll lose tomorrow?

375
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:16,167
No, shake off such thoughts.

376
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,400
Shake them off?

377
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,933
Does that mean I'll be shaken off tomorrow?

378
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:25,633
Oh my.

379
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:33,167
Is this really the jinx-breaking routine?

380
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:34,467
Eating rose tteokbokki?

381
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:36,133
Eat it before it gets cold, okay?

382
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:38,267
I feel dizzy, quickly.

383
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:40,267
Okay.

384
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,233
How is it?

385
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:48,067
Taste good?

386
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:50,133
- Texture?
- Just so so.

387
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:52,867
Sweet and spicy.

388
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:57,400
That's all? Why describe the taste that simple?

389
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,767
I'm not the type to eat something delicious
and then get all excited about it.

390
00:28:00,767 --> 00:28:04,200
I just grab a bite at a convenience store.

391
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,000
That's why you're so thin.

392
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,400
I think the only people who
haven't tried rose tteokbokki

393
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,300
are you and me.

394
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,767
What?

395
00:28:12,767 --> 00:28:14,400
Then, haven't you eaten this?

396
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,033
You said it's a jinx-breaking routine?

397
00:28:18,867 --> 00:28:20,533
Well…

398
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:23,067
Eating with eyes.

399
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:24,767
Second-hand satisfaction.

400
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:26,933
It's fine now, right?

401
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:29,833
The jinx is broken, right?

402
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,267
Mint chocolate croiffle?

403
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:57,267
Better than I thought…

404
00:28:57,267 --> 00:28:59,300
It's delicious, isn't it?

405
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,933
On cheat day, I'm going to go
over this course thoroughly.

406
00:29:03,933 --> 00:29:05,667
Self-management.

407
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:08,967
It must be your own thought,
not the thought of others?

408
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:11,100
It seems you always live
by other people's standard,

409
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,033
not your own.

410
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:14,433
Time for self-reflection?

411
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:15,967
That's a bit of a luxury talk.

412
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:19,533
Is it that you don't know how to do it?

413
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:21,667
It's either you don't examine what you want

414
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:25,667
or you don't know how to.

415
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:28,800
Is it the former or the latter?

416
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:35,667
What are you suddenly doing?

417
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:37,533
It's time for me to exercise.

418
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:39,600
Aren't you going to get up?

419
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:41,867
Looks tasty.

420
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:44,167
Okay, everybody, dive in.

421
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:46,733
Here.

422
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:48,500
Shall I?

423
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,167
If I leave food, I'll be punished, right?

424
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:54,033
- For sure.
- Just get scolded once by Elsa.

425
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:55,667
Thank you for the meal.

The side dishes are tasty, so enjoy them.

Oh, yes.

431
00:30:14,067 --> 00:30:18,300
I had an Eiffel Tower key ring
in my drawer, but it's gone now.

432
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,033
Did you take it by any chance?

433
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:23,933
Do you still keep the key ring that Te O
gave you? I threw it away a long time ago.

00:30:25,267 --> 00:30:29,533
It's strange. It was there just a few days ago.

436

You saw it back then too, didn't you, Lee Goon?

437

I was worried because you didn't look happy.

449
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:15,667
Why are you always focused on other's feelings?

450
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:18,667
Doesn't your own mood matter?

451

Yes, to take you home.

I played with my neighborhood friends.

547
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,967
And I cried because I lost,

548
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:22,000
but then you gave me a shoulder throw.

549
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:28,867
Is this tiny piece of land all you're after?

550
00:37:28,867 --> 00:37:33,867
Look, you should aim for the sky.

551
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:36,767
The cloud is mine.

552
00:37:38,267 --> 00:37:40,133
Then

553
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:43,333
the other cloud is mine.

554
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,933
You can take all the clouds.

555
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:48,633
I'll take the sun.

556
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:52,400
No.

557
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,633
You take the sun as well.

558
00:37:56,133 --> 00:37:57,800
Then, what would you take?

559
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,833
I'll take

560
00:38:00,733 --> 00:38:02,467
the universe.

561
00:38:02,467 --> 00:38:05,200
I'll be a star of the universe.

562
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,533
You will see.

563
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,900
As you will be a star of the universe,

564
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,067
your body will remember soon.

565
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:25,933
Your DNA never lose.

566
00:38:27,633 --> 00:38:30,400
Is there anyone like that?

567
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:33,700
Winning and losing?

568
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,100
So what if you lose?

569
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,100
Myself at that time,

570
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,800
luckily enough,

571
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,933
I simply did well at what I enjoy.

572
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:48,100
Winning is not important.

573
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,400
Really.

574
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,100
What's important is doing something
that makes you truly happy.

575
00:38:55,567 --> 00:39:00,767
Anyway, I should be
a star of the universe, right?

576
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:04,067
Then,

577
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,533
I'll make it happen,

578
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,100
your dream.

579
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:15,233
Why do you achieve my dream?

580
00:39:15,233 --> 00:39:17,867
You should achieve your own dreams.

581
00:39:19,633 --> 00:39:22,233
We can't get all the things.

582
00:39:22,233 --> 00:39:25,500
Work and people.

583
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:29,500
I just need to understand my feelings

584
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,900
and give my best to them.

585
00:39:46,933 --> 00:39:49,133
Just

586
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:51,567
stay within the lines

587
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:55,067
without crossing them.

588
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,400
Hey.

589
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,200
- Hey.
- Yes?

590
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,100
You've crossed the line.

591
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,800
No, I haven't.

592
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,000
Move aside.

593
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,167
Move, now.

594
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:15,133
- Move it.
- Don't be close to me.

595
00:40:15,133 --> 00:40:16,900
- Move.
- Move away.

596
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,433
- Move away.
- It hurts.

597
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:22,267
- Oh my.
- How dare you?

598
00:40:22,267 --> 00:40:24,500
Do you know whose clothes these are? Mine.

599
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,733
I can buy you 100 suits when
I became a star of the universe.

600
00:40:27,733 --> 00:40:29,900
You should wash this one.

601
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,967
Like this?

602
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:37,533
Oh no, it's really…

603
00:40:37,533 --> 00:40:39,933
Oh my.

604
00:40:39,933 --> 00:40:41,733
- That's too bad.
- It's okay.

605
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:45,067
So you got hurt during the part-time job?

606
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:49,500
What a coincidence to come across with Ju Yeon.

607
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,667
Still, it's a relief I didn't get caught.

608
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:56,767
If I'd been caught, things
would be chaotic by now.

609
00:40:56,767 --> 00:40:59,367
Why are you not allowed to work part-time?

610
00:40:59,367 --> 00:41:01,400
She doesn't come home often.

611
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,267
She's somewhat indifferent.

612
00:41:03,267 --> 00:41:05,900
Disappointed with your sister?

613
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,833
It seems like she doesn't like me.

614
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:10,400
I took care of preparing the food,

615
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,667
laid out the blanket for her,

616
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:16,567
and I even asked Seung Hyun not to wake her up.

617
00:41:17,867 --> 00:41:19,900
Ju Yeon.

618
00:41:22,933 --> 00:41:26,300
She's become a completely different person.

619
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,433
Back then, she was so kind.

620
00:41:28,433 --> 00:41:32,300
She was the only one who'd reach
out first when I was being bullied.

621
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,933
She used to make sure everyone got along well.

622
00:41:35,933 --> 00:41:40,100
I thought to myself that I should
become just like her when I grew up.

623
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,967
But now,

624
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:43,900
completely selfish,

625
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,133
ignoring family, only caring about works.

626
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:48,433
She's cold, cynical, blunt, and indifferent.

627
00:41:48,433 --> 00:41:52,100
There's no room to get in, oh my.

628
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:02,833
She's just pretending.

629
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:04,033
Pretending?

630
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:07,433
Even though Ju Yeon seems prickly,

631
00:42:07,433 --> 00:42:11,367
she is actually a very warm-hearted person.

632
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:14,267
She is exactly like her father.

633
00:42:14,267 --> 00:42:17,533
Her father was also a psychiatrist.

634
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:21,300
He especially cared deeply for his patients.

635
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,067
That day,

636
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:27,733
he went out for volunteer work on day-off.

637
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:39,467
Oh my… Dad.

638
00:42:39,467 --> 00:42:43,667
Ju Yeon witnessed the scene.

639
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:49,667
The reason why I'm not
allowed to work part-time jobs

640
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,667
is that she's worried strange
people might harm me.

641
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:59,667
She said her goal

642
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:03,067
was not to become like her father.

643
00:43:03,067 --> 00:43:08,067
But where did that go? She
took after her father in every way.

644
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,467
[Lee Goon]

645
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:45,433
Hmm.

646
00:44:55,933 --> 00:44:58,900
He's sleeping.

647
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:10,433
Lee Goon, that guy, really.

648
00:45:15,733 --> 00:45:18,367
Great job!

649
00:45:18,367 --> 00:45:21,433
Excellent choice. Pass me over.

650
00:45:21,433 --> 00:45:23,467
Back when I was young,

651
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:27,000
my coach told me this.

652
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,467
Skill is important, but you can't
beat someone with good luck.

653
00:45:31,467 --> 00:45:34,500
Cha Si On, you're so lucky.

654
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,100
You've signed a contract with the best agency.

655
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,967
Yes, correct.

656
00:45:38,967 --> 00:45:41,067
It's the best agency.

657
00:45:41,067 --> 00:45:43,367
Why do you say that?

658
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:45,733
[Resignation]

659
00:45:45,733 --> 00:45:49,100
Resignation? Stop joking around
and bring me the contract.

660
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,533
This one? It's our contract.

661
00:45:54,633 --> 00:45:55,900
Your contract?

662
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,700
Yes, I opened an agency.

663
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,000
This agency is monopoly.

664
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,333
So I could

665
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:07,367
dominate all this market.

666
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,700
No, hey, who do you think you are…

667
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,833
Hey.

668
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:18,467
Cha Si On, it's not real, right?

669
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,967
I feel completely satisfied.

670
00:46:28,967 --> 00:46:30,267
You planned this?

671
00:46:30,267 --> 00:46:32,500
You.…

672
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:37,933
What's going on? Is this
Lee Goon I knew before?

673
00:46:37,933 --> 00:46:41,133
Before? Well.

674
00:46:41,133 --> 00:46:45,033
I'm just living for the moment
today, right after Won Bin.

675
00:46:45,033 --> 00:46:47,967
Let's go, little girl.

676
00:46:48,933 --> 00:46:50,267
Oh.

677
00:46:50,267 --> 00:46:53,400
Thank you for your meeting room.

678
00:46:56,033 --> 00:46:57,867
I'll inform all the journalists!

679
00:46:57,867 --> 00:46:58,933
Let's see who wins.

680
00:46:58,933 --> 00:47:01,033
I'll inform them Cha Si On is injured now.

681
00:47:01,033 --> 00:47:07,200
[Tennis Queen Cha Si On! Suspended
Due to Injury! Will Focus on Rehabilitation]

682
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:12,333
Mister.

683
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:15,533
Is it okay spending money on
rehab without any income?

684
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:20,133
Do you know what to do
if you fall while running?

685
00:47:20,133 --> 00:47:22,767
You need to adjust your shoelaces
to fit your feet properly.

686
00:47:22,767 --> 00:47:25,867
Otherwise, you'll fall down again.

687
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,700
So cool!

688
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,800
You just prepare to be a star of the universe.

689
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,767
I've already started.

690
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,800
Let's go.

691
00:47:36,967 --> 00:47:40,733
Professor Han, help yourself as you work hard.

692
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:41,767
Yes, thank you.

693
00:47:41,767 --> 00:47:43,000
Is the R&D on track?

694
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,433
Of course.

695
00:47:45,433 --> 00:47:50,800
Isn't this all thanks to the Minister's
enthusiastic support?

696
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,933
I was about to talk about the budget approval.

697
00:47:53,933 --> 00:47:57,433
I heard the documentation hasn't been ready.

698
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,833
Documentation?

699
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:06,000
The documentation that
you received from the U.K.

700
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:11,633
I'm sorry.

701
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,233
Oh, sorry.

702
00:48:18,233 --> 00:48:21,633
Kyung Ju Yeon, haven't you sent it yet?

703
00:48:24,467 --> 00:48:26,800
That is…

704
00:48:28,533 --> 00:48:31,267
It's my fault.

705
00:48:31,267 --> 00:48:33,433
Since the due date of budget is today,

706
00:48:33,433 --> 00:48:36,867
we should organize it today to
facilitate receiving next year's budget.

707
00:48:36,867 --> 00:48:41,100
There was something wrong.

708
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,200
I'll send it by fast delivery within today.

709
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,867
Kyung Ju Yeon, you've heard it?

710
00:48:46,867 --> 00:48:49,033
Today… by today?

711
00:48:49,033 --> 00:48:51,067
Yeah.

712
00:48:51,067 --> 00:48:53,967
I'll serve for you.

713
00:48:53,967 --> 00:48:58,633
No. I need a hard copy with
an official seal on it, not an email.

714
00:48:58,633 --> 00:49:02,700
I need that as soon as possible.
Can you send it by air freight today?

715
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:06,700
What? It takes that long to reissue?

716
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:10,967
Can I speak to profess…
Professor's off the work?

717
00:49:10,967 --> 00:49:13,800
It drives me crazy.

718
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:18,433
Please, is there any way to reissue it quickly?

719
00:49:18,433 --> 00:49:19,800
Call again tomorrow?

720
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,867
Hello?

721
00:49:21,867 --> 00:49:23,867
Uh?

722
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,633
It's driving me nuts.

723
00:49:25,633 --> 00:49:28,600
How could I have completely forgotten that?

724
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,533
I've been so out of it these past few days.

725
00:49:31,533 --> 00:49:34,567
He probably doesn't even remember it.

726
00:49:34,567 --> 00:49:36,100
Should I talk to his guardians?

727
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,167
What to tell, then?

728
00:49:39,167 --> 00:49:40,833
Let's just die, Kyung Ju Yeon.

729
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:43,600
Die, die!

730
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,500
Dr. Kyung.

731
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,800
I'm a little bit busy now.

732
00:50:01,133 --> 00:50:04,400
I can't ask him honestly, for real.

733
00:50:06,767 --> 00:50:08,900
Lee Shin.

734
00:50:09,533 --> 00:50:11,367
Nurse Song!

735
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:13,000
- Yes.
- Do you have Lee Shin's phone number?

736
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,200
Is Lee Shin's counselling today?

737
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,633
The player Lee Shin?

738
00:50:17,633 --> 00:50:19,600
He's busy now.

739
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,567
We're cheering him as
the final game is on live.

740
00:50:22,567 --> 00:50:25,467
- Yes.
- Oh, right.

741
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:26,700
Parents.

742
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,867
Is the guardian of Lee Goon
in the hospital room?

743
00:50:31,633 --> 00:50:33,700
They are…

744
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,500
Hello, the guardian.

745
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,933
I'm Kyung Ju Yeon,
the psychiatrist of Lee Goon.

746
00:51:05,933 --> 00:51:09,033
No, nothing particular,

747
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:11,967
but I need the patient's ID copy

748
00:51:11,967 --> 00:51:15,667
out of the subject's experiment documentation.

749
00:51:15,667 --> 00:51:19,400
Goon's new ID is at home.

750
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,667
Nobody is at home because of the final game.

751
00:51:22,667 --> 00:51:25,500
I'll bring the ID in the evening
after the competition.

752
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,633
I'm so sorry, but I really need it right now.

753
00:51:28,633 --> 00:51:30,200
If you don't mind,

754
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,433
would it be okay for my staff to
pick it up directly from your house?

755
00:51:34,433 --> 00:51:37,067
It is a really urgent case.

756
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,433
We appreciate it, then.

757
00:51:40,433 --> 00:51:44,800
I'll text the front door password to you.

758
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,500
Yes, thank you so much.

759
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,333
The doctor in charge is handling
the paperwork as well.

760
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,833
Is it that you don't know how to do it?

761
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:08,967
It's either you don't examine what you want

762
00:52:08,967 --> 00:52:12,900
or you don't know how to.

763
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:17,433
Then whose thoughts matter?

764
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:19,867
It's your life.

765
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:29,200
Why do you achieve my dream?

766
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,733
You should achieve your own dreams.

767
00:52:44,533 --> 00:52:46,567
Eh…

768
00:52:47,133 --> 00:52:48,167
Shin.

769
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:50,367
Well…

770
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,600
Something that I want…

771
00:53:10,867 --> 00:53:13,900
Oh, it is urgent,

772
00:53:15,533 --> 00:53:17,033
What shall I do? What if I get caught?

773
00:53:17,033 --> 00:53:19,333
Arrested? Go to jail?

774
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,900
Kyung Ju Yeon, pull yourself together.

775
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,967
This is all for the patients and for
the future of brain science in Korea.

776
00:53:26,967 --> 00:53:29,400
Yes, I'm sorry about telling a lie,

777
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,067
but I'm just picking up my stuff, right?

778
00:53:31,067 --> 00:53:32,933
Yes.

779
00:53:32,933 --> 00:53:35,000
Okay, okay.

780
00:54:21,567 --> 00:54:24,667
I'm so nervous, like I might die.

781
00:54:25,933 --> 00:54:28,467
You scared me!

782
00:54:28,467 --> 00:54:31,767
I didn't know about the dog.

783
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:36,667
Hi,

784
00:54:36,667 --> 00:54:38,733
I'm not a thief.

785
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:42,767
Do you possibly bite?

786
00:54:43,633 --> 00:54:47,167
Gosh, you startled me.

787
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:50,167
You scared me.

788
00:54:51,133 --> 00:54:52,400
Still sleeping.

789
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,133
Hasn't Lee Goon gone to the rehab room today?

790
00:54:54,133 --> 00:54:57,000
He was sleeping earlier. I'll wake him up now.

791
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,133
Okay.

792
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:01,167
Oh my.

793
00:55:01,967 --> 00:55:03,967
Hey!

794
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,167
Who are you?

795
00:55:06,167 --> 00:55:09,200
I'm awfully sorry.

796
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,833
Lee Goon!

797
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:13,067
[Nurse Song]
You'll be scolded if your master knows.

798
00:55:13,067 --> 00:55:16,533
What are you doing,
greeting strangers like this?

799
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,033
It seems that this whole room is Lee Shin's.

800
00:55:48,433 --> 00:55:51,367
The luggage is…

801
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:03,367
Welcome, how much do you want?

802
00:56:03,367 --> 00:56:05,100
Full with premium.

803
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,333
It looks like a coupon?

804
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:13,900
Oh, my mistake.

805
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,100
I'll come back later.

806
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:18,000
This is a gift for you.

807
00:56:24,267 --> 00:56:27,567
Mental coaching and personal stuff next week.

808
00:56:27,567 --> 00:56:29,433
Why did you stop serving?

809
00:56:29,433 --> 00:56:31,900
You've managed to win.

810
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,000
Well,

811
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,033
from today on, let's immediately
increase the time for serving lessons.

812
00:56:40,033 --> 00:56:42,433
I need rescheduling with the trainer.

813
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:46,000
No, today we have a meeting with ad agency.

814
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,367
Hey, Shin.

815
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:49,000
What did you say?

816
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,467
I don't care about making money.
I care about getting better.

817
00:56:53,467 --> 00:56:54,967
Hello?

818
00:56:54,967 --> 00:56:56,367
Yes, it's me.

819
00:56:56,367 --> 00:56:58,900
Have you seen Shin's game today?

820
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,000
I must leave.

821
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,133
Hey, but…

822
00:57:01,133 --> 00:57:03,933
What 'but'?

823
00:57:03,933 --> 00:57:06,333
Leaving here?

824
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:09,333
Where are you going? You are
supposed to meet the coach today.

825
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:12,700
I feel like to take a shower
and get some sleep.

826
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:15,133
By my own decision.

827
00:57:15,133 --> 00:57:16,733
Hey, Lee Shin!

828
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:19,200
Can't you hear your mom? Lee Shin!

829
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,433
He needs a break too.

830
00:57:20,433 --> 00:57:23,467
On my. You are spoiling him!

831
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,567
Where is it? Why isn't it here?

832
00:57:27,567 --> 00:57:30,433
Strange, really, wait.

833
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:35,300
This is a rest room.

834
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,000
Here is one more door.

835
00:57:41,033 --> 00:57:44,833
Excuse me.

836
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:52,533
No, it isn't here. It's driving me crazy.

837
00:57:52,533 --> 00:57:54,767
No, wait a second.

838
00:57:54,767 --> 00:57:55,933
How many doors are here?

839
00:57:55,933 --> 00:57:58,233
Where is it?

840
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,100
Yes! It's mine.

841
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:00,000
Thank you so much.

842
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,200
Let's go now.

843
00:59:03,533 --> 00:59:07,500
Thanks. Keep it a secret to your master.

Did you come here to find your
old memory by any chance?

857
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:39,833
Are you curious about me?

858
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:41,767
I'm curious about you, more than myself.

859
01:00:41,767 --> 01:00:43,133
You're not allowed to go
out without a guardian.

860
01:00:43,133 --> 01:00:44,800
So, are you my guardian today?

861
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,100
A medical guardian.

862
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,067
Don't ever touch my stuff again.

863
01:00:48,067 --> 01:00:50,400
Shouldn't the patient be told what the test is?

864
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,500
I'll take the responsibility.

865
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,800
Make sure nothing gets
out of the operating room.

866
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,933
Today's test is a top secret.

867
01:00:54,933 --> 01:00:56,333
What have you done with the subject?

868
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:57,800
Please stay out of my business.

869
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,867
It doesn't matter since you have no
emotional attachment to the patient.

870
01:00:59,867 --> 01:01:01,667
Dr. Kyung, we're in trouble.

871
01:01:01,667 --> 01:01:02,767
The patient Lee Goon…

872
01:01:02,767 --> 01:01:04,567
I should have been on his side.

873
01:01:04,567 --> 01:01:06,567
I should have protected him.

874
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:10,000
Let's stop here, both of us.
