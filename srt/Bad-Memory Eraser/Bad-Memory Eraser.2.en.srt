[We followed the production guidelines
when filming child actors and animals.]

3
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:53,067
Good.

4
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:56,900
Cortisol goes down, serotonin goes up,

5
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,800
and the clinical results
for number 109 are good.

6
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,433
Number 108, whose clinical trial
started on the same day…

7
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:06,800
Hey.

8
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,433
It really wasn't because of me, right?

9
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:20,167
If the clinical trial is successful,
all the bad memories

10
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:23,433
and memories about me will be forgotten.

11
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:25,467
Yeah.

12
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,500
Are you going to visit the patient
again? You should go home today.

13
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Yes.

14
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,033
Your mother has called you several times.

15
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,833
Just for 15 days and nights…

16
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,767
You, no…

17
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:41,867
Lee Goon?

18
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:44,900
You wake up?

19
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,433
Do you know where this is?

20
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,967
Mr. Lee, do you remember anything?

21
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:55,733
Do you remember why you are here?

22
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,133
Do you remember who I am?

23
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:06,567
Do you recognize me?

24
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:12,600
Who do you think I am?

25
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,933
Are you okay?

26
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,967
Finally…

27
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:30,733
Finally we met.

28
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,600
Hello?

29
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,033
My first love!

30
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:37,333
What… What are you saying?

31
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:41,767
I'm your… first… first… what?

32
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:46,867
I've been looking for you desperately.

33
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:50,033
Excuse me, just a moment.

34
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:53,467
Who do you think I am?

35
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,433
- Goon!
- Goon.

36
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:02,933
Are you okay?

37
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:06,300
Do you recognize us?

38
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,167
Doctor, is he alright?

39
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,033
It's perfect.

40
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:22,100
Even with FMRI, the amygdala's ability
to store bad memories is completely stopped.

41
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,267
Hormone levels are also more
complete than in mouse clinical trials.

42
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:27,167
Hello, my first love.

43
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,233
My first love.

44
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:32,067
Hello, my first love.

45
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:35,800
I'm his first love? I must
have heard it wrong, right?

46
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,100
Hello, my first love.

47
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,600
What if I didn't hear it wrong?

48
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,033
Symptoms of delirium?

49
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:45,367
Are there any side effects?

50
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:48,500
Kyung Ju Yeon!

51
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,533
Yes?

52
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:52,100
Finally! Finally, we made it!

53
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,267
We erased the bad memories!

54
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:58,567
The data is perfect and there
seem to be no side effects.

55
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:01,800
Wait, I'll report to
the hospital director first.

56
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,000
We're not at the reporting stage yet…

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,633
Human testing is not animal testing,
and a detailed interview comes first.

58
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:12,000
She's right.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,767
I want to brag about this achievement quickly.

[Episode 2, Unexpected First Love]

61
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,300
What?

62
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:41,900
Goon, are you alright?

63
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,200
Goon, what's your name?

64
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,600
You just told him the name.

65
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,567
Do you recognize who we are?

66
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,833
You two are sculptors, right?

67
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,267
What?

68
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:03,800
A sculptor? A sculptor who sculpts?

69
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,333
Since you gave birth to a sculptural handsome
man like me, aren't you a sculptor?

70
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:15,500
Isn't it so obvious that it's no fun?

71
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:20,567
Do you remember that you got hurt?

72
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:24,733
Did I get hurt?

73
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:28,200
With these long legs,

74
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,867
white skin,

75
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:32,900
and,

76
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:38,233
perfect six-pack abs, where did I get hurt?

77
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:40,900
Did he say 'six-pack abs'?

78
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:49,533
- Why?
- Why? Are you sick?

79
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:53,600
- Call a doctor now.
- Doctor? Nurse?

80
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,233
Luckily, my face wasn't hurt.

81
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:07,867
What's this?

82
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:11,100
Oh… Don't touch that.

83
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,467
That's because you hurt your head a little bit.

84
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:18,100
You had minor surgery, but you'll be fine.

85
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,133
You.

86
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:23,200
Finally, you're back as my friend Lee Goon.

87
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,300
You're back!

88
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,500
Do you remember?

89
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,133
When is your last memory?

90
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:43,267
What I remember clearly is
the Junior World Championship finals.

91
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:45,133
I won, right?

92
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:47,467
Only the bad memories

93
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,133
have been erased.

94
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:53,700
Stability is important right now,
so take it slow.

95
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,000
They say amnesia is a common
aftereffect of an accident.

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,467
Everyone, please stop giving him
so much headache.

97
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,133
Aftereffects of an accident?

98
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:03,600
What accident happened?

99
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,400
Oh, well. That…

100
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:10,500
You fell down the stairs.

101
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:13,033
On the stairs of your house.

102
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:15,133
Stairs?

103
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,767
Did I fall down the stairs?

104
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:20,033
Stairs…

105
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,333
Really?

106
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:26,067
Is the brain science research center
finally accomplishing something successful?

107
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:27,667
Shh.

108
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:30,100
It's still a secret.

109
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,633
Well, I'm expecting at least one small award.

110
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:37,200
A Nobel Prize?

111
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:44,900
The brain center was making a loss,
so I was going to close it down.

112
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,000
There are no mistakes this time, right?

113
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,567
Last time, that lab rat was also…

114
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:50,900
Oh, don't worry.

115
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,400
We plan to isolate the subjects and closely

116
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,800
observe him 24 hours a day for 100 days.

117
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:08,067
There is no mention of first love
in the counseling records.

118
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:10,733
I'm thinking about going to

119
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:15,267
the alumni association
and meeting my first love.

120
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:18,200
He went to find his first love,
but why is his first love me?

121
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,733
Is that a real side effect?

122
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:22,833
It drives me crazy.

123
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:28,567
Mom made it, so eat a lot.

124
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:35,933
We shouldn't run into each other when people
are around until I check it out in person.

125
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:39,400
The subject must never be aware of

126
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,833
the experiment or of his past.

127
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:46,433
Until things stabilize, he shouldn't meet
anyone who reminds him of the past.

128
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:50,567
You said you'd only erase bad memories,
but why did you erase so many memories?

129
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:54,233
This is proof that everything
recently has been a bad memory.

130
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:57,967
All he remembers are good memories.

131
00:09:57,967 --> 00:10:00,033
Sports related, friends.

132
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,800
But family was…

133
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,100
It was only part of it…

134
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,533
Did he by any chance have someone he loved?

135
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:13,667
A girlfriend or a woman he liked.

136
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:17,133
Well, that…

137
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:19,967
Do you know anything?

138
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:22,600
- You're his friend.
- What?

139
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:26,133
Well.

140
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:27,567
I'm not sure.

141
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:29,100
He doesn't know anything about him.

142
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,000
Are you sure there are no side effects?

143
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,800
Yes, so far it is still like that.

144
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,900
Clinical trials are unpredictable.

145
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,000
The guardian said he would take the risk.

146
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,133
Yeah, I said that.

147
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:47,833
I was the first to ask for the clinical trial.

148
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,800
Did you?

149
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,167
Why?

150
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:54,433
Then what if something big happens.

151
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:58,367
You all know why your son
was brought to the hospital, right?

152
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:01,400
Isn't it because every day feels like hell

153
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,767
that he made such an extreme choice?

154
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:07,933
Here are the results from today's test.

155
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:10,567
Your son is now

156
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:12,267
reborn as he was

157
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:16,133
before he had any bad memories.

158
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,367
These deep,

159
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:27,100
profound,

160
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,000
and addictive eyes.

161
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,200
Hey, guys.

162
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,400
You guys are also intoxicated by my scent.

163
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,533
Patient.

164
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,567
I'll measure your pulse and blood pressure.

165
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:08,400
Don't you need to take your pulse?

166
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,200
I think you got a heart pounding because of me.

167
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,100
I guess you're bored.

168
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,667
What? First love…

169
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,267
I must have misheard.

170
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:34,767
Yeah, I must have misheard.

171
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:37,733
What are you doing here?

172
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:41,267
I think you were looking for me unofficially.

173
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:43,400
Mr. Lee, please listen carefully.

174
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,867
I'm your doctor, not your first love.

175
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:48,733
I don't know the exact reason,
but you were mistaken for a moment.

176
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:49,833
Am I mistaken?

177
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:54,567
Yes, you and I are just doctor and patient.
That's all there is to it.

178
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:58,400
You really don't know me?

179
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,267
I saw you for the first time
in the operating room.

180
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:04,267
Well.

181
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:08,767
My face is so memorable.
How could you not remember it?

182
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,267
Do you really not remember?

183
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:11,467
What are you saying?

184
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:13,600
This doesn't make sense…

185
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,633
Shh.

186
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,567
It's so hard.

187
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,667
I can't even take a rest.

188
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,400
Will you

189
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,967
- give me a massage later?
- Massage?

190
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:34,533
Where, where?

191
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:39,500
Other than the lips.

192
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:42,600
No.

193
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,400
A little further down?

194
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,133
Oh my, why are you gulping? Why?

195
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:51,967
Pervert.

196
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:54,733
What are you thinking? Calf! Calf!

197
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,233
Oh, calf!

198
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,700
I'll call you back.

199
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:07,600
Is anyone there?

200
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:10,533
It's not opening.

201
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:12,167
Why isn't the door opening?

202
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:16,933
First of all, you must not
tell anyone about this!

203
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:19,933
Open it.

204
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:22,900
We were all alone

205
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,900
in this narrow room without anyone knowing.

206
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,267
Is it okay if that's known?

207
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:30,633
What?

208
00:14:30,633 --> 00:14:33,467
It just seems like a doctor
talking quietly with a patient.

209
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:34,800
Yeah?

210
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,200
Then, I'll open it.

211
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,533
Yes, open it.

212
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:40,633
Oh, Dr. Tae Oh?

213
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:43,567
- What are you doing?
- It's not opening?

214
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:45,567
Yes.

215
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
What's wrong with the door?

216
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:55,800
Push it now, quickly!

217
00:14:57,167 --> 00:15:01,033
His bad memories are erased,
but his wrist is still the same?

218
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:06,033
Then the experiment wasn't perfect?

219
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:07,500
Why aren't you pushing with your right hand?

220
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,633
Because this one hand is enough.

221
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:15,367
It's not opening.

222
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:18,300
This won't work. I'll have to call security.

223
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,667
- Hello?
- What should we do?

224
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:22,633
- Yes, security, right?
- Go in there.

225
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,567
In that laundry basket?

226
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:29,033
In that unsanitary, germ-filled ball of fabric

227
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:32,167
that might have been worn by some patients?

228
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:35,167
If I go in there, I might get
sick that I didn't have before.

229
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,533
Or, you can go in yourself.

230
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:39,000
Don't you know the spirit of chivalry?

231
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,267
Don't you know the spirit of doctor?

232
00:15:40,267 --> 00:15:43,533
I am a patient, look.

233
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:44,633
Well.

234
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:46,600
Can't you even do that

235
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,333
for your first love who you've
been waiting for so long?

236
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,333
I love you,

237
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,033
but I love myself more?

238
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,733
Then let's play rock, paper, scissors.

239
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:12,800
Oh, yes.

240
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:20,633
- Okay, Professor, I understand.
- Someone was inside.

241
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:22,933
What happened?

242
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,133
Senior, didn't you say you were
going to have a family interview?

243
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:30,867
The guardians are waiting.

244
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:32,733
Yeah, I should go.

245
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:36,367
Have you checked the sterile room feces?
Have you not finished the statistical report?

246
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:38,400
I'll check it right away.

247
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:44,200
- I'll go.
- Yes.

248
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,433
Still, I'm glad the result
of the surgery was good.

249
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:10,433
Right.

250
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,467
You go to the court now.
This season is so important.

251
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:17,900
Well,

252
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,467
you should warm up your body
by adding night time PT.

253
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:24,067
- Yes.
- He's not having a baby or something.

254
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:26,133
How does he always warm up his body?

255
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:28,500
He has to get some rest.

256
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,800
The more you relax, the more
flexible your body becomes.

257
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,900
Go.

258
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,367
Wait, Goon is…

259
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:36,467
ADR, oh, PCR, PCR.

260
00:17:36,467 --> 00:17:38,733
Just stay still.

261
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,900
You go now.

262
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,867
I'm Shin's mom. When will
Goon's inspection be over?

263
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:53,033
Isn't he in the hospital room?

264
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:55,067
What?

265
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,700
What should we do? We're dead.

266
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:03,567
Strangely, I get so angry when I
check out other people's social media.

267
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:05,633
When I get angry, I drink a glass of makgeolli,

268
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:08,967
and after drinking, my face gets even rougher,

269
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:10,267
so I get angry again.

270
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:12,333
Dr. Kyung.

271
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:15,133
As a result,

272
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:18,100
I think I have anger management issues.

273
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:21,567
You said you were suffering from depression
6 months ago, panic disorder 4 months ago,

274
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,533
and anger management disorder this week.

275
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:27,133
You are self-diagnosing.

276
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:32,300
Should I quit social media?

277
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,167
This week, please quit social media.

278
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:37,000
Make sure to see the morning
sunlight and exercise regularly.

279
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,200
Don't think of it as holding
back from being angry,

280
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,667
but first think about whether something
is enough to make you angry…

281
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:44,633
Ju Yeon, it's emergency.
The subject has escaped.

282
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:50,033
Yeah, that social media was the problem.

283
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:52,733
There's nothing without a reason.

284
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,467
Then, Dr. Kyung. See you next week.

285
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,933
- Goodbye.
- Yes.

286
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:59,933
Goodbye.

287
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:04,867
Yeah.

288
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:07,600
There's a reason for everything.

289
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,067
Why did he…

290
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:12,667
You must not touch anything.

291
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:27,767
What if the memories were manipulated
at the moment they were erased?

292
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,433
Goon.

293
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:11,000
You look so handsome.

294
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,233
One, two, three.

295
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:33,367
When will my memories come back?

296
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,467
I don't know.

297
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,300
I won't mind the dog.

298
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:04,267
I don't like it.

299
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:07,800
Is this something a person
wears? I don't like it.

300
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,533
I feel like my eyesight is deteriorating.

301
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:15,867
The color should be gorgeous

302
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:20,500
and beautiful like this.

303
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,500
I also like it.

304
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,567
Awesome, it's cool.

305
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:33,533
Spectacle, suspense, thriller,

306
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:38,300
road movie, lovely, real erotically cool.

307
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,067
What is that ugly dog?

308
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:44,900
It's not your fault you're ugly, but

309
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,433
it's your fault for not dressing up.

310
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:02,167
Cola.

311
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
What?

312
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,300
Why am I crying?

313
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:38,333
Hey.

314
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,333
Hey?

315
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,300
This is ridiculous.

316
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,833
Brother! Call me 'brother'.

317
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,833
Brother.

318
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:52,800
This is a male.

319
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,733
How did you find the house?
Do you remember the password?

320
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:57,733
Here it is.

321
00:22:57,733 --> 00:23:00,867
Your ID, your card key.

322
00:23:00,867 --> 00:23:02,000
When did you take mine?

323
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,567
There was no bathtub

324
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:05,800
in the hospital.

325
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,400
I have to take a half-body bath like this

326
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,900
to get my blood circulation like this.

327
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,767
No matter how I look at it, this isn't my room.

328
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:18,600
The interior is crude.

329
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,300
Didn't I have an eye for interior?

330
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,400
What?

331
00:23:26,033 --> 00:23:28,100
It's your room.

332
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,600
That expensive watch on your wrist is yours,

333
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,733
and that designer suit you wore
just once during fashion week

334
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:36,767
is also yours…

335
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,633
The eldest son of the family has returned, but…

336
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:42,933
Doesn't he say hello to me?

337
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:46,100
You educate him again.

338
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,867
Otherwise, he'll sleep in the hot when
it's hot and in the cold when it's cold.

339
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,000
What should I do because
I feel anxious every day?

340
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,667
I guess the clinical trials were for nothing.

341
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:02,000
He brightened up though.

342
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,567
Even though he's a bit narcissistic
now, it's good to have a self-esteem.

343
00:24:05,567 --> 00:24:08,167
And do you see this?

344
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:11,467
The luggage that Goon brought
back from England is still unpacked.

345
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:12,667
We've been

346
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:16,867
so indifferent to Goon all this time.

347
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,000
But that doesn't mean he can
play tennis again after 15 years.

348
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,900
Goon, Goon.

349
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,967
Goon.

350
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:42,667
Is he that handsome because he looks like me?

351
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:45,633
Why are you suddenly wearing Shin's clothes…

352
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:52,067
The hospital was teeming with germs,
so I washed up to feel refreshed.

353
00:24:52,067 --> 00:24:55,100
But why did you just leave
the hospital without saying anything?

354
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,400
Everyone is worried.

355
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,933
Right.

356
00:24:58,933 --> 00:25:02,067
Coffee. Thank you.

357
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,767
Well.

358
00:25:04,767 --> 00:25:07,000
What are you going to do if you
suddenly come out and collapse

359
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,233
as soon as you wake up like this?

360
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:13,167
Yeah, there's chaos right now because
you disappeared from the hospital.

361
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:16,333
I thought that coming home would help me

362
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:19,000
regain my lost memories.

363
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,167
But,

364
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:23,933
did I fall down those stairs
and have an accident?

365
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:27,633
Oh, I think you misstepped.

366
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,800
Didn't I fall into the Han river?

367
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
- No.
- No.

368
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,700
No, it's not.

369
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,033
Make me an espresso.

370
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:41,267
Ethiopian Yirgacheffe single origin.

371
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:43,467
Yeah.

372
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,667
By the way,

373
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:50,833
I just remember playing tennis.

374
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:53,933
How have I been doing lately?

375
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:58,067
You were just like you are now.

376
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:02,200
Looking at the racket makes me feel…

377
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:08,633
Well,

378
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,200
tennis…

379
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,067
Oh, I was going to tell you
that when you got settled.

380
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:17,400
Well, you'll find out anyway,
so your mom will tell you.

381
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,933
Why is this so messy?

382
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:24,367
You…

383
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:26,633
You retired as a tennis player.

384
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:31,767
You wanted to learn how to run a company.

385
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:35,100
So, after graduating from college,
you joined a sports agency.

386
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,067
The agency that Shin belongs to.

387
00:26:37,067 --> 00:26:40,633
Running a company?

388
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:42,167
[Big Picture Agency Manager, Lee Goon]

389
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,167
Agency Manager.

390
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:47,733
You just quit exercising, but you're too smart.

391
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:50,633
That's not all. Besides that…

392
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,133
You had a very clear presence.

393
00:26:58,133 --> 00:27:00,433
Plus,

394
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:02,867
you were popular.

395
00:27:02,867 --> 00:27:05,467
What is this?

396
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:10,000
Not only for women but also for men.

397
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:14,800
Well, it's not different

398
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,567
from what I expected.

399
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,100
I'm sure you're happy

400
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,433
to have a son like me.

401
00:27:26,367 --> 00:27:29,400
Isn't that my suitcase?

402
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,667
- It's something I treasured.
- Oh, this is…

403
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:33,367
I borrowed it for a while.

404
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:36,400
I'll wipe it.

405
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,700
Well then,

406
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,300
I'll go to the hospital first.

407
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,367
This also needs to be changed.

408
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:47,400
Well then.

409
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,567
Who should I hang out with today?

410
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:55,000
Is it you?

411
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,567
No, it's not.

412
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:59,233
Is it you?

413
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,733
It's you today.

414
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:13,833
Oh, it's good.

415
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:16,567
You and I have to wear these sunglasses

416
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:19,400
because it's so dazzling.

417
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,567
I wish you had listened
to me earlier like this.

418
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:25,667
You're so shy.

419
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:28,967
It took so long.

420
00:28:28,967 --> 00:28:31,433
I'm leaving.

421
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,267
Where did this go wrong?

422
00:28:36,267 --> 00:28:38,533
Right.

423
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:42,967
What are you talking about?

424
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:45,667
An error occurred during the clinical trial?

425
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:47,467
It's my fault.

426
00:28:47,467 --> 00:28:50,767
I think some of the memories were
reconstructed as some disappeared.

427
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:54,833
So he mistook you for his first love?

428
00:28:57,233 --> 00:28:59,867
Oh, my.

429
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:03,233
How about being honest with the subject
and finding another subject?

430
00:29:03,233 --> 00:29:04,967
If it doesn't work out, I'll do it.

431
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:09,000
Research is important, but
we can't ignore side effects.

432
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,467
This was barely approved
by the ethics committee.

433
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:18,400
The prerequisite is that 'the subject
must be in an extreme situation'.

434
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,967
Even if the study is stopped, side
effects cannot be hidden from him.

435
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:25,167
He is a patient I have been
observing for over ten years.

436
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:27,367
He went from being a promising tennis player

437
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:30,533
to living in his brother's shadow for a moment.

438
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:34,633
He eventually became so pessimistic
that he even attempted suicide.

439
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:39,500
He has finally found his
life through clinical trials.

440
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,567
Ju Yeon, Ju Yeon.

441
00:29:47,033 --> 00:29:52,567
As you said, the patient's life depends on it.

442
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,933
How could we tell him to go back to the way
he was before because of misunderstanding?

443
00:29:57,933 --> 00:30:00,067
Lee Goon.

444

[Treatment Room]

445
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:07,533
So are you telling me to lie
and pretend to be that woman?

446
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:09,700
I'm not saying that because
this experiment is a waste.

447
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,167
It would be a waste of an opportunity
for that patient to miss out on.

448
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:15,200
What did he look like when you
saw him? Didn't he look happy?

449
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,933
What kind of life does the patient want?

450
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,967
All treatments have side effects,

451
00:30:20,967 --> 00:30:24,900
and it is the doctor's role
and duty to resolve them.

452
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,367
Just for the time being, until
we find the cause of the error.

453
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:29,900
Even though…

454
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,233
What do you think will happen
if this experiment is stopped?

455
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:35,300
We can't even find the cause of the error.

456
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,000
Let's somehow find the cause and fix it.

457
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,367
We can do that. I'll do that.

458
00:30:41,367 --> 00:30:46,300
Of course, I will follow your decision,

459
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,967
but as the attending physician of a patient
whom I have been watching for over 10 years,

460
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:55,267
I ask you to take care of him.

461
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:07,100
Oh my, I haven't even started yet.

462
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,067
Why are you making such a fuss?

463
00:31:11,533 --> 00:31:13,933
Well…

464
00:31:13,933 --> 00:31:16,867
What do women think of a man in a suit?

465
00:31:16,867 --> 00:31:21,767
If you go out without permission again,

466
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:25,133
I might do something to this suit.

467
00:31:30,267 --> 00:31:32,467
- Stay still!
- Nurse.

468
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:34,000
Aren't you deliberately
making it hurt more right now?

469
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,433
I have to work overtime because of you,
so you have to put up with this much.

470
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:41,633
Dr. Kyung has been guarding

471
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:45,233
your hospital room without resting a single day

472
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:47,533
since the day you had surgery.

473
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:51,900
So listen to her, please!

474
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:08,600
Have you decided to meet her?

475
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,767
Your first love?

476
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:15,433
Aren't you so traumatized that

477
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:19,000
you're even afraid of meeting your first love?

478
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,533
Because bad memories can
be offset by good memories

479
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:24,500
once you meet her without being afraid.

480
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:28,533
What if even good memories
turn into bad memories?

481
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:30,900
Will you take responsibility?

482
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:34,500
He said that his first love was a good memory,

483
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,833
but why did he want to erase it all?

Yes, no.

486
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,100
It's because I'm busy.

487
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,600
You practically live in the lab.

488
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,500
Why don't you change
your address there instead?

489
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,633
They say that other families'
daughters just go shopping

490
00:33:02,633 --> 00:33:05,267
with their mothers and help with housework.

491
00:33:05,267 --> 00:33:06,867
I make money for you.

492
00:33:06,867 --> 00:33:11,300
What keeps a psychiatrist busy at night?

493
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:16,200
Have you met a man recently?

494
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,833
Sorry, sorry. If that's the case,
I won't bother you again.

495
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:21,667
Yeah. I'm seeing a guy, so don't bother me.

496
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:24,233
I don't believe you.

497
00:33:24,867 --> 00:33:29,067
Don't you just throw your bra everywhere
and go braless in your workroom

498
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:31,933
like you do at home?

499
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:33,633
How did she know that?

500
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:36,533
In everything else, you resemble me,

501
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:41,200
but your chest resembles your father.

502
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,733
How can my breasts resemble my father's?

503
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:47,500
Don't say something like that anywhere.

504
00:33:48,633 --> 00:33:51,100
You scared me!

505
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,333
Mom, hang up.

506
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,033
How much of the call did you hear?

507
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:05,900
You heard it all.

508
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,233
What did you say?

509
00:34:07,233 --> 00:34:08,600
Didn't you hear it?

510
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,467
I said your chest resembles your father's.

511
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:14,867
- It would be nice if you were like me.
- Hang up, hang up.

512
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,333
But why do you talk to
my mother-in-law like that?

513
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,767
Why do you call my mom like that?
Did you have a dream while sleeping?

514
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:23,167
Yes, I dreamed.

515
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:26,133
I had a dream that I have to get
married when I find my first love.

516
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:27,633
Yes, live well with your first love.

517
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:30,633
But I'm not your first love.

518
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:34,900
You're not my first love or my doctor,

519
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,000
but you've been by my side for days,

520
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,433
from the day I had surgery

521
00:34:40,433 --> 00:34:43,133
until now. Why is that?

522
00:34:43,133 --> 00:34:45,667
Why is that?

523
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,333
I heard you were there 24 hours
a day, excluding clinic hours,

524
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:51,000
so did you even help me go to the bathroom?

525
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,867
If I had a girlfriend,

526
00:34:54,867 --> 00:34:59,767
she would have misunderstood
you very, very much.

527
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,900
I'm afraid you might have been waiting for me,

528
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,433
so I'm telling you to drink
this and get some sleep.

529
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:15,433
It's hot, it's hot, get it now.

530
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:16,533
Take it.

531
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:18,733
Put it down there.

532
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:23,500
Oh, I thought of you, but
you're being so cold to me.

533
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,167
You still don't remember me?

534
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,000
You don't have to remember me.

535
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,333
Because I remember you.

536
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:45,233
It feels like my body doesn't remember

537
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:47,933
the lost memories,

538
00:35:47,933 --> 00:35:50,100
but my mind remembers them.

539
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,133
No,

540
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,967
is it that the body remembers
but the mind doesn't?

541
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:03,833
I'll remember someday. It doesn't matter.

542
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,133
Because I found someone who
can't be compared to anything else.

543
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:11,700
It's you.

544
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,233
My one and only first love.

545
00:36:17,533 --> 00:36:19,167
Lie.

546
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:20,700
It's a blatant lie.

547
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,600
Dr. Kyung hid the side effects.

548
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,833
Then all clinical trials are fake?

549
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:30,400
You're still a doctor? I'm disappointed.

550
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,733
What have you done to me?

551
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:34,200
My first love memories

552
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,767
are ruined because of you.

553
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:39,833
No, that's not it.

554
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:42,533
No, that's not it.

555
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,667
No!

556
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:35,133
You're amazing.

557
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:37,567
I think you drank about 100 while
filming. You're drinking it again?

558
00:37:37,567 --> 00:37:38,967
This is all free.

559
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:41,267
It's kind of like 'anger income'.

560
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:42,533
It's 'unearned income.'

561
00:37:42,533 --> 00:37:44,000
It's anger income.

562
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,833
It's unearned… anger.

563
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:49,867
You speak so confidently
that even I am confused.

564
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:51,567
By the way, did you come alone today?

565
00:37:51,567 --> 00:37:53,667
Who are you looking for?

566
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,033
There comes the person you're looking for.

567
00:37:56,033 --> 00:37:57,467
Where?

568
00:37:57,467 --> 00:37:59,567
You two were together.

569
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:02,100
Our super sports star, Lee Shin.

570
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,600
National star Cha Si On.

571
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,867
I haven't seen you for a while,
but lately I see you often.

572
00:38:07,867 --> 00:38:09,367
You are being cold.

573
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:11,133
Our company's star is filming a commercial,

574
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:13,800
so of course I have to come.

575
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:17,167
You were joking last time when you said
you weren't renewing your contract, right?

576
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:19,633
I got insomnia because you said
you wouldn't renew the contract.

577
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:23,800
I can't sleep because I'm worried
that Shin is upset with me.

578
00:38:24,967 --> 00:38:28,333
Is it because I told Lee Goon something?

579
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:31,200
That was loving advice.

580
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,700
I didn't think you two were really close.

581
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,733
I'm leaving.

582
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:39,333
That rude little bastard.

583
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:41,867
But did you come alone?

584
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:43,200
Where's the manager?

585
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,833
Manager? Who?

586
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:48,133
Oh, Lee Goon? He's sick.

587
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:51,167
Last time, he spoke rudely to
the national star and got punished.

588
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:54,633
Oh, he's sick?

589
00:39:14,267 --> 00:39:16,167
I came to visit Lee Goon here.

590
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:18,100
Just a moment.

591
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,100
Oh, nobody is allowed to visit Mr. Lee.

592
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,367
Then he's in this hospital, right?

593
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:26,400
He's 28 years old, with a very handsome face.

594
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,967
And he's tall, sexy guy Lee Goon, right?

595
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:34,200
I am that handsome, tall and sexy Lee Goon.

596
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,467
Mister!

597
00:39:35,467 --> 00:39:37,467
Secretary, the hospital
director is there, right?

598
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:39,867
Yes, I'll go up right now.

599
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:53,400
Oh my, you scared me.

600
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,633
What are you doing here?

601
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:55,667
Go out.

602
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:57,067
Just once.

603
00:39:57,067 --> 00:39:59,167
Shh.

604
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,567
You can see it clearly
because it's there, right?

605
00:40:09,267 --> 00:40:11,233
Security will be here soon.

606
00:40:11,233 --> 00:40:12,700
One.

607
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,000
Two.

608
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Three.

609
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:24,200
- Here, Nurse Song.
- No, wait a minute.

610
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,167
Shh, just once!

611
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:27,233
Nurse Song!

612
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:29,567
Just once, just once.

613
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,800
Shin.

614
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Shin.

615
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:45,233
Shin.

616
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:49,367
Let's not do this.

617
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:51,100
- Shin.
- Wait a minute.

618
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,700
Doctor, what's happening…

619
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,467
Nurse Song, please calm this down here.

620
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:57,933
Calm down?

621
00:40:57,933 --> 00:40:59,633
Folding hands.

622
00:40:59,633 --> 00:41:01,833
- Let's keep folding our hands.
- Hello.

623
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,967
She's my fan.

624
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:05,833
Yes, she's my fan.

625
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:07,567
You know me, right? I'm Lee Shin.

626
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:09,000
Look at the bracelet, the bracelet.

627
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Yes, it's not a scandal.

628
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,167
- Shin, Shin.
- Look at the bracelet.

629
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:16,033
Shin, Shin.

630
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:18,833
- Folding hands.
- Folding hands.

631
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:20,933
More… more? More?

632
00:41:20,933 --> 00:41:22,333
Are we going to keep doing this?

633
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:24,767
Oh, folding hands…

634
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:32,200
You're my fan?

635
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,100
Of course I know Cha Shi On.
You were a rising star 2 years ago.

636
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,800
Now you are just a girl
in a constipation commercial.

637
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,033
I admit it.

638
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:43,200
I admit it coolly.

639
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,367
If you don't remember meeting me,

640
00:41:45,367 --> 00:41:48,700
you probably won't remember
seeing my data, right?

641
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,767
- Data?
- At that time.

642
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:55,533
You looked at my data and
told me to be careful of injuries.

643
00:41:56,567 --> 00:41:58,733
Big data is not just a record,

644
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:00,167
but a sophisticated scientific result.

645
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:04,167
A thousand pieces of data per second,
400 types of data collected,

646
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:05,900
the way the direction of movement
changes during the game,

647
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,767
instantaneous acceleration,
muscle explosiveness

648
00:42:09,767 --> 00:42:12,533
according to movement, power control,

649
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:14,633
all of this data can be
analyzed to predict injuries.

650
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:18,333
Of course, only an athletic
genius like me can see it.

651
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:19,533
You are my style.

652
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:22,433
You little girl…

653
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,433
I'm everyone's style.

654
00:42:28,067 --> 00:42:29,667
My popularity is…

655
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:33,900
I don't have a private life, but must
I bear the weight of the crown?

656
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,667
It's something like that.

657
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:37,867
Isn't it so?

658
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,967
- I'm your fan.
- Please give me an autograph.

659
00:42:41,967 --> 00:42:45,233
Your appearance is cute,
and your signature is cute too.

660
00:42:49,933 --> 00:42:51,967
This is a gift for you.

661
00:42:53,867 --> 00:42:55,233
It's a new product.

662
00:42:55,233 --> 00:42:57,533
It's sponsored, so don't feel pressured.

663
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,300
Even so, I'm a big-hearted high school
student who makes a lot of money.

664
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,400
Actually, I was a bit surprised that day.

665
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,333
The day you said you would retire
and become Shin's manager.

666
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:13,200
You were the first Korean to win
the World Junior Championships.

667
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,367
But why did you lose the medal?

668
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,667
A medal?

669
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:25,533
Did… Did I lose my medal?

670
00:43:25,533 --> 00:43:27,167
Did you lose your medal?

671
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:29,800
I dropped my medal.

672
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,833
Why? Are you feeling bad?

673
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:38,033
Mister.

674
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:40,400
Mom.

675
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:44,333
Open your eyes.

676
00:43:52,233 --> 00:43:53,333
My medal.

677
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,300
Wait.

678
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,867
Goon!

679
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,633
Mister.

680
00:43:58,633 --> 00:44:00,733
Mister.

681
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,600
Somebody, please help him.

682
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,100
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

683
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,500
Are you okay?

684
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,533
Are you alright?

685
00:44:18,767 --> 00:44:20,900
Yes, it's Kyung Ju Yeon.

686
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,333
Yes, I'll go right away.

687
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,800
Oh my.

688
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,867
It drives me crazy.

689
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,233
[Intensive Care Unit]

690
00:44:46,233 --> 00:44:50,200
How's Goon?

691
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,967
Still…

692
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:53,533
Where is his guardian?

693
00:44:53,533 --> 00:44:58,700
His mother asked me to
come quickly. I am his friend.

694
00:44:59,467 --> 00:45:02,500
If only I hadn't asked him
to go to the alumni reunion…

695
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,700
Alumni reunion?

696
00:45:05,367 --> 00:45:07,567
He kept insisting that he wouldn't come,

697
00:45:07,567 --> 00:45:09,900
but for some reason, he suddenly came.

698
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,467
My medal, my medal.

699
00:45:11,467 --> 00:45:14,367
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute

700
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,733
Where did the person who won this medal go?

701
00:45:16,733 --> 00:45:18,333
She went out a little while ago.

702
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:20,467
Oh, there!

703
00:45:32,367 --> 00:45:33,733
The person

704
00:45:33,733 --> 00:45:36,533
who opened my eyes to the world again.

705
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:39,433
The only one who reached out to me

706
00:45:39,433 --> 00:45:42,900
when everyone else turned their backs on me.

707
00:45:43,567 --> 00:45:46,333
She's the reason I am alive.

708
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:48,800
And she is alive.

709
00:45:49,633 --> 00:45:53,600
Thank you for being alive.

710
00:46:20,433 --> 00:46:22,000
Hey! Where are you?

711
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,033
Have you found your first love?

712
00:46:24,033 --> 00:46:25,900
Yeah, I found her.

713
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,367
Thankfully.

714
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,633
Hey, did you pretend to know her?

715
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:31,067
Hey, you should have confessed to her.

716
00:46:31,067 --> 00:46:34,167
I shouldn't have anything more to wish for.

717
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,900
That's how it should be.

718
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,600
But she was already with someone else.

719
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:46,267
It was taken away again.

720
00:46:46,267 --> 00:46:49,000
What do you mean by that?

721
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,067
Who took it away?

722
00:46:55,567 --> 00:46:57,700
Lee Shin.

723
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,400
That day.

724
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,733
I heard that he lost his first love
to someone really close to him there.

725
00:47:05,967 --> 00:47:10,833
He had lost everything since he
stopped playing tennis, and again…

726
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,800
So his first love became a bad memory?

727
00:47:44,167 --> 00:47:46,900
Isn't it weird?

728
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,167
A mother who doesn't shed
a single tear in this situation.

729
00:47:51,733 --> 00:47:54,400
I look like a stepmother, right?

730
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,000
I've never cried in front of kids.

731
00:47:59,133 --> 00:48:01,167
No.

732
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,233
I don't think I've cried since that day.

733
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:12,333
The day I left my child behind after hearing
that I couldn't play tennis anymore.

734
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:14,667
I promised myself that day.

735
00:48:14,667 --> 00:48:16,533
Mom.

736
00:48:16,533 --> 00:48:18,667
Mom.

737
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:24,167
Mom, take me too.

738
00:48:26,767 --> 00:48:29,800
If I break down in front of my kids,

739
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,333
they will become like me.

740
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:36,767
I'm also a former athlete.

741
00:48:36,767 --> 00:48:40,633
I thought I had to raise them strong.

742
00:48:41,933 --> 00:48:45,700
I became a cool-headed mother to him.

743
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,567
The night the accident happened,

744
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:58,333
Goon said something to me.

745
00:48:58,333 --> 00:49:00,900
- It's the best, the best.
- Add sesame oil and mix it well.

746
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,533
I'll do that.

747
00:49:02,533 --> 00:49:04,967
This goes best with rice.

748
00:49:04,967 --> 00:49:08,233
But the rice is cooked really well today.

749
00:49:08,233 --> 00:49:09,567
Eat more, Shin.

750
00:49:09,567 --> 00:49:11,367
This sauce is…

751
00:49:11,367 --> 00:49:14,000
You came back at a good time.

752
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,800
Come now, Grandma sent you
some soy sauce marinated crab to eat.

753
00:49:19,933 --> 00:49:21,867
There are more of these, right?

754
00:49:21,867 --> 00:49:25,300
If it goes well with rice
like this, it's the best.

755
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:29,100
I'll tell Grandma to send it again.

756
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,133
It's good.

757
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,267
Yeah, it's full.

758
00:49:32,267 --> 00:49:34,267
Here.

759
00:49:41,633 --> 00:49:43,867
Yeah, eat this.

760
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,800
Here, Shin. Eat this.

761
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:50,467
My grandmother sent this to me.

762
00:49:50,467 --> 00:49:52,633
Because I like it.

763
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
To put it that way,

764
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,600
the rest of the food was bought with money

765
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:03,067
earned from playing tennis
until your brother got blisters on his feet.

766
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:04,900
The spoon you are holding,

767
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:09,233
the chair you are sitting on, the ground
you are walking on are all Shin's.

768
00:50:09,233 --> 00:50:12,667
Why are you suddenly doing this?

769
00:50:12,667 --> 00:50:14,400
Yeah, Goon.

770
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,733
Shin is trying to control his diet these
days, so he can't even eat properly.

771
00:50:17,733 --> 00:50:20,200
We have to support him.

772
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,267
Why are you doing this
all of a sudden after being quiet?

773
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:27,400
It's mine. Don't touch it!

774
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,433
It's mine.

775
00:50:33,533 --> 00:50:35,733
Do you feel like it's a waste
for your younger brother to eat?

776
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:39,900
Why do you get greedy for no
reason when you live doing nothing?

777
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:43,267
If you have that kind of greed,
you can live greedily every day.

778
00:50:43,267 --> 00:50:47,200
How come you've been living like
a reckless person since you got hurt?

779
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,767
When on earth was that?

780
00:50:48,767 --> 00:50:51,533
Oh, stop now, please.

781
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,533
How hard must it be for Goon?

782
00:50:54,533 --> 00:50:56,767
He's already

783
00:50:56,767 --> 00:50:59,433
falling behind his younger brother.

784
00:50:59,433 --> 00:51:01,400
That bastard.

785
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,400
You can't even make a living
without your younger brother.

786
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,700
I'm also your son.

787
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,867
Don't call me like that.

788
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:17,867
I'm also the son of this family.

789
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:22,533
Why do you only call me like that?

790
00:51:23,367 --> 00:51:27,400
I can have at least one!

791
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,300
Even just one can be mine.

792
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,933
Do you know what I have
in my bag all year round?

793
00:51:36,233 --> 00:51:38,733
It's umbrella.

794
00:51:38,733 --> 00:51:42,767
Because there's no one
to bring it to me even if it rains.

795
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:45,900
You went to see Shin
who was training day and night…

796
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,867
Have you ever been with me

797
00:51:48,867 --> 00:51:53,300
for my entrance ceremony,
graduation ceremony, or birthday?

798
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:56,467
Do you know why I don't go out?

799
00:51:56,467 --> 00:51:59,000
My body is…

800
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,100
Because my body is not my body.

801
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,400
Even when I was bullied in school,

802
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,600
I got hit. Do you know why?

803
00:52:09,567 --> 00:52:11,967
Because I'm Lee Shin's elder brother.

804
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,433
If I hit them, my brother will suffer.

805
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:18,733
People compare me to Shin even when I breathe.

806
00:52:18,733 --> 00:52:22,533
We're brothers, but he has
everything and I have nothing.

807
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,267
Everything I had was taken away.

808
00:52:26,267 --> 00:52:28,900

I would sell my soul, but

813

it won't work.

814

role to my younger brother.

819
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,400

00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,100
Mom?

821
00:53:21,267 --> 00:53:24,900
You've never been
a 'mother of Lee Goon' before.

822
00:53:35,933 --> 00:53:39,300
I thought, no matter how immature he is,

823
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,567
how could he say something like that?

824
00:53:46,967 --> 00:53:49,800
But when I thought about it,

825
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,300
I realized that I had never
really been Goon's mother.

826
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:03,333
How fortunate it is that

827
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:06,633
he has now lost even that memory.

828

looking for you…

Why do you call my mom like that?

837

Yes, I dreamed.

838
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:27,133
I had a dream that I have to get
married when I find my first love.

You don't have to remember me.

841
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:35,367
Because I remember you.

turn into bad memories?

the whole time after I woke up.

858
00:58:32,033 --> 00:58:38,067
Is it because I haven't been able
to play tennis for a while?
