[We followed the production guidelines
when filming child actors and animals.]

00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:16,067
Honey.

4
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:18,333
Honey, wake up.

5
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,267
Why? Did I do something wrong again?

6
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:25,200
There's some noise outside.

7
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:27,967
Is it a thief?

8
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:29,833
Go and check it out.

9
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,033
- Me?
- You worked out.

10
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:34,367
I have a bad heart.

11
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:37,067
Okay, don't worry.

12
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:40,333
Just trust me.

13
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:20,233
Lee Shin!

14
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:21,233
Shin.

15
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:24,333
Dad.

16
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:27,433
You bastard.

17
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:29,167
You came back well.

18
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:31,900
Oh my.

19
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,633
Hey, what's this smell?

20
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:38,233
Did you happen to work on
a deep-sea fishing boat?

21
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:44,100
Is it because I went fishing?

22
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,633
Seems like you had a great time all by yourself

23
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:50,267
without even thinking
about your family worrying.

24
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:52,900
Yeah, you came back well.

25
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,133
It's all good if you came back healthy.

26
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:58,400
Ah, by the way, where's Goon?

27
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,000
You are tired, right?

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,467
You may go back.

29
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:13,467
We've already walked around
the neighborhood twice.

30
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,300
Why is this neighborhood so small?

31
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,067
This time again…

32
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:26,667
Well… That…

33
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:31,300
- That…
- Do you have something to say?

34
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:36,300
I mean…

35
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,400
Let's have a peck.

36
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,467
All of a sudden?

37
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:46,067
Oh my… Don't you know?

38
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:49,767
"When Daddy goes to work, kiss, kiss, kiss."

39
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:54,467
"Bye you, see you again, kiss, kiss,
kiss." Don't you know this song?

40
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:58,367
So, I mean we…

41
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:02,200
Let's meet again.

42
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,867
Oh my.

43
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:05,900
The ringing is going to wake everyone up.

44
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,367
Go back home.

45
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:11,700
Ringing? What do you mean?

46
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,367
Ah, that's it!

47
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:19,667
The chime that you hear when
kissing someone you like?

48
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,567
Is it a hallucination filled
with earnest longing?

49
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:27,000
Our lips didn't even touch.

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,967
You're even hearing hallucinations now.

51
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:35,433
Wow, you must really love me.

52
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,233
Go in. I'll be on my way.

53
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:43,233
I'm really leaving.

54
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:45,033
Yes.

55
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:46,900
Take care…

56
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,433
Be careful.

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,133
I'm going.

58
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,467
Don't cry because you'll miss me again.

59
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:10,667
I'll be on my way.

60
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,967
I didn't sleep. I waited.

61
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:34,533
You could have gone to sleep first.

62
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,900
The bell ringing woke you up, right?

63
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,633
The bell?

64
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:44,567
You said you had something to
tell me, right? So I've been waiting.

65
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:47,600
I'm late, right?

66
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,333
I found Player Lee Shin and
brought him back with me.

67
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,933
I have something to deal with.

68
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:53,733
Did you find Lee Shin?

69
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:59,067
He's not some teenager anymore.
Why did he even run away?

70
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,567
How are you feeling now?

71
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:07,033
Seung Hyun put this on me to encourage me.

72
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,800
I went to the market with
your mother during the day.

73
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,133
Spicy chicken feet go best with makgeolli.

74
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:16,933
I sipped makgeolli too much.

75
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:20,200
I was about to come home
holding Seung Hyun's hand.

76
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,467
But then I realized, it wasn't Seung Hyun.

77
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:28,167
So I ended up helping to find his mother.

78
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm glad it seems your mood have improved.

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,800
The people in this house feel a hundred,

80
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,100
even a thousand times more
like family than my own mom.

81
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,900
Tomorrow, I should go to
the Athletes' Village and say goodbye.

82
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,800
So what were you about to say?

83
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,867
Sae Yan.

84
00:06:56,867 --> 00:07:00,000
Don't be startled and listen well.

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,367
You know.

86
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,767
Why are your hands so cold?
They're like ice blocks.

87
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:05,933
Put them in. It's warm in here.

88
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:07,633
Come here.

89
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:11,600
Then just a moment.

90
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:24,900
Even knowing this truth, I felt heavy-hearted

91
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,500
because I couldn't bring myself to say it.

92
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,633
But now, I think I really
have to talk about it.

93
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:38,500
Before I tell you, I have a favor to ask.

94
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,700
I don't know how his brain will react.

95
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,333
So I want you to keep it
a secret for the time being.

96
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:50,733
It's about Mr. Lee's first love.

99
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,467
How are you feeling right now?

100
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:25,400
- When do you plan to return?
- I'm sorry.

101
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,933
May I ask you for a word?

102
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:28,500
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

103
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,133
Please say a word.

104
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,967
Like the official statement,

105
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:39,200
Player Lee Shin has submitted video evidence
proving that there are no charges against him.

106
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,976
Regardless of the reason, we deeply
regret causing social unrest.

107
00:08:42,976 --> 00:08:44,200
Moving forward, Player Lee Shin will…

108
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,233
Sports player Lee Shin was cleared of
attempted murder charges this morning.

109
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:54,500
On the 22nd, a post by an anonymous tipster
on a social media platform quickly spread,

110
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,900
leading to Lee Shin, who faced
attempted murder charges,

111
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,233
turning himself in to the police
after ten days on the run.

112
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:02,433
According to the investigation,

113
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:05,167
the lead officer confirmed that while there
was a minor dispute between the siblings,

114
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,500
it was not an attempted murder.

115
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,367
Additionally, Player Lee Shin's agency

116
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:14,133
has announced that they plan to file
a lawsuit against the anonymous tipster

117
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:19,233
who posted the text and photos on social
media, considering it malicious behavior…

118
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,033
CEO Hong, where are you going?

119
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,433
The outfit stands out too much.

120
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:26,767
I'm the CEO of Shin's agency, after all.

121
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,700
And since I have the ability, I
managed to handle it at this level.

122
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,100
If it were another agency,

123
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,333
Shin's return will be nothing
more than a dream.

124
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,900
Alright, then shall we start heading
to the Athletes' Village now?

125
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,167
Okay, change your clothes and
come back down. I'll be waiting.

126
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:45,567
I'm not going.

127
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,833
I'm planning to take a break for a while.

128
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,267
What? Take a break?

129
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:52,433
All of a sudden?

130
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:54,533
What did you say?

131
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:57,567
After disappearing without
a word and then showing up,

132
00:09:57,567 --> 00:10:01,833
the only thing you say is that you're
going to take a break from exercising?

133
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:06,667
Not for long. I'll take
a break for about a year.

134
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,567
One year?

135
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,267
You mean…

136
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:13,733
Do you know how much has been invested?

137
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:18,067
Do you know at what age
do tennis players retire?

138
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:22,133
At most, in a few years, you would naturally
retire and rest for the rest of your life.

139
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:24,700
Even with exercise, timing is everything.

140
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,667
Even if you double your
workout, it wouldn't be enough.

141
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,967
And you want to take a year
off at twenty-seven?

142
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:34,133
Because I'm twenty-seven.

143
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,733
Because I'm an adult now.

144
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:38,700
For the first time, I want to
live by my own thoughts.

145
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,333
Whether being a tennis player
is really what I want to do,

146
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:45,000
or if I'm just doing it
because someone told me to.

147
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:47,533
I also want to reflect on my own feelings.

148
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:49,067
You were forced to do it?

149
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:53,433
Are you saying that you've been doing
it unwillingly because we forced you?

150
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,067
Shin.

151
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:57,700
Do you know how much your
mother has sacrificed for you?

152
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:03,367
Your mother would feel very
hurt if you talk like that.

153
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:05,100
Of course. Yes.

154
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,533
It's not okay.

155
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,500
What do you mean, take a break?

156
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,767
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,167
This is not a discussion, but a notification.

158
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:17,967
It's my life, so I'll take responsibility.

159
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:20,000
I'll take care of the aftermath as well.

160
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,167
Through my lawyer.

161
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:26,600
I will contact you after carefully
reviewing the contract details.

162
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:33,600
Shin.

00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:37,000
Cola.

164
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,533
Cola.

165
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,033
Cola.

166
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,933
It's not here.

167
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:48,233
I'm here.

168
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,033
What are you doing?

169
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:01,333
The dog house is sturdy.

170
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,767
Sounds don't carry well from it.

171
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:09,500
They make good dog houses these days.

172
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,900
Looks good, huh?

173
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,633
Looks good? What are you talking about?

174
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:17,133
Is it Ju Yeon's magic?

175
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:21,167
Ju Yeon is great in every way,
but she has no eye for men.

176
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:24,433
I can't believe she likes you more than me.

177
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,033
That's exactly what I'm saying.

178
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:30,767
I haven't even shown 1% of my charm.

179
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,533
Goon, that…

180
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:40,900
That Han River incident.

181
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,533
Ugh, forget it.

182
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:47,867
It's fine as long as you came back.

183
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:57,467
Do you want to chew some gum?

184
00:12:57,467 --> 00:13:01,100
[I'm sorry.]

185
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,500
No, I'll chew this one.

186
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,700
[Let's be happy.]

187
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:17,500
Oh my, Cola.

188
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,867
Looks like Cola prefers you over me now.

189
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:24,300
Seeing it just trailing after you.

190
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:30,400
Ugh, Cola. It's so annoying, you just…

191
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,033
Just live with him.

192
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,767
Cola.

193
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:42,167
Now that I'm resting, so let's
hang out every day, okay?

194
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:47,233
Let's go for walks and hang out every day.

195
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:50,233
Try your best.

196
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:51,800
No.

197
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,467
Seeing you say you're taking a break,
isn't that a sign of determination?

198
00:13:57,467 --> 00:14:02,933
Live your life well.

199
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:10,467
Oh, right.

200
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:13,667
My phone.

201
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,833
Don't you have my phone?

202
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,300
Everyone is practicing with their partners.

203
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,767
Why am I the only one with you?

204
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,467
At least pretend to be working hard.

205
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:03,867
Before both of us get kicked out for no reason.

206
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:06,000
Waist exercise.

207
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,833
Lee Shin has terrible manners!

208
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:12,500
Like the phone drops on your face
when you're lying down and using it.

209
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:16,867
Like pouring cold water into the cup ramyeon.

210
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:20,800
Like eating a tangerine
after brushing your teeth.

211
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:24,867
Warm up and wait for me.

212
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,400
Hey, Cha Si On.

213
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,900
If Lee Shin is involved in an attempted murder,
it's a sure thing he'll be a washed-up athlete.

214
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,133
Can't you read the text?

215
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,100
The news said he was cleared of all charges.

216
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,467
So what?

217
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:41,067
Honestly, he was cool because
there wasn't a single scandal.

218
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:45,000
His image is totally ruined.

219
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,100
So what?

220
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,067
You're an attention-seeker who wants
to create a scandal but can't, right?

221
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:51,200
Because you're a nobody.

222
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,967
Do you want to die?

223
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:55,733
Hey, why are you even exercising?
You're going to be kicked out anyway.

224
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:56,833
You!

225
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,000
You ignorant girl!

226
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,933
What did you say? You know I'm strong, right?

227
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:04,467
Try to feel just how strong I am!

228
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:07,467
Hey!

229
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:12,067
Hey, what's wrong?

230
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:13,533
There are a lot of people watching.

231
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:18,200
That bitch is bad-mouthing Lee Shin.

232
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:24,333
Hey, aren't you coming over here?

233
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:34,000
It's really unfair.

234
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,700
She started the trouble first.

235
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,533
Why am I the only one being
told to leave the Athletes' Village?

236
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:43,400
You were kicked out of the Athletes' Village,
but she probably ended up with a broken rib.

237
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,933
It's a good thing we reached an agreement.

238
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:46,800
Let's assume she hit her first.

239
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,400
Then what about me?

240
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,667
If our player is getting hit,
do I just stand by and watch?

241
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,567
Like a man, just…

242
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:59,300
I heard that she took off your pants. It's
a good thing you were wearing long johns.

243
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,900
Whose side are you on now?

244
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,333
Do you think everyone will just stay quiet?

245
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,533
Mr. Lee.

246
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:07,667
Oh? Ms. Sae Yan.

247
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,767
So you came to pick her up
because Si On got kicked out.

248
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:12,867
What?

249
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,400
You're right.

250
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,767
I'm unemployed now too.

251
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:20,900
I've quit my job too.

252
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,433
Let's all go together.

253
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:25,300
Ms. Sae Yan.

254
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,600
I'll carry your luggage for
you. Please give it to me.

255
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,167
Thank you.

256
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:32,267
The table is just like a jungle.

257
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:35,967
An anaconda could come out.

258
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:42,000
What is it?

259
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,267
I'm trying to eat what I want
while taking a break.

260
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,333
You two haven't tried
something like this, either.

261
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,500
After eating only vegetables all the time…

262
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,933
It's delivery food.

263
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:56,467
Wow, this smell.

264
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:59,300
Honey.

265
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,067
- Ah, yes?
- Please ask him

266
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:04,033
how long it's going to take for him to recover

267
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:07,167
and ask him if he wants to
spend his whole life resting.

268
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:10,933
He must have heard it all…

269
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:12,600
Shin.

270
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,300
You need to eat chicken breast and
vegetables and build up your muscles.

271
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,267
Give that to me.

272
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:22,333
You two should take a vacation.

273
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,400
You've been looking after me all your life.

274
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,800
What is he saying?

275
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,267
He's pretending to care about us so much.

276
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:32,800
He's so immature.

277
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,733
I can't believe a national athlete representing
the country would say something irresponsible.

278
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:41,033
Honey.

279
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:42,333
Yes?

280
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:46,700
Please tell him that he can
rest later, after his retirement.

281
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,033
I'm not a messenger, but why do you
keep asking me to relay messages to him?

282
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:51,167
Shin.

283
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:54,767
Are you going to eat this kind of delivery
food even when you get older, huh?

284
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,633
You have to earn well while you're young.

285
00:18:56,633 --> 00:18:58,200
Give this to me.

286
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,367
Honey!

287
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,067
Eat up.

288
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:06,000
I'll go up then.

289
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,467
Hey, Shin, it's just a saying.
Come here, eat up, and then go up.

290
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:11,967
[Hanseom Hospital]

291
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:16,333
Now, the reason I've called
an emergency meeting today is

292
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:22,133
I have succeeded in the reset
experiment with the mouse 109.

293
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:24,567
Reset?

294
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:29,567
That… I've decided to hand
over the directorship to Te O.

295
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:34,400
I hope everyone will follow Te O's words.

296
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:37,000
That's not right, Professor Han.

297
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,267
Dr. Te O.

298
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:42,567
How about giving it a bit more time?

299
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:45,500
Three days is too tight.

300
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,567
I won't say it twice.

301
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:51,600
It is in three days.

302
00:19:56,767 --> 00:20:03,333
Dr. Kim, there's no time. I'll go now.

303
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:05,867
What did Dr. Kim say?

304
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:07,233
What are the test results?

305
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:11,233
Did he say the memory recognition error
has been restored to its original state?

306
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:14,467
He said he's just observing
the test subject's progress.

307
00:20:14,467 --> 00:20:19,367
I bought some time by pretending to cooperate.

308
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,167
Still, we are running out of time.

309
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:29,767
How about we just tell
Minister everything honestly?

310
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:33,900
At least Minister will stop
the reset experiment, right?

311
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,867
He might stop not only the reset experiment but
also the experiments to eliminate side effects.

312
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:43,267
If that happens, the side effects
could be irreversible forever.

313
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:46,067
We have to succeed in the experiment
even one day earlier than Te O.

314
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:51,433
That way, we can also
naturally prevent a reset.

315
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,700
So how can that be done in three days?

316
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,567
Te O, that punk.

317
00:20:57,567 --> 00:21:01,633
Professor Han, please buy as
much time as possible next to Te O.

318
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:06,867
I will try somehow to prevent
the side effects with Dr. Kim.

319
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:15,600
Elsa is better after all!

320
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,367
Didn't Te O embezzle research funds last time?

321
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:20,433
I don't know.

322
00:21:20,433 --> 00:21:26,733
How do you not know? Everyone in this
hospital knows that you two are dating.

323
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:29,933
Dr. Kyung.

324
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,133
Dr. Kyung, did you know?

325
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:37,733
Are you really handing over
the research center to Dr. Te O?

326
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:41,667
For the time being, please pay attention to
the management of the mice in the aseptic room.

327
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:45,100
It's right after the reset experiment on mouse
109, so we need to be prepared for eventuality.

328
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,267
Are you just going to stand by and watch
Dr. Te O become the head of the center?

00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:53,933
[Library]

330
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:58,000
Was it the year 1994?

331
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,400
When selling sweet potatoes at Morin Market,

332
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,400
I met Ms. So Jeong, who was
selling fish-shaped buns.

333
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,133
Back then, our affection was so special
that it made the local newspapers.

334
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:12,800
Could it be that we weren't meant to be?

335
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,067
Now that we each have our own families.

336
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,567
Did something come up?

337
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:24,833
No.

338
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,967
Why did you put that on like the kids do?

339
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:33,233
Oh, this?

340
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:35,033
This is my lucky charm.

341
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:37,100
It's a transfer tattoo.

342
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,067
A transfer tattoo?

343
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,200
You don't know what a transfer tattoo is?

344
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,667
After sticking the paper like this,

345
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:48,100
you wet it with your saliva
and slap it onto your hand!

346
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,100
What is that? You put that on with your saliva?

347
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,200
Like this.

348
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:07,133

Yes, Lieutenant.

I think I might be able to
find the blackmailer.

The envelope that contained the photos

352
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:15,733
was a wet adhesive envelope,

353
00:23:15,733 --> 00:23:20,067
so it's possible it was sealed with saliva.

354
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:21,467
Yes.

355
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:26,533
I'll send the envelope by courier,
and please test the DNA.

356
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:29,567
Yes.

357
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,600
[Duri-moe Newspaper, People Met at the Market]

358
00:23:43,267 --> 00:23:46,633
Oh, this is my mom.

359
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,833
If so…

360
00:23:52,467 --> 00:23:55,400
Sae Yan, I'll leave first.

361
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,133
I found it.

362
00:23:57,133 --> 00:24:00,033
I think I found

363
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:03,300
my dad.

364
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:11,033
Thank you.

365
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:29,933
This is what my dad looks like.

366
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:35,367
Thanks to you, I now know my dad's
face and name. I'm truly grateful.

367
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:40,200
Because you paid the favor in full upfront.

368
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,800
That's a relief.

369
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,333
That's good to hear.

370
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:49,400
Yes, I'll go now.

371
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,633
Ju Yeon.

372
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,367
Are you upset?

373
00:24:58,367 --> 00:24:59,600
You know me well.

374
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,267
I'm not doing all this just for my own benefit.

375
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,800
Honestly, if the side effects are revealed,

376
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,967
you're at risk of being disciplined.

377
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:12,567
If I reset it, it's a win-win for both of us.

378
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:14,733
Even as you make excuses,

379
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:17,033
you're not thinking about the subject at all.

380
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:20,667
Subject?

381
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:25,233
Since when have you cared so much
for patients and test subjects?

382
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:30,700
If you mess up, you could end up never
being able to work in this field again.

383
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,267
Just protect the subject.

384
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:41,600
I can't just watch him
return to a hellish life.

385
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:47,267
Others would think
you're really his first love.

386
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:00,233
Who do you think I am?

387
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:02,300
The pretty aunt with a changed voice.

388
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,367
Look at this. Here's the warm bun you love.

389
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:06,367
Pizza bun?

390
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:09,333
There's pizza bun, vegetable bun, and
red bean bun. What do you want to eat?

391
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:10,667
I'll have the pizza bun.

392
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:14,600
Well, then the person who
arrives first gets to choose first.

393
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,567
Let's start.

394
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:19,833
Where does that rule come from?

395
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,300
- Mom.
- It's time for the flight.

396
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,433
Let's hurry up.

397
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:33,833
No, I don't want to go back.

398
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,967
I can't go. I will report to the police.

399
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:37,767
Ma'am, could you please report to the police.

400
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:41,033
Just go back.

401
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:42,533
Ma'am.

402
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:47,933
If I had known you ran away from
the beginning, I wouldn't have taken you in.

403
00:26:47,933 --> 00:26:49,067
Ma'am.

404
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:51,400
Ma'am, can't I stay a little longer?

405
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,133
The truth is, I'm looking for my biological
father, and I'm almost there now.

406
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:55,967
So, just a few more days…

407
00:26:55,967 --> 00:26:57,633
Please just leave.

408
00:26:57,633 --> 00:26:59,200
It's not just a day or two.

409
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,833
Do I have to take care of my
friend's daughter as well?

410
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:05,033
You're so clueless.

411
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:07,633
Why are you looking for your father?

412
00:27:07,633 --> 00:27:11,467
Is being a dad just about giving birth?
Just leave! It's really annoying.

413
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:15,200
Then at least I want to say goodbye to Ju Yeon…

414
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,300
Ju Yeon knows too. Ju Yeon
said you should leave.

415
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,300
What?

416
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:26,167
Grandma, don't take away the pretty auntie.

417
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:29,733
Seung Hyun, come here.

418
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:33,900
Grandma, don't kick out the pretty auntie.

419
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,600
I can eat a little and share my food with her.

420
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,267
I'll also do the cleaning.

421
00:27:41,267 --> 00:27:47,633
So, let's all live together, pretty auntie,
auntie Ju Yeon, and you, Grandma.

422
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:50,200
Please.

423
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,133
Seung Hyun, if you don't listen
to me, you'll get scolded, okay?

424
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:56,033
Are you going to get scolded today?

425
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:59,400
I'll go… Don't scold Seung Hyun.

426
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,700
Pretty auntie, don't leave.

427
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,633
Seung Hyun, I'm sorry.

428
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:12,467
But I'll come back. I promise.

429
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:23,867
Thank you for everything so far.

430
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:32,867
You also need to keep going to
the hospital for your injured wrist.

431
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:15,900
Why were you being a nuisance
at someone else's house?

432
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,700
Ju Yeon can't even remember your childhood.

433
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:26,500
Once you get to Italy, stay put and
don't leave the house for a while.

434
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:39,367
- Are you okay?
- Are you hurt anywhere?

435
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:46,133
Oh my.

436
00:29:48,067 --> 00:29:49,700
Oh my.

437
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,167
Sae Yan.

438
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:55,467
Please hold onto Sae Yan!

439
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:07,133
Excuse me!

440
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:14,900
Who are you?

441
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:39,233
Thank you, I ran away thanks to you.

442
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:43,733
But do you by any chance know me?

443
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:03,533
Sae Yan.

444
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,800
Ah… Dad.

445
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,200
My daughter.

446
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,867
Are you really my dad?

447
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:34,633
Are you truly my dad?

448
00:31:44,933 --> 00:31:50,333
Have I aged too much since then?

449
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:52,133
No, you look the same.

450
00:31:52,133 --> 00:31:55,733
No, even if there were no photos, just…

451
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:58,200
I can tell just by the look in your eyes

452
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,867
that you're my father.

453
00:32:00,867 --> 00:32:04,267
Dad.

454
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:12,400
I also recognized my daughter at first glance.

455
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,633
But how did you save me?

456
00:32:16,633 --> 00:32:19,800
What?

457
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:24,133
When I went to the countryside house
you lived in, the village chief told me.

458
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:30,467
I came with the address and
saw some men taking you away.

459
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:35,433
My mom was trying to
take me back to Italy by force.

460
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:38,767
But the fact that the person
who saved me is my dad,

461
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:44,233
it's a million times more amazing
than I ever imagined when I was little.

462
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:45,967
My daughter.

463
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:52,000
So, now that you've run away from
Mom, shall we live together?

464
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,167
That sounds good.

465
00:32:57,367 --> 00:32:58,933
Sae Yan, what do you like?

466
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:01,800
I like everything because I eat well.

467
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,800
Dad is… I can't believe I'm calling you dad.

468
00:33:06,967 --> 00:33:10,667
- Are you giving this to me?
- Yes.

469
00:33:13,267 --> 00:33:17,333
- Oh my!
- It's delicious.

470
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:20,833
Dad.

471
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,533
This.

472
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:28,500
I've always wanted to pin
a carnation on you for Parents' Day.

473
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:35,833
I like strawberries.

474
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,433
You like strawberries.

475
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:41,533
One strawberry and one mango, please.

476
00:33:45,633 --> 00:33:49,500
- Is it good?
- Yes.

477
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,733
Thank you.

478
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:03,567
- Oh, you startled me!
- Sorry.

479
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:04,600
Sae Yan, are you okay?

480
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,600
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Oh, okay, goodness.

481
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:10,200
- Gosh.
- They startled me.

482
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,433
Sae Yan, can you wait just a moment?

483
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:14,233
I need to make an urgent call.

484
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:18,033
- Yes, sure.
- Just a moment.

485
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,367
- Excuse me, Doctor.
- Yes.

486
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:15,533
What if we combine Solution HL13 with
the separated mouse brain neural cells?

487
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:17,800
HL13?

488
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,067
I'll take a look at it.

489
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,767
- Hello.
- Ju Yeon.

490
00:35:29,767 --> 00:35:33,233
It's me. I thought you might worry,
but there's no need to worry.

491
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:35,833
This isn't bad.

492
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:36,967
Yes.

493
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:38,900
Sae Yan, I'll call you back later.

494
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,267
Oh Ju Yeon…

495
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:46,600
What's going on?

496
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,833
Ah, you startled me.

497
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:51,700
Who are you calling?

498
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:56,267
Ju Yeon is someone I lived with for a while,
so I thought she might be worried…

499
00:35:56,267 --> 00:36:00,867
Don't call again.

500
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:06,267
For the time being, it's best not
to contact anyone, not even Mom.

501
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:10,267
It would be dangerous if she even tried
to track the location through the phone.

502
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:14,767
I will keep the phone with me.

503
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,067
But you don't need to worry about Ju Yeon.

504
00:36:17,067 --> 00:36:21,700
Since she has been helping to find you.

505
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:26,833
Now that I've met my daughter,

506
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:32,633
I'm worried we might be separated again.

507
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:36,667
You will listen to me, right?

508
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:39,733
Yes.

509
00:37:28,433 --> 00:37:31,900
What's the problem?

510
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,467
It's done.

511
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:09,900
It's fine now.

512
00:38:10,267 --> 00:38:12,700
Why, why?

513
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,433
- Is it a success?
- Yes.

514
00:38:15,433 --> 00:38:17,267
Thank you.

515
00:38:17,267 --> 00:38:21,433
Kyung Ju Yeon! It's a success, success!

516
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:22,467
Wait.

517
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,733
The reset is in two days, right?

518
00:38:25,733 --> 00:38:29,967
We need to remove the side
effects first before then.

519
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:32,267
It takes at least two days to prepare,

520
00:38:32,267 --> 00:38:34,200
but let's try tomorrow night.

521
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,567
Tomorrow night.

522
00:38:35,567 --> 00:38:39,433
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you so much.

523
00:38:39,433 --> 00:38:45,100
Tomorrow, his first love memories
will return to normal.

524
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,167
Until then, please stay by the subject's side.

525
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:50,733
Since I will take care of Te O.

526
00:38:50,733 --> 00:38:52,867
Yes.

527
00:38:52,867 --> 00:38:53,867
You've worked hard.

528
00:38:53,867 --> 00:38:57,667
Kyung Ju Yeon, you've had it hard.

529
00:38:57,667 --> 00:39:01,267
You did a good job.

530
00:39:16,633 --> 00:39:23,633
[Shall we meet?]

531
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:34,900
It seems that he took her away.

532
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,867
What should I do about Sae Yan?

533
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,733
I'm back, but I have to
go out again right away.

534
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:49,000
Mom, is something going on?

535
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,867
No.

536
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:53,467
By any chance,

537
00:39:53,467 --> 00:39:56,600
did you get a call from Sae Yan?

538
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:02,033
I received a call yesterday, but
I hung up because I was busy.

539
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,900
Why? Is something going on?

540
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,067
Huh?

541
00:40:07,067 --> 00:40:12,333
Sae Yan went back to Italy with her mother.

542
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:15,100
What? Suddenly?

543
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,267
Why all of a sudden?

544
00:40:17,267 --> 00:40:20,467
That's what happened.

545
00:40:20,467 --> 00:40:22,667
There was no other discussion, right?

546
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:26,900
I was busy and hung up right away.

547
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,833
I had something to tell Sae Yan.

548
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:34,833
I wish she had waited a few more days for me.

549
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:36,300
Oh my, I forgot.

550
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,767
Is the stew all done?

551
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:43,133
Mom.

552
00:41:18,533 --> 00:41:22,633
It's perfect. The first
date with my first love.

553
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:27,433
Let's go. Let's go to Ju Yeon.

554
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:42,633
Last date before sending him to his first love.

555
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,100
Oh, Ju Yeon! Over here.

556
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:05,067
Can't you gain like 10 more kilos?

557
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:09,600
Or can't you be about 10 years older?

558
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,267
Why? Do I look strange today?

559
00:42:12,267 --> 00:42:15,267
Today, you look so perfect

560
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:19,633
that I'm worried you might leave.

561
00:42:19,633 --> 00:42:22,900
It makes me anxious.

562
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:28,567
Is there something you want to
do? I'll do anything you want.

563
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:31,333
Leave everything about
our first date today to me.

564
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:34,433
I wasn't sure what you would like, so
I booked a nice atmosphere restaurant.

565
00:42:34,433 --> 00:42:37,633
Let's go.

566
00:42:38,567 --> 00:42:40,767
Hello.

567
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,267
I made a reservation under the name Lee Goon.

568
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:44,333
Mr. Lee Goon?

569
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:46,500
Not like Mr. Kim, Mr. Choi, or anything.

570
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,533
Goon as in the single character!

571
00:42:47,533 --> 00:42:49,533
Ah, yes.

572
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:52,733
Mr. Lee Goon…

573
00:42:52,733 --> 00:42:55,033
You're not on the list?

574
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:57,000
That can't be.

575
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,767
One moment, I've even received
a confirmation text for the reservation.

576
00:43:01,767 --> 00:43:04,667
Your reservation is for tomorrow though.

577
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:07,567
No, that can't be.

578
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:11,467
I know a great buffet restaurant,
so let's go there.

579
00:43:11,467 --> 00:43:15,067
I had everything perfectly prepared for today.

580
00:43:15,067 --> 00:43:17,300
We can come back here tomorrow.

581
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,133
Tomorrow? Tomorrow…

582
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:28,567
You make plans for tomorrow in
advance. Do you like me that much?

583
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:30,567
Yeah, let's go.

584
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:35,133
To the restaurant you like.

585
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,633
Goodbye.

586
00:43:37,633 --> 00:43:39,333
Here you are.

587
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:43,867
Thank you. Goodbye.

588
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:56,533
There are things that need to be
appropriate for the time, place, and occasion.

589
00:43:56,533 --> 00:44:01,967
It seems like this restaurant
can't keep up with my outfit.

590
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:10,367
Maybe it stands out so much
that it's even more stylish?

591
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:21,733
[Korean Buffet 6,000 Won per Person]

592
00:44:21,733 --> 00:44:24,533
Yes, please enjoy.

593
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:26,667
You are totally…

594
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:32,267
You are totally into me.

595
00:44:32,267 --> 00:44:33,833
Seriously…

596
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:35,300
Ah, everyone.

597
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:39,233
Now, go ahead, enjoy your meal.

598
00:44:39,233 --> 00:44:44,900
Yes, eat as much as you like.
Because this place is a restaurant

599
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,700
with unlimited refills.

600
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,733
Now that I'm here,

601
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:55,633
this restaurant is no different
from a very luxurious restaurant.

602
00:44:55,633 --> 00:44:57,833
Just sit right here and wait.

603
00:44:57,833 --> 00:45:02,233
I'll show off my skills and come back.

604
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:09,033
Leave it to me. Please wait a moment.

605
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,067
Now, let's see.

606
00:45:12,067 --> 00:45:16,267
A rabbit that resembles you.

607
00:45:16,267 --> 00:45:17,433
It's…

608
00:45:17,433 --> 00:45:18,567
To me,

609
00:45:18,567 --> 00:45:23,600
you are like a very twinkling star.

610
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,367
I have prepared a star for you.

611
00:45:25,367 --> 00:45:27,100
When did you make this?

612
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,733
It's so cute.

613
00:45:28,733 --> 00:45:31,433
There's more. It's not over yet.

614
00:45:31,433 --> 00:45:36,567
Ta-da, it's a bunch of vegetables.

615
00:45:37,967 --> 00:45:40,433
A vegetable bunch. I've never seen it before.

616
00:45:40,433 --> 00:45:43,400
Oh, Ju Yeon!

617
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,067
Ta-da.

618
00:45:46,067 --> 00:45:48,133
When did you prepare this?

619
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:49,500
Just count to three.

620
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,267
One, two, three.

621
00:45:53,267 --> 00:45:56,233
Ta-da.

622
00:45:56,233 --> 00:45:57,933
Let's eat up now.

623
00:45:57,933 --> 00:45:59,767
How can I eat this? It's too precious.

624
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:01,200
Here you go.

625
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,667
You may go now.

626
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:06,867
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

627
00:46:12,733 --> 00:46:16,067
Goodbye.

628
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:28,533
Would you like to eat some apple?

629
00:46:41,467 --> 00:46:45,933
It's really the digital age.

630
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,667
Wow, what is this?

631
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:53,933
Wow, seriously. It's incredibly splendid.

632
00:46:53,933 --> 00:46:57,733
Feels like we're at a club, right?

633
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:04,633
Isn't it a bit rude to look at
your phone while dating?

634
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,600
Sae Yan went back to Italy yesterday.

635
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,600
I haven't heard from her since she arrived.

636
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,700
Sae Yan left?

637
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,033
She left without even seeing me.

638
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:22,200
In the end, she couldn't
find her father either.

639
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,900
Sae Yan…

640
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,433
If you have time later,

641
00:47:27,433 --> 00:47:31,700
could you go and meet her?

642
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:35,767
Um, meet Sae Yan?

643
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:41,533
Sure. Why not?

644
00:47:41,533 --> 00:47:45,367
I'll go with you.

645
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:49,367
You know, the wish bracelet
that Sae Yan gave you.

646
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:53,400
How is it? Is your wish coming true?

647
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,467
About half way?

648
00:48:02,533 --> 00:48:09,300
Your expression looks a little dark.

649
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:13,000
I'm sorry. I must be a bit tired today.

650
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,700
You're tired, huh?

651
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,133
Okay, then.

652
00:48:19,133 --> 00:48:21,800
I'll tell you a healing secret

653
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,700
that will completely
eliminate all your fatigue.

654
00:48:27,633 --> 00:48:29,467
So, like this.

655
00:48:29,467 --> 00:48:31,900
Just stand right in front of me like this.

656
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:37,333
Look into my eyes, and then you'll be healed.

657
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,200
You really are full of self-love.

658
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,233
That's not it.

659
00:48:43,233 --> 00:48:49,267
See yourself reflected in my eyes.

660
00:48:49,267 --> 00:48:55,833
I get healed every time I see you.

661
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,733
Even though we're indoors, maybe
it's because the weather's chilly,

662
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:07,500
I have a runny nose.

663
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,533
It was so cold outside earlier,

664
00:49:20,533 --> 00:49:25,300
but you didn't even pretend to be cold.
Do you know how worried I was?

665
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:30,100
How is it? Are you a bit warmer now?

666
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,100
Has your heart warmed up as well?

667
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,133
Yes.

668
00:49:34,133 --> 00:49:36,767
Oh? You smiled!

669
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,100
I guess you have nothing to worry about now.

670
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,600
Right? You feel healed, right?

671
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,867
- Yes.
- Good.

672
00:49:42,867 --> 00:49:46,100
Alright, then.

673
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,800
In a little bit, we'll be
greeted by a new world.

674
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:55,633
One, two, three!

675
00:50:00,567 --> 00:50:03,867
I can't see it well.

676
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:23,600
Hello.

677
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:26,633
I want to buy the bracelet.

678
00:50:26,633 --> 00:50:31,500
Is it possible to custom-make
all to the feeling I like?

679
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:44,667
♫ Where will it be, that day ♫

680
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:52,667
♫ How much further do I
have to go before I can see ♫

681
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,967
Did you dream of me?

682
00:50:56,967 --> 00:51:00,700
59 minutes before meeting. Let's meet
at the restaurant from yesterday.

683
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,133
Don't be late!

684
00:51:19,967 --> 00:51:24,433
[Professor Han Dong Chil]

685
00:51:24,433 --> 00:51:26,233
Yes, Professor Han.

686
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:29,133
I'm about to meet him now.

687
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:34,767
I'll head into the research center
after laying everything out.

688
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,433
Yes.

689
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,367
Kyung Ju Yeon.

690
00:51:41,367 --> 00:51:45,433
With a resolute heart, Te O is now…

691
00:51:45,433 --> 00:51:47,267
Professor Han.

692
00:51:47,267 --> 00:51:49,100
Oh, okay.

693
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,833
Let's have a drink tomorrow.

694
00:51:53,567 --> 00:51:55,967
The reset clinical trial set-up is
all done for tomorrow, right?

695
00:51:55,967 --> 00:51:57,100
I'm planning to leave work.

696
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,500
Leaving work?

697
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,867
Oh, then.

698
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:03,833
Shall we grab a casual drink today?

699
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:06,567
I have a prior engagement
with the hospital director.

700
00:52:06,567 --> 00:52:08,500
Is that so?

701
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,100
Yes, that's good.

702
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:15,800
No, then see you tomorrow.

703
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,200
Don't come running just because you miss me…

704
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,700
[Inspector Kim]

705
00:52:30,667 --> 00:52:31,933
Yes, Inspector Kim.

706
00:52:31,933 --> 00:52:35,333
The DNA of the blackmailer came
from the envelope you mentioned.

707
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:37,333
Who is it? Can I see the picture?

708
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:40,100
I'm on my way to make inquiries now.

709
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,000
First, I will send you the pictures by email.

710
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,533
Please check if you have seen this
person around or if you know him.

711
00:52:45,533 --> 00:52:50,833
I will send you the picture by email in
the business card you gave me last time.

[Ahn Hyo Myeong, 6-time
offender of stalking and murder]

713
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,433
He's a person with a criminal record
of violence, obsession, and stalking.

714
00:52:57,433 --> 00:52:59,667
I can't go into details,

715
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:02,600
but he is a dangerous individual
who has committed murder.

716
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,567
Murder?

717
00:53:11,367 --> 00:53:17,367
[Myeongseong Car Center]

718
00:53:34,467 --> 00:53:39,567
[Myeongseong Car Center]

719
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:37,167
[6-month suspension from competitions
and excluded from national team selection.]

720
00:56:11,033 --> 00:56:14,433
Yes, it's Lee Goon.

721
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:18,133
What did you say?

722
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:23,800
Ju Yeon!

723
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,067
Please open the door.

724
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,300
Ju Yeon.

725
00:56:35,033 --> 00:56:37,267
This is a very important matter

726
00:56:37,267 --> 00:56:42,067
not only for Ju Yeon but also for you.

727
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:46,567
By now, everyone's probably preparing
the experiment to remove your side effects.

728
00:56:46,567 --> 00:56:48,400
They tried to deceive me

729
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,700
and try to take you away.

730
00:56:54,933 --> 00:56:56,400
What on earth are you talking about?

731
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,867
What are these side effects, and what
is this experiment you're talking about?

732
00:56:58,867 --> 00:57:02,267
The day you fell into the Han River,

733
00:57:02,267 --> 00:57:08,667
you became a clinical trial subject in addition
to the traumatic brain hemorrhage surgery.

734
00:57:09,233 --> 00:57:10,333
Clinical trial?

735
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:13,600
It's colloquially known as
'the Bad Memory Eraser'.

736
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,167
With the consent of your family,

737
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:19,000
they erased all of your bad
memories from the past.

738
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,033
So that you can forget all the bad memories

739
00:57:21,033 --> 00:57:23,067
from the past and start living anew.

740
00:57:23,067 --> 00:57:27,033
Keeping only good memories like now.

741
00:57:28,167 --> 00:57:31,633
What does that…

742
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,533
What are you talking about?

743
00:57:42,533 --> 00:57:44,833
Where is Ju Yeon?

744
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:46,067
It's not even worth listening to anymore.

745
00:57:46,067 --> 00:57:50,300
It would be valuable to know
who the experimenter is,

746
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,733
if the experimenter is

747
00:57:53,733 --> 00:57:56,800
your beloved Kyung Ju Yeon.

748
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,533
What? Kyung Ju Yeon?

749
00:58:00,533 --> 00:58:04,200
You are the test subject, and
Kyung Ju Yeon is the experimenter.

750
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,467
Do you understand now?

751
00:58:05,467 --> 00:58:08,267
She volunteered to be on
the team doctor just to observe you.

752
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:09,833
It was an intentional approach.

753
00:58:09,833 --> 00:58:13,100
Shut up.

754
00:58:16,267 --> 00:58:18,267
If you want to,

755
00:58:18,267 --> 00:58:23,933
I can show you the observation journal
that Kyung Ju Yeon wrote while observing you.

756
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,033
No.

757
00:58:27,033 --> 00:58:28,967
Ju Yeon couldn't have done that.

758
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:31,367
You probably can't believe it.

759
00:58:31,367 --> 00:58:38,067
Before you hear about the side effects,
that fatal error I mentioned earlier…

760
00:58:39,233 --> 00:58:42,167
Fatal error?

761
00:58:42,167 --> 00:58:44,800
Memory distortion.

762
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,400
And your first love.

763
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,800
From the start, Kyung Ju Yeon

764
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,533
is not your first love.

765
00:58:51,533 --> 00:58:53,600
Don't talk nonsense.

766
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:59,200
What on earth are you blabbering about now?

767
00:59:00,433 --> 00:59:05,500
Oh, Dr. Kim. I'm leaving now.

768
00:59:06,667 --> 00:59:12,500
Dr. Te O was supposed to have
a drink with the hospital director.

769
00:59:13,233 --> 00:59:16,567
Could it be that…

770
00:59:19,933 --> 00:59:21,867
Professor Han.

771
00:59:21,867 --> 00:59:25,367
The number 109 mouse, which underwent
the reset experiment, has died.

772
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:29,333
I checked the cage because there
was another mouse in mouse cage 109.

773
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:33,733
Dr. Te O secretly asked the waste
disposal guy to take care of it.

774
00:59:33,733 --> 00:59:35,400
When?

775
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,000
That punk, he deceived us!

776
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,600
Where is Te O now?

777
01:00:10,267 --> 01:00:14,800
If you undergo this clinical trial,
everything will return to its place.

778
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,633
Don't you want to return to your true self?

779
01:00:17,633 --> 01:00:20,000
To before Kyung Ju Yeon deceived you.

780
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,900
To before you were taken advantage of.

781
01:00:24,367 --> 01:00:25,500
Open this door right now.

782
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:29,633
Te O, Yoon Te O!

783
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,800
The number 109 mouse is also dead.

784
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,267
Stop it right now!

785
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:37,533
Professor Han is also in cahoots with her.

786
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:41,633
He colluded with Kyung Ju Yeon and used you.

787
01:00:41,633 --> 01:00:42,900
No.

788
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,167
I'll explain everything.

789
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:47,767
It was all for your sake.

790
01:00:47,767 --> 01:00:51,100
You should never undergo this surgery.

791
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:55,433
Kyung Ju Yeon will be coming soon.

792
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:04,200
No.

793
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,267
No.

794
01:01:06,267 --> 01:01:10,533
No, absolutely not.

795
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,867
I'll pour you some water.

796
01:01:41,367 --> 01:01:44,633
Yes, Professor Han.

797
01:01:45,733 --> 01:01:48,900
What?

798
01:02:29,933 --> 01:02:36,200
♫ The day when it becomes dazzlingly bright ♫

799
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:44,233
♫ Even if your steps are still heavy ♫

800
01:02:44,233 --> 01:02:52,000
♫ I will be by your side, as if it's fate ♫

[Bad Memory Eraser]

802
01:02:56,933 --> 01:02:59,800
If someone has to resign, it should
be me. But why are you quitting?

803
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,767
It all started with my
thesis in the first place.

804
01:03:01,767 --> 01:03:03,367
It's my responsibility to take care of it.

805
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:06,533
Is it you? Are you the one
who spread our video?

806
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:08,367
Sae Yan didn't go to Italy?

807
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:10,067
It seems like she's with her father.

808
01:03:10,067 --> 01:03:11,467
I wonder where she's hiding.

809
01:03:11,467 --> 01:03:14,167
I've never actually been a mother to them.

810
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:16,600
Every day, you lock yourself in that
gloomy room, drinking away.

811
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,528
Do you know that our family is
suffocating because of you?

812
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:20,867
Are you still suffering from trauma?

813
01:03:20,867 --> 01:03:23,333
That must be why she's
more concerned about you.

814
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:25,033
Because he's just like you.

815
01:03:25,033 --> 01:03:26,867
You deceived and used me.

816
01:03:26,867 --> 01:03:31,467
I can never forgive you.
