00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,833
Seung Hyun, what is this?

180
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,433
How long has it been here?

181
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:38,667
The pretty aunt took it
out of a big bag last time.

182
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,600
Big bag? That one?

183
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
Could it be that one?

184
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,767
Yes.

185
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,767
Why didn't I think of that?

186
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:50,133
Seung Hyun.

187
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,067
Yes.

188
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:07,133
Professor Han suggested me
try writing an emotion diary.

189
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:11,600
Will this make the wrist pain go away?

190
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,200
He said to think of him like a brother and to
be honest with him about whatever I'm feeling.

191
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,367
Shall we try writing this "emotion diary"?

192
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:25,133
Look into your heart and
write down the feelings

193
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,767
you honestly experience.

194
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,800
Okay?

195
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:44,300
I wrote down the real
reason I had been avoiding

196
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,300
the professor's eyes.

197
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,367
Following the professor's advice,

198
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:49,733
honestly.

199
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:52,033
Thank you for your hard work.

200
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:56,067
Oh my.

201
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:58,567
Why is he giving me this?

202
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:01,300
Professor, by any chance…

203
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,100
You're wearing a wig, right?

204
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,400
I asked the professor

205
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,067
if he was wearing a wig.

206
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:13,967
The professor hasn't been
accepting appointments for a while.

207
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:17,633
Well, it must be a coincidence.

208
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:22,233
Sometimes he sends parcels
to me who lives alone.

209
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:26,600
"Could it be something to eat?"

210
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:31,433
When I open it, it's another gold trophy.

211
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:34,500
He's showing off again.

212
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:42,400
Yeah, the problem was that
my last name was Lee.

213
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,900
Who would have thought I'd end up
in the second string instead of the first?

214
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:50,933
Whenever I'm alone,

215
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:54,633
I often imagine being with that girl.

216
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:58,167
If I were to meet that girl,

217
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:03,167
I would give her flowers first.

218
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:05,567
Aren't you cold?

219
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,067
Today is my birthday.

220
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,833
And it's also Shin's birthday.

221
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,767
Shin is the best.

222
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:23,267
On the day I'm the protagonist, of all days,

223
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:26,333
that guy happened to be born
on the same day as me.

224
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:31,100
Why is nobody by my side?

225
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,867
If that girl were alive,
would she be by my side?

226
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:42,533
The only one who reached out to me.

227
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:46,067
I want to meet her, but I'm scared,

228
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:50,700
fearing that even she might leave my side.

229
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:56,900
♫ The day when it becomes dazzlingly bright ♫

230
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:04,967
♫ Even if your steps are still heavy ♫

231
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:11,133
 00:19:17,967
Uh, that… Have you seen the remote control?

232
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:19,833
If you don't know where it is,

233
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:25,233
please call Ju Yeon and
ask her to find it for me.

234
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,967
This one?

235
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:34,867
No, not that one.

236
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:37,533
The audio remote control.

237
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,800
This one?

238
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,533
Well, are you a fairy or what?

239
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:49,333
I mean the batteries for
the audio remote control.

240
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,567
Uh? There are no batteries here.

241
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,900
Are you calling Ju Yeon?

242
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,700
Is she not answering?

243
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,033
Huh? That's strange.

244
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:19,967
I talked on the phone earlier with her.

245
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,700
Hello?

246
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,733
Ju Yeon?

247
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,633
She didn't even answer my call.

248
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:40,133
Ju Yeon, uh…

249
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:43,433
Do you know where the batteries
for the audio remote are?

250
00:20:43,433 --> 00:20:45,367
You don't know?

251
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:46,600
Uh…

252
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,133
If she doesn't know where they are, could you
tell her to come here now and find them…

253
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:55,933
Oh, I roughly know where it is. Got it.

254
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:02,100
Ms. Kyung Ju Yeon.

255
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,533
I'll bring them to you.

256
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,900
Hey there.

257
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:14,867
Yes, please go ahead.

258
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:17,600
Are you very busy?

259
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:20,567
Yes, I'm on my days off for a while.

260
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:23,300
And Player Cha Si On isn't here, either.

261
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,233
Well, that's true, but…

262
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:34,200
No, it's just that I'm not
feeling well right now.

263
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,100
I heard Sae Yan is taking
good care of the sick.

264
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,300
She's warm-hearted, so
she'll do better than me.

265
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,700
In many ways.

266
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:55,200
Ms. Jeon Sae Yan is

267
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,867
so warm and caring towards me.

268
00:21:57,867 --> 00:22:00,567
She helps me wash my face

269
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:03,067
and even feeds me porridge.

270
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:06,333
She really takes good care of me.

271
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,900
Thanks to Jeon Sae Yan, it's much…

272
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,067
Yes, it feels like I'm getting better.

273
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:15,767
- But why like this…
- That's good to hear.

274
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,300
If you have nothing else to say, I'll hang up.

275
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,767
Get well soon.

276
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,333
[Jeon Sae Yan]

277
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:55,700
Why are you running out barefoot
as if you've committed a crime?

278
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,733
Staying with me all night
isn't exactly a huge crime.

279
00:23:09,633 --> 00:23:10,667
Alright.

280
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:12,100
What are you doing right now?

281
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,467
If you're going to grumble,
at least make sure I can't hear it.

282
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,100
Let me down. What are you doing?

283
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,733
Why am I feeling like this?

284
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:43,300
Ju Yeon, Ju Yeon!

285
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:48,733
Who are you?

286
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,567
Is this Ju Yeon's place by any chance?

287
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,767
Yes, it is.

288
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,933
Aren't you Player Lee Shin?

289
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:01,400
Oh my.

290
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,433
Why did you come here…

291
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:05,000
It's nothing special.

292
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,267
I came to see Ju Yeon and you personally.

293
00:24:08,267 --> 00:24:09,867
You're here to see Ju Yeon?

294
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:13,167
- Here, take this, ma'am.
- Oh my.

295
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:14,333
Please come in.

296
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,967
Oh my.

297
00:24:17,967 --> 00:24:22,033
- Here it is.
- Oh my, you've bought so much.

298
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:23,300
Thank you.

299
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,167
Please have a seat.

300
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:26,767
- Yes.
- Seung Hyun.

301
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:29,900
Please sit on the sofa here.

302
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,167
The house is cozy and nice.

303
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:40,900
Shall I sit here?

304
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:48,267
You must be Seung Hyun, right?

305
00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:51,267
I'm a close friend of your aunt.

306
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:56,300
Please have some of this.

307
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,633
- Thank you.
- Well, I come across situations like this.

308
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:04,233
This doesn't happen often, but
it does happen occasionally.

309
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:06,933
It's the first time.

310
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:09,100
Huh?

311
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:13,767
Seung Hyun, how about go
outside and play for a while?

312
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:15,900
Tsk.

313
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,133
Oh no, what should I do?

314
00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:22,300
Seung Hyun, you should be more careful.

315
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,767
Ah, just a moment please.

316
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:25,600
It's okay. It's okay, ma'am.

317
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,667
Please try to wipe it with this.

318
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:30,567
- Oh dear, what should I do?
- It's okay.

319
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:31,567
It's okay.

320
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:33,500
Oh dear, jeez.

321
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,733
That won't be enough, right?

322
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,367
Just a moment please.

323
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:39,367
No…

324
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,567
It's fine. It's fine.

325
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:46,300
It's fine.

326
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,733
First, change into this for now.

327
00:25:52,733 --> 00:25:55,433
Meanwhile, I'll try to wash this somehow.

328
00:25:55,433 --> 00:25:56,767
I'm so sorry, what can I do?

329
00:25:56,767 --> 00:25:59,900
Oh no, this belongs to Ju Yeon's father…

330
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,233
Yes, the only men's clothes we
had are her father's clothes…

331
00:26:04,967 --> 00:26:09,000
He's passed away, but these clothes are new.

332
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,533
Ju Yeon always buys new
ones for Dad's birthday.

333
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:14,600
Oh dear.

334
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,500
It's an honor, sir. I…

335
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,700
Then I'll wash them nicely
and return them to you.

336
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,567
- The bathroom is over there…
- Yes.

337
00:26:28,933 --> 00:26:31,400
It's okay.

338
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:41,833
It suits you well.

339
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,133
- Take a seat.
- Yes.

340
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:52,600
Don't you need to call Ju Yeon?

341
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,133
We don't even know when she'll come back.

342
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:56,067
Ah, I…

343
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:59,233
I wanted to give her a surprise.

344
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:04,133
If it's okay with you, ma'am, I'll
wait here until Ju Yeon arrives.

345
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:08,500
Then, I will enjoy it.

346
00:27:11,433 --> 00:27:12,433
It's sweet.

347
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:14,933
- Is that so?
- Yes.

348
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:21,067
Grappa.

349
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:25,433
Add a shot of brandy,

350
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:29,267
put in some honey,

351
00:27:29,267 --> 00:27:33,267
and mix it well.

352
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,233
Isn't it right?

353
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,767
You're awake?

354
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:26,733
What's wrong with you? Did you catch a cold?

355
00:28:26,733 --> 00:28:27,867
No, not at all.

356
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:30,300
Here, please have this.

357
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,433
What is this?

358
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,867
Ah, alcohol…

359
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:37,433
Did you drink alcohol just now?

360
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:39,267
- You seem drunk?
- No.

361
00:28:39,267 --> 00:28:41,233
No, no.

362
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:42,933
This is…

363
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:44,600
What was this again?

364
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,000
This is a traditional Italian
remedy called 'grappa'

365
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,667
that my mother passed down.

366
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:53,733
Grappa.

367
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:56,233
They say it's grappa.

368
00:28:57,733 --> 00:28:59,333
Its name is grappa.

369
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,933
Drink it. You should try drinking it.

370
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:02,000
Yes, I'll drink it later.

371
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,800
Quickly, you have to drink it now.

372
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,133
I got it, so please take a rest.

373
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:09,267
No, you have to drink this now.

374
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:13,100
I promised with Ju Yeon
to take care of the sick.

375
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,667
Did Ju Yeon ask for this?

376
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:18,800
Did Ju Yeon tell you to take care of the sick?

377
00:29:19,567 --> 00:29:20,767
Did Ju Yeon tell you to do this?

378
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:23,033
Shh.

379
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:29,500
Why, why, why?

380
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,767
Why?

381
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:37,300
Jeez, really.

382
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:41,667
Oh my, this is driving me crazy.

383
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:43,867
Okay.

384
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:41,867
Sorry, I thought you were
a beautifully looking homeless woman?

385
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:44,067
Gosh.

386
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,667
Why are you sitting like that?

387
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,767
Are you not feeling well?

388
00:31:03,067 --> 00:31:04,667
Where?

389
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:07,367
I don't know.

390
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:11,300
I'm feeling unwell, but I
don't know where it hurts.

391
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,300
I'm a doctor, but I don't know where it hurts.

392
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:22,633
I've been going to the hospital
for nearly 10 years.

393
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:25,967
I probably know better than most doctors.

394
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:30,600
Upon first seeing the situation, let's see.

395
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,967
Ah, I see.

396
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:37,367
Ah.

397
00:31:37,367 --> 00:31:41,400
There's no cure for this illness.

398
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,933
If you bleed, you can apply ointment,

399
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:52,567
but there's no ointment for a bruised heart.

400
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:57,433
Do you know why there isn't ointment?

401
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,833
To stay in the memory for a long time,

402
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:05,700
even bad memories become

403
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,367
cherished memories over time.

404
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:52,400
Oh, are you awake?

405
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,833
It's weird.

406
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:57,633
I'm sure I was sitting on a chair.

407
00:32:57,633 --> 00:32:59,767
Why does it feel like I'm lying in a bed?

408
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:01,200
Yes, that's right.

409
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,333
You are lying now.

410
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:11,267
Now, take some medicine.

411
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:16,967
Drink some water too.

412
00:33:28,867 --> 00:33:31,600
It's weird.

413
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,567
No matter how much beer
I drink, I don't get drunk.

414
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:38,033
Would strong liquor and beer be the same?

415
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:42,333
You gulped down two
bottles of that strong liquor.

416
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:47,933
Your fever?

417
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:52,767
How is it? It's gone down, right?

418
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:54,967
Right.

419
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,533
That's a relief.

420
00:33:58,533 --> 00:34:01,033
Good.

421
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,467
Nice.

422
00:34:04,467 --> 00:34:07,700
Grappa is the best, right?

423
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:12,433
And honey! There's honey in it too.

424
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:15,167
Grappa, grappa, grappa.

425
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:18,000
Your drinking habits are really…

426
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,033
What's so funny?

427
00:34:22,033 --> 00:34:24,800
I feel nauseous.

428
00:34:25,867 --> 00:34:27,967
When you're sick,

429
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:31,900
isn't there someone you want to see?

430
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:38,033
For me, it's my dad.

431
00:34:38,867 --> 00:34:41,633
Even though I've never seen him,

432
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:44,867
I miss my Dad.

433
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,300
You said earlier

434
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,100
that you prepaid for the favor.

435
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:57,167
Don't worry, I'll help you until you find him.

436
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,000
Promise me.

437
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,267
Okay.

438
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,467
Now, it's done, right?

439
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:08,767
Okay, stamp it.

440
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,900
Copy.

441
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,967
Laminate and input.

442
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:20,567
I miss Ju Yeon.

443
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:24,067
I also miss ma'am.

444
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:27,167
Seung Hyun will be looking for me.

445
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:32,200
I think I have to go.

446
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:36,367
Then, goodbye.

447
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,533
Well…

448
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,333
Are you my auntie's boyfriend?

449
00:35:58,633 --> 00:36:02,067
No, well… not yet.

450
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,933
Seung Hyun, do you like puppies?

451
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:13,333
This is my puppy Cola. Isn't he pretty?

452
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:15,767
With pretty Cola and the even prettier auntie,

453
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:18,267
the four of us should play
together. How about it?

454
00:36:18,267 --> 00:36:19,433
With the pretty auntie?

455
00:36:19,433 --> 00:36:21,867
Yes.

456
00:36:21,867 --> 00:36:24,400
Alright.

457
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,400
Then what does that pretty auntie like?

458
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,767
The pretty auntie?

459
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:32,233
She likes beer.

460
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:35,633
You know, the can beer with you drawn on it.

461
00:36:35,633 --> 00:36:39,233
Why? Did your auntie mention me
while looking at my picture?

462
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:40,933
She was crumpling it up,

463
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:43,633
and saying she would crush it.

464
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:51,100
Could it be that the pretty auntie
you mentioned is actually Jeon Sae Yan?

465
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,800
Why would she be the pretty auntie?

466
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,100
Ju Yeon is the prettier auntie.

467
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,667
Looks like you don't have
a good eye for women, huh?

468
00:36:57,667 --> 00:36:59,667
She just goes around hitting people.

469
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:01,500
She has a very quirky personality.

470
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,400
Mister, just leave now.

471
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,567
You say things you
shouldn't in front of a child.

472
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:08,367
Wait! Seung Hyun.

473
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:10,500
Shall we draw more pictures and play more?

474
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,367
I'm so good at drawing.

475
00:37:12,367 --> 00:37:16,233
With me, drawing tigers and lions…

476
00:37:27,867 --> 00:37:29,333
[Emotion Diary, Lee Goon]

477
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:34,967
Is this my brother's emotion diary?

478
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:05,033
Madam, this is cheating, isn't it?

479
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,367
Can't you win with these cards?

480
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,667
Please teach me a move, madam.

481
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:11,433
No, master.

482
00:38:11,433 --> 00:38:13,433
The lesson fee is expensive, but alright.

483
00:38:13,433 --> 00:38:14,733
Good.

484
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:17,367
It's not a celebrity discount, but it's
a national team player discount, okay?

485
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:19,367
Okay!

486
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:29,767
- Ju Yeon?
- Huh?

487
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:31,800
Did you know your mother is a gambler?

488
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,433
Should I just live here and
learn from you, madam?

489
00:38:35,433 --> 00:38:37,867
I'd like it.

490
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:41,467
Are you coming now?

491
00:38:41,467 --> 00:38:45,600
Player Lee Shin has been waiting
for a long time to surprise you.

492
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,333
You acted like you'd be
right back, but you're late.

493
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:53,067
Come out.

494
00:38:59,033 --> 00:39:01,033
Here.

495
00:39:05,933 --> 00:39:08,033
Here, gargle it.

496
00:39:15,433 --> 00:39:17,533
Here, water.

497
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,767
Now we are completely in sync, aren't we?

498
00:39:25,767 --> 00:39:28,067
Because it's the fourth time.

499
00:39:28,067 --> 00:39:30,733
Since I've sent the fourth taxi,

500
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:32,100
let's walk from here on.

501
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,100
Oh, okay. That would be better.

502
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,433
No, wait a minute.

503
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,267
Hop on my back.

504
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:41,867
Wow.

505
00:39:41,867 --> 00:39:44,067
Wow.

506
00:39:44,067 --> 00:39:47,500
Let's go!

507
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
Oh, manners hand!

508
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,567
Top-notch manners, unwavering
comfort, five stars!

509
00:39:54,567 --> 00:39:56,100
Just sleep.

510
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,467
I won't leave you abandoned on the street.

511
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,700
What are you doing?

512
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,867
Why are you staring at someone so intently?

513
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:09,133
I saw it while you were sleeping earlier.

514
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:13,633
From the side, your profile, especially
your nose, looks very handsome.

515
00:40:13,633 --> 00:40:15,933
I'm just saying this.

516
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:21,633
You must have taken after your mother.

517
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:24,267
Your mother's charm was so overflowing

518
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:26,967
that I couldn't help but pick up on it myself.

519
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:29,600
Home-cooked meal was delicious,
and she has a hearty personality.

520
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,433
What do you think? Don't you
think I've gained some weight?

521
00:40:32,433 --> 00:40:34,967
What are you doing now?

522
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,967
I've tried calling and texting
you, but you haven't responded.

523
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:42,833
This is the only way I
could think of to reach you.

524
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:46,200
There must be a reason for avoidance, right?

525
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,900
I know the reason.

526
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,433
The kiss that day.

527
00:40:50,433 --> 00:40:53,000
Never mind. There's no need to talk about that.

528
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,467
It was to change your brother's mind.

529
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:59,667
"Seeing me kissing, he'd
give up on his feelings for me."

530
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:00,700
Isn't that it?

531
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,633
I like you.

532
00:41:03,633 --> 00:41:05,533
The intention to make my
brother let go of his feelings.

533
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:08,533
You know it's not just that.

534
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:10,933
You know that I like you

535
00:41:10,933 --> 00:41:14,867
because you're good at
reading people's feelings.

536
00:41:14,867 --> 00:41:16,567
Don't pretend you don't know.

537
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:19,133
It's not that I'm pretending not to know.

538
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:21,500
I really didn't know.

539
00:41:24,933 --> 00:41:29,467
I don't have prior knowledge
on what to do in situations like this.

540
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:33,333
My expression is clumsy and awkward.

541
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:36,500
I'll apologize first. I'm sorry.

542
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,833
I've never read your feelings.

543
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,267
Also,

544
00:41:41,267 --> 00:41:46,267
I'm not interested in whatever
feelings you may have.

545
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:51,067
So, don't harbor feelings for me.

546
00:41:54,467 --> 00:41:56,500
And,

547
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,900
Sae Yan is his true first love.

548
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,000
There was no need to deceive me, right?

549
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:08,667
You're angry because
I didn't tell you about that.

550
00:42:10,167 --> 00:42:12,533
Even if I knew

551
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:14,133
or said it,

552
00:42:14,133 --> 00:42:17,133
would anything change?

553
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:20,033
Will you tell it to Jeon Sae Yan?

554
00:42:20,033 --> 00:42:23,367
You can't even tell her because
you're afraid my brother will find out.

555
00:42:23,367 --> 00:42:25,500
Then, will you go tell my brother?

556
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,367
If he finds out, will you explain everything
about how and why his memory

557
00:42:30,367 --> 00:42:32,733
of things might be incorrect?

558
00:42:32,733 --> 00:42:35,000
He underwent a clinical trial, and
he experienced side effects?

559
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,800
I might not have said it, but
things must have changed now.

560
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,567
What might have changed?

561
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:44,133
Do you think that if that were the case,

562
00:42:44,133 --> 00:42:46,800
you might not like my brother?

563
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,867
The reason you are cold to me

564
00:42:48,867 --> 00:42:52,000
is entirely because you like my brother.

565
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,400
Isn't it?

566
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,333
But you shouldn't do that.

567
00:42:57,333 --> 00:43:00,333
And more so, you shouldn't like him.

568
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:02,167
Originally, my brother

569
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:05,933
loved that first love, not you.

570
00:43:05,933 --> 00:43:11,233
Because that first love you
acted isn't really his first love.

571
00:43:11,233 --> 00:43:14,733
The first love that you acted is

572
00:43:14,733 --> 00:43:17,433
Jeon Sae Yan.

573
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:23,333
I know as well

574
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:27,467
that the more I do this,
the more you'll push me away.

575
00:43:27,467 --> 00:43:29,933
But it's also my first time,

576
00:43:29,933 --> 00:43:33,267
so without any prior learning
on how to behave in such situations,

577
00:43:33,267 --> 00:43:36,833
my expression might be clumsy,
unfamiliar, and awkward,

578
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:38,800
like you.

579
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,700
But I can't help it.

580
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,500
Since my feelings don't follow my mind.

581
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,400
Like you are now.

582
00:43:50,067 --> 00:43:53,567
Even though my feelings don't follow my mind,

583
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:57,333
my reason already knows well.

584
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:59,500
There won't be any issues
you are worried about,

585
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,567
and I believe you will do the same.

586
00:44:03,567 --> 00:44:05,933
Both of us.

587
00:44:16,633 --> 00:44:18,833
Ju Yeon,

588
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:21,933
please talk to me.

589
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:37,667
Are you feeling any better?

590
00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:42,200
You said you were busy,
but both of you were here.

591
00:44:42,967 --> 00:44:46,833
Even if I was busy, I came to see Ju Yeon.

592
00:44:53,233 --> 00:44:55,600
What's with Sae Yan? Is she asleep?

593
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,533
She passed out from drinking.

594
00:44:57,533 --> 00:45:00,200
Did she drink alcohol?

595
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,700
- Sae Yan, are you okay?
- Yes.

596
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,733
Are you really okay?

597
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:08,933
It's not okay.

598
00:45:08,933 --> 00:45:11,467
Aren't you worried about me?

599
00:45:11,467 --> 00:45:15,400
Don't you ask me if I'm
okay or how I'm feeling?

600
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,367
I was really sick.

601
00:45:18,367 --> 00:45:22,867
I thought about you a lot.

602
00:45:25,367 --> 00:45:27,767
You seem to be okay.

603
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:31,167
Why does Ju Yeon worry about you?

604
00:45:31,167 --> 00:45:35,100
Ju Yeon, I had a great time today.

605
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:39,267
Please tell your mother that I'm
very grateful for the homemade meal.

606
00:45:40,933 --> 00:45:43,367
Sae Yan, get up.

607
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:44,433
Let's go.

608
00:45:44,433 --> 00:45:46,633
Huh? Home?

609
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:49,767
I did everything you told
me to do really well today.

610
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:52,567
- Oh, okay. Okay.
- Let's go in now.

611
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:54,867
We'll go in.

612
00:45:54,867 --> 00:45:57,700
Goodbye.

613
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,733
I'll come again.

614
00:45:59,733 --> 00:46:01,600
To bring your father's clothes.

615
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,767
What? Lee Shin?

616
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:05,033
Why are you here?

617
00:46:05,033 --> 00:46:06,900
- Hey, get lost!
- Sae Yan.

618
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,867
- Go away!
- Sae Yan.

619
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:11,033
You!

620
00:46:15,233 --> 00:46:18,100
I have to go to the practice room.

621
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:22,233
Then,

622
00:46:22,233 --> 00:46:24,567
shall we play a game?

623
00:46:31,267 --> 00:46:33,600
It feels like the earth is spinning.

624
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,133
Oh, my stomach's churning.

625
00:46:36,133 --> 00:46:38,900
Why did you drink so much?

626
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,367
I know.

627
00:46:40,367 --> 00:46:43,933
I tried to cure him with that
Italian home remedy, but

628
00:46:43,933 --> 00:46:48,600
I've only ever eaten what my mom makes.
So how would I know how to make it?

629
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,733
I really tried to take good care of
him because you asked me to.

630
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,367
I know.

631
00:46:55,367 --> 00:46:58,267
I took care of him by cooking porridge for
him, feeding him spoonful by spoonful,

632
00:46:58,267 --> 00:47:00,200
wiping his sweat,

633
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,733
taking off his clothes when he was hot,
and dressing him when he was cold.

634
00:47:05,467 --> 00:47:10,000
But at first, it seemed like he was telling me
to leave quickly because I was a bother.

635
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,233
As time went on, it seemed to get a bit better.

636
00:47:14,233 --> 00:47:17,367
He even brought me hangover remedies.

637
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:18,933
I think we got a bit closer.

638
00:47:18,933 --> 00:47:21,900
How can I express this? It's sort of…

639
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,467
It feels like we're becoming
real friends, real friends!

640
00:47:28,967 --> 00:47:30,600
Hello?

641
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,100
Will it take longer for the ramyeon, ma'am?

642
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,467
- Yes.
- Will it take longer for the ramyeon?

643
00:47:36,467 --> 00:47:38,933
Oh, just a moment.

644
00:47:38,933 --> 00:47:41,167
What's going on? What happened?

645
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:42,733
Did you get scalded?

646
00:47:42,733 --> 00:47:44,300
Are you really okay? What should I do?

647
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,933
It's my fault for asking you to cook ramyeon…

648
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:48,967
Sorry.

649
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:51,200
Are you really sorry? If
you are, don't get hurt.

650
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,500
If you get hurt, it hurts me more.

651
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,133
I'm sorry that I'm hurt.

652
00:47:57,133 --> 00:47:59,767
Will this not leave a scar? Are you okay?

653
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:01,633
It's okay.

654
00:48:01,633 --> 00:48:03,900
Let's eat.

655
00:48:04,567 --> 00:48:07,533
I will do it, I will.

656
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,600
Can you manage?

657
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,667
You can't beat me.

658
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:17,167
Well.

659
00:48:17,167 --> 00:48:19,367
Do you think you can beat me?

660
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:22,433
I can see your moves clearly.

661
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:27,600
Even if it's exposed, I can win.

662
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,367
Hey, amateur.

663
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:42,033
Let's stop now.

664
00:48:42,033 --> 00:48:44,900
Why? Don't you want to win?

665
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,900
You're not satisfied until
you get whatever you want.

666
00:48:50,233 --> 00:48:51,967
Ah, that's right.

667
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,867
There's something I also want to have.

668
00:48:54,867 --> 00:48:57,767
Are you being honest now?

669
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,100
The one you always wore,

670
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,367
the glow band with your name on it.

671
00:49:05,933 --> 00:49:08,733
I haven't been seeing that around lately.

672
00:49:09,267 --> 00:49:11,467
Did you lose it?

673
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,300
Please give me an autograph.

674
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,233
- Understood.
- Please take a photo with me.

675
00:49:22,533 --> 00:49:24,200
That's at home.

676
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,567
About a thousand of them?

677
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:27,800
All my fans wear it, you know.

678
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,167
It's my merchandise, after all.

679
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,567
So didn't you lose it?

680
00:49:32,567 --> 00:49:35,333
For example,

681
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:37,667
did you lose it at the Han River
or something like that?

682
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,967
Why are you acting like an amateur?

683
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:53,367
It's just…

684
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:56,200
Because I want one too.

685
00:51:03,633 --> 00:51:07,000
[Observing CEO Hong, it seems like
he's different on the inside and outside.]

686
00:51:48,633 --> 00:51:50,933
Come on, more! Lift it, lift more, lift!

687
00:51:50,933 --> 00:51:52,167
That's right, good.

688
00:51:52,167 --> 00:51:53,900
- Faster, faster!
- Okay, go!

689
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,533
Good, yes. Lift it higher.

690
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:58,900
- Go!
- Just a little more!

691
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,567
Start.

692
00:52:00,567 --> 00:52:04,167
Yes, he asks you to run a bit faster.

693
00:52:06,633 --> 00:52:10,333
You guys will get straight into
the game after a 30-minute break.

694
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:12,700
- 30-minute break!
- Yes.

695
00:52:20,167 --> 00:52:23,333
This is the clothes I gave to Ju Yeon.

696
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:26,333
I told you that you can date with
Ju Yeon over my dead body.

697
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:27,967
Oh my.

698
00:52:27,967 --> 00:52:30,067
What? Are you the mother of Ju Yeon?

699
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:32,267
Are you qualified to decide that?

700
00:52:32,267 --> 00:52:33,667
Oh my.

701
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:37,133
You are not Ju Yeon's type.

702
00:52:37,133 --> 00:52:40,100
- Ju Yeon is…
- Ms. Sae Yan!

703
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:43,133
What kind of things are you talking about?

704
00:52:43,133 --> 00:52:46,933
It's a warning! Be careful!

705
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,467
That was a curse, wasn't it?

706
00:52:51,467 --> 00:52:53,333
I'm not sure what's being said,

707
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:57,267
but her pronunciation is good and pretty.

708
00:52:58,033 --> 00:52:59,367
Oh boy.

709
00:52:59,367 --> 00:53:03,033
The coach's pronunciation is much better.

710
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:06,000
Hey, since we're on the subject,

711
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,567
uh, could you maybe help me
and Sae Yan get together?

712
00:53:10,567 --> 00:53:13,833
You two seem to be very close.

713
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:16,567
What the heck! What's so pretty about her!

714
00:53:16,567 --> 00:53:19,800
Why are you getting angry again?

715
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,833
Shin.

716
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:23,767
- What?
- What is it?

717
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:26,467
Hey, drink some water.

718
00:53:26,467 --> 00:53:29,600
And raise your knees when you step.

719
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,333
Don't do it carelessly, okay?

720
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:35,233
Your fluctuations in condition are all visible.

721
00:53:35,767 --> 00:53:39,500
[Doesn't your brother know the truth about
the incident? Let's meet 4 p.m. at the cafe.]

722
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,733
Go now, what are you doing here?

723
00:53:40,733 --> 00:53:44,233
Hey, Shin! Lee Shin!

724
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:05,900
The documents, Player Lee Shin
came and picked them up that day.

725
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,533
Did Shin do that?

726
00:54:07,533 --> 00:54:09,400
He said that since you lost
your memory due to the accident,

727
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,867
there's no need to bring up your bad memories.

728
00:54:11,867 --> 00:54:15,000
Your younger brother is
really worried about you.

729
00:54:16,467 --> 00:54:19,067
There's no record on the CCTV
from that day because of the rain.

730
00:54:19,067 --> 00:54:23,467
It'll be recorded based on the testimony
of the paramedic and your brother.

731
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,367
Still, you're lucky.

732
00:54:26,367 --> 00:54:29,567
It's only because Player Lee Shin is someone
of his caliber that he was able to save you.

733
00:54:32,067 --> 00:54:35,667
Was it Shin who saved me?

734
00:54:35,667 --> 00:54:37,867
Didn't you know?

735
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:42,067
To swim with an unconscious person for
such a long time and get him out so quickly…

736
00:54:42,067 --> 00:54:44,967
It was raining that day and the Han
River water would have been muddy.

737
00:54:44,967 --> 00:54:49,733
It's strange because one would usually
remove shoes before diving in to save someone.

738
00:54:49,733 --> 00:54:51,333
The paramedic said

739
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:55,167
Player Lee Shin was soaking
wet, even his shoes.

740
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,067
Please, please, please.

741
00:55:05,067 --> 00:55:07,267
Quickly, quickly.

742
00:55:19,133 --> 00:55:21,167
What's so important about that?

743
00:55:21,167 --> 00:55:25,400
If it was that important, you
should have taken good care of it.

744
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,267
Seung Hyun, the emotion diary that was here…

745
00:55:27,267 --> 00:55:29,500
Haven't you seen that diary?

746
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,633
While I was drawing yesterday,

747
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:34,933
I only used a few pages.

748
00:55:34,933 --> 00:55:38,567
A drawing? What about the diary?

749
00:55:38,567 --> 00:55:42,133
I was playing with Shin yesterday,

750
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:44,800
I left it here.

751
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,300
If you mean Shin, is it Player Lee Shin?

752
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:23,400
The public CCTV wasn't confirmed, either.

753
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:51,800
Yes, the CCTV that overlooks the Han River.

754
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,867
We're at the final stages of
our remodeling construction,

755
00:56:53,867 --> 00:56:57,033
so we haven't installed the CCTV yet.

756
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,867
Is there no other CCTV nearby?

757
00:57:02,867 --> 00:57:06,733
I mean, apart from that public CCTV.

758
00:57:06,733 --> 00:57:09,900
Well, I'm not really sure.

759
00:57:10,433 --> 00:57:13,433
Okay, I see.

760
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,133
Just a moment, please.

761
00:58:05,467 --> 00:58:08,167
Everyone, stay hidden from Shin and then.

762
00:58:08,167 --> 00:58:10,567
If a suspicious person appears,
you know what to do, right?

763
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:12,667
- Yes.

Hey, your brother is really driving me crazy.

770
00:58:52,233 --> 00:58:54,300
What?

771
00:58:54,833 --> 00:58:57,033
He left the Athletes' Village
without saying anything?

772
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:00,233
I don't know. It seemed like he
had an urgent matter come up.

773
00:59:00,233 --> 00:59:03,933
He ran out all of a sudden without
a word and isn't answering calls.

774
00:59:03,933 --> 00:59:05,533
I'm now making up stories to the coach.

775
00:59:05,533 --> 00:59:07,400
Anyway, it's total chaos right now.

776
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,067
Hey, you need to do something about it quickly.

777
00:59:09,067 --> 00:59:11,967
Hey, you know what happens if Shin
gets kicked out of the national team?

778
00:59:11,967 --> 00:59:14,700
Hey, Si On will be kicked out along with him.

779
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,633
It's doubles, you know.

780
00:59:17,633 --> 00:59:22,033
Alright, I got it. I'll look for him.

Ah, what! What is it?

782

I was just trying to get an autograph.

783

Please, talk to me.

No, just a moment.

First, we need to find Shin.

800
01:02:04,233 --> 01:02:06,100
Can we check where he is right now?

801
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,533
I'm planning to organize my
thoughts during this opportunity.

You know my father?

803
01:02:10,467 --> 01:02:12,200
There are sightings of Shin on social media.

I'm worried that your bad memories will return.

Since the mouse experiment was a success, if
you don't cooperate, there's nothing I can do.
