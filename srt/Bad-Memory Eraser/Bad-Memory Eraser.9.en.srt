00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:56,233
You are appearing on TV.

182
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:58,033
That's always on the news.

183
00:17:58,033 --> 00:17:59,600
Let's just watch something else.

184
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,067
Finally, we end the morning
news with news of the renewal

185
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:06,667
[Lee Shin, loyal FA re-signing]
of the contract of the tennis star player.

186
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,800
CEO Hong is really fast.

187
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,100
The ink on the signature
probably hasn't even dried yet.

188
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,967
[Dung Flex]

189
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:23,633
Do the 'Dung Flex'

190
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,800
Thank you for your hard work.

191
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,200
I don't like it, absolutely not.

192
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,933
I'm not doing it.

193
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:37,700
I absolutely can't do this!

194
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,600
Are you suddenly saying you can't do it?

195
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't like the color.

196
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,067
If you don't like gold or reddish brown…

197
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:48,133
The color of the poop is all the same.

198
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:49,833
I don't like the shape, either.

199
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,900
No, I'm telling you it's
the same as it was then.

200
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:01,633
Little cutie.

201
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:03,100
Didn't you even look at the storyboard?

202
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,600
How can you agree to it without consulting me?

203
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,300
I heard the storyboard
was sent to you by email.

204
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,100
I didn't realize it was the same
storyboard from back then.

205
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,700
Am I a child?

206
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,833
I heard it was just two months ago.

207
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,400
I've grown 2 cm in just two months.

208
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,633
I am not a child anymore.

209
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:25,800
I really hate this so much!

210
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,867
What are you going to do about it?

211
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:33,367
Whether you convince her or scold
her, she has to keep filming it.

212
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,300
This contract was made
with the previous agency.

213
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,833
I think we need to examine the legal clauses.

214
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,333
Excuse me?

215
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,667
Do you know how much money
has been spent on this set?

216
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,400
Then, pay the penalty and
all costs incurred today.

217
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,733
If you don't cooperate by 5 P.M. today,
we would consider it a breach of contract.

218
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,933
I'll go!

219
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,167
I am sorry.

220
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,100
Little cutie, little cutie!

221
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,833
Yes, hello. This is Lee Goon speaking.

222
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,033
Who is this?

223
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,367
Oh, you're the brother of Player
Lee Shin from our agency.

224
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,100
Ah, who would have known

225
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,367
that he would re-sign with
me instead of his own brother.

226
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:51,133
I have to give in to you. I heard
that you don't even go out to eat.

227
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,467
Because you are worried that
you'll go out of the business.

228
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:56,567
I thought that would be you.

229
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:58,800
I heard that Cha Si On is causing trouble.

230
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,100
Investors really hate when
something is not profitable.

231
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,000
Ah, sir.

232
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,933
CEO Hong.

233
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:13,300
You already came out like this to greet me.

234
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,967
Welcome.

235
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:19,267
Thanks to Lee Shin's contract renewal,
the agency's image has also improved.

236
00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:22,367
It's all thanks to you, sir.

237
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:24,567
- Let's go in.
- Yes.

238
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:27,000
Mr. Lee, wait here.

239
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,100
Jincheon Athletes' Village?

240
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,033
You want me to go all the way
there and interpret for you?

241
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:39,233
Yes.

242
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:41,267
Yes, yes.

243
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:44,000
Yes.

244
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,300
It's a shame, but I'm sure you'll be able to
find another competent interpreter somewhere.

245
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,900
Yes.

246
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,167
Okay, then. Just hang up the phone now.

247
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:55,867
I need to dig up the ground to drink beer.

248
00:21:57,467 --> 00:22:00,933
After clearing out all the beer in the fridge,

249
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:02,767
beers come out of the ground.

250
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:05,900
I should farm beer at our house.

251
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,133
I had only put a few in
just to drink occasionally.

252
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:12,600
Oh, ma'am…

253
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,833
If you're going to just wander around
doing nothing, then just go back home.

254
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,600
Why?

255
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,533
Ma'am.

256
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:22,867
Your mom is also insisting
to send you off quickly.

257
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:27,033
I heard you went back and forth
to the countryside every day.

258
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:30,500
What are you wandering around for?

259
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,333
To the countryside…

260
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,967
Oh, hold on. Hold on.

261
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:38,167
Where is the Jincheon Athletes' Village?

262
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:42,633
- You've worked hard.
- Yeah.

263
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:45,000
Good job.

264
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,833
Hey, what's this? Are these new uniforms?

265
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:53,533
Stay still. Stay still.

266
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:59,033
Coach Bang?

267
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:01,267
Oh, Shin.

268
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:04,867
You came early?

269
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,667
Don't tell me, your face…

270
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:08,667
Is it because of the wound I punched back then?

271
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:11,167
That can't be.

272
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:13,233
I was wondering

273
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:16,033
if this fist was actually cotton candy.

274
00:23:16,033 --> 00:23:17,367
It was very sweet.

275
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:19,500
Well, hey…

276
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,500
You…

277
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:26,633
I was sorry for that day.

278
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:28,900
It's okay.

279
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,867
Ah, where's my partner?

280
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,367
That's right. She's filming now, right?

281
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:34,567
Player Lee Shin?

282
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:36,167
Filming?

283
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:38,267
It's total chaos.

284
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:40,067
She ran away because she doesn't want to film.

285
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:41,900
Because she insisted on
not wearing a poop mask.

286
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,467
But Goon is trying to do as she says.

287
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:46,300
He is on the verge of bankruptcy right now.

288
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,567
Did she cause another incident?

289
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:51,600
She caused trouble, as is typical of her.

290
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,633
What is he really going to do about it?

291
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:55,967
Oh? Ju Yeon.

292
00:23:57,933 --> 00:23:59,333
Ju Yeon.

293
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,767
Oh? Player Lee Shin.

294
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:08,467
Coach, I'm sorry about what happened last time.

295
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:13,367
Translation app…

296
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:17,700
Wait, wait.

297
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,333
- Have a good day at work today.
- Yeah.

298
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,900
- Go for it!
- Bye.

299
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,900
Hey, Dalgona! Welcome.

300
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,333
Please take care of me.

301
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,633
And no need for apologies.

302
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:33,067
Start preparing to keep in step
with Player Si On from tomorrow.

303
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,833
Well…

304
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:40,533
He said you should keep in
step well with Player Si On.

305
00:24:40,533 --> 00:24:44,200
Hey, why are you coming out from there?

306
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,867
Are you singing a song now?

307
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:49,767
I got a job here as an interpreter.

308
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:52,167
What?

309
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:55,033
Then how do you know Ju Yeon?

310
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:57,933
Are you talking about Ju Yeon?

311
00:24:57,933 --> 00:25:00,900
She's my roommate. We live together.

312
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,033
What?

313
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:06,500
Ju Yeon recommended this job to me too.

314
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,567
Oh, right.

315
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:12,300
You didn't show up in the meeting
room the other day, right?

316
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,067
The other day?

317
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:19,067
Then, did you meet Cha Si On and CEO?

318
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:21,600
Was there anything special?
What did you talk about?

319
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,333
What? Are you jealous by any chance?

320
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:28,167
- Follow me, follow me.
- Hey, hey!

321
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:29,233
You bastard!

322
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:33,333
Hey! Let go!

323
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,067
You quit right now.

324
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:40,300
This is my territory. Each person's
territory must not be invaded.

325
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,133
Why?

326
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:45,833
Are you afraid that I'll tell everyone
about my brief fling with you?

327
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:46,833
Hey, don't worry.

328
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:49,433
Would I really reveal my shame
past with my own mouth?

329
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:52,767
Listen well, the CEO you met
the other day is my elder brother.

330
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:56,700
And Ju Yeon is my brother's first
love that he's been looking for.

331
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:01,567
What does that have to do with me?

332
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:04,567
Just do what I tell you, and don't
think about making it complicated.

333
00:26:04,567 --> 00:26:05,700
I'm telling you to back off.

334
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,767
What if I don't want to?

335
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:10,367
I will tell the coach

336
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:13,367
directly to fire you.

337
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:14,467
Do whatever you want.

338
00:26:14,467 --> 00:26:17,300
How are you going to tell him?
You don't even speak Italian.

339
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,100
Try to live a more civilized life.

340
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,667
If I have this one thing, it'll work.

341
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:23,867
Oh, really? Then I'll have to say in Italian
beforehand not to listen to that.

342
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:26,200
Then he won't understand what you're saying.

343
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,567
Why do you keep interfering in my life?

344
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:32,767
I don't even care about you.

345
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:36,067
Here is close to the countryside, so
I can find that person and do my work.

346
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:38,967
Anyway! Don't mind it.

347
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:43,700
Why hasn't the man you're
looking for shown up yet?

348
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,633
Have you ever considered that
he doesn't want to meet you?

349
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,467
Think about it carefully.

350
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:52,700
Why hasn't anyone who knows him yet
appeared in that small country village?

351
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,933
Did he really not show up?

352
00:26:55,933 --> 00:27:00,900
He may not want you to find him.

353
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,867
Hey!

354
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:18,433
[Celebration! School's pride, Player Cha Si On!
Selected for the national tennis team!]

355
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,533
[Everyone sometimes needs comfort.]

356
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,067
Did you take a teary selfie
with artificial tears?

357
00:27:58,067 --> 00:28:01,533
Inducing sympathy reduces malicious comments.

358
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:06,133
What? Did he call you and
ask you to come see me?

359
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:10,367
Didn't you post it on social media on purpose?

360
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:14,533
You felt sorry for causing an accident and running
away, so you at least told him your whereabouts.

361
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:16,333
I guess school was the only place you could go.

362
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:19,000
Even if I'm an athlete, I shouldn't
stay away from studying.

363
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,167
School days won't come back again.

364
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:26,000
Seems like you're just
spacing out all day, huh?

365
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,133
Mr. Lee agreed you don't have to do
that, but why did you still run away?

366
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:32,633
He is also quite sensitive.

367
00:28:32,633 --> 00:28:36,133
So what if he does everything I ask
him to do? Will his business fail?

368
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:39,800
Why? Are you worried about him?

369
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,667
You are young, but you are
a national representative.

370
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:47,533
A player representing a country
cannot do as he or she pleases.

371
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:51,333
Should I tell you how I feel?

372
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,500
[Poop representative, nation's
poop girl. Constipation, step aside]

373
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,833
Who did such a mean thing?

374
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,133
I was excited when I first
filmed the commercial.

375
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:00,533
I filmed a commercial for a major
pharmaceutical company

376
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:02,833
and used the money I
received to pay for coaching.

377
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:05,367
But when they used to call
me the 'nation's fairy,'

378
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:08,533
but now they call me 'the nation's poop girl.'

379
00:29:08,533 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm not a junior, but I'm
a senior national team member,

380
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,733
so I don't like those views anymore.

381
00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:19,167
You keep talking from
other people's perspectives.

382
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:23,300
What you think is important,
not the few trashy perspectives.

383
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,833
You should be the one who is upright.

384
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:32,067
Do you know the three most
useless nagging in the world?

385
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:35,333
'Don't stress out,' 'Raise your self-esteem.'

386
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:39,367
'Don't care about what others
think.' Can you do that?

387
00:29:39,367 --> 00:29:42,533
I don't want to care about
what other people say.

388
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:45,800
But the more I listen to it,

389
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,633
the more it seems like it's true.

390
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:54,167
They don't know anything about me.

391
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,700
Trash bag!

392
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,667
Did you just swear?

393
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:23,700
I said trash bag, trash bag!

394
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,033
So, I gave you a trash bag like this.

395
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:31,200
What are you going to do?

396
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,167
I have to throw it away. What,
should I take it home with me?

397
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,233
That's right.

398
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:40,467
Are you going to take it knowing it's
obviously trash? You should throw it away.

399
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:43,600
If you know that the words of strangers
are trash, just throw them away.

400
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,467
Now you know how to tell
what is trash and what is not.

401
00:30:47,467 --> 00:30:52,400
Rumors keep popping up day after day.

402
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,100
When I lose a game, I'm
the one who's the most upset.

403
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,433
But instead of comforting me,
they swear all sorts of things.

404
00:30:58,433 --> 00:31:02,867
You know what's better than
someone consoling you?

405
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:06,233
You can comfort yourself.

406
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:08,433
Here, like this.

407
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:11,867
Si On has worked hard today. Si On is the best.

408
00:31:11,867 --> 00:31:16,633
I'm truly my number one pick.

409
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,000
You don't have a boyfriend, right?

410
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,133
Would you like me to set
you up on a blind date?

411
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:24,533
I have a friend who likes older people.

412
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:28,800
This is called a 'butterfly hug'.

413
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,000
It will make you feel very peaceful.

414
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,967
Cross your arms into an X
and then hug yourself.

415
00:31:33,967 --> 00:31:36,900
And gently stroke and pat yourself.

416
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,733
That's right. I lost, but I fought well.

417
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:43,067
I'm your number one fan. I support
you so much. You're the best.

418
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,700
I was so sexy during the game today.

419
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:50,600
I love myself the most,
fervently, passionately!

420
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,300
Now, in this way, Player Si On…

421
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,733
Player Si On.

422
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:21,433
I sincerely thank you for
investing so generously.

423
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:24,567
Let's have a meal with
Player Lee Shin next time.

424
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:28,567
Of course, I will contact you next time.

425
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:40,600
I have something to discuss with you regarding
Player Cha Si On's advertising contract.

426
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,300
I've received a call from the advertiser.

427
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,867
We're investing, not doing charity.

428
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:47,567
We'll arrange it with the sportswear
company the player prefers,

429
00:32:47,567 --> 00:32:49,267
and we'll handle any losses as a way to cope.

430
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,800
I won't say it twice.

431
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,433
Well, sir.

432
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,067
Yes, Coach.

433
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:11,600
Ah, it's refreshing.

434
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:15,167
Cut! Oh, that was good.

435
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:17,967
But, just a bit more of refreshing
vibe! Let's do it one more time.

436
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:20,033
Yes.

437
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:27,667
Ready, action!

438
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,067
Move aside, constipation!

439
00:33:37,067 --> 00:33:41,133
Now do the 'Dung Flex'.

440
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:45,467
Cut! Okay!

441
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:48,000
That's good. Why didn't
you do it like this before?

442
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,400
Let's take a short break.

443
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,167
Let's take a short break.

444
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:58,333
Little cutie.

445
00:33:58,333 --> 00:33:59,833
This is…

446
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:01,167
You don't have to force
yourself to do it. Let's go.

447
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:03,800
Trash bag! Do you know that?

448
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,667
What? You shouldn't swear.

449
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:09,400
Ah, never mind.

450
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,533
It makes me sad to think that someone
else might show up wearing this mask.

451
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:17,033
I don't care if I'm called the nation's
poop girl or the nation's fairy.

452
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:21,033
The agency has been giving me money
for years to keep me playing for a long time.

453
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:23,267
Why…

454
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:27,633
As I promised at the beginning, I'll let
you concentrate only on your sports.

455
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:29,267
We can handle the advertising contract
affairs no matter how much…

456
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:33,467
No, mister. Relax.

457
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:36,367
Dr. Kyung came to my school
earlier and taught me.

458
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:39,567
Kyung… Dr. Kyung Ju Yeon?

459
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:43,000
Peace! Try to find some
tranquility in your mind.

460
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,933
Now, try to follow me.

461
00:34:45,933 --> 00:34:49,800
Dear, dear! You did well.

462
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,000
Dear, dear! You should be a huge success!

463
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,033
Dear, dear. Goon, dear, dear.

464
00:34:57,033 --> 00:35:01,800
Dear, dear. Great job, Goon.
You should be a huge success!

465
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:23,033
When is your owner coming?

466
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:24,733
It's not that I'm waiting or anything.

467
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:29,300
I'm just waiting with
you in case you get bored.

468
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:32,733
[Patient Lee Goon]

469
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:39,967
Hello.

470
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:41,867
Where are you?

471
00:35:41,867 --> 00:35:44,267
I had some sleep at the agency.

472
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:49,767
Well, if you haven't eaten yet,
let's eat something together.

473
00:35:49,767 --> 00:35:51,667
Eat?

474
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:53,700
I haven't eaten yet.

475
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,600
I thought you said we
weren't going to eat together?

476
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:00,000
If you don't want to, just say so.

477
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
No, it's not that I don't want to.

478
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,767
A company dinner is okay. A company dinner.

479
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:10,800
See you in 30 minutes at the food
stall in front of the training grounds.

480
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,033
What about the time to get ready…

481
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:16,733
Hello? Hello?

482
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:20,967
If he asks me to come, should I go right away?

483
00:36:20,967 --> 00:36:23,400
I should go. He's my subject of the experiment.

484
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,200
Cola, I'll be back soon.

485
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:29,933
Well, only giving me 30 minutes?

486
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:33,333
Does he think I'll come to him right
away if he tells me to? It's so funny.

487
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:37,400
Oh, taxi! Here, over here!

488
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,833
Sir, please go to the street food
stall in front of the Olympic Stadium.

489
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:48,333
Could you please hurry a little?

490
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,867
I'm worried the noodles might get soggy.

491
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,100
♫ I'm very clumsy ♫

492
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:59,300
♫ I can only use expressions I don't like ♫

493
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:04,167
♫ You know everything. I love you so much ♫

494
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:10,300
♫ Please be like this to me at every moment ♫

495
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:22,567
I'm sorry, but today I…

496
00:37:22,567 --> 00:37:25,267
I'm here all alone.

497
00:37:26,267 --> 00:37:28,767
Can you come over now?

498
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:37,300
Player Lee Shin, I have an appointment now…

499
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:39,667
What happened?

500
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:42,367
No, it's just…

501
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:44,933
To give you my brother's diary.

502
00:37:57,633 --> 00:38:02,200
Ma'am, please give us two bowls of noodles.

503
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,133
Can I borrow this for a moment?

504
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:07,167
I heard that women
shouldn't sit in cold places.

505
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:08,167
Take it.

506
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:09,667
Thank you.

507
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:12,233
Oh, it's so fluffy.

508
00:38:12,967 --> 00:38:15,367
Oh my.

509
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,500
Okay.

510
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:34,733
His true first love appeared in front of him.

511
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:39,100
And she even knows Ju Yeon?

512
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:46,367
If he keeps running into Jeon Sae Yan,

513
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:49,433
his memories might come back.

514
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:53,600
Jeon Sae Yan.

515
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,433
If it's Ju Yeon, she can persuade her.

516
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:03,500
I'll tell her everything

517
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,533
about his true first love.

518
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:37,167
This is really…

519
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,733
Anyone who sees you will think you came
right away after waiting for a phone call.

520
00:39:39,733 --> 00:39:44,167
Wow, I wondered why my steps were drawn here.

521
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,267
I already have company. It's Ju Yeon.

522
00:39:50,267 --> 00:39:53,067
Really? Ju Yeon? That's great.

523
00:39:53,067 --> 00:39:54,767
Then, we can eat together.

524
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,000
Let's wait together.

525
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,500
Ma'am, please give me one more bowl of noodles.

526
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,633
Yes.

527
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:08,667
I'll eat it first because
it shouldn't get cold.

528
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,833
That, the…

529
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:25,767
Let's have the company dinner later.
I'll go to the agency after work.

530
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:30,867
Then, please eat a lot and enjoy it.

531
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,867
Oh, you got rejected.

532
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:38,433
Ju Yeon has a bad impression of you these days.

533
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:44,667
Why? What did she say?

534
00:40:46,233 --> 00:40:47,767
The main dish is missing, isn't it?

535
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:49,200
What?

536
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,600
Ma'am, just give us two bottles of beer here.

537
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,333
Yes.

538
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:55,433
The main dish.

539
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:59,733
Thank you.

540
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:03,933
So what did Ju Yeon say about me?

541
00:41:04,933 --> 00:41:05,933
Wow.

542
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:09,033
I'm a bit thirsty, so I'll start.

543
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:18,267
This water is enough for me.

544
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:22,567
I feel bad drinking alone.

545
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:26,100
Then, this… I've washed my hands.

546
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,567
Like this, sort of…

547
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:32,100
Get in the mood to drink.

548
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:35,467
Like a cocktail.

549
00:41:35,467 --> 00:41:38,300
- Cocktail…
- Cheers.

550
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:12,400
There's no one here. Did
you rent the whole place?

551
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,167
The place can't match your beauty.

552
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:18,300
Here, have a seat.

553
00:42:23,633 --> 00:42:26,333
Your beauty is beyond the limit.

554
00:42:28,267 --> 00:42:31,233
Do you know that you are sometimes cheesy?

555
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:35,567
What about the notebook?

556
00:42:35,567 --> 00:42:39,233
This isn't some kind of police interrogation.

557
00:42:39,233 --> 00:42:41,300
Are we just going to get to the point?

558
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:46,267
Let's talk about the weather,
and also catch up a bit.

559
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:48,933
The view is nice.

560
00:42:53,633 --> 00:42:57,100
If I see a river, it's a river view.

561
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,967
If I see the ocean, it's an ocean view.

562
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,667
If I see Ju Yeon,

563
00:43:03,867 --> 00:43:06,300
I love you.

564
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:11,967
What about the notebook? The emotion diary.

565
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:19,400
Still, we have to eat the signature dish here.

566
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,500
I've rented out this whole place, right?

567
00:43:28,433 --> 00:43:31,567
So what Ju Yeon always said was…

568
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,067
We drank all the beer.

569
00:43:33,067 --> 00:43:34,833
Ma'am, one more beer for us please

570
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:36,467
No, no.

571
00:43:36,467 --> 00:43:40,667
We've eaten enough, so I'll be going now.

572
00:43:42,467 --> 00:43:45,767
By the way, your first love.

573
00:43:45,767 --> 00:43:47,733
Ju Yeon.

574
00:43:47,733 --> 00:43:51,167
I heard you've been looking
for her for a very long time.

575
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,400
How was it?

576
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,933
You must have imagined a lot.

577
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:58,667
How might her face have
changed? What would she like?

578
00:43:58,667 --> 00:44:00,333
Could she be married?

579
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:03,400
What would her reaction be when seeing me?

580
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,633
How was it? Was it as you imagined?

581
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,033
Actually, I am also looking
for someone right now.

582
00:44:16,567 --> 00:44:19,100
But I haven't thought about that.

583
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,400
What would that person's
reaction be when seeing me?

584
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,067
Not everyone can feel the same way I do.

585
00:44:26,067 --> 00:44:31,533
I wonder if I'm just searching
out of my own greed…

586
00:44:35,567 --> 00:44:39,100
You'll know once you try it.

587
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,533
But what if I get hurt in the process?

588
00:44:41,533 --> 00:44:44,533
Then, I would be just too pitiful.

589
00:44:51,433 --> 00:44:54,500
The touch of that child on that day.

590
00:44:55,033 --> 00:44:56,600
The calm tone of voice.

591
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,367
The scent of the waterside.

592
00:44:59,367 --> 00:45:05,167
I remember the event from
15 years ago as if it was yesterday.

593
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:08,167
I've missed her for a very long time.

594
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:10,267
And finally, we've reunited.

595
00:45:10,267 --> 00:45:15,933
Well, you know the result.

596
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:20,300
Even if she doesn't remember
me at all, I remember her.

597
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,700
Even if she doesn't like me at all, I like…

598
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:31,533
Even if I could go back to before I found her,

599
00:45:31,533 --> 00:45:33,600
I would gladly find her again.

600
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,833
Willingly.

601
00:45:36,933 --> 00:45:41,033
Wow, I want this kind of guy.

602
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,167
You're a very charming man.

603
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:48,633
If I had been your first love, I
wouldn't have hurt you like that.

604
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,467
Thanks to you, I had a very good meal.

605
00:45:55,267 --> 00:45:56,533
And,

606
00:45:56,533 --> 00:46:01,533
I don't quite remember
exactly what Ju Yeon said.

607
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,267
She worries about you a lot.

608
00:46:10,633 --> 00:46:12,800
Well…

609
00:46:21,433 --> 00:46:25,633
Can you give me a ride…

610
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,200
This is just a schedule notebook.

611
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:40,600
I found it in the dust.

612
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,533
Then it's not at home.

613
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:46,200
My brother threw away
everything he used before.

614
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,700
Then we can do nothing about it.

615
00:46:57,967 --> 00:47:00,733
Does it not taste good?

616
00:47:00,733 --> 00:47:03,200
Ah, no,

617
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:09,000
The view is really nice.

618
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,500
That's the 57th time you've said that.

619
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:21,167
I heard that you are
acquainted with the interpreter.

620
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:23,933
We are living together for a while.

621
00:47:23,933 --> 00:47:28,867
Please take care of her. She has never
worked before because of strict home rules.

622
00:47:29,567 --> 00:47:31,867
I see.

623
00:47:33,467 --> 00:47:36,067
That's true.

624
00:47:36,067 --> 00:47:40,367
She'll probably quit soon
because the home rules are strict.

625
00:47:40,367 --> 00:47:41,967
- Pardon?
- Okay.

626
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:44,933
No, nothing.

627
00:47:45,467 --> 00:47:48,733
Can I eat this by any chance?

628
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:52,800
I have to manage my weight again
when I enter the Athletes' Village.

629
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:55,967
Please eat up.

630
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:07,833
My brother used to sneak food into his room

631
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:12,267
and eat it when he was a junior player.

632
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:14,233
He did that when he was young?

633
00:48:14,233 --> 00:48:17,967
So, he must have eaten alone back then, right?

634
00:48:17,967 --> 00:48:20,733
My brother really liked jelly.

635
00:48:20,733 --> 00:48:23,633
He was caught by the coach
while secretly eating jelly.

636
00:48:23,633 --> 00:48:25,833
And there was a death course
in front of the training ground.

637
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:28,267
He used to run there every day.

638
00:48:28,267 --> 00:48:30,833
What? Did he like jelly that much?

639
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:35,200
I thought he wouldn't touch anything
unhealthy, but he has the taste of a kid.

640
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,300
He's not even a child.

641
00:48:40,733 --> 00:48:44,300
I like chocolate better than jelly.

642
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,267
What flavor of jelly does he like?

643
00:48:46,267 --> 00:48:50,067
Does he like something like
ginseng-flavored jelly?

644
00:48:50,067 --> 00:48:52,900
I wonder if he cuts jelly
like this and eats it.

645
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,033
It's so funny.

646
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:59,700
Do you like him?

647
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,233
- Pardon?
- Whenever it comes to him,

648
00:49:07,233 --> 00:49:10,133
your eyes sparkle.

649
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:15,800
I guess it's because I have to
write an observation journal.

650
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,900
It's a natural interest as a researcher.

651
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,133
Well, that's a relief.

652
00:49:23,133 --> 00:49:26,333
He thinks you are his first love,

653
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:29,400
so he might feel that way,

654
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,267
but the true first love of my brother

655
00:49:32,267 --> 00:49:34,800
is not you.

656
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,733
Yes, of course.

657
00:49:48,433 --> 00:49:50,767
Ju Yeon, try this.

658
00:49:52,833 --> 00:50:00,467
♫ How much further do I
have to go before I can see ♫

659
00:50:00,467 --> 00:50:07,033
♫ Even if that unreachable dream ♫

660
00:50:07,033 --> 00:50:15,033
♫ Turns away from me and becomes more blurred ♫

661
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:23,067
♫ I will walk towards that day ♫

662
00:50:23,933 --> 00:50:27,600
I feel like I've been really
drained of energy today.

663
00:50:30,367 --> 00:50:33,633
What time is it now? She's just home?

664
00:50:48,433 --> 00:50:52,367
My house really is the best.

665
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,800
This is my house, though.

666
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,433
Technically, it belongs to the landlord.

667
00:50:59,433 --> 00:51:01,900
I couldn't even eat properly.

668
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:05,700
I just watched her drink it with her mouth.

669
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,800
Would you like to drink together?

670
00:51:13,467 --> 00:51:15,700
Okay.

671
00:51:29,567 --> 00:51:32,933
- Here.
- Ah, mine.

672
00:51:32,933 --> 00:51:34,967
It's mine.

673
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,333
Cheers.

674
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:41,367
Cheers.

675
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,833
Oh my.

676
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:17,100
He's handsome.

677
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,633
What am I saying? Oh my.

678
00:52:18,633 --> 00:52:21,567
Am I so tired that I'm talking nonsense?

679
00:52:21,567 --> 00:52:24,433
Oh my.

680
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:33,133
If it's not because of coffee,

681
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,533
unless my heart is pounding

682
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:40,900
because I'm scared or in pain.

683
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:08,500
Oh my, oh my.

684
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,733
Ugh, I slept well.

685
00:53:17,733 --> 00:53:20,800
I also fell asleep… What time is it now?

686
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:37,533
Why did you come here?

687
00:53:37,533 --> 00:53:42,367
Self-esteem starts with small things.

688
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:45,600
Shh.

689
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,533
Can't we just come during the day?

690
00:53:54,533 --> 00:53:58,767
That's why… That's why
I said I would come alone.

691
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,767
- Are you scared?
- Yes.

692
00:54:02,767 --> 00:54:04,867
Oh, gosh.

693
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:07,067
Don't do that.

694
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:09,400
- Ah, you startled me!
- So why did you come with me?

695
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,167
Ugh, really.

696
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,900
- Let's go.
- Uh, just a minute.

697
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,500
Let's go slowly.

698
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,933
Now, let's go.

699
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:46,167
Seriously, please stop that.

700
00:54:46,167 --> 00:54:48,400
Let's go.

701
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,800
I'm planning to change it to a new desk.

702
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,300
No matter how much I try not to care,

703
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,067
she's still young, so…

704
00:55:35,067 --> 00:55:38,667
But, the hands…

705
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,667
The new desk is probably in the storage room.

706
00:55:44,667 --> 00:55:50,433
But that would be like giving
them a new sketchbook.

707
00:55:51,233 --> 00:55:52,700
Let's doodle on it.

708
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,267
Doodle?

709
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:56,567
Let's raise her pride as
a national representative,

710
00:55:56,567 --> 00:55:59,567
and let the students know
about the status of Player Si On,

711
00:55:59,567 --> 00:56:05,167
Let's doodle that even the most
mischievous guys will never be able to do.

712
00:56:05,767 --> 00:56:07,500
Okay.

713
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,800
I'll take red.

714
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,533
Then I'll take blue.

715
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,700
Alright.

716
00:56:17,033 --> 00:56:19,367
Should we use a big one?

717
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,533
How could someone doodle like this?

718
00:56:24,533 --> 00:56:27,333
I know. Students these days are so scary.

719
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:29,933
- They are so mean.
- This bad thing…

720
00:56:30,467 --> 00:56:32,500
It's all done.

721
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:18,100
♫ The day when it becomes dazzlingly bright ♫

722
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:26,167
♫ Even if your steps are still heavy ♫

723
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:32,500
♫ I will be by your side, as if it's fate ♫

724
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:40,733
♫ In sleep, and even in dreams ♫

725
00:57:40,733 --> 00:57:46,133
♫ I will protect you ♫

726
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:51,767
This is… I feel proud.

727
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,700
Wait, my cell phone!

728
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,267
I think I left it behind.
I'll bring it right away.

729
00:58:01,267 --> 00:58:03,400
- Yes.
- Just a moment, one minute!

730
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,500
One minute.

731
00:58:10,967 --> 00:58:13,300
Starting now, one minute!

732
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,433
It can't possibly be.

733
00:58:18,433 --> 00:58:21,133
It shouldn't be.

734
00:58:21,133 --> 00:58:24,633
Because the me he sees isn't real.

735
00:58:24,633 --> 00:58:29,400
Ju Yeon, I found it.

736
00:58:31,933 --> 00:58:34,033
I should check.

737
00:58:34,033 --> 00:58:38,133
Let's find out my true feelings about him.

738
00:58:55,300 --> 00:59:00,367
♫ I start and end every day alone ♫

739
00:59:00,367 --> 00:59:04,367
♫ The warmth of you goes around ♫

740
00:59:04,367 --> 00:59:08,567
♫ If only we could be peaceful and♫

741
00:59:08,567 --> 00:59:12,433
♫ Beautiful with those words we looked at ♫

742
00:59:12,433 --> 00:59:19,100
♫ It's you ♫

743
00:59:20,733 --> 00:59:27,767
♫ It's you ♫

744
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:35,733
♫ It's you ♫

745
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:44,267
♫ It's you ♫

746
00:59:45,267 --> 00:59:50,400
♫ I start and end every day alone ♫

747
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,500
♫ The warmth of you goes around ♫

748
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:58,667
♫ If only we could be peaceful and♫

749
00:59:58,667 --> 01:00:04,133
♫ Beautiful with those words we looked at ♫

750
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:09,233
[Bad Memory Eraser]

751
01:00:09,233 --> 01:00:11,567
Ah, what should I do? I can't look at his face.

752
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:14,267
Since it's for work, let's get in my car.

753
01:00:14,267 --> 01:00:15,367
Would you like to take my car?

754
01:00:15,367 --> 01:00:17,533
Hurry and get in! Hurry!

755
01:00:17,533 --> 01:00:19,533
If I get caught, I won't be
able to come back to Korea.

756
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:21,133
It's all for you.

757
01:00:21,133 --> 01:00:23,033
Snap out of it, Kyung Ju Yeon.

758
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:26,600
Why did you bring Jeon
Sae Yan without any notice?

759
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,633
I'll sacrifice myself if
I can just block your way.

760
01:00:29,633 --> 01:00:32,633
You've been touchy, and a bit
annoyed with me all day.

761
01:00:32,633 --> 01:00:34,067
There is a large temperature
difference in the mountains.

762
01:00:34,067 --> 01:00:38,100
You know what to do in case you
end up alone in the mountains, right?

763
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:41,567
All my attention is focused on this person.
