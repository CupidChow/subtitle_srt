180
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:45,100
Cola, are you constipated?

181
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,000
Hey, try sitting down. Sit down
and correct your posture.

182
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,300
Oh, I wasn't talking to you.

183
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,000
Everything is okay.

184
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,633
I've been a bit busy with Shin's work lately.

185
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:57,500
I'll call you back later.

186
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,900
Okay, then.

187
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,867
He said he's okay, Kyung Ju Yeon!

188
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:06,767
Why do you keep bothering me?

189
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:07,767
Pardon?

190
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:10,467
Ah, I got confused.

191
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:13,233
I'll hang up now.

192
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,367
- Bye.
- Bye.

193
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:23,167
Bye.

194
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,200
Bye.

195
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,467
Still, everything gets through.

196
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:32,733
Heart to heart,

197
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:37,100
and gaze to gaze.

198
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:42,400
Yes, hello.

199
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,633
I'm Jeon Sae Yan, who lived at

200
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,733
126 Duri-myeo-gol 15 years ago.

201
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:52,933
Yes, I was wondering if by
any chance you remember me.

202
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:55,733
Hello? Hello…

203
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:03,933
Are you almost done with the calls?

204
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:05,667
I'm not sure.

205
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,167
If you're almost done,

206
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:11,867
how about going to see Mr. Lee?

207
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:14,000
Mr. Lee?

208
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,767
He must be busy dealing
with Lee Shin's affairs.

209
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,500
But why do you keep suggesting I go see him?

210
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,567
What?

211
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:27,833
And even the nursing.

212
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,233
Did you two fight?

213
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,367
No, it's not like that.

214
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:34,167
I just heard that you two
became close friends last time,

215
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:37,467
So, I thought you could be
a support to each other.

216
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:40,533
No, surely you'd be more of a support than me.

217
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:43,167
You are his first love.

218
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:51,667
Okay, next up is Ms. Ahn Jeong Sook.

219
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:55,033
Do you want me to help you find your dad?

220
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,500
Really?

221
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,067
Yes.

222
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:00,167
- Are you asking if it's voice phishing?
- Ah, you don't know?

223
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:02,033
- No, no.
- Yes, I see, thank you.

224
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:03,300
Why is he swearing?

225
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,233
Why is he swearing like that?

226
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,400
Yes.

227
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:14,233
I'm looking for someone,
so I'm calling you now.

228
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:17,567
Ah, yes. It's 126.

229
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:21,667
Her mother's name is Jeon So Jeong.

230
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:23,467
That's right.

231
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:25,700
Oh, just a moment.

232
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:27,667
Yes, please go ahead.

233
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:31,533
Are you talking about that child's mother?
The one who lives with the child alone

234
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:33,667
while the child's father works abroad?

235
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:34,800
Uh, yes. That's right.

236
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,900
I'm Sae Yan, the child you're talking about.

237
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,400
Do you know anything about
my father, by any chance?

238
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,800
Even just a name?

239
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,533
Well…

240
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:47,767
That is…

241
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:50,733
Ugh, I don't know. I don't want to
get involved, so don't call me.

242
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:53,700
Wait a moment, ma'am.

243
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,600
It seemed like she knew something.

244
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,767
The phone is powered off,
connecting to voicemail…

245
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,433
It said the power is off.

246
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:13,600
For the first time, someone who
knows something has come forward.

247
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,933
Am I going to end up not finding my dad?

248
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:20,967
I've asked other people to call
me, if they remember anything,

249
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:23,233
so let's wait and see.

250
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:25,333
Okay.

251
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,300
Hello?

252
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,133
Yes, I'm Sae Yan. I mean I'm Jeon Sae Yan…

253
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:40,667
You know my father?

254
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,033
This one? Or this one?

255
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:49,467
Which one looks a bit neater?

256
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:52,733
Clothes somewhat suitable for adults.

257
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:57,967
This one is too revealing.

258
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,900
Why is my hair this yellow?

259
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,400
Should I dye my hair in black?

260
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,367
What if my dad thinks I'm a delinquent?

261
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:07,733
Or can't you lend me your clothes?

262
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,567
Your clothes are tidy, right?

263
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:11,800
Alright.

264
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,333
Oh, it's done. Thank you.

265
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,133
Then just a moment.

266
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:16,433
Ah, then I should pack a lunchbox.

267
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:18,967
No, rather than a lunchbox,

268
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:20,467
yes, I'll find the gift…

269
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:24,567
I'll find the gift I brought
from Italy to give to my dad.

270
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:27,533
Okay.

271
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:30,133
Exhale. That's right.

272
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,000
What should I do?

273
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,733
I'm too nervous.

274
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:37,267
What if my dad is disappointed when he sees me?

275
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:39,533
What if he says I'm not pretty?

276
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:44,800
You look so pretty to me, so how much
prettier can you be to your father?

277
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,400
Actually, I…

278
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,433
I feel so good.

279
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:54,067
No, I mean…

280
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,467
I don't know how to ride a bike.

281
00:21:55,467 --> 00:22:00,200
Because kids are all taught by their
own fathers to ride a bike like this.

282
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,200
So I thought "I should learn when
my dad comes," so I didn't learn it.

283
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,433
Swimming too! Swimming…

284
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:10,733
I went to learn swimming, and everyone
was being held by their fathers.

285
00:22:10,733 --> 00:22:13,133
Just like this, floating along.

286
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:16,367
So I just skipped it and didn't go.

287
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:18,833
I still don't know how to swim.

288
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,367
I'm planning to learn it when my dad comes.

289
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:23,400
But,

290
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,900
I'm finally meeting my dad now.

291
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:34,233
If you cry now, your eyes will swell up.

292
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:35,467
You are right.

293
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:39,233
What if you meet your dad, and he
says, "You don't have my eyes."

294
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,800
No way.

295
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,367
I won't cry. Look.

296
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:46,667
I won't cry.

297
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:51,500
Buy him something delicious.

298
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,167
I know all your credit cards being blocked.

299
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:58,200
Ah, right. My dad might not have money.

300
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:04,233
Ju Yeon, you are the best.

301
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:34,767
Excuse me…

302
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:35,900
- Yes?
- This…

303
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,467
Would you sell that to me?

304
00:23:38,467 --> 00:23:41,200
How much is this?

305
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,267
How much can I buy this for?

306
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:48,567
Hey, let's try it on. Hand it over.

307
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:49,900
Ah, give it here.

308
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,567
I'll just try it on once.

309
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:54,967
Quickly, quickly. Just once, hurry!

310
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,833
- Just once.
- Take it off!

311
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:01,300
Hey, you delinquent youths.

312
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,067
Don't go around hungry, and leave.

313
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,300
- Hey, aren't you standing there?
- No.

314
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,800
Ah, jeez, the padded jacket.

315
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:10,933
You're just giving it away, right?

316
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:13,900
Your parents might worry if they
know you're going around like this…

317
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,467
What are you talking about. I'm just stealing
back the padding that was stolen from me.

318
00:24:18,467 --> 00:24:20,633
Oh my.

319
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:24,000
Hey, this is like ten times more expensive.

320
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,567
From now on, don't extort anyone and
don't get extorted yourself, okay?

321
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,933
Wow, it's nice.

322
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:31,167
You're not reporting this to the police, right?

323
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:33,767
Promise not to report to the police!

324
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:35,433
Hold on.

325
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:38,700
Take off your sunglasses for a moment.

326
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,133
Where have I seen that face before?

327
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:43,167
Don't you extort money from now on, got it?

328
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:56,400
- Wow, it's…
- What's this?

329
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:01,433
Okay, okay.

330
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:06,433
I've been in sports for 20 years.

331
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,833
How dare…

332
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:11,233
Those bastards.

333
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,033
[Tennis Association]

334
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,233
Honey, is this the place?

335
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:29,367
No, I don't know.

336
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:33,367
Hey, isn't this outfit more eye-catching?

337
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:37,300
Wouldn't just gym clothes be better?

338
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:41,633
How could he even be
under police investigation?

339
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:45,033
Is it okay for the discipline of the Tennis
Association to collapse like this?

340
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:46,567
I didn't hand over the evidence
video to the police

341
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:49,167
because I thought we
could find Lee Shin quickly

342
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:51,300
once the police investigation started.

343
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,733
If he returns, he will be cleared
of all charges immediately.

344
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:56,467
It's not just a matter of
shedding the suspicion.

345
00:25:56,467 --> 00:26:00,367
The person involved has to come
and explain, not just disappear.

346
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:04,133
His long absence from the Athletes' Village
has damaged his dignity as a sportsman.

347
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:05,900
We must strip him of his national
team membership right way,

348
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,833
and prevent him from
participating in competitions.

349
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:10,200
Anyway,

350
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,900
if Player Lee Shin does
not appear within two days,

351
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,800
I will consider not only a suspension

352
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,100
but also permanent expulsion.

353
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,867
Even so, a permanent ban is…

354
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:24,000
I'll…

355
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,400
I'll bring him along.

356
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:31,067
It's like splashing water on a dry face.

357
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:53,033
Hello.

358
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:54,967
Oh.

359
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:56,567
Ms. Sae Yan?

360
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:58,700
Yes.

361
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:02,667
Dad… Daddy?

362
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,200
Can I hug you just once?

363
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,833
Oh, sure.

364
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:20,567
I really tried not to cry.

365
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:24,367
I truly promised myself I wouldn't cry.

366
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,467
The reason I came out today is…

367
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:36,867
I wanted to tell you today is the last day.

368
00:27:36,867 --> 00:27:39,967
I came out to say that.

369
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:43,433
I'm sorry.

370
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:57,033
I'm not usually someone who cries this much.

371
00:27:57,033 --> 00:28:01,267
I actually smile a lot, but you might
misunderstand and think I don't smile much.

372
00:28:01,933 --> 00:28:04,200
Ah, that…

373
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:12,033
I think I drew over a hundred
pictures when I was young.

374
00:28:12,033 --> 00:28:15,567
And I brought the best one I drew among them.

375
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:19,333
Since I didn't know what you looked like,
I drew it from my imagination and

376
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:22,333
it doesn't seem to resemble you much.

377
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:30,900
For me, just…

378
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:36,267
seeing you this healthy is enough for me.

379
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,033
Instead,

380
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,500
just please don't forget me.

381
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:55,067
This is really something I shouldn't be doing.

382
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,133
Pardon?

383
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,800
I'm sorry.

384
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,133
I came out here for money.

385
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:06,767
But you looked so pitiable…

386
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:10,400
What are you talking about…

387
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,967
Someone sent me out here.

388
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:19,100
The truth is, I'm not your real father.

389
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,267
What do you mean? He's not her real father?

390
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,700
How could you do this to her? She's
been yearning for her dad all her life.

391
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:39,667
The reason I called you in such a hurry is…

392
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:43,167
Please persuade our Sae Yan
to go back to Italy quickly.

393
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:47,200
I've already submitted my resignation
to the tennis association through a lawyer.

394
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,033
You made her quit her job as well?

395
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:53,100
What's the reason for doing this?

396
00:29:56,567 --> 00:30:01,367
I heard you are doing research on bad memories.

397
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:11,700
Is there really a need to dig
up even the bad memories?

398
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,433
Why would Sae Yan looking for her
dad be considered a bad memory?

399
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:17,467
Sae Yan has no memories of her dad whatsoever.

400
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,833
I'm talking about the bad
memories for everyone.

401
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:25,033
Pardon?

402
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:30,433
How could you do that?

403
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:34,933
How could you make me into a daughter
who can't even recognize her father's face?

404
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,433
What have I…

405
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:48,500
And you even submitted
a resignation to the association.

406
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,433
I am not going back to Italy.

407
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:52,667
You might think my dad is trash,

408
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:54,500
but to me, he's my father.

409
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,333
He's the father who brought
me into this world, please.

410
00:31:07,467 --> 00:31:11,000
Can't you just please leave me alone?

411
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,900
You might still think of me as a child,

412
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,833
but I've grown up now.

413
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,800
It can't go on like this.
Pack your things right now.

414
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:29,933
Don't do this.

415
00:31:29,933 --> 00:31:32,233
Let go!

416
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:41,333
I will take care of Sae Yan.

417
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,067
No matter if it's between parent and child,

418
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:47,033
how can you deceive even the feelings
she's longed for all her life?

419
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:43,033
I'm so lonely.

420
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:46,667
Why is there no one by my side?

421
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,133
If it's fine with you,

422
00:32:52,133 --> 00:32:55,633
I will be by your side.

425
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:32,067
Look at that person. What is he doing?

426
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:35,200
Oh, that's so funny.

427
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,500

I'm not disappointed.

00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:33,833
Tell me where you are.

00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:36,767
No, no. It's embarrassing.

439
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:41,767
I just called because I wanted to
hear your voice. Just hang up, I'm sorry.

hasn't contacted their parents even once?

Leave him be. If he's hungry, he'll come back.

he hides when it gets tough?

00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:16,000
So, with the desire to give up everything,

537
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,333
I tried to jump into the Han River water,

538
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:22,467
but he held me back.

539
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:24,833
Lee Shin.

540
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,533
With the hand injured from saving me.

541
00:43:30,267 --> 00:43:32,467
Because of that injured hand,

542
00:43:32,467 --> 00:43:36,467
he lived his whole life
in his brother's shadow…

543
00:43:36,467 --> 00:43:39,733
But he chose me over himself again.

544
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,300
Like a fool.

545
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:56,867
He's over there.

546
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,500
And,

547
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,400
I spent a little money.

548
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:06,233
It was also given by Player Lee Shin.

549
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:07,633
Please tell him I said thank you.

550
00:44:07,633 --> 00:44:10,700
Yes, goodbye.

551
00:44:14,567 --> 00:44:17,700
So on this occasion,

552
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,200
I plan to sort my thoughts
out before going back.

553
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,000
What I want to do.

554
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,167
What I need to start doing right away.

555
00:44:27,767 --> 00:44:31,667
Because I've lived listening
only to what others tell me.

556
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:35,433
It's my first time making life plans,

557
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:37,667
so it's difficult.

558
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:44,200
If it's hard to make big plans,
start with small ones.

559
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:49,000
"What should I eat this morning?"
"Should I try something I've never eaten?"

560
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,833
Plan and achieve things as
they come to mind, one by one.

561
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:57,700
Next, a bigger plan, and
then an even bigger one.

562
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,033
Just like that.

563
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,567
Do you know the reason?

564
00:45:06,567 --> 00:45:10,367
The reason I got into someone
named Kyung Ju Yeon.

565
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,633
When I'm with you, I become myself.

566
00:45:14,633 --> 00:45:18,000
I become my true self, not just someone

567
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,100
wearing my brother's mask.

568
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,667
Every day, according to a fixed schedule,

569
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:29,100
I lived suppressing my imperfect emotions.

570
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,100
But when I'm with you,

571
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,767
the real me pops out unexpectedly.

572
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:39,167
As if

573
00:45:40,033 --> 00:45:43,500
you're making the dead me breathe again.

574
00:45:45,633 --> 00:45:47,900
That's why I like you.

575
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,300
I feel comfortable with you.

576
00:45:51,133 --> 00:45:53,700
Do you know…

577
00:45:54,467 --> 00:45:57,633
Do you know that you hold my happiness?

578
00:46:05,667 --> 00:46:08,567
Shall we take a walk?

579
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,833
Ju Yeon.

580
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,767
Mr. Lee.

581
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:30,167
Mr. Lee Goon.

582
00:46:31,433 --> 00:46:33,733
Mr. Lee Goon.

583
00:46:35,533 --> 00:46:38,300
Are you just leaving?

584
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:42,533
How can you leave just like that, after
carrying all that baggage alone up to here?

585
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,533
If you leave like that,

586
00:46:44,533 --> 00:46:46,533
you'll be constantly worried and anxious.

587
00:46:46,533 --> 00:46:50,467
What does that have to do with you?

588
00:46:50,467 --> 00:46:52,800
If you're misunderstanding something…

589
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,367
Misunderstanding?

590
00:46:54,367 --> 00:46:56,800
What misunderstanding?

591
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,200
That there's something going
on between Lee Shin and you?

592
00:47:01,733 --> 00:47:05,567
I've seen it in the Athletes'
Village and now too.

593
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:10,300
Isn't it foolish to think that
as a misunderstanding?

594
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,767
It is a misunderstanding.

595
00:47:13,633 --> 00:47:16,767
I'm not sure if it's right to clarify.

596
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:20,033
Even if you'll just leave, I don't want to see
you leaving with wounds and hurt.

597
00:47:20,033 --> 00:47:21,433
No, that shouldn't be.

598
00:47:21,433 --> 00:47:25,800
Hurt? What hurt?

599
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,900
Are you worried that I got
hurt because I like you?

600
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,467
There's no such a thing…

601
00:47:32,467 --> 00:47:37,633
You know, it was just an old
memory game from the start.

602
00:47:37,633 --> 00:47:40,900
I thought about giving it
a try as it was my first love.

603
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,700
But it turned out to be
less impressive than I thought.

604
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,000
Just in time, I've started to
get tired of a woman like you.

605
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,767
I really dislike complicated things.

606
00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:51,933
Let's not

607
00:47:51,933 --> 00:47:54,567
cling to each other.

608
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:56,867
Let's be cool about it.

609
00:47:58,867 --> 00:48:01,200
That's a lie.

610
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,200
If you say things you don't mean and go,

611
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,733
you'll be uncomfortable all along.

612
00:48:08,733 --> 00:48:14,300
Shall I tell you in a colder, more harsh and
cold way so that you can understand?

613
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,333
I said I don't like you.

614
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:19,833
I'm so sick and tired of you.

615
00:48:25,033 --> 00:48:27,733
Isn't that why

616
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:31,533
your father left you too?

617
00:48:44,233 --> 00:48:46,600
That's enough.

618
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,300
You can do that much.

619
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:53,133
♫ The silent streets are filled ♫

620
00:48:53,133 --> 00:49:00,500
♫ With countless thoughts
and the wounds inside them ♫

621
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:08,067
♫ You light a small light in a corner ♫

622
00:49:08,067 --> 00:49:14,800
♫ Of my heart that I had ignored ♫

623
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:22,400
♫ Where will it be, that day ♫

624
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:30,300
♫ How much further do I
have to go before I can see ♫

625
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:36,700
♫ Even if that unreachable dream ♫

626
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:44,700
♫ Turns away from me and becomes more blurred ♫

627
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:53,133
♫ I will walk towards that day ♫

628
00:49:56,633 --> 00:50:04,300
♫ Stopping at the end of
what was a very long day ♫

629
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:12,200
♫ I let out a long sigh that I've
been holding in so long ♫

630
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:18,633
♫ When the clouds covering my day clear ♫

631
00:50:18,633 --> 00:50:26,633
♫ Say goodbye from the day ♫

[Hanseom Hospital]

634
00:50:56,367 --> 00:51:00,433
Patient 109, we will serve you comfortably.

635
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:01,533
Huh?

636
00:51:01,533 --> 00:51:03,667
Haven't you seen mouse number 109?

637
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:07,400
How would I know? Do you
think I could have pilfered it?

638
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,800
Wow, that's ridiculous.

639
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,300
There's no way I would do that.

640
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:15,300
Since she reacted so strongly, it really
seems like she might have pilfered it.

641
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,833
Did Professor Han take it?

642
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:23,067
Then, Dr. Kim,

643
00:51:23,067 --> 00:51:27,400
You're saying that following this
paper, we might solve the side effects?

644
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,567
That's right.

645
00:51:30,633 --> 00:51:34,600
You mean, all memory recognition errors
can be restored to their original state?

646
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,533
The first trial in the U.K. was successful,

647
00:51:37,533 --> 00:51:40,867
but let's talk after the second trial.

648
00:51:40,867 --> 00:51:42,133
Please take good care of it.

649
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:44,333
If we can just eliminate the side effects,

650
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:47,300
the subject will live
the perfect life he dreams of.

651
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:50,033
Oh, thank you.

652
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,000
Oh, Dr. Nam.

653
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,167
What? Mouse number 109 has disappeared?

654
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,367
You…

655
00:52:19,367 --> 00:52:22,633
What have you done with mouse number 109?

656
00:52:22,633 --> 00:52:24,233
Please cheer up.

657
00:52:24,233 --> 00:52:27,667
I've successfully conducted a reset
experiment with mouse number 109.

658
00:52:27,667 --> 00:52:29,800
A reset?

659
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:34,767
You mean you've reverted mouse
number 109 to before the clinical trial?

660
00:52:34,767 --> 00:52:38,533
How dare you tamper with the mouse
behind my back without my permission?

661
00:52:38,533 --> 00:52:42,967
Aren't you the one secretly
plotting behind the scenes?

662
00:52:42,967 --> 00:52:44,733
For example,

663
00:52:44,733 --> 00:52:47,067
side effects?

664
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,467
How did you know…

665
00:52:52,467 --> 00:52:56,467
I've already secured the evidence
from your computer.

666
00:52:56,467 --> 00:53:00,900
Oh, that's just a very minor side effect.

667
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,700
You know that…

668
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:06,767
It's just a very trivial memory error.

669
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:11,967
It's just simply mistaking Kyung Ju Yeon
as his first love. That's all.

670
00:53:11,967 --> 00:53:17,967
Ah, first love. That's it.

671
00:53:17,967 --> 00:53:20,733
I was confused for a while because
you put a password on the file.

672
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:25,200
Were you just testing me?

673
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,467
The mouse test must have been successful too.

674
00:53:27,467 --> 00:53:29,733
Please cooperate with
the subject reset experiment.

675
00:53:29,733 --> 00:53:30,867
The patient Lee Goon.

676
00:53:30,867 --> 00:53:33,333
What?

677
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:34,567
That is absolutely not allowed.

678
00:53:34,567 --> 00:53:36,900
If you don't cooperate,
there's nothing I can do.

679
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,333
I'll have no choice but
to talk to the subject directly.

680
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,133
What do you mean that you're
going to talk to the subject?

681
00:53:44,133 --> 00:53:46,967
You're going to tell them that
he was a clinical trial subject?

682
00:53:46,967 --> 00:53:50,100
Do you have any idea how dangerous that is?

683
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:55,633
Nobody knows what kind of dangerous stimuli
it could give to the subject's brain circuitry.

684
00:53:55,633 --> 00:54:00,033
We are currently researching
ways to eliminate the side effects.

685
00:54:00,033 --> 00:54:01,667
Just wait a little bit.

686
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:04,300
That won't do.

687
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,267
If that side effect disappears,

688
00:54:06,267 --> 00:54:09,133
I'll be left with nothing, right?

689
00:54:09,133 --> 00:54:12,167
Are you trying to fill

690
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:14,867
one person's life with your own desires?

691
00:54:14,867 --> 00:54:20,767
Isn't it the reason you hid the side
effects to satisfy your greed?

692
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:23,267
Yes, Professor Han.

693
00:55:23,267 --> 00:55:25,500
Te O…

694
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,033
Te O found out about the side effects…

695
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:33,133
The ones related to Goon
recognizing you as his first love.

696
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:34,133
What?

697
00:55:34,133 --> 00:55:37,467
If we don't cooperate with
the reset experiment,

698
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:42,533
he said he would reveal
everything to the subject,

699
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,300
from the clinical trial to the side effects.

700
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,667
What should I do about this?

701
00:55:47,667 --> 00:55:51,900
Are you saying he'll tell Goon
everything about the clinical trial?

702
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,400
Ju Yeon, are you okay?

703
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,267
Your brother is in danger.

704
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,300
Ju Yeon.

705
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,433
I'm sorry.

706
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:11,033
I guess…

707
00:56:11,033 --> 00:56:13,533
I guess, I…

708
00:56:13,533 --> 00:56:15,933
I…

709
00:56:15,933 --> 00:56:19,533
I finally understand what I must do.

710
00:56:36,167 --> 00:56:38,233
Get on.

Te O is not answering my calls.
I wonder where he went.

00:59:34,933 --> 00:59:36,900
Could it be that he went to Lee Goon?

Actually,

745
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:08,533
