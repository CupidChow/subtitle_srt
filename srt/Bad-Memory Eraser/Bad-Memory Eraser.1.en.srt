179
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,667
Okay. I'm sorry.

180
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:30,900
You keep apologizing at the end
of every sentence. Stop doing that.

181
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,933
Okay, I'm sorry…

183
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,133
I hate you, but you must really hate me too.

184
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,867
I don't eat boiled meat.

185
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:44,833
Can you make the menu more even

186
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:48,333
by switching off between chicken soup
and fried chicken? Wouldn't that be great?

187
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,567
Mom cooked this with love. Eat up, okay?

188
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:53,100
I haven't tasted it yet,
but I'm sure it's delicious.

189
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:56,533
Here's a drumstick.

190
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,000
Gosh, it's hot.

191
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Are you alright?

192
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:03,867
All moms must be invincible.

193
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:08,000
I'd gladly sacrifice my hands for
my child. You must've been hungry.

194
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,300
What's certain is that she wasn't
referring to me when she said, "my child."

195
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,533
The pecking order is obvious just
from the order of food being served.

196
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:17,267
First in line.

197
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:20,100
Second in line.

of this family is in last place now.

Here.

201
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,133
Perhaps, I was mistaken.

202
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:37,133
She must've felt bad about
what happened at the airport.

203
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:40,533
Maybe because I worked hard
serving as Shin's manager in the U.K.?

204
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:45,033
Or because I'm the eldest son,
the pillar of this family?

205
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:47,233
Give it to Cola.

206
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:50,233
Fourth in line.

207
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:53,500
I'm last in line behind the dog.

208
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:59,867
The issue is that even the dog knows that.

209
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:02,633
I must teach the dog a lesson
that I come before him.

210
00:19:02,633 --> 00:19:04,633
Hey.

211
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:09,900

Your mom and dad are not the same breed.

to our school presentation tomorrow, right?

- You held up well.

Out of all people, why did it have to happen
in front of Te O? Because of that loser.

Do you even know that I'm handling
all the complaints you get from the patients?

266
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:50,200
That's why I asked you to spare me
from counseling patients in detail.

00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:05,667
Cold yuja tea with lots of whipped cream

351
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:08,433
and caramel syrup, please.

352
00:28:13,467 --> 00:28:15,233
- Hello?
- Hello?

353
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:17,233
This is Mr. Lee Goon's number,
right? About the luggage--

354
00:28:17,233 --> 00:28:20,167
- No, thanks.
- Hello? Please hold on.

355
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:21,667
I'm the owner of that luggage.

356
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,867
Our bags got switched.

357
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:25,433
The airport called me already.

358
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:27,533
Then, why didn't you answer my calls?

359
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:30,233
- I called and texted you so many times.
- Your order is ready.

360
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:32,533
I'll send it over to you this week,

361
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:34,000
so please text me your address.

362
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,967
When? Hello--

363
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,467
Excuse me.

364
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:43,200
You didn't put enough whipped cream.

365
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,233
What's wrong with him? He thinks
he's the only one who is busy?

366
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:49,500
He's driving me nuts.

367
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,600
Come in, Goon.

368
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,400
What? Hi, mister.

369
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,800
Come sit over here.

370
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,067
I said, come in.

371
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:26,267
Go make a copy.

372
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:31,433
As for the advertisement…

373
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:36,100
Data is nothing but numbers.

374
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,967
What matters is systematic analysis.

375
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:40,767
Oh, please do it for me.

376
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:42,833
Come on.

377
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:49,800
Do you want me to?

378
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,967
One moment.

379
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,633
Your stroke speed is good

380
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,167
as well as your muscle mass, but…

381
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:08,333
What's wrong?

382
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:11,167
It's been progressing quite a bit.

383
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:14,800
You injured your knee, didn't you?

384
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,833
Hey!

385
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:18,667
Are you out of your mind?

386
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:21,500
Don't you dare jinx things
by mentioning injuries to an athlete.

387
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,500
Mind your business, okay?

388
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,700
I'm letting you be Shin's manager
because he asked me.

389
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,367
You're mooching off your little brother.

390
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:36,233
Hey, why don't you go make a copy of these?

391
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,833
What's his problem?

392
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:47,667
He doesn't know how to handle his own matters.

393
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:48,767
He's always causing trouble.

394
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:53,133
Gosh, I thought he was a tennis genius,
but actually, he's a total loser.

395
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:56,833
What? Did he get into trouble again?

396
00:30:56,833 --> 00:31:00,267
His little brother is doing so great.
What's wrong with him?

397
00:31:00,267 --> 00:31:02,400
What a loser.

398
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:18,333
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

399
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:24,067
Excuse me. I sent you so many text messages.
Shouldn't you reply me by now at least?

400
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:25,467
Can't you be a little considerate?

401
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,400
Call me as soon as you turn on your phone!

402
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:34,767
Please call me right way. I beg you.
Just a text message will do.

403
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:51,167
Dr. Kyung.

404
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:53,533
It's a type of anxiety disorder.

405
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:56,500
If you do things to change up your
mood, meet up with some friends,

406
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,000
or make yourself believe
that you left your worries behind,

407
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,700
and your anxious feeling

408
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,700
will ease up quite a bit.

409
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,200
I feel like the earth is spinning.

410
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,767
Dr. Kyung, I must go now.

411
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,700
The earth is spinning. It's spinning.

412
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,600
The phone is powered off…

413
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,933
Gosh, seriously. Is this guy a con artist?

414
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:38,367
Is he trying to get money out of me?

415
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:43,767
I hope he isn't a broker who sells documents
to another hospital research lab for money.

416
00:32:47,067 --> 00:32:49,233
Hello?

417
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,533
An emergency patient?

418
00:32:52,267 --> 00:32:55,100
- Can you tell me about the patient?
- He has wrist pain.

419
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,800
Wrist pain?

420
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,167
Why did you call me instead of
neurosurgery or orthopedics?

421
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:03,000
He's a former patient of
Professor Han, but he isn't here.

422
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,367
- Where is the patient?
- This way, please.

423
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:12,167
Doctor, my wrist hurts so much.

424
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:14,600
Please give me some painkillers.

425
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:20,000
Can you describe the pain?

426
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,500
You're a psychiatrist.

427
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,033
Please call a neurosurgeon.

428
00:33:25,033 --> 00:33:26,833
You heard the result of your CT scan, right?

429
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:31,000
Please administer the strongest one
you have here. Nothing else will work.

430
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,767
That shot is for critically ill patients only.

431
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:39,600
I've been ill for 15 years. How much worse
must I be to be considered critically ill?

432
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:42,333
Please hand me a hammer.

433
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:43,533
Pardon me?

434
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:45,933
I must crush his arm to give him that shot.

435
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:48,600
You don't know anything about pain.

436
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,200
I don't care if it's a neurosurgeon or
a pain specialist. Get me anyone. Please!

437
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,433
You know that it's somatization disorder
caused by neurosis, right? It's fake pain.

438
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:05,433
I don't want psychiatric treatment.

439
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:10,133
It won't work anyway and my pain will remain.

440
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:17,000
Okay, fine. I'll administer a tranquilizer.

441
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:28,733
What was that for?

442
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,667
How do you feel? Your right wrist
isn't hurting anymore, is it?

443
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:34,400
You came in regularly for ten years,
but haven't been doing that lately.

444
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
You've only been coming to
the emergency room biweekly.

445
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,933
I tried everything over ten years,

446
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:41,533
including hypnosis and neurofeedback.

447
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:44,167
How much longer must I endure to forget?

448
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:46,200
Ten more years?

449
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,533
Or 20 more years? Or only after I die?

450
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:54,233
If you keep getting catered treatments,
you'll get better eventually.

451
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:00,233
Then, you must be living your life
forgetting all the bad memories.

452
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:05,700
I would sell my soul to you
if only I could forget it.

453
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,600
I'm not done treating you. Where are you going?

454
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,967
What a great doctor you are.

455
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,667
My wrist doesn't hurt at all anymore.

456
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,767
Have you decided to meet her?

457
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:24,933
Your first love?

458
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,200
Aren't you so traumatized that

459
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,400
you're even afraid of meeting your first love?

460
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,000
Because bad memories can
be offset by good memories

461
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,100
once you meet her without being afraid.

462
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,433
What if even good memories
turn into bad memories?

463
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,933
Will you take responsibility?

464
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,733
What should we do?

465
00:35:56,733 --> 00:35:59,133
He said, he's fine now.

466
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:05,900
It doesn't state what his
traumatic memories are about.

467
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,133
Lee Goon.

468
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:14,733
Lee Goon? Wait, Lee Goon?

469
00:36:21,767 --> 00:36:26,667
Is he the owner of the luggage then?

470
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:29,100
Please excuse me for a moment.

471
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:31,967
You fool.

472
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:33,733
Why do you not want to go?

473
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,833
This could be your one and only chance.

474
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:41,333
I'm not going.

475
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,433
You punk. You're like wired earphones

476
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:47,933
keep getting tangled no matter how hard I try.

477
00:36:47,933 --> 00:36:51,000
It's like a Pandora's box.

478
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,100
I'm afraid to open it.

479
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,333
I see.

480
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,367
It's scary to open it.

481
00:36:58,367 --> 00:37:01,467
It's like going into a public restroom…

482
00:37:04,067 --> 00:37:06,267
And the toilet seat lid is down.

483
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:08,300
I wonder what's inside.

484
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,133
You're so afraid to lift it up.

485
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:14,733
And your stomach cramps are getting worse.

486
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:18,933
You have no choice, so
with the tips of your fingers,

487
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:22,300
you lift it up mustering up the courage.

488
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,867
Poop.

489
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:27,033
Chicken gizzard. Eat up.

490
00:37:30,267 --> 00:37:32,700
It's no big deal once you open it.

491
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,233
Hey, just lift it up and see.

492
00:37:34,233 --> 00:37:36,200
In the worst-case scenario, it's just poop.

493
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,033
Well, rejection is the worst thing
that could happen, you know?

494
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:44,400
I hate myself

495
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,867
for being like this too.

496
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,867
I have no confidence.

497
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:54,000
So, can I ask you a favor?

498
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,133
Can you go to the class reunion
tomorrow and ask around for me

499
00:37:58,133 --> 00:38:03,300
to see if anyone knows… the girl

500
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,400
who was with me? Just her name at least.

501
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,233
Crazy punk.

502
00:38:11,233 --> 00:38:13,633
Help me, man.

503
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,867
I'm the doctor from earlier today.

504
00:38:20,867 --> 00:38:24,033
And I'm the owner of that luggage.

505
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:27,733
I didn't call you so late
because of my luggage.

506
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,700
I spoke too hastily without knowing
what memory caused your trauma.

507
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:37,167
But I didn't underestimate
the seriousness of your pain.

508
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,533
I won't be irresponsible and cliché
to say that time will help you forget.

509
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:45,467
I won't. I can't say that, either.

510
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,433
But just drop in whenever you feel upset.

511
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:56,500
You won't be able to forget,
but you can get used to it at least.

512
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:23,800
I'll be able to become
happy like you now, right?

513
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:46,200
I'll bring your luggage to
the hospital tomorrow morning.

514
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:54,767
Let's make history tomorrow.

515
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:06,900
What's wrong with this?

516
00:40:24,933 --> 00:40:28,700
What's on my calendar today? Let's see.

517
00:40:30,533 --> 00:40:33,033
A class reunion invitation?

518
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,500
I'm so envious.

519
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,267
I lived in Australia the whole time,

520
00:40:38,267 --> 00:40:41,867
so I have no classmates in Korea.

521
00:40:41,867 --> 00:40:43,700
It sounds fun.

522
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,533
Should I go tell them that I'm your
little brother to bring up your status?

523
00:40:47,533 --> 00:40:51,533

00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,367
Until the day you die.

696
00:56:12,367 --> 00:56:16,433
Is it… because of me?

697
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,467
What's going on? You can't touch anything.

698
00:56:21,467 --> 00:56:22,900
If you can't bear to watch, go outside.

699
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:26,633
No, it's okay. I'd like to watch.

700
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:30,467
I'll make an incision here now.

701
00:56:30,467 --> 00:56:32,567
Okay.

702
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,900
Calmly and slowly.

703
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:54,267
No!

704
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:01,733
Mom, take me too!

705
00:57:03,867 --> 00:57:05,867
I'm sorry.

706
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:12,233
You could never escape
from memories of the past.

707
00:57:12,233 --> 00:57:14,733
Until the day you die.

708
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:43,167
Are you okay?

709
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,500
Open your eyes.

710
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:49,667
Are you okay?

711
00:59:25,133 --> 00:59:26,800
You, no…

712
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,033
Lee Goon?

713
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,300
You wake up?

714
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:35,033
Do you know where this is?

715
00:59:38,967 --> 00:59:42,233
Mr. Lee, do you remember anything?

716
00:59:42,233 --> 00:59:45,000
Do you remember why you are here?

717
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:55,633
Do you remember who I am?

718
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:58,167
Do you recognize me?

719
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:05,267
Who do you think I am?

720
01:00:15,167 --> 01:00:17,400
Finally…

721
01:00:22,867 --> 01:00:25,400
Finally we met.

722
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,500
Hello?

723
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,833
My first love!

724
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:46,800
♫ Only to me ♫

725
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,667
♫ Can you please come? ♫

726
01:00:54,733 --> 01:00:58,633
♫ Look at me, look at me, look at you ♫

727
01:00:58,633 --> 01:01:02,533
♫ Like today, if I can walk a path ♫

728
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:06,467
♫ Along with you ♫

729
01:01:06,467 --> 01:01:10,367
♫ Like tomorrow, if I can ♫

730
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:13,967
[Bad Memory Eraser]
♫ Always see you ♫

731
01:01:13,967 --> 01:01:15,000
[Bad Memory Eraser]

732
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,567
I'm his first love?

733
01:01:16,567 --> 01:01:17,867
I must have heard it wrong, right?

734
01:01:17,867 --> 01:01:20,367
What if I didn't hear it wrong?
Are there any side effects?

735
01:01:20,367 --> 01:01:22,900
I am that handsome, tall, and sexy Lee Goon.

736
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,567
I think you were looking for me unofficially.

737
01:01:24,567 --> 01:01:26,700
I'm your doctor, not your first love.

738
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,433
You still don't remember me?

739
01:01:28,433 --> 01:01:30,400
Ju Yeon. It's an emergency.
The subject has escaped.

740
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,600
Did I fall down those stairs
and have an accident?

741
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,767
Do you remember? When is your last memory?

742
01:01:34,767 --> 01:01:37,500
The subject must never be aware of

743
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,100
the experiment or of his past.

744
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,467
Are you feeling bad? Mister!

745
01:01:42,467 --> 01:01:44,967
An error occurred during the clinical trial?

746
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:48,100
What have you done to me?
