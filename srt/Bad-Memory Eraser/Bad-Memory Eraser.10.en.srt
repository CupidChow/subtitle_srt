Sometimes it might be better not
to answer than to speak harshly.

177
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:17,067
I've organized the expected questions of
media day and the answer guidelines on a USB.

178
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:20,767
Ah, wait.

179
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:22,867
Looks like I left it in the car. Wait a moment.

180
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,133
Give it to me at the Athletes' Village
later. Don't think of not coming.

181
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:29,000
- Let's go.
- Okay.

182
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:31,867
Really, sir?

183
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:36,667
If it's the village youth association records,
are all the residents who lived there recorded?

184
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,833
That's great.

185
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,233
[Ju Yeon's mother]

186
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:43,233
No, no.

187
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:46,133
I can go there right away tomorrow.

188
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,700
- The customer is currently on a call…
- Why isn't she answering the phone?

189
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,433
So… That…

190
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:57,367
What should I suddenly say?

191
00:12:57,367 --> 00:13:01,667
You, who goes to an English kindergarten,
tell him. She's on the phone.

192
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:05,167
She's busy.

193
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:07,100
Where is she?

194
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,100
Where? Do you mean where she is?

195
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,300
Well… The stadium?

196
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,933
The national tennis team players.

197
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:18,567
Tell him she went to the orientation.

198
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:22,067
Tennis orientation.

199
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,600
Really? Can I have the address?

200
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,700
Address! Address!

201
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,833
The address. She said it's
on the back of the schedule.

202
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,833
Here.

203
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:45,800
All right. Okay, thanks.

204
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:53,367
Ah, goodbye, yes.

205
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,500
It seems Sae Yan's father sent him.
Why doesn't she answer the phone?

206
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,433
Yes, then I'll see you tomorrow.

207
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:03,900
Yes, thank you.

208
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,467
What are you looking at?

209
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:11,567
You're here as the coach's interpreter,
not as the coach. You understand?

210
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:13,567
Stop pretending to be a coach.

211
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:17,467
You acted almost like
an Oscar Best Actress winner.

212
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:19,700
Me?

213
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,200
Do you know me?

214
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,933
Didn't we agree to pretend
not to know each other?

215
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:28,100
It's all for you.

216
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,933
You don't want to see my face either, do you?

217
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:32,100
Of course.

218
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,267
Hey, you don't know anything. That
Athletes' Village is like the military.

219
00:14:36,267 --> 00:14:38,333
You have to stick with me for 24 hours.

220
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:41,933
Do you think it's okay to have to eat, sleep,

221
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:45,600
and live together with people you don't like?

222
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,933
I mean, just seeing your face
makes me want to hit you.

223
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:52,400
The fact that I have to
endure it is so annoying.

224
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,100
Ah, just thinking about it is already dreadful.

225
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,567
Right. If you get stressed,
you'll get wrinkles here.

226
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,800
Right?

227
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:10,300
That's why I'm considering it.

228
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,700
What?

229
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,867
I'm already this annoyed, so I
wonder how annoyed you must be?

230
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:18,700
If you work out so hard
that you're almost dying,

231
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,800
and your ex is always in
front of you 24 hours a day,

232
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,367
not only will you get
wrinkles, but you'll also cry.

233
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:30,433
If I could only block your
path, I would sacrifice myself.

234
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,900
Hey, you!

235
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,733
You better think carefully, okay?

236
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:38,033
Oh, my. She…

237
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:40,000
Now, everyone this way.

238
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,033
Load all the big luggage into
the luggage compartment.

239
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:46,733
Now, hop on quickly
to the fun Athletes' Village.

240
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:49,733
- Who gave you permission?
- Oh my.

241
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:57,033
Oh my.

242
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:59,267
I'm fine. I'm fine.

243
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:00,733
I'm not hurt. I'm fine.

244
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:02,633
My car is over there, so let's go.

245
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:05,267
Ju Yeon, Ju Yeon!

246
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:07,267
Please take my car.

247
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,633
- My car.
- No, there's no need for that.

248
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:11,800
- Is that okay?
- Of course.

249
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,167
Sit next to me, put a tangerine in my mouth,

250
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,700
and talk to me, so I don't fall asleep.

251
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,367
This is some kind of driving date.

252
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:24,200
Since it's for work, please take my car.

253
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,100
Please take my car.

254
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,200
Please take my car.

255
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,733
Take my car.

256
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:31,067
I'll just…

257
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:39,533
I'll take the Player Lee Shin's car.

258
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:42,833
No, that…

259
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,433
Are you alright?

260
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:48,133
Let me see.

261
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,133
You're fine. You're fine.

262
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:52,367
See you later at the Athletes' Village.

263
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:54,600
Oh, Ju Yeon. Ju Yeon.

264
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,800
Don't get in that car.

265
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:01,133
Why are you interfering, interpreter?

266
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:03,367
She has to go with me.

267
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:05,533
I don't want to ride in that car.

268
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:09,933
If you don't want to take
the car, ride the bus… Please.

269
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:14,833
Or take the coach's car… Please!

270
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,200
We will be taking Mr. Lee's car.

271
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,233
That old car. Ah, sorry.

272
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:22,367
Classic car!

273
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:25,733
You sent me in a taxi that night,
saying you had something to do.

274
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:29,667
Yeah, a lot happened that night.

275
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:33,300
Thanks to you, I slept fitfully at night.

276
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,633
Slept fitfully? Why?

277
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,533
What happened?

278
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:41,533
Come on, let's go together.

279
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:44,167
No, wait a minute.

280
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:45,267
Just the two of you?

281
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:47,667
Ju Yeon has to come with us.

282
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:48,700
All three of us should go.

283
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,967
Ah, no. No!

284
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,200
Then…

285
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,733
All three of you. Take my car, all of you.

286
00:17:57,733 --> 00:17:59,067
All together?

287
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:01,267
You must stick close to me.

288
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:02,833
Even when going to the bathroom. Okay?

289
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,900
What's going on with Mr. Lee?
Is there something with him?

290
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,667
There's nothing. That…

291
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:10,267
You answer the phone. Mom has
been looking for you for a while now.

292
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:11,667
Right, I need to call your mom back.

293
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:14,233
I'll make a call and go.
Take this and go first.

294
00:18:14,233 --> 00:18:18,233
No, stay with me.

295
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,867
What happened?

296
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:28,100
Why did you sleep fitfully?

297
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,200
You don't need to know.

298
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,167
Huh?

299
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:53,867
Why did you sleep fitfully?

300
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:57,167
Did something happen between you and Ju Yeon?

301
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:59,167
It's because

302
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:03,567
your dog marks its territory just anywhere.

303
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,900
I thought it was something serious.

304
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,400
Did you leave Cola safely at the dog hotel?

305
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,167
I don't know. Just take care of your own dog.

306
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,867
Don't bother me.

307
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:16,767
But you like it, right?

308
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,967
I told you. We can just
leave him at the pet hotel.

309
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:30,667
Goon said he's postponing all his
schedules and coming tomorrow night.

310
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:33,700
Let's leave in two days, shall we?

311
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,633
But what did Goon do at the dog hotel
that made them tell him not to come back?

312
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:42,167
And every time he goes
to the Athletes' Village,

313
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:45,167
you don't have to follow him like this.

314
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:49,933
You received Shin's diet plan, free-time
PT, and Pilates schedule, right?

315
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:55,033
Oh my. Shin is not that young. If he
follows that schedule, his body will just…

316
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:59,267
I've made sure to check with the team
members that he started his weight control.

317
00:19:59,267 --> 00:20:02,800
And you rushed to renew
his contract with the agency

318
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,300
without even consulting me, right?

319
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,567
I suppose it's better if I take
care of the intense work, right?

320
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:11,533
Let me handle this… How can you keep
digging up herbs like this every time.

321
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:13,967
Do I just turn it like this?

322
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:22,600
Oh, my gosh.

323
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,867
There's no strength in the sound.

324
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:28,300
Here, take a bottle of this and drink it.

325
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:35,233
Why aren't you answering the phone?

326
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:40,700
I guess your parents sent the people,
and some foreigners came and looked for you.

327
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,467
So what did you say to them?

328
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:44,467
Please tell them I ran away, or I was missing.

329
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:46,733
Just tell them I'm dead.

330
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:49,400
If I get caught, I can't
come back to Korea again.

331
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,000
What? I told them you went to orientation.

332
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,033
I gave them the official
document from the association.

333
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:02,433
Oh, my gosh. When?

334
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:10,233
Ju Yeon, please get in.

335
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:14,633
Ju Yeon, please get in.

336
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:17,100
Ju Yeon.

337
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,100
Sae Yan, let's go!

338
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:33,200
Get in. Hurry up and get in.

339
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,567
Then, I'll take the front seat.

340
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:36,600
- Get in now.
- You drive…

341
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,133
Get in!

342
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:39,800
Hey!

343
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,500
Hey!

344
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,833
Hey, this is a new car.

345
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,733
You need to drive well.

346
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:46,633
Sae Yan, what's going on?

347
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:48,267
Ju Yeon, please fasten your seatbelt.

348
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:50,300
Oh, I'll take care of mine.

349
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,433
You don't need to do this for me.

350
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:53,467
That's my seatbelt.

351
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:55,533
Oh no, what should we do?

352
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,067
Skinship!

353
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,300
No, no. Skinship is not allowed!

354
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,167
What? Who are those people?

355
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,167
Wait, Sae Yan. Drive slowly!

356
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:10,700
Sae Yan, Sae Yan!

357
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:20,000
Someone in front!

358
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,233
This is driving me crazy.

359
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:34,367
It seems I've probably missed the golden time.

360
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:37,033
Is everyone okay?

361
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:40,300
Shall we get going then?

362
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:45,267
Slowly, safe driving! Slowly.

363
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,833
You got startled, huh?

364
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,533
If we're late, I'll get fired.

365
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:58,300
You have to be alive to get fired.

366
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:01,233
I'm alive, right?

367
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:03,533
We almost got hurt.

368
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:06,733
Besides, do you know how dangerous
it is to sit in the middle?

369
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:07,867
Ju Yeon, are you hurt?

370
00:23:07,867 --> 00:23:09,900
Look in front!

371
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,533
I have a bit of a headache.

372
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:16,867
You got startled.

373
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:19,267
What driving license did you get, bumper cars?

374
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:22,200
You did that on purpose
to finish me off, right?

375
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,472
No. If I wanted to finish you off, I would
have done it when I was alone with you.

376
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:26,600
Do you two know each other?

377
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,733
- No.
- No.

378
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:33,400
Sorry, sorry. From now on, I'll drive safely.

379
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:37,300
The more I struggle to get out,
the more I feel like I'm sinking in.

380
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,167
All my attention is focused on this person.

381
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:43,433
No more, romance is not allowed.

382
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,133
Ju Yeon, you don't look well?

383
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:49,133
Hold on.

384
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:51,500
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

385
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,433
I have a headache and feel a bit
nauseous. Maybe it's motion sickness.

386
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:58,900
I think I'll feel better after some sleep.

387
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:03,833
- Ju Yeon.
- Ju Yeon.

388
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:07,567
- Here.
- Ah, thank you.

389
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:10,400
Let's avoid meeting as much as possible.

390
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,633
Don't look, and don't listen.

391
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:14,233
I'd rather sleep.

392
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:16,467
Who were those people chasing us earlier?

393
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:20,100
They were people sent by my father.

394
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,000
My family is a bit strict.

395
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,833
If I get caught, I won't be
able to return to Korea again.

396
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:28,833
Why did you decide to run away
from home and stay in Korea?

397
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:31,900
I'm trying to find someone I desperately miss.

398
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,133
- Someone you desperately miss?
- Ah, I'm hungry!

399
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:38,567
I guess my blood sugar dropped
because I was startled earlier.

400
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:44,900
The next rest area sells amazing
sausage and rice cake skewers.

401
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,333
Rice cake skewer?

402
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:50,000
I heard that our interpreter's
favorite Ju Yeon's

403
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,367
favorite snack is sausage and rice cake skewer.

404
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,667
Oh my. She's not even a child.

405
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:56,800
Really? Then we should go
if it's her favorite snack.

406
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,233
Right?

407
00:24:58,233 --> 00:25:01,533
And actually, the fuel light
has been on for a while too.

408
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,100
- Huh?
- Yes.

409
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,833
[Hanseom Hospital]

410
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:16,367
Even plants propagate.

411
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:19,433
It seems like Nurse Song might like me,

412
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:22,167
or maybe she doesn't.

413
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:25,133
It would be nice if I could get a hint.

414
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:31,000
Nurse Song, please send me a signal.

415
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,233
I love you not because I love you,

416
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:54,133
but because I cannot help it.

417
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:58,300
Oh my, why did he leave
quotes in the group chat?

418
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,567
Professor Han is indeed an old man.

419
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:06,267
It's such poetic and heart-fluttering phrases.

420
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:10,800
Her sensibilities match mine so well.

421
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:14,767
Now.

422
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:18,300
Let's go have lunch at a place
with a nice atmosphere today.

423
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,700
Really?

424
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,033
Pasta?

425
00:26:21,033 --> 00:26:22,067
Lobster?

426
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:23,767
No, no.

427
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:28,533
A herbal whole duck soup
restaurant with a yard!

428
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:29,833
Oh my.

429
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:32,067
Lately, my body has felt quite weak.

430
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:35,367
I'll really nourish my body well today.

431
00:26:35,367 --> 00:26:37,667
She has good tastes that match mine.

432
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:40,933
I really like houses with such yards.

433
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,100
I want to live in such a place.

434
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,567
Don't you think so, Professor Han?

435
00:26:44,567 --> 00:26:47,667
Does she mean she wants
to live in such a place with me?

436
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:49,667
Is this a signal?

437
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:52,367
Does she like me?

438
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:56,900
Will I finally be able to propagate?

439
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,667
Well, let's go eat.

440
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:02,467
Call Te O too.

441
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,600
- I have eaten well.
- I have eaten well.

442
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,467
I can afford this much.

443
00:27:12,467 --> 00:27:15,467
Professor, it was truly delicious.

444
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:19,100
- I have eaten well, Professor.
- No, no.

445
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,900
Everyone, go out and get some fresh air.

446
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,633
We'll go out first.

447
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:25,833
- I have eaten well.
- The check, please.

448
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,933
Thank you.

449
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:38,033
By any chance, are there coffee candies?

450
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:39,600
No, my woman…

451
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,233
No, my crush really likes that.

452
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:44,800
Please try looking there.

453
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,300
Ah, it's not here.

454
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:56,233
Coffee flavor!

455
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:59,033
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

456
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:05,567
Come to think of it, you and Professor
Han are wearing couple outfits.

457
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:06,667
Couple outfits?

458
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:10,200
For some reason, you and Professor Han seemed

459
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,933
like a loving married couple.

460
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,300
With the elderly?

461
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,567
Elderly?

462
00:28:18,567 --> 00:28:21,700
Because the color of
the clothes is similar to his.

463
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,433
I think I should just throw this outfit away.

464
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:29,300
I was kind to him because he
reminds me of my late father.

465
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,667
Huh? Your father?

466
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:35,900
Ah, a married couple? That really upsets me.

467
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:41,233
It's my first time seeing Nurse Song angry.

468
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:44,667
It's understandable to be angry.
Aren't they a generation apart?

469
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,433
You went too far.

470
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,467
No, that's not it.

471
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:50,300
Nurse Song.

472
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,333
Let's go.

473
00:28:57,233 --> 00:29:01,967
She thought of me like a father,
not like a romantic relationship…

474
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:18,433
Driving in Korea made me
tense, and now I'm tired.

475
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:21,867
I'll take over the driving
from now on, interpreter.

476
00:29:21,867 --> 00:29:23,967
Everyone, go to the restroom and come back.

477
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:27,833
You too, our hardworking interpreter,
go and come back from the restroom.

478
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:30,133
I'm fine. I have a big bladder.

479
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:31,233
Everyone, don't be late.

480
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:33,533
If you guys are late, everyone
from athletes to staff will be fired.

481
00:29:33,533 --> 00:29:35,667
Then, I'll go buy some snacks.

482
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:36,933
Oh, wait a minute. Just a minute.

483
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:39,967
Let's each buy something delicious.

484
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:41,733
Alright.

485
00:29:41,733 --> 00:29:44,500
Alright, here.

486
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,800
Everyone takes ten thousand won.

487
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,200
Alright, get off. Let's go! To buy
something delicious to eat.

488
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,067
Please go buy some snacks.

489
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,467
- Hey.
- Why?

490
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:05,267
Watch your mouth.

491
00:30:05,267 --> 00:30:07,967
If you do that, it'll all be obvious
that we dated for a little while.

492
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:09,700
It's not obvious that we only dated briefly,

493
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,633
but I can't hide that I hate you.

494
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:14,433
Sorry.

495
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:16,667
So you're not going to the rest stop, right?

496
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:20,867
Ah, that's great. I saved my money then.

497
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:22,700
For whose benefit?

498
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,733
Move aside.

499
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,133
Oh, it's cold.

500
00:30:29,033 --> 00:30:32,567
You! Oh, it's cold.

501
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,467
Since I just made ten thousand
won, should I go rest in the car?

502
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:44,200
Hello.

503
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,767
Please give me four iced Americanos.

504
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:49,700
No, please give me three.

505
00:30:52,933 --> 00:30:55,533
Here is the receipt.

506
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:01,300
Hello?

507
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,733
Yes, Sae Yan's father.

508
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:06,233
Your daughter is with me.

509
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:08,433
Yes.

510
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,833
No, no, no!

511
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:13,000
I'm not dating her again.
Please just take her home.

512
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,500
Yes.

513
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,133
We are at…

514
00:31:18,133 --> 00:31:20,400
Come to your senses, Kyung Ju Yeon.

515
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,067
Why on earth are you doing this, huh?

516
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:27,167
Why did you buy this jelly?

517
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,633
No, I bought it because I wanted to eat it.

518
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:34,233
I really like jelly.

519
00:31:34,233 --> 00:31:35,233
I love it.

520
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:38,267
I like jelly the best in the world.

521
00:31:44,933 --> 00:31:45,933
How much is it?

522
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:48,100
It's 2,000 won.

523
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,033
She's feeling nauseous,
and she has a stomachache.

524
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:55,367
- Motion sickness?
- Yes.

525
00:31:55,367 --> 00:31:57,667
She also has a bit of a headache.

526
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,767
She slept with the clothes over her head.

527
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:02,167
Oh, a cold?

528
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,533
She's been a bit sensitive
with me all day long.

529
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:09,100
And she got a bit irritated with me.

530
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,600
Oh, I guess it's not you, but your girlfriend?

531
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,133
A girlfriend?

532
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:18,167
Well, we're not an official couple yet.

533
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:20,000
But we're in a similar kind of relationship.

534
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,300
Did she have a fever?

535
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,900
Is there any possibility of pregnancy?

536
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,467
Pregnancy?

537
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:29,733
No, I mean, if she gets pregnant
just because I hugged her once,

538
00:32:29,733 --> 00:32:32,933
then all the people in the world…

539
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:39,700
Please give me motion sickness pills,
cold medicine, and painkillers.

540
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:45,633
- It's 10,000 won.
- Okay.

541
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:51,233
- If I exclude this, it's 8,000 won, right?
- Yes.

542
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,233
Here it is.

543
00:32:58,556 --> 00:33:01,831
[Feel free to take an alcohol
swap, if you need one.]

544
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:05,400
Yes, thank you.

545
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,733
- Thank you.
- Take care.

546
00:33:11,967 --> 00:33:15,700
Is it a delicious restaurant?
I happen to have 2,000 won left.

547
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,333
Let's just go. We need to hurry now.

548
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:22,433
No, it will be quick. There's
only one person here.

549
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:23,800
Alright then, you have to come back quickly.

550
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,333
Yes, I'll be there soon.

551
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,133
Oh no, I'm going to miss the bus at this rate.

552
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:35,867
Then go ahead and order first.

553
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:38,933
Oh my. Thank you, young man.

554
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:43,367
Please give me 50 of these.

555
00:33:43,367 --> 00:33:45,500
50?

556
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:54,133
Jeon Sae Yan, you're no longer in my life now.

557
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,233
Ju Yeon? Ah, I need to be quiet.

558
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:03,500
Right, everything will be perfect
once my brother arrives.

559
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:06,133
Okay.

560
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:08,300
Good, good.

561
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:16,400
What? Why did he come with
Jeon Sae Yan without notice?

562
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,933
Ah, right, whatever.

563
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:22,533
He's not staff, so he'll
manage to come on his own.

564
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,633
Oh my, oh my, excuse me! I'm over here!

565
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:29,200
Yes, goodbye.

566
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,133
Ju Yeon.

567
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:32,733
- What's going on?
- You also didn't get in the car?

568
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:35,033
Why did they leave us out and depart?

569
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:36,933
Wait, let me make a call.

570
00:34:36,933 --> 00:34:37,933
Oh, right.

571
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:39,300
Ah, my phone is in that car. You try calling.

572
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,100
Hold on. Just a moment.

573
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,100
Did you leave your cell phone?

574
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,500
Seriously, just stay still.

575
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,400
Public phone booth…

576
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,267
Do you happen to have your wallet?

577
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:53,967
I don't.

578
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:09,067
Sorry, this is all for you.

579
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:14,000
Hello.

580
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,067
This is Kyung Ju Yeon. Did you leave us behind?

581
00:35:17,067 --> 00:35:20,767
Oh dear, I'm sorry. We were in
a hurry and came ahead with Ju Yeon…

582
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:24,000
Ju Yeon?

583
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:31,367
What? Have we already arrived?

584
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:33,667
Hey, why are you here!

585
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:36,100
What did he say? Give it to me.

586
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,633
Hey, Lee Shin. You come back right now.

587
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,267
What? Where is everyone?

588
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,800
What did you say?

589
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,100
What? Where?

590
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,300
A resort…

591
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,067
A resort?

592
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:55,400
Okay, just wait there for now.

593
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,467
Yes.

594
00:35:57,467 --> 00:35:59,467
- The resort, here?
- Yes.

595
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:02,300
[Blue Forest Natural Resort]

596
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,833
Yeah, the truth is I was
going to leave without you!

597
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:07,433
- So what are you going to do?
- Are you trying to get me fired?

598
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:09,867
Lee Shin!

599
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:12,633
I'm a national representative.

600
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:14,067
Do you know how much I'm worth?

601
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:17,133
I work for the country, you know?

602
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:20,800
Why do you keep interfering in my life?

603
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,133
If you keep doing this, I won't stay still.

604
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:27,967
Why do you keep appearing
and interfering in my life?

605
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:31,400
You're the one who suddenly barged
into my life and caused a mess!

606
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,967
This bracelet, I'm going
to cut off the bracelet.

607
00:36:35,967 --> 00:36:38,367
Let that go.

608
00:36:38,367 --> 00:36:39,367
Why don't you let go first?

609
00:36:39,367 --> 00:36:42,267
How can I trust you? You let go first.

610
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:46,067
Then let's let go on the count of three.

611
00:36:46,067 --> 00:36:47,433
One.

612
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:49,333
Two.

613
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,333
Three!

614
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:09,200
Are you doing well there?

615
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,967
Yes.

616
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:13,867
Don't worry. I won't lose you.

617
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:16,800
You said it would be faster
if we take the shortcut.

618
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,633
You said it would take
30 minutes, but it's already…

619
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:23,567
What's wrong? Are you in pain again?

620
00:37:23,567 --> 00:37:24,600
I have some over-the-counter medicine.

621
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,100
Really? That's a relief. I was in
so much pain, so I almost cried.

622
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,900
Knowing you might be in pain,
I went to the pharmacy earlier.

623
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,767
You have a band-aid, right?

624
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:35,633
My heels have been peeling and
bleeding since a while ago.

625
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:37,667
Band-aid…

626
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:42,267
What I have with me now
is just… cold medicine and…

627
00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:47,400
Just cold medicine and motion-sickness pills.

628
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,933
Medicine for menstrual cramp…

629
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:54,300
There is no band-aid. You didn't
buy the most common thing.

630
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,300
Let's just go.

631
00:37:58,933 --> 00:38:00,700
- Well…
- I'm fine.

632
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,800
Take a rest before we go.

633
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,733
Player Lee Shin must be
waiting, so we should hurry.

634
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:08,867
Are you…

635
00:38:08,867 --> 00:38:10,667
Are you that worried about Shin?

636
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,967
Yes, I'm worried about him.

637
00:38:12,967 --> 00:38:15,133
If Player Lee Shin is late,
Sae Yan will be late too.

638
00:38:15,133 --> 00:38:17,533
If Player Lee Shin doesn't join the team,
Si On won't be able to join, either.

639
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:19,567
If that happens…

640
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,633
Don't make me talk.

641
00:38:24,633 --> 00:38:26,200
Why…

642
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,500
Why have you been like this all day?

643
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,033
You are sensitive and avoid me,
and don't even make eye contact…

644
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:34,067
You don't even look at my eyes.
Are you angry with me?

645
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:35,167
No.

646
00:38:35,167 --> 00:38:36,900
Is there something I did wrong?

647
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,867
- No…
- Well, then.

648
00:38:39,867 --> 00:38:44,700
Is it because of what happened that night?

649
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:51,233
As a doctor, I examined you because
I was worried. What's wrong with that?

650
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,700
It's been too hard, so
I've become a bit sensitive.

651
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,667
Let's take a rest a bit before we go.

652
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:04,900
Let's do that.

653
00:39:19,933 --> 00:39:21,733
Aren't you tired?

654
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:24,000
I'm tired.

655
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,600
Let's take a rest here for a bit before we go.

656
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,867
Now.

657
00:40:05,733 --> 00:40:08,400
It's not a ring.

658
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,267
What are you talking about? I thought
you were going to kneel and apologize.

659
00:40:14,267 --> 00:40:16,667
Even if there is no band, let's disinfect it.

660
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,767
I won't do it now. I'll do it later.

661
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:20,800
Let me see.

662
00:40:22,433 --> 00:40:25,200
You're pretty hurt.

663
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,467
It makes me sad.

664
00:40:30,633 --> 00:40:31,900
I'm okay.

665
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,667
I'm not okay.

666
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:41,433
If you disinfect, I'll give you a gift.

667
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:43,967
What gift…

668
00:40:45,133 --> 00:40:46,900
Ta-da!

669
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,433
Even with this?

670
00:40:48,433 --> 00:40:51,467
Sausage and rice cake skewer.

671
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:54,733
Oh my!

672
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:56,600
If you don't like it, then never mind.

673
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,433
Just a moment.

674
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:12,033
Okay, then let's start the disinfection!

675
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,033
Oh, no. It must hurt.

676
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:18,633
You're bearing it well.

677
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,800
Ah, you're bearing it well.

678
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:24,700
Please.

679
00:41:26,867 --> 00:41:29,600
You're acting like a crybaby.

680
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,200
This isn't that painful.

681
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,800
Huh, what? Are you crying now?

682
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,133
I'm not crying.

683
00:41:38,133 --> 00:41:39,400
You're crying.

684
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,433
There are tears in your eyes.

685
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:43,567
I'm not crying.

686
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:46,800
You said you'd never cry in your
life, but you're quite the crybaby.

687
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,033
If that's not tears, then what is it?

688
00:41:49,033 --> 00:41:52,200
Look, look! I didn't cry.

689
00:41:57,967 --> 00:42:00,400
Now I can finally see you properly.

690
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,567
Your eyes.

691
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,033
Okay, the disinfection is done.

692
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,233
Eat.

693
00:42:11,233 --> 00:42:13,300
Yes.

694
00:42:17,633 --> 00:42:21,633
I had no intention of cutting it, but
what's so great about this bracelet?

695
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:25,367
Life in the Athletes' Village
seems to be bleak from now on.

696
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:32,000
Okay, okay.

697
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:35,800
It's done. It's done.

698
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,867
It's a little short, but it's okay.

699
00:42:39,633 --> 00:42:43,400
By the way, where is she?
Why isn't she coming back?

700
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,533
Is she very angry?

701
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,300
Yeah, but it's okay because I made this.

702
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:52,100
Lee Shin, you deceitful jerk.

703
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,433
Go to hell.

704
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:59,467
But I came up here in a fit of anger,

705
00:42:59,467 --> 00:43:02,600
but where on earth did the road lead to?

706
00:43:03,633 --> 00:43:05,133
[Beware of snakes, watch out for wild boars]
What is this?

707
00:43:05,133 --> 00:43:08,267
Are there snakes here?

708
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:13,800
Oh, that startled me.

709
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:33,400
She left her cellphone behind.

710
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,767
She is so bad with directions.

711
00:43:36,767 --> 00:43:39,400
Why can't you do something right?

712
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,100
Jeon Sae Yan, Jeon Sae Yan who's from Napoli!

713
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,667
If I find you, I won't stay still.

714
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:49,033
I don't even have a cellphone.

715
00:43:49,033 --> 00:43:53,167
What? Isn't this the place I came earlier?

716
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:56,700
Ju Yeon.

717
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,200
Hey!

718
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,333
You have to find me. Why
are you looking for Ju Yeon?

719
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:06,800
Why are you coming now! I
almost got bitten by an anaconda!

720
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,800
If you're glad to meet me again,
just say it's nice to meet me.

721
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,200
And are we in "Amazon"? Why
would there be an anaconda?

722
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,267
You are the kind of person who would soak
an anaconda alive in alcohol and drink it.

723
00:44:15,267 --> 00:44:17,467
If you had come any later, I'd
have buried you alive here.

724
00:44:17,467 --> 00:44:20,700
Now you're finally showing your true colors.

725
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,800
If you keep doing that, you climb down alone.

726
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,933
To make the snakes come out,
I guess I should call them.

727
00:44:24,933 --> 00:44:28,067
Hey, shut up! Shut up!

728
00:44:28,067 --> 00:44:29,800
You are as cunning as fox.

729
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,467
Then, why are you trying to work where I am?

730
00:44:32,467 --> 00:44:34,633
What's the reason you insist on working?

731
00:44:34,633 --> 00:44:38,200
If you stick with me, we'll just fight.

732
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,833
If I stay there, it'll be easier to ask around,
and I'll have a reason to stay in Korea.

733
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:43,967
Right, did you find that out?

734
00:44:43,967 --> 00:44:46,833
You said there might be someone
you know in the countryside.

735
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,933
But that wasn't the place.

736
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,867
Right?

737
00:44:54,867 --> 00:44:57,867
You can't possibly be of any help to my life.

738
00:44:58,967 --> 00:45:01,533
I guess I need to mobilize
all my connections now.

739
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:05,300
I'll ask Ju Yeon, or I heard your brother is
the CEO. So I'm sure he knows a lot of people.

740
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,067
Why? You saw a snake? Where is it?

741
00:45:08,067 --> 00:45:10,133
That one?

742
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,333
I want to go to the bathroom.

743
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:16,033
I think there's a bathroom
if we go a little further.

744
00:45:16,033 --> 00:45:19,500
No, no. My stomach hurts.

745
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,100
You go there and keep a lookout.

746
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,867
Keep a lookout.

747
00:45:24,867 --> 00:45:28,067
Wow, seriously.

748
00:45:28,067 --> 00:45:31,567
- You're impossible to deal with.
- Go further. Go further.

749
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:34,233
Oh, that's enough. There.

750
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:39,700
Oh my, my stomach hurts so much.

751
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,767
Really?

752
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,600
I'm giving this to you. Eat it.

753
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,133
What's this?

754
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:51,933
You want me to eat this
while smelling your poop?

755
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:54,867
Just eat it.

756
00:45:54,867 --> 00:45:56,100
Oh, right.

757
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,767
Just in case.

758
00:45:58,767 --> 00:46:00,167
You take all of this.

759
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:02,733
What's this?

760
00:46:02,733 --> 00:46:04,633
And you also left your phone behind.

761
00:46:04,633 --> 00:46:06,733
Right.

762
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:14,267
And since the caretakers come by
here frequently, don't worry too much.

763
00:46:16,633 --> 00:46:19,467
There is a large temperature
difference in the mountains.

764
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,033
What are you doing?

765
00:46:22,033 --> 00:46:26,567
How long will it take to
poop? Are you constipated?

766
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:29,333
I held my poop in for a long time.

767
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,833
Do you see that red ribbon
tied to that tree over there?

768
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,767
Having red ribbons like that on the trees
makes it look totally like Christmas.

769
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:39,833
Did you tie it?

770
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:42,433
No, I didn't do it.

771
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:45,767
Mountaineers tied them
there, so we wouldn't get lost.

772
00:46:45,767 --> 00:46:47,700
There's one over there too.

773
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,200
If by any chance you are
left alone in the mountains.

774
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,100
- You know?
- Yes.

775
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:56,967
Keep watch here quickly. I will
answer the call of nature, okay?

776
00:46:56,967 --> 00:46:58,433
Turn around, turn around.

777
00:46:58,433 --> 00:46:59,633
Are you seriously…

778
00:46:59,633 --> 00:47:03,633
Are you really about to… Are you
seriously going to poop right here?

779
00:47:03,633 --> 00:47:04,633
Yeah.

780
00:47:04,633 --> 00:47:06,900
What are you doing? Let's
just go to the restroom.

781
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:11,367
Hey, I'm really going to poop. I
unbuttoned it, unzipped it, so don't look.

782
00:47:11,367 --> 00:47:13,567
Don't do it. I hate it. I really hate it.

783
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:21,767
Is this how parents feel when
they leave their children behind?

784
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,867
No, no, no.

785
00:47:24,867 --> 00:47:28,200
Yeah, you'll feel better if
I'm not looking for you.

786
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,467
This is for the good of everyone.

787
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,333
This is the recreation
forest near the rest area.

788
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:44,000
I'll send you the location,
so you can come this way.

789
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,867
Okay.

790
00:47:50,533 --> 00:47:54,000
Are Goon and Ju Yeon coming?

791
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,533
[I've sent someone, so please wait a bit!]

792
00:48:09,733 --> 00:48:12,900
Hey, you stepped in poop, right?

793
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,767
Hey, I think something bit me.

794
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,233
I feel like a snake has bitten me.

795
00:48:17,233 --> 00:48:20,433
Hey, what should we do? There was a sign
back there saying that snakes come out.

796
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:21,800
Hey, hey.

797
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,433
Then, call 911 quickly, hurry!

798
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Yes, this is near the walking trail
by the recreational forest.

799
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,033
We climbed up about 20 minutes.

800
00:48:34,033 --> 00:48:37,900
I think he was bitten by
a snake. What should I do?

801
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,700
30 minutes?

802
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,533
Hey, since I can't see it, you take a look.

803
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:44,300
No, are you crazy?

804
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:48,733
No, not the hips, higher up. Higher! Hurry!

805
00:48:48,733 --> 00:48:52,067
Hey, I actually haven't even pooped.

806
00:48:52,067 --> 00:48:54,367
Then, I'm sorry, but please
come as quickly as possible.

807
00:48:54,367 --> 00:48:57,133
Yes, yes. I'm sorry.

808
00:48:57,133 --> 00:48:59,800
They might not be able to find this place.

809
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,500
I'll go and bring them here, okay?

810
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,300
I think I'm dying now.

811
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:09,700
I've never lived my life the way I wanted.

812
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,867
And I haven't properly fallen in love yet.

813
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,733
Dying while pooping in the mountains?

814
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:18,267
Don't publish an obituary.

815
00:49:18,267 --> 00:49:20,733
At least I want to be remembered
by people as an honorable person.

816
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,833
It might not be a venomous snake.

817
00:49:27,233 --> 00:49:29,133
Now.

818
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:32,967
You said there's a big temperature
difference in the mountains.

819
00:49:32,967 --> 00:49:34,433
And.

820
00:49:34,433 --> 00:49:36,700
Thank you. I only have you.

821
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:40,600
You'll feel a bit better now.

822
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,167
It's good.

823
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,167
This is tasty.

824
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:53,800
I can't believe that my last
supper in life is chocolate.

825
00:49:58,467 --> 00:50:00,100
It's so cold.

826
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,133
It seems the poison is
spreading through my body.

827
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:06,200
I'll go and get someone to
suck out your snake's venom.

828
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,200
No, no.

829
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,567
Don't leave me alone.

830
00:50:09,567 --> 00:50:11,733
I don't want to die alone. No, no.

831
00:50:11,733 --> 00:50:13,633
There will surely be a male caretaker nearby.

832
00:50:13,633 --> 00:50:16,767
If not, I'll go find a natural man.

833
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,633
Hey, it looks like I'm being
punished for my bad deeds.

834
00:50:22,633 --> 00:50:23,733
What?

835
00:50:23,733 --> 00:50:27,900
Actually, I contacted your
dad to come pick you up.

836
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,533
What? You!

837
00:50:32,033 --> 00:50:34,433
Forgive me.

838
00:50:38,733 --> 00:50:41,600
It's gotten much shorter,
but you have thin wrists.

839
00:50:44,867 --> 00:50:46,467
And,

840
00:50:46,467 --> 00:50:49,200
I know the person you're looking for.

841
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,867
Really? How do you know my real dad?

842
00:50:52,867 --> 00:50:54,700
Real dad?

843
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,567
You said you know the person I'm looking for?

844
00:50:56,567 --> 00:50:57,900
I'm looking for my dad.

845
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,400
Not your first love?

846
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,033
Who is my first love?

847
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:07,233
Jeon Sae Yan.

848
00:51:07,233 --> 00:51:09,433
The poison is spreading.

849
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:16,667
Lee Shin, you can't die.
Pull yourself together.

850
00:51:16,667 --> 00:51:20,133
Hey, Lee Shin, are you okay?

851
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,700
Ah, seriously.

852
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,800
Hey, Lee Shin.

853
00:51:50,367 --> 00:51:52,400
It's not a snake bite. It's a bee sting.

854
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,800
If you don't have any specific
allergies, there shouldn't be a problem.

855
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,400
But the guardian is quite remarkable.

856
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,733
You thought he was bitten by a snake,
and you sucked out the poison for him.

857
00:52:03,533 --> 00:52:07,500
Then, we'll get going.

858
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,267
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

859
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:27,733
Sae Yan, what happened?

860
00:52:27,733 --> 00:52:31,500
Nothing happened.

861
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,300
What on earth are you two up to?

862
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,167
Why did you just leave us at the rest area?

863
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:43,367
And what happened here
so that an ambulance came?

864
00:52:45,867 --> 00:52:52,500
[Lower Entrance]

865
00:52:55,733 --> 00:52:59,200
What's up? What happened?

866
00:53:00,067 --> 00:53:02,200
What's wrong?

867
00:53:03,533 --> 00:53:06,233
We're out of gas.

868
00:53:06,233 --> 00:53:07,700
What?

869
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,833
I mean…

870
00:53:11,133 --> 00:53:15,233
I told you earlier that I
needed to fill up with gas.

871
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,100
I mean…

872
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,333
What should we do? We need to be there by 5.

873
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,700
Hey, hey.

874
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,533
I knew this would happen.

875
00:53:33,533 --> 00:53:35,433
Are they the only ones who haven't come yet?

876
00:53:35,433 --> 00:53:38,500
Oh, seriously.

877
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,933
We only have 30 minutes left.

878
00:53:40,933 --> 00:53:43,633
Ah, these guys.

879
00:53:43,633 --> 00:53:44,667
The line is busy…

880
00:53:44,667 --> 00:53:48,300
Oh my, they're on a call again.

881
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,400
The line is currently…

882
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,800
Ah, these guys are driving me crazy.

883
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,500
Aren't we going to be late?

884
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:04,000
How could you forget to refuel?

885
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:07,367
It's Guk Bong again.

886
00:54:07,367 --> 00:54:11,500
What will happen to us by
the time the tow car arrives?

887
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,100
We'll be kicked out one by one.

888
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:17,900
If Lee Shin can't get there, little
cutie will also be out of the team.

889
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:21,600
Then there's no need for a team doctor.

890
00:54:33,433 --> 00:54:36,233
Hey, little cutie.

891
00:54:36,233 --> 00:54:38,267
Cha Si On?

892
00:54:49,433 --> 00:54:51,767
Coach, aren't they here yet?

893
00:54:51,767 --> 00:54:54,933
If they are late, you also have to
step down from the main coach position.

894
00:54:54,933 --> 00:54:56,933
OK, I can do it.

895
00:54:56,933 --> 00:54:59,333
Come on. Move, move!

896
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,133
They are here.

897
00:55:17,133 --> 00:55:20,467
She came here. He came here.

898
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,100
No problem. It's okay?

899
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,567
It feels like a month has passed
even though nothing has started yet.

900
00:55:27,567 --> 00:55:29,933
Come quickly, hurry.

901
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:39,667
That's a relief.

902
00:56:02,467 --> 00:56:06,900
You still have a lingering
attachment to the sports, right?

903
00:56:13,367 --> 00:56:16,033
You can be honest.

904
00:56:19,867 --> 00:56:21,967
Let's go.

905
00:57:00,433 --> 00:57:03,200
Is this where you want to stop by?

906
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,333
Do you remember?

907
00:57:06,533 --> 00:57:09,100
The place where we first met.

908
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,600
15 years ago.

909
00:57:12,133 --> 00:57:14,300
The place where you saved me.

910
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:19,533
A place where memories
with you are preserved intact.

911
00:57:24,667 --> 00:57:27,367
You asked if I was okay, right?

912
00:57:27,933 --> 00:57:33,767
You also asked if I had
no more regrets about you.

913
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,900
I'm trying to show my feelings now.

914
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:44,200
I'm trying not to lie to myself or you anymore.

915
00:57:44,767 --> 00:57:47,767
I will reveal and show everything

916
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:51,833
more proudly and confidently.

917
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,833
I…

918
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,867
I can't do that.

919
00:58:00,867 --> 00:58:03,733
I don't have the right to do that.

920
00:58:06,333 --> 00:58:08,733
I'm sorry.

921
00:58:08,733 --> 00:58:10,933
That's a lie.

922
00:58:15,433 --> 00:58:18,133
Look into my eyes and say it.

923
00:58:18,133 --> 00:58:19,900
If that's the truth,

924
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,033
look into my eyes and say it clearly.

925
00:58:34,967 --> 00:58:38,067
You are such a fool.

926
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,533
Even if you deceived me,

927
00:58:42,367 --> 00:58:45,100
don't lie to yourself.

928
00:58:46,733 --> 00:58:49,267
Let's stop pretending

929
00:58:50,767 --> 00:58:53,133
we're okay.

930
00:58:55,533 --> 00:59:03,067
♫ You light a small light in a corner ♫

931
00:59:03,067 --> 00:59:09,767
♫ Of my heart that I had ignored ♫

932
00:59:09,767 --> 00:59:17,467
♫ Where will it be, that day ♫

933
00:59:17,467 --> 00:59:25,200
♫ How much further do I
have to go before I can see ♫

934
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:31,700
♫ Even if that unreachable dream ♫

935
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:39,700
♫ Turns away from me and becomes more blurred ♫

936
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:48,200
♫ I will walk towards that day ♫

937
00:59:57,067 --> 01:00:02,200
[Bad Memory Eraser]

938
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,433
Even if everything changes, there
are some things that don't change.

939
01:00:04,433 --> 01:00:05,967
If it's okay with you, we…

940
01:00:05,967 --> 01:00:08,033
Don't even think about sneaking skinship.

941
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:11,133
What are the side effects? I need to
figure that out, so I can steal the research.

942
01:00:11,133 --> 01:00:12,500
Now I'm in big trouble.

943
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,533
There's nothing we can do.
We're already on the same boat.

944
01:00:14,533 --> 01:00:16,433
I sent something important yesterday.

945
01:00:16,433 --> 01:00:18,867
Jealousy is also a natural emotion.

946
01:00:18,867 --> 01:00:21,433
I feel like I'm going to die of embarrassment.

947
01:00:21,433 --> 01:00:23,667
I've come this far by deceiving people.

948
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:26,700
I feel like I'm about to be exposed as just
someone who's only flashy on the outside.

949
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,333
Mr. Lee, are you okay?

950
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,967
Let's admit it together and be honest.

951
01:00:30,967 --> 01:00:35,067
If you want to love, don't
hold back for a moment.
