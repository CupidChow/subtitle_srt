Well. Why are you here…

This is a very strange situation, you know?

00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:02,400
Obviously, this is my house

On top of that, you're even taking my suitcase?

It's not what you think. I swear.

Please hear me out first.

The thing is that for a matter
of procedure, I need your ID card.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,667
But all your family members were busy,

13

so they gave me the door passcode.

Yes.

17
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:31,267
Is it because my ID card is so heavy

18

Even though I'm very busy,

26
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,533

00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:17,300
Maintaining some distance
can help block out emotions.

181
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,133
Granted, you won't be able to develop
positive feelings toward someone,

182
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:22,367
but you won't be able to
develop negative feelings, either.

183
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,000
But those who love you will get heartbroken

184
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,167
since you won't give them the time of day.

185
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:30,667
There are people who you
shouldn't give the time…

186
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,933
of day.

187
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:35,767
You just thought of someone. You have
someone on your mind, don't you?

188
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:40,267
That's nonsense. I was
thinking about my boyfriend.

189
00:12:40,267 --> 00:12:43,833
Boyfriend? Do you have a boyfriend?

190
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:47,067
How come everyone reacts like that?

191
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,433
Do I look like I can't get
a boyfriend or something?

192
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:52,633
Exactly. It's never occurred to me.

193
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,867
Anyway, I need to show my emotions

194
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:58,167
only when it's necessary.

195
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:01,200
Unnecessary emotional exchanges
only lead to needless misunderstandings.

196
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,567
Only when it's necessary?

197
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:05,800
Then, do you show your emotions
to your boyfriend at least?

198
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,800
He went home already.

199
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,333
Professor Han went home already?

200
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:20,000
Gosh. This is so disappointing.

201
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,767
Then, I have no choice,

202
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:25,067
but to consult with Dr. Kyung.

203
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:26,300
She's here, right?

204
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,600
She left for the day already.

205
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,633
She left for the day?

206
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:30,733
Yes, she left for the day.

207
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:33,433
I see. Understood.

208
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:35,500
Have a good rest.

209
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,367
I guess I'll have to sleep here tonight.

210
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:53,133
Why are you staring at me like that?

211
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,067
You used to say,

212
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,000
"Goon, face me when you sleep."

213
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,800
"Goon, face me when you sleep."
You used to say that

214
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,000
and cling to me all the time.

215
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,833
That's why I'm facing you as I sleep, okay?

216
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:10,333
That was so long ago. You remember that?

217
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:15,167
So, you do have good memories of me.

218
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,933
Good memories? Good memories, my foot.

219
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:21,233
Just go to sleep looking at my handsome face.

220
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:23,367
No, thanks.

221
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,767
I thought you had no memories of me left.

222
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:43,700
How were we like as brothers
even though I can't remember?

223
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,933
Just as you described.

224
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:53,533
I clung to you

225
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:56,567
and you always played pranks on me.

226
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:01,633
I see.

227
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:08,633
Hey, Shin. Sit up.

228
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:11,600
Why are you bothering me again?

229
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,133
Well, the thing is…

230
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,167
What?

231
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:21,400
Since you're up, turn off the lights.

232
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,567
I'm tired.

233
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,400
Even if you want to look at
my face, turn off the lights.

234
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,500
Okay?

235
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,600
It's only morning. Are
you drinking beer already?

236
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,067
You haven't even eaten, right?

237
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:16,467
Well…

238
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:19,467
It's like an aperitif, you know?

239
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,200
It's a gift I got for you from Italy.

240
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,200
It's a set of unique, couple shirts
I ordered to wear with you originally,

241
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,600
but you and your boyfriend
can wear them together.

242
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
No, thanks.

243
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,767
- I don't wear couple shirts.
- "I don't wear couple shirts."

244
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:38,467
Yes, I knew you'd say that.

245
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:42,033
You're so predictable to a tee.

246
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,667
But I wonder if he feels the same.

247
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:47,600
I can handle my own business.

248
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,267
Sure, fine.

249
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,333
I was going to tell you my
secrets for captivating men,

250
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,133
but if you really don't want to hear,

251
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,667
then, I'll just…

252
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:02,300
No, I didn't mean that
I don't want to hear about them.

253
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:48,567
Hello, ma'am.

254
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:03,600
He did high-intensity
training all day yesterday.

255
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:14,867
Is this because you made him wear new shoes?

256
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:18,233
The thing is that it was such an important…

257
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:20,267
Okay, got it.

258
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:25,267
It was such an important
sponsor, so we had no choice.

259
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:33,100
It must've been so painful for him.

260
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,167
Look at this blood.

261
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,267
Honey.

262
00:18:36,267 --> 00:18:38,967
It was such an important
sponsor, so he had no choice.

263
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:42,633
- Yes, that's right.
- Shall I make your feet bleed too?

264
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:47,833
This sponsor…

265
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:53,200
This sponsor offered to cover
all the coaching fees, so I had no choice.

266
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,000
It was for Shin's long-term
benefit. Yes, that's right.

267
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:27,467
You know who I am, don't you?

268
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,433
Without time to break them in,

269
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:33,000
I heard that you told him to
wear these on the day of the match.

270
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,200
I guess you want a free ride off
Shin's blood, sweat, and tears.

271
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:46,700
The penalty? I'll pay it.

272
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,533
Coaching fees?

273
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:52,633
I can cover them even if
I have to sell my own body.

274
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:57,967
Don't you ever think about
leeching off my child.

275
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,500
Why don't you get the rehab
treatment first so that you can run well?

276
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,700
They canceled my commercial shoot
because my rehab article came out.

277
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,233
I should've put out the press releases later.

278
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:11,400
I shouldn't have announced it first.

279
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,667
Mister, you're kind of
like one, two, eight, and nine.

280
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:14,700
One, two, eight, and nine?

281
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,200
You're too extreme.

282
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,533
I've been barely hanging on by compensating
for my skills with my good reputation.

283
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:21,967
What if I get forgotten like this?

284
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:25,033
I'm too extreme, I see.

285
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:26,633
Hey.

286
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:32,067
Even an airplane needs go
incredibly fast from the ground…

287
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:33,500
to fly high.

288
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,533
Just take care of your body.

289
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:38,600
Such concerns are for me to handle.
That's what our agency is for.

290
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,133
You're super cool,

291
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:43,567
but can I really trust you?

292
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:45,767
Don't think of me as
one, three, five, and seven.

293
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:48,000
One, three, five, and seven?

294
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:51,900
Don't underestimate me.

295
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,100
I'll let my mom know.

296
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,800
My mom said, if you don't put a down
payment within ten days, the deal is off.

297
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,733
- What?
- You give them the rest.

298
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:06,133
Hey.

299
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:08,167
Hey.

300
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,233
Hey.

301
00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:15,867
There's no more snacks.

302
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:18,333
No more snacks. None.

303
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,933
This isn't food.

304
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:23,200
Hey, I said, no more snacks. None.

305
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:25,033
No way.

306
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,667
He'll cooperate with the testing
only if we let him go out.

307
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:28,967
We can't force him, you know?

308
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:32,533
But what if he goes out and runs
into someone he knew in the past?

309
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:34,133
That's possible,

310
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:37,867
but still, the subject's opinion matters.

311
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:39,900
Then, let's have him
go with a guardian at least.

312
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,533
He can't go alone.

313
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,567
- Wow, unbelievable!
- He's so handsome.

314
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:52,133
No, you can't give me something
you've already had a sip.

315
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:53,300
I'm thankful too.

316
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,667
I'm a fan.

317
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,400
♫ So high ♫

318
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,767
♫ Look at me, look at me, look at me ♫

319
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:10,267
♫ So high ♫

320
00:22:10,267 --> 00:22:14,300
♫ Look at me, look at me, look at you ♫

321
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:22,200
♫ Only to me, can you please come ♫

322
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:29,267
You can't go out without a guardian.

323
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:31,433
So, are you my guardian for today?

324
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,800
A medical guardian.

325
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:40,833
I don't like your habitual melodramatic gaze.

326
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,667
I have hands too. The old-fashioned way
of hitting on me is also not allowed.

327
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:48,133
That's not what I was doing.

328
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,800
Can't I even look at the GPS?

329
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,000
The racehorses have started off with vigor.

330
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,900
The racehorses on the inside
continue to maintain their speed.

331
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,867
The racetrack?

332
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:05,367
See?

333
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:09,133
You didn't come here to go
on a date with me, did you?

334
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:10,867
Please, let's keep our work and personal life--

335
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:12,767
Let's keep them separate.

336
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,333
Although I like you,

337
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,567
I won't tolerate you interrupting my work.

338
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,833
Did you come here to find your
old memory by any chance?

339
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,467
Do you think you've done
horse racing in the past?

340
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:29,667
Do you remember something at least? Is that it?

341
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:31,633
Are you curious about me?

342
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:33,033
Yes, as a doctor.

343
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:36,733
I'm curious about you, even more than myself.

344
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:41,800
Well, let's ask and answer
one question each. Go first.

345
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,433
How did you and Dr. Te O start to date?

346
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:47,033
He confessed his feelings the day before
I left for the U.K. Why did you come here?

347
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:48,567
To secure investments.

348
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:49,800
What do you like about him?

349
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,067
He's smart. What investment?

350
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:52,500
Business investment.

351
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,033
Would you consider breaking up with him?

352
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:55,033
Never.

353
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,633
Does this relate to your past memories?

354
00:23:56,633 --> 00:23:58,667
No.

355
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:02,067
Is he…

356
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:05,400
your first love?

357
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,333
Yes, he is.

358
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:20,500
I'll find out where the VIP room is.

359
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,900
Stay put and wait here.

360
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,067
I don't have much time. You'll be quick, right?

361
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:28,867
Right?

362
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,833
Gosh, seriously.

363
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:37,833
Now that I think about it, I've never been to
a place like this since I'm always working.

364
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
Te O.

365
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,000
Can we meet up tonight?

366
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,633
Who is it?

367
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:54,200
No one important. Let's go.

368
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:56,633
Oh, my.

369
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:58,233
What's all this?

370
00:24:58,233 --> 00:25:00,367
It stinks.

371
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:05,300
Who the hell did this?

372
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,700
"Agency Goon"?

373
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm Lee Goon of Sports Agency Goon.

374
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,233
Here's the business proposal.

375
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:53,400
We're not just a simple agency.

376
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,133
We aggregate every single
action of athletes into big data,

377
00:25:56,133 --> 00:25:59,467
manage the players, and match them
with teams. We're highly specialized.

378
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:03,967
I've come to offer you
an investment opportunity.

379
00:26:05,467 --> 00:26:08,533
Get him out of here. Please leave now.

380
00:26:10,933 --> 00:26:15,167
Please give me a minute. Sir,
I wouldn't bet on horse number five.

381
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:21,733
Statistics and winning odds
of each horse's performance

382
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:23,700
and performance trends
are based on weather and climate.

383
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,800
I'm sure you've made
your predictions based on AI.

384
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,067
However, animals gauge
the weather with their keen senses.

385
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:34,500
Typical data can't capture
the entirety of the day's weather.

386
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,967
If it was raining and cloudy first

387
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:39,000
and then cleared up,

388
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,033
you could only input "rain" or
time-specific records into the data pool.

389
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,933
Based on the analysis of more
than 6,000 pieces of data per second,

390
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:49,900
the speed of horse number five will
decrease significantly on a day like today.

391
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,367
Pardon me.

392
00:26:53,367 --> 00:26:56,533
I don't know much about horse racing,
but please allow me to add to what he said.

393
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:59,200
Horse number five seemed
psychologically unstable.

394
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,533
Its eyes were dull,

395
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:05,000
and it screamed like a frightened child.

396
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,300
And you are?

397
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:10,733
I'm a psychiatrist.

398
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:14,200
She'll manage the mental health
of our agency's athletes

399
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:17,300
as the team doctor.

400
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,533
In one minute, the betting for
the first race in Seoul will close.

401
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:22,033
So,

402
00:27:22,033 --> 00:27:25,067
which horse would you bet on?

403
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:27,267
If it were me…

404
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:34,933
[Time Remaining Until Betting Closes]

405
00:27:39,467 --> 00:27:43,433
[Time Remaining Until Betting Closes]

406
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,867
The betting for the first
race in Seoul has closed.

407
00:27:51,867 --> 00:27:53,433
I'd bet on horse number three.

408
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:54,767
But…

409
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:56,400
Be careful.

410
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,300
How can you treat my words…

411
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:04,833
Okay, let's leave.

412
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:08,533
You should've picked any number quickly.
Why did you have to provoke him?

413
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:10,767
At this moment, horse number three
successfully takes the lead from the outside!

414
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:13,100
He'll call me in again.

415
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,900
Over here.

416
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,333
Excuse me.

417
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:22,900
The boss wants you to come back in.

418
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:28,433
Defying expectations, horse number
three confidently secures first place!

419
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,767
The team doctor has a prior appointment today.

420
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:36,667
Please relay a message to him
to contact us with a new meeting date.

421
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:38,700
Please excuse me.

422
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,500
Are you playing hard to get?

423
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,767
Are they still there?

424
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:46,767
One second.

425
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,967
They're on a call right now…
Oh, they're going back.

426
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
How did you know?

427
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,533
Did you really use big data
or something to guess it right?

428
00:28:58,533 --> 00:28:59,900
It was luck.

429
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,633
You can't predict a horse's
condition 100 percent.

430
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:06,633
You can only increase the probability a little.

431
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,333
Why do you want to get investments?

432
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:16,100
There are many legal avenues for betting
money such as horse races or sports games.

433
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,233
You could make money from there
and invest in your business.

434
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,467
I am a former athlete

435
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:24,167
and I love sports.

436
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:25,833
It's not unethical to earn money that way,

437
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:28,667
but I don't want to exploit sports.

438
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:32,533
Because that's my business principle.

439
00:29:33,233 --> 00:29:35,267
Let's go.

440
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:41,167
Then, did he intentionally delay
giving his answer earlier too?

441
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,167
I know, you have hands too.

442
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:04,233
But you don't have feelings for your
patients, so it shouldn't matter, right?

443
00:30:04,233 --> 00:30:08,233
Because that's your business principle.

444
00:30:25,067 --> 00:30:26,767
I'm hungry.

445
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:32,000
If you're hungry, why don't we
grab dinner before heading in?

446
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,467
Te O.

447
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:35,667
Where are you?

448
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,000
I've just got back to
the hospital with the patient.

449
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,633
Are you done with your work, Te O?

450
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:40,800
I'll be done soon.

451
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,000
Let's meet in the small meeting room at eight.

452
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,567
Wait until I get there, okay?

453
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:45,933
In the small meeting room?

454
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:48,467
No, it's fine. I'll wait for you there.

455
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:51,100
Come as soon as you finish, okay?

456
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,633
Don't go anywhere today.

457
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,000
What's with him?

458
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,633
No, you can't.

459
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:05,033
Make sure you don't let Kyung Ju Yeon or
anyone outside the operating room find out.

460
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:06,400
Today's testing is highly confidential.

461
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,067
Shouldn't we inform the patient
about the nature of the test?

462
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:11,533
Considering it even
involves general anesthesia.

463
00:31:11,533 --> 00:31:16,300
It's a matter that has already been
consented by the subject's family members.

464
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,767
I'll take responsibility, so don't worry.

465
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:21,933
But still, what if our supervisors find out…

466
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:28,333
So, do you plan to name it a joint study by
the psychiatry and neurosurgery departments?

467
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:32,933
It's a joint study since the research was
conducted by the Brain Science Research Center.

468
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,333
You're not ambitious enough.

469
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:41,500
Our neurosurgery department
should get more credit for it.

470
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,000
Initially, it started out
for psychiatric research

471
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,700
and Dr. Kyung Ju Yeon is
the first author of the paper too.

472
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,167
Facts are not important.

473
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:54,200
What's important is turning them into facts.

474
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,567
"Facts aren't important. What's
important is turning them into facts."

475
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:01,867
It's an order from someone higher up.

476
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:09,067
Excuse me, Mr. Lee Goon.

477
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,067
When is Dr. Kyung supposed to arrive?

478
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:20,433
We've informed Dr. Kyung,

479
00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:24,000
but she can't come due to
an important commitment.

480
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,633
Everyone is waiting.

481
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,067
Okay, then.

482
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:43,533
Let's just start.

483
00:32:45,067 --> 00:32:47,433
It won't take long.

484
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:52,800
I'll count to five.

485
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:05,067
Why is that punk here?

486
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:09,333
Then, what about his meeting with Ju Yeon?

487
00:33:10,267 --> 00:33:12,467
Let's get started.

488
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:31,400
Light the candle. Swoosh.

489
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,567
Lay out flower petals. Ta-da.

490
00:33:32,567 --> 00:33:35,800
With an impactful gaze and a smile,

491
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,133
say, surprise!

492
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:47,233
What do people get so
excited about things like this?

493
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:55,700
How pretty.

494
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,433
Have you been waiting long?

495
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:18,667
Yes, I just finished.

496
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:21,600
I'll be right there, okay?

497
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:27,767
Te O?

498
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:54,500
Have you been waiting long?

499
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,867
That's why I told you not to wait today.

500
00:34:57,867 --> 00:35:01,267
Since Ju Yeon's waiting, I'll
just show my face for a second.

501
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:04,233
You're always talking about Dr. Kyung.

502
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:06,033
Is there something going on between you two?

503
00:35:06,033 --> 00:35:08,400
We're just colleagues.

504
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,833
Since you're afraid of Ju Yeon, I'm
making sure you don't run into her.

505
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:14,867
Why do we have to meet up
on the stairs and in the car?

506
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:19,033
I can't handle a secret relationship.
It's too nerve-wracking.

507
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,033
It's because it'd be hard on you
if we made our relationship public.

508
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:24,367
Let's say, we're dating openly.

509
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:28,700
Do you think it'll still be easy for me
to deceive Ju Yeon and sneak you out?

510
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,033
[Jeon Sae Yan]

511
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:32,167
Oh, I almost forgot.

512
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:34,067
Let me go by the small meeting room
for five minutes and come back.

513
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:36,133
I have to wait again?

514
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:38,567
Can't you just text her that you can't come?

515
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:41,567
It's not because of Ju Yeon.
I left my jacket there.

516
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:43,000
Okay, fine.

517
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,033
I'll be right back.

518
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:47,033
- Let me come with you.
- Okay, let's go.

519
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,800
Wait, hold on.

520
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:05,433
What shall I do?

521
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:29,033
I'm hungry. I'm going first.

522
00:37:29,033 --> 00:37:30,533
Wait.

523
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:33,733
Okay, fine. Let's go together.

524
00:37:51,867 --> 00:37:54,100
Answer me.

525
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,100
You don't want to?

526
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,600
Then,

527
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,467
when you come back from
the U.K., let's date, okay?

528
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:04,400
The day you come back will be
our first day of being together.

529
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
Promise me.

530
00:38:57,267 --> 00:39:00,967
Stop being so pathetic like this
and go confront him right now.

531
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:02,667
Or slap him hard at least.

532
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:04,867
It's not Te O's fault.

533
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:07,833
I was mistaken like a fool.

534
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:10,900
After all, I was the one who was mistaken,

535
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,533
so he probably had no choice.

536
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:18,067
I know those feelings better than anyone else.

537
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:21,333
I'm just

538
00:39:21,867 --> 00:39:26,533
so mad at myself and
frustrated that I can't even cry.

539
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:30,433
I've told you, being able to cry is a luxury.

540
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:33,433
Isn't it more like deceit than luxury?

541
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:35,867
You're deceiving yourself.

542
00:39:35,867 --> 00:39:39,233
You're a psychiatrist, and yet you're not
being honest with your own feelings.

My feelings?

544
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:48,500
Do you want me to tell you how I really feel?

545
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:52,633
Please stop caring about my business.

546
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:54,933
That's how I truly feel

00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:57,467
about you.

548

When I kept my mouth shut all this
time during the counseling sessions,

the subject for three months?

continue with this research.

face in the bright daylight?

00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,133
Has the color of the gate facing
the outside always been that?

never looked at it closely in broad daylight.

00:51:55,433 --> 00:51:57,867
Oh, no. Seung Hyun.

705
00:51:57,867 --> 00:52:02,600
I'm going to live with my
cute little Seung Hyun forever.

706
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:07,367
Don't tell unnecessary
things to the child, okay?

707
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,500
It hurts.

708
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,567
Promise me.

709
00:52:13,567 --> 00:52:17,333
No matter what happens,
don't get shocked or cry.

710
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:20,500
I'm afraid that if you
get hurt, I'll get hurt too.

711
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,633
What are you doing?

712
00:52:22,633 --> 00:52:24,633
Get hands off her.

713
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:12,867
Te O, I came by to hand over the materials.

714
00:53:12,867 --> 00:53:16,900
I can't reach you. Are you in surgery?
I'll come to the neurosurgery department.

Ju Yeon, the thing is…

717
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,133
What did you do to him
under general anesthesia?

718
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:26,200
What did you do to the subject?

719
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,733
I just conducted a few tests from
the neurosurgical perspective.

720
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:33,867
You were already working on a research topic
even before the subject was discharged.

721
00:54:33,867 --> 00:54:35,167
Does the subject know about this too?

722
00:54:35,167 --> 00:54:36,633
Well…

723
00:54:36,633 --> 00:54:40,400
I used general anesthesia since it'd
be hard to explain if the subject knew.

724
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,000
I should have been on his side.

725
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I should have protected him.

726
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Ju Yeon, let's think objectively, okay?

727
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:53,500
Ju Yeon, can't you get mad
a bit more gracefully?

728
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,533
Gracefully?

729
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:58,900
Yes, it's good to be graceful.

It didn't break like I thought.
It just came undone.

Is there anything like
a towel to dry myself with?

it was raining so hard.

my phone battery was dead too.

Did you know that the lobby floor
of your building is made of marble?

771

I almost slipped and fell
totally flat on my face.

772
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,100
This floor is marble too.

Be careful. If you twist your
back, it won't heal easily.

I don't need any insurance benefits.
Just providing room and board will do.
