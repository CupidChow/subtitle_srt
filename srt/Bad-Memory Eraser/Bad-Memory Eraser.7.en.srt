[Episode 7, Nice to Meet You]

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,933
You must already know him without me saying,

5
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:51,033
The player, Lee Shin.

6
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:53,733
He may not look like me because he
has inferior genes compared to me.

7
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:55,467
Real brothers.

8
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:57,000
I know the player Lee Shin well.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,100
I'm somewhat famous, right?

10
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,300
Nice to meet you.

11
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,567
Ah, yes.

12
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:10,600
This is Dr. Kyung Ju Yeon,
the temporary team doctor at our agency.

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,933
It seems like there's more
to introduce about her.

14
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:22,633
You liked her when you were very young?

15
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:27,967
Ah, right, she's my first love.

16
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:31,733
The one who saved me when
I fell into the water as a kid.

17
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:34,067
She's my lifesaver.

18
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:40,733
So that was when you fell into
the river near Grandmother's house?

19
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,800
Yes.

20
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,667
What a great connection.

21
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:53,667
You two meet again as doctor and patient.

22
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:55,500
Well, should I get you a drink or something?

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,267
Oh, no. No, thank you.

24
00:01:58,267 --> 00:02:02,133
There's beer here. I'll open one for you.

25
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,700
Here it is.

26
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:14,667
I was going to teach you something about it.

27
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,567
But I forgot about the medical test tomorrow.

28
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:18,300
- I'm leaving.
- Take care.

29
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,533
I'll be going.

30
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:22,267
- Are you leaving already?
- Yes.

31
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:25,367
But aren't you leaving work?

32
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:29,333
I was about to leave as well.

33
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:33,333
I also need to charge my phone.

34
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:42,633
Let's go.

35
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,033
Then I'll leave work.

36
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:52,433
Yes, go home safely.

37
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:09,167
[Fast charger]

38
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:14,867
I would have come with you,
if I had known you'd be here.

39
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,200
I didn't say anything because it's not
yet decided that I'll be the team doctor.

40
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,167
You might have noticed the circumstances
under which I became the team doctor.

41
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:25,933
Because of the clinical trial, I have to
observe your brother without him knowing.

42
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:29,700
I'm also worried about potential side effects.

43
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,000
Is it kind of like an undercover investigation?

44
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,033
I want to take responsibility for the subject
until the end, and I should do that.

45
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:40,467
You do that for all subjects, right?

46
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:42,900
Because of your sense of responsibility
towards your patients,

47
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,067
you even take a leave of absence from the hospital
and work undercover alongside the subjects.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,533
You are my brother's first love, so
do you feel a stronger responsibility?

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,467
It would have been the same
even if I wasn't his first love.

50
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:59,167
It seems even bad memories get
covered up if there are good ones.

51
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:02,800
All my brother's bad memories
seem to have been erased,

52
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,433
but the memory of falling into water hasn't.

53
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:09,833
Is it the power of love?

54
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,067
Let's go. I'll take you home.

55
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:17,400
No, it's okay.

56
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,600
See you at the hospital tomorrow at lunch.

57
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:24,233
Yes.

58
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:31,400
Is he mad because I didn't say anything?

59
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:37,000
I came out because I was worried
that he would be in trouble.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,600
But there's a lot of work to do.

61
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:54,267
Are you sure?

62
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:59,733
Are you sure Ju Yeon is your first love?

63
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,467
You must have run into each other
coming and going from the hospital.

64
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:04,100
You didn't know her until then,

65
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,567
but when you woke up from surgery,
you said that she was your first love.

66
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:10,333
Doesn't that seem strange?

67
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:16,500
My memory is clear, so please ask
the person directly about the rest.

68
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,500
And apologize to her directly.

69
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:27,033
My memory is clear,

70
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:29,367
but why is everyone…

71
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:40,667
It's refreshing, right?

72
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:48,533
I came back because I felt refreshed
thinking about winning the bet.

73
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,067
Yeah?

74
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:55,233
But,

75
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:59,033
does cramming really change
the outcome all at once?

76
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:03,533
Cramming is better than not doing anything.

77
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:08,533
Are you scared that I'm
joining as the team doctor?

78
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:11,233
No.

79
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:14,100
I'm just uncomfortable.

80
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,700
The fact that a man and a woman
are alone in the same space.

81
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,200
We're not just a couple, but we're colleagues.

82
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,767
If you don't have emotions,
what could be uncomfortable?

83
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:25,767
It's not like we're working naked.

84
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:30,867
Why do you suddenly start to
do cleaning? Do you need help?

85
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:33,367
No, no. Don't come over. I don't want that.

86
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:35,433
You'll do your work, and I'll work on mine.

87
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:38,233
I just need to clean
the floor because it's dirty.

88
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:40,967
You just do your work.

89
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,367
His personality is really…

90
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:46,967
Even if a person is hanging there like a bat,

91
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:49,967
if it's not your business,
you'll just walk away.

92
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:53,700
Ah, I'm really getting angry.

93
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,533
Consider your own temperament more than mine.

94
00:06:57,533 --> 00:07:02,133
I've heard of 'car camping', but
'drunk camping' is new to me.

95
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:04,800
Do you know who made me drink so much?

96
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,533
You've seen all of my humiliations.

97
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:12,800
Why did you stop talking? Please continue.

98
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,467
It's just my embarrassments have been exposed.

99
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:18,433
You saw me embarrass myself
when I was doing an event for a guy.

100
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:20,467
Oh, I see.

101
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:24,367
Do you have nothing on your
side? Something to tease about?

102
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:29,500
I am always perfect, so why
would I have such a thing?

103
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:34,133
Oh my, oh my.

104
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:38,967
Oh.

105
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:41,367
It's the charger I've been searching for.

106
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,767
And it's a new one.

107
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Did you buy it for me?

108
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:51,567
Excuse me.

109
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:56,267
Excuse me.

110
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,500
Oh my.

111
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:03,333
This, this one.

112
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:08,267
Are you overestimating yourself?

113
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:10,367
That charger isn't mine.

114
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:11,900
Is this the landlord's?

115
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,500
What? Does that make sense?

116
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,800
Yes, it makes sense.

117
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,700
Why would I do something that could be misunderstood
by someone I have no personal interest in?

118
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,233
If you have proof that

119
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:26,833
I bought that charger, I'll hire you right now.

120
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,867
You.

121
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,967
I'm going to watch the footage
of player Cha Si On's game.

122
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:37,067
Would you like to watch it together?

123
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:40,500
If it helps with the consultation,
I think I should do what I can.

124
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,567
Do you have any snacks?

125
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:49,700
I'm back…

126
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:53,100
What time is it now?

127
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,000
You told CEO Hong that you
were going home a long time ago.

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,200
But why didn't you answer the phone?

129
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,033
I forgot to call because
I was visiting Goon's agency.

130
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:04,933
You…

131
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:06,900
Did you drink?

132
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,733
Are you out of your mind?

133
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:11,133
Don't you know you have
a medical test tomorrow?

134
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,667
At this age, he can drink
alcohol and things like that.

135
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,533
Do you think that makes sense?

136
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:20,600
Do you want to live a normal life?

137
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,567
Then you should quit being an athlete.
How can you be so irresponsible?

138
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:27,600
Are you the only one who's sacrificing?

139
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,200
Don't you know that the whole family
is making sacrifices to support you?

140
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,433
Because I was busy taking care of you,
I couldn't even look after your brother.

141
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:38,867
Don't you even feel sorry?

142
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,133
Grand queen dowager,
I have committed a deadly sin.

143
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:46,467
Please kill me for committing a rash act.

144
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:47,800
- What?
- Please kill me.

145
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,433
- Why are you doing this?
- Please kill me.

146
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:51,467
Crown prince, crown prince, get up.

147
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,100
I think he drank a bit too much.

148
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,400
- Let's go, let's go…
- No.

149
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,100
No, Dad, I'm okay.

150
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:04,433
Oh, my back is hurt.

151
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:10,633
Now I finally got closer to my brother.

152
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,967
I'm trying to enjoy it.

153
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:17,433
Yeah, go ahead and enjoy it.

154
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,367
Try lifting your leg.

155
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:21,533
Lift your leg.

156
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:23,400
Sleep, okay?

157
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,533
Yes.

158
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:42,233
I saw that online.

159
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44,967
Even looking at it, I couldn't understand.

160
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:48,333
Huh? Just now! Did you see it just now?

161
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,667
Isn't that a foul?

162
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:51,267
Isn't it a foul?

163
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:53,767
No, it seems right.

164
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:56,267
Look here. This part seems quite important.

165
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:58,300
Isn't it?

166
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,333
Oh my, what is it?

167
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,033
When did you sit so close? Huh?

168
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:05,400
Didn't you sneakily come and sit next to me?

169
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,500
I guess the sofa is leaning to one side.

170
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:14,167
Foul, foul! It's a foul.

171
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:17,100
Huh? Foul…

172
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,733
Foul… Isn't that foul?
It really seems like a foul.

173
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,167
Thanks to you, I will eat well.

174
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:35,600
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

175
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,667
Do you know what the scariest
affection in the world is?

176
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:39,933
'Food-ship'.

177
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,367
Eating together builds bond.

178
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:44,300
We can't eat together.

179
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,833
You're going to eat all this by yourself?
Being petty about food is stingy.

180
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:52,433
What if we become attached by eating
together? What if I start liking you?

181
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:54,400
You should eat salad for breakfast.

182
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Who eats meat in the morning?

183
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,200
This salad looks so fresh,
so it must be really delicious.

184
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,633
Smell of fresh salad.

185
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:19,500
Are you doing this on purpose
to give me a hard time?

186
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,433
Otherwise, who grills meat in the morning?

187
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:25,767
No, I also eat raw fish.

188
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:28,367
Does staying up all night for a few days

189
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:33,100
make the sport which you had
no interest in into your head?

190
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,233
Don't worry about me, but…

191
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:38,767
You should worry about yourself.

192
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:42,300
If you can't close a contract with the player
Cha Si On, will you get any investment?

193
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,933
Korean players will be divided into these two.

194
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,300
A player belonging to my company.

195
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,500
And the players who will belong to my company.

196
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:59,667
I have a lunch appointment at 12
o'clock, so you can eat all my salad.

197
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:20,033
Dad? It's Sae Yan.

198
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:24,133
I forgot to tell you that I am in Korea.

199
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:26,500
I'm sorry.

200
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,900
I'll hang out in Korea some
more time and then go back.

201
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,933
Please give me the credit card…

202
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:37,733
Yes, it's your money, but you never
allowed me to earn money, right?

203
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:41,900
You don't even let me work part-time,
so of course I don't have the money.

204
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,300
Yes, yes.

205
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,367
I'll take a good rest on my own before leaving.

206
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:51,467
Just give me a little bit of time.

207
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:54,733
Hello, Dad?

208
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,433
I need to find that person quickly.

209
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,167
Ugh, it's lukewarm.

210
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,333
This is sparkling water.

211
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,167
That's alcohol.

212
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:38,233
Why did you bury alcohol under the ground?

213
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:43,067
Your grandma makes kimchi, right?

214
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:44,700
When making kimchi, she
buries it under the ground, right?

215
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,067
You bury precious things under the ground.

216
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:49,433
It's a secret to your grandma.

217
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:52,900
You can use it. You don't have money, right?

218
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,200
Pretty aunt is also our family, so take it.

219
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,233
Family?

220
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:05,467
You and your grandma are
way better than my real family.

221
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:10,267
And this, once I've sorted things out.

222
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,600
I'll double it and then pay you back.

223
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,900
I promise.

224
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,533
Hello, this is the call-taxi service, right?

225
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:22,767
Yes, it's a round trip to Jincheon.

226
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:26,733
I have to pay in coins…

227
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:29,700
I will call you back.

228
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:33,333
Why do you keep staring at me?

229
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,100
I need to cut open your stomach.

230
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,100
If you look at me like
that, it hurts my feelings.

231
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,633
Grand queen dowager.

232
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,533
Trainer, trainer.

233
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:13,633
I'll hang up now.

234
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:21,167
Why isn't she coming out? I just
wanted to see her face before leaving.

235
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Go ahead, take a look.

236
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,133
Hey, why are you here? Hey, get out, get out.

237
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,000
Let's play together. Let me brighten your mood.

238
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,667
Are you asking me to play with you so that
I can suffer trouble from your father again?

239
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:41,000
I got the picture your dad sent
someone to take of you and me.

240
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,533
As humiliation shots?

241
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:46,633
Keep them as a memory. You don't
even have the usual date photos.

242
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:48,367
You left me so quickly because you
were afraid something big would happen.

243
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:52,133
If he's going to take a photo of us,
please tell your father to use a filter.

244
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:56,167
Your mother also seemed pretty
scary because you lied to her.

245
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:59,033
How can you tell this is a training ground?

246
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:00,667
Where's the trainer?

247
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,400
Where?

248
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,633
- Did you overhear?
- Drive.

249
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:08,200
Driver, drive.

250

- Yes.

253

Yes.

Where are we going?

00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:28,700
- Right!
- I got it!

Ah, my leg hurts. Why isn't he coming?

257
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,700
I'm hungry, and my leg hurts.

258
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:47,700
Please leave a message after the beep…

259
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,367
Did something really happen to him?

260
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:04,367
I called the team doctor, so
you'd relax during the game.

261
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:07,933
So don't stress her too much.

262

What's this?

263
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:13,233
I feel like you're trying to protect her.

Hey, you.

267
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,633
Fine, if you don't need
the team doctor, forget about it.

268
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:26,933

Player Cha Si On, please come in.

271
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:36,433
I spoke to him about the hospital
director. You can go in now.

272
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:38,600
What do you think? The team
doctor is quite helpful, right?

273
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,467
I think we are quite a good
match. Don't you think?

274
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:43,633
Disgusting! It's obvious.

275
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:47,567
Pretending to be interested and showing off
when you're not interested in me at all.

Bah.

277
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:56,800
So, will you be able to
convince her by tomorrow?

278
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,067
Of course.

279
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:02,800
You might as well prepare
to sign a contract with me.

Gosh.

Oh, baby.

Ah, my baby will be all scratched up.

Poop smell!

289
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:42,467
If you like the smell of poop so much,
should I make you a diffuser with that?

290
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:45,267
This is the smell of hometown.

291
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,867
What would you know?

292
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:50,167
Doesn't seem like a comment
from someone who's lived in Italy.

293
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:53,233
Ah, I need to exercise, but what
am I doing in this nowhere village?

Exercise?

if there was any news.

seem to be digested.

and the same goes for when I take digestives.

should take digestives or not,

351
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:48,600
The off-site training wasn't
even proper training.

352
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:05,500
Yeah.

353
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,000
Still, it's good because it
keeps other thoughts away.

354
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,200
By the way, what is she doing here?

355
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,267
She walks around the whole neighborhood.

356
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:19,800
Did something not go well?

357
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,500
This is the first time
I've seen you this listless.

358
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,767
Were the corners of
the eyes originally like that?

359
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:28,167
Every time you see me,

360
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:31,533
your eyes looked like this.

361
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:34,200
But now, your eyes completely look like this.

362
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,700
I'll find that person someday.

363
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,200
Well…

364
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,233
It seems that person ran away in fright,
thinking you were looking for him or her.

365
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:46,000
Is that so?

366
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,300
Why is she acting like that?

367
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,533
The water here is totally frozen.

368
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:57,767
How is it? It's refreshing, right?

369
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:59,033
Hey, you old pumpkin!

370
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:01,100
- Come over here.
- Don't do that.

371
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,867
I'll do it. I'll do it.

372
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:04,800
I told you not to do it!

373
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,333
You're going to be barefaced!

374
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,500
You're going to be barefaced.

375
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:20,033
I tried my best to cheer her up.

376
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:22,867
Why is she so strong?

377
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,000
- Open the door.
- Well.

378
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,167
- Walk all the way to Seoul.
- Hey, hey!

379
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:29,067
- Bye.
- Hey, hey!

380
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:30,633
Open the door.

381
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:33,467
If you go like this, how can I go back?

382
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:34,933
Hey, come to your senses.

383
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,967
Hey, no, really!

384
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:38,967
You know how scary my dad is, right?

385
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:40,667
Hey!

386
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:42,667
Hey!

387
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:00,767
Uh, hello?

388
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:04,333
Huh? I can't hear.

389
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,700
Hello?

390
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,100
It seems the phone signal is bad there.

391
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,633
- What, where?
- Ju Yeon.

392
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:13,333
Can you call a taxi for me?

393
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,367
I'm in the countryside right now.

394
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:20,533
I don't have any money right now.

395
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,767
Why did you go there?

396
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:28,533
Looking for someone? Who? Wait.

397
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:30,900
I'll take a taxi, so wait there.

398
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,467
No, it's dangerous to take
a taxi alone at night.

399
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,633
Don't move and wait there.

400
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:38,567
Oh my.

401
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,400
Please pull over there.

402
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,300
Isn't it dangerous for
you to take a taxi alone?

403
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,467
We're getting on the highway.

404
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:46,300
I don't want to be in debt. Please let me off.

405
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,067
I dislike being in debt and
getting tangled up as well.

406
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:53,967
Why are you rushing there right away?

407
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:59,200
I was forced into debt.

408
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,767
What? A watch, or a bracelet?

409
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:04,733
A wish. I'm in debt for a wish.

410
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:10,167
And no matter how much of a line I draw,
she's the one who comes into that line.

411
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:13,767
There's someone who can
bring down your iron wall.

412
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:16,667
I wonder who that person is.

413
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:36,400
Will I be able to meet that person again?

414
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,900
Is it always like this here,
with no lights or people?

415
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:48,300
It's so dark that if someone were
buried here, no one would know.

416
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,800
It would be perfect for a movie location.

417
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,700
What do you stop the car all of a sudden?

418
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,867
Wow, that was startling.

419
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:04,233
Let's take a short break before we go.

420
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:08,367
Take a break? Here? Why?

421
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:14,967
Would you mind closing your eyes for a moment?

422
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,433
Why should I close my eyes?
What are you going to do?

423
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:20,700
No lights, no people.

424
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,633
In a place where no one would
know if anything happens.

425
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:25,067
Oh my, it's funny.

426
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:28,167
Then do as you wish.

427
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:30,733
Okay, okay, I've closed them.

428
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:33,267
So, what are you going to do?

429
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:36,467
Why do you stop the car suddenly, lower
your voice, and tell me to close my eyes?

430
00:28:36,467 --> 00:28:40,567
Are we filming a romance or something?

431
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:46,433
Did you leave?

432
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,133
Excuse me.

433
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:50,800
Are you opening the trunk?

434
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,233
Can I open my eyes?

435
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:05,133
What? What is he taking out?

436
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:07,267
A shovel?

437
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:12,300
Oh, my gosh.

438
00:29:15,367 --> 00:29:17,667
He saw me. He saw me.

439
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:20,800
Oh no, it must be me, it must be me.

440
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,967
Raise up the window!

441
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,233
What are you doing?

442
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:29,400
What are you doing?

443
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,433
- Can't you see?
- I'm asking because I don't want to know.

444
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:34,567
Who are you going to bury with the shovel?

445
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:37,000
Come out for a second. Come out, please.

446
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,967
Tell me with words. Put that down first.

447
00:29:49,733 --> 00:29:54,167
There's an animal killed in a road
accident, so I'm going to bury it.

448
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,833
Although you passed away alone in this life.

449
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:13,967
I hope you live a long, healthy

450
00:30:13,967 --> 00:30:16,400
and happy life in your next life.

451
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,367
I guess animals are an exception.

452
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:21,567
You're cold to people.

453
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:30,000
Hello…

454
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,333
Hello?

455
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:34,700
Ju Yeon, I've taken a car heading to Seoul.

456
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,300
What? Whose car?

457
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,700
Why did you just take any car?

458
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,367
No, I just happened to meet someone I knew.

459
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:43,700
Someone you know?

460
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,867
Anyway, the important thing is I'm
going back to Seoul. See you in Seoul.

461
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:50,333
What a relief.

462
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:52,800
Did she…

463
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:57,300
I'm sorry, but I just have to go back to Seoul.

464
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,833
I came back because I had something to ask.

465
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:10,233
Who exactly are you looking for?

466
00:31:10,233 --> 00:31:11,700
What will you do with that?

467
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,167
I don't know.

468
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:14,800
It might be someone I know.

469
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,500
I also have ties here.

470
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:22,067
The person I love.

471
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:25,567
That person used to lived
here when I was young.

472
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,500
[The road to Durimoegol]

473
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,967
Aren't you going to eat?

474
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,433
My dad was also a doctor.

475
00:31:52,433 --> 00:31:54,133
A psychiatrist.

476
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:58,133
Dad didn't see each patient as just a patient

477
00:31:58,133 --> 00:32:03,233
but approached them with his own
emotions as if it were his own matter.

478
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,533
- Sir…
- Patients came first before his family.

479
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:08,500
- Be sure to visit the health center.
- Yes, I will for sure.

480
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,800
And then…

481
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,600
I wanted to show that
I was different from my dad.

482
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,367
I kept distance from the patients

483
00:32:25,367 --> 00:32:29,500
and kept them away in case emotions developed.

484
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,900
But…

485
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,867
I feel suffocated, so is
this frustration or what?

486
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:38,700
I saw my reflection in the patient's glasses.

487
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,367
"I'm not interested in your
story, so get it over with and leave."

488
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:44,333
"When will this story end?"

489
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:48,933
"You'll never get better so just
talk accordingly and then get up."

490
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,367
This patient might have

491
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:58,433
thought of me as a glimmer of hope.

492
00:32:58,433 --> 00:33:02,833
Who could open their heart
and talk to someone like me?

493
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:05,900
To people who brought bad memories,

494
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,733
I wonder if I'm becoming another bad memory.

495
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:16,367
The player Si On is right.

496
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:19,667
I used to talk as if I knew something

497
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:22,633
even though I wasn't even interested.

498
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:27,933
To a person who is self-blaming like this,

499
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:30,700
what words will you offer?

500
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,867
In this case, the only thing I can do is

501
00:33:34,867 --> 00:33:40,500
to survey all your patients, create big data,

502
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,700
and then prove that it is not true.

503
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,500
There's nothing you can do for me.

504
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,533
It's just…

505
00:33:50,533 --> 00:33:55,767
It's just frustrating, and speaking out
makes me feel at least a bit relieved.

506
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:03,700
Just like you, they feel the same.

507
00:34:05,167 --> 00:34:10,233
Just being by their sides is comforting.

508
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:13,167
Just by being there,

509
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:16,967
there's nothing more to wish for.

510
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:21,567
That will be enough for them too.

511
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:23,900
Certainly.

512
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:34,333
Oh, it's hot.

513
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,500
Why is it suddenly so hot?

514
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,367
I need to open a window.

515
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:51,067
No.

516
00:34:51,067 --> 00:34:53,233
It's the smell of the countryside.
It's the smell of cow's poop.

517
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:55,133
This is because I opened
the window. You know that, right?

518
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:57,233
You absolutely know it's not me, right?

519
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:59,933
A smell that wasn't here for
a while is suddenly emerging.

520
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:01,667
The wind! It's because of the wind.

521
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:04,800
The wind is blowing this way just like this.

522
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,967
Let's assume that's true.

523
00:35:05,967 --> 00:35:08,600
That's not it, no. This isn't it.

524
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,800
I don't smell like this.

525
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,067
- Yes, let's say that.
- I'm telling you, it's not me.

526
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:13,300
- Yes, I got it.
- Ah, it drives me crazy.

527
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,500
- We're leaving.
- Let's go now.

528
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,833
Yes.

529
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:21,667
It's not me. It's not me.

530
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:26,633
Thank you for giving me a ride.

531
00:35:26,633 --> 00:35:30,633
Ju Yeon, let's meet at the stadium tomorrow.

532
00:35:30,633 --> 00:35:32,333
Tomorrow might be the last day.

533
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:36,567
Don't be quick to judge the results.

534
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,900
Ju Yeon.

535
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,200
Who is it? A man?

536
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,333
Ah, that is…

537
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:58,400
Hey, you!

538
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,567
Why did you go there without any plan?

539
00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:02,833
Because of you…

540
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:05,533
Oh my.

541
00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:07,700
First, I got scolded by your mother.

542
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,133
Secondly, I got scolded by Seung Hyun.

543
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:13,100
And third, I got scolded by you.

544
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,567
I feel like… family!

545
00:36:15,567 --> 00:36:19,233
What? Did you just curse?

546
00:36:19,233 --> 00:36:20,767
I said we're like family.

547
00:36:20,767 --> 00:36:24,400
Actually, I didn't grow up
receiving this kind of attention.

548
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:28,733
Let's go. Your mom is making pumpkin porridge.

549
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:30,067
Try it once more.

550
00:36:30,067 --> 00:36:31,100
Why?

551
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,267
- You.
- Why?

552
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:34,433
You didn't even answer the phone.

553
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:58,200
♫ Being with the worries that cling to me ♫

554
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,500

[2022 South Korea National
Tennis Team Candidate Test]

567
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:35,267
Have you fallen for me?

568
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:41,000
I wonder who walks around
pretending to be cool like this.

569
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,800
It's not that I'm trying to act cool.

570
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,033
It's just that I look cool myself.

571
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,267
Sir.

572
00:38:52,267 --> 00:38:54,067
I will devote my whole body

573
00:38:54,067 --> 00:38:55,633
and work hard as a national team coach,

574
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,500
giving my all for infinite glory.

575
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,933
Good, good.

576
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:00,400
- Thank you.
- Yes, yes.

577
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,033
Thank you.

578
00:39:03,033 --> 00:39:04,067
You are here.

579
00:39:04,067 --> 00:39:07,067
Hey, you said you weren't coming.

580
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:08,100
Sir.

581
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,100
From the player Cha Si On's agency.

582
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:19,000
Yes, excuse me.

583
00:39:23,633 --> 00:39:25,733
Doctor?

584
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:28,333
Isn't it?

585
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:34,967
Go for it, go for it!

586
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,333
Player Lee Shin.

587
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:42,333
Why didn't you come to lunch yesterday?

588
00:39:51,067 --> 00:39:53,167
Wear it.

589
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:57,533
I put on a talisman for good luck.

590
00:39:57,533 --> 00:39:59,700
Go for it.

591
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,100
Why isn't he coming?

592
00:40:11,633 --> 00:40:15,233
Player Cha Si On, you'll
be there in 10 minutes.

593
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,767
Cha Si On, go for it!

594
00:40:30,767 --> 00:40:33,500
- Go for it.
- Cha Si On, go for it.

595
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,733
Little cuttie, are you okay?

596
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:53,433
Why is she like this?

597
00:40:53,433 --> 00:40:54,467
Oh my, Si On.

598
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:55,933
Si On.

599
00:40:55,933 --> 00:40:57,300
Cha Si On, Cha Si On.

600
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,767
Where's the ambulance? Ambulance!

601
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:02,533
Call an ambulance, quickly!

602
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,333
Since we're the only ones here, get up.

603
00:41:31,567 --> 00:41:34,867
I really felt dizzy earlier.

604
00:41:39,067 --> 00:41:42,633
Everyone says to cheer up, right?

605
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:43,800
Don't cheer up.

606
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,833
What?

607
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:46,467
I said, don't cheer up.

608
00:41:46,467 --> 00:41:50,033
Are you bad-mouthing me because
I'm not dealing with you right now?

609
00:41:50,033 --> 00:41:54,467
Whenever you start something,
you hear 'cheer up' the most, right?

610
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:59,067
It's okay to be lacking,
and it's okay to be clumsy.

611
00:41:59,067 --> 00:42:01,533
It's okay not to cheer up.

612
00:42:01,533 --> 00:42:03,167
You might not do well today.

613
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:06,833
Just being there has its own meaning.

614
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:10,967
You only have to do as much as
you can and as much as you've done.

615
00:42:10,967 --> 00:42:15,100
So let's not cheer up.

616
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,800
Still, everyone has their expectations.

617
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,500
Others have their own lives.

618
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,500
As long as your expectations
are not disappointed, that's fine.

619
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,600
If I do badly, who would want
to sign a contract with me?

620
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,200
I'm here for you, little cuttie.

621
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,500
Mister?

622
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,900
Where do you want to go? Just tell me.

623
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,567
This is the extent of my territory.

624
00:42:58,567 --> 00:42:59,967
The court is your territory.

625
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,800
Is this really what you want?

626
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,400
Even if it doesn't work out, you have to try.

627
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:07,767
I'll go.

628
00:43:16,567 --> 00:43:19,967
So you've been preparing
the big data for the whole night?

629
00:43:19,967 --> 00:43:21,300
But why didn't you tell me?

630
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,767
The national team should be
composed of the best players.

631
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:29,000
With her skills, she'll never
make it to the national team.

632
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,667
- Doubles?
- As you know.

633
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:34,200
Player Cha Si On's specialty is the volley.

634
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,700
No one can match her in net play.

635
00:43:40,133 --> 00:43:43,867
Here are the rehabilitation
doctor's opinion and the big data.

636
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:48,800
If she teams up with the player I recommend,

637
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,467
there will surely be a chance of winning.

638
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,433
The doubles players already have their teams.

639
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,333
But there's a new doubles player.

640
00:44:04,033 --> 00:44:06,567
You called for me…

641
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,200
So, is she playing doubles
with Player Lee Shin?

642
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,633
Yes.

643
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:16,933
Since they can compensate for each other's
weaknesses when they play mixed doubles.

644
00:44:16,933 --> 00:44:19,533
It will be the most ideal combination.

645
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:23,933
What's left is up to the players.

646
00:44:25,267 --> 00:44:29,033
Both of us are dependent on
Player Si On for employment.

647
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,700
Indeed.

648
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,800
Simple labor is the best when you're anxious.

649
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,667
- What is this?
- It's a wish bracelet.

650
00:44:38,667 --> 00:44:41,967
Don't call it childish. If you
say that, you'll get bad luck.

651
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:45,567
Why are you making this now?

652
00:44:45,567 --> 00:44:47,900
You don't need to know.

653
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,433
Ah, the length is…

654
00:44:49,433 --> 00:44:51,900
Hold on. Give me your arm for a second.

655
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:59,300
Ah, superstitions

656
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,233
can be useful at times, right?

657
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:03,600
Grab the end here for a moment.

658
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,867
Oh, of course.

659
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:08,233
The design is pretty too, right?

660
00:45:08,233 --> 00:45:10,433
This is decent.

661
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,833
- Hold on, just a sec.
- No, don't move.

662
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:15,200
I said don't move. It's coming loose.

663
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,700
Oh, I'll take it out for you.

664
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,900
This one looks like a receipt.

665
00:45:25,033 --> 00:45:27,867
Oh dear, it's cut off.

666
00:45:29,033 --> 00:45:32,533
A receipt for a phone charger?

667
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:35,233
Oh, that charger, it's the one that was bought.

668
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,800
Let's see the date.

669
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,567
Stop, be careful with the physical contact.

670
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:42,567
Why aren't you showing it to me?

671
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:44,433
- Let me take a look at this.
- No, no.

672
00:45:44,433 --> 00:45:47,967
Seriously, no physical contact
allowed, it's prohibited.

673
00:45:47,967 --> 00:45:49,967
If that's what you bought, you
know you're hiring me, right?

674
00:45:49,967 --> 00:45:51,567
- Let me see.
- Oh, that.

675
00:45:51,567 --> 00:45:56,867
Then, I might end up really liking you again.

676
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:05,600
Does that scare you?

677
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,700
I got a phone call.

678
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:27,533
Hello? Hello?

679
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:29,033
Mister.

680
00:46:29,033 --> 00:46:30,500
Yes, you little cuttie.

681
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,467
Oh, right, so how did it go?

682
00:46:35,467 --> 00:46:37,133
Yes.

683
00:46:37,133 --> 00:46:39,900
Yes!

684
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:46,033
Ah, yes, congratulations.

685
00:46:46,033 --> 00:46:48,967
And what about the team doctor?

686
00:46:48,967 --> 00:46:52,133
What do you want to do?

687
00:46:52,133 --> 00:46:53,733
You never want to see her again.

688
00:46:53,733 --> 00:46:57,767
If it's totally unacceptable,
we'll find another team doctor.

689
00:46:57,767 --> 00:47:01,667
Mister, do as you like. It doesn't matter.

690
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:03,767
Ah, okay.

691
00:47:03,767 --> 00:47:07,300
Yes, yes, alright.

692
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,133
What did she say? What about me?

693
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:14,767
I don't know.

694
00:47:14,767 --> 00:47:15,833
What?

695
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,467
Well, what did she say?

696
00:47:19,867 --> 00:47:21,333
I don't know.

697
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:23,433
Why wouldn't you tell me?

698
00:47:23,433 --> 00:47:26,633
Just a minute. Let's go together.

699
00:47:26,633 --> 00:47:27,667
Oh my.

700
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:28,733
Ah, hey!

701
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:31,367
I heard you're playing doubles with Si On.

702
00:47:31,367 --> 00:47:35,867
You said you hated playing doubles?
What made you change your mind?

703
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,767
Because there is nothing else I can do.

704
00:47:39,767 --> 00:47:42,033
No.

705
00:47:42,033 --> 00:47:44,900
I shouldn't be the one doing this.

706
00:47:45,967 --> 00:47:49,200
Because that's the only thing I can do for her.

707
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,667
For whom? Cha Si On?

708
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:56,000
Or is it for Goon?

709
00:48:05,033 --> 00:48:06,633
I guessed it right.

710
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:11,500
That's the doctor that Goon
was with at the hospital, right?

711
00:48:14,233 --> 00:48:16,800
Are you really not going to tell me?

712
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,333
That's a violation of the bet.

713
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:20,667
You should go home now.

714
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:22,900
Home?

715
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,800
You'll be busy starting work from tomorrow.

716
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:32,267
Did Player Si On ask to hire me?

717
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,500
I won the bet, right?

718
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,233
Oh, that little cuttie.

719
00:48:38,233 --> 00:48:41,567
She doesn't know how to
distinguish a good person.

720
00:48:43,267 --> 00:48:45,533
Thank you.

721
00:48:48,867 --> 00:48:52,800
Goon laughs really well.

722
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,267
She's that doctor, right?

723
00:48:57,767 --> 00:49:00,133
His attending physician,

724
00:49:00,133 --> 00:49:02,867
the team doctor,

725
00:49:03,433 --> 00:49:05,700
and his first love.

726
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,867
First love?

727
00:49:14,333 --> 00:49:16,433
What's going on?

728
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,200
Congratulations.

729
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,633
Congratulations.

730
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,933
Ma'am, can I go to the first meeting

731
00:49:25,933 --> 00:49:28,267
between the coach and Si On?

732
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,400
Please take good care of Si On, CEO Lee Goon.

733
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,467
Si On, see you later at home.

734
00:49:38,467 --> 00:49:40,633
Ma'am, the promise you made with me.

735
00:49:40,633 --> 00:49:42,433
CEO Hong.

736
00:49:42,433 --> 00:49:47,367
If it weren't for you, I would have
prepared just a hunger strike.

737
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:50,633
Thank you very much.

738
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,533
Yes.

739
00:49:55,533 --> 00:49:57,833
There are plenty of other players.

740
00:49:57,833 --> 00:50:01,400
Try to do well with just Cha Si On.

741
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,933
Let's go.

742
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:04,567
Ah, wait a moment.

743
00:50:04,567 --> 00:50:06,633
By the way,

744
00:50:07,233 --> 00:50:10,733
doesn't it smell like poop?

745
00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:18,267
Is the smell coming from here?

746
00:50:52,933 --> 00:50:55,033
Little cuttie.

747
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,633
Let's go.

748
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,833
No, no. Someone who can do it right now.

749
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:09,467
Okay, then. Look into it and
contact me immediately.

750
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:11,033
Hey, Goon.

751
00:51:11,033 --> 00:51:12,533
Oh, did Lee Shin come?

752
00:51:12,533 --> 00:51:14,433
That's not what's important right now.

753
00:51:14,433 --> 00:51:16,133
I think you can't have
the coach's meeting today.

754
00:51:16,133 --> 00:51:19,000
- Why?
- The interpreter left after working for today.

755
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,933
Saying that the coach
was impossible to deal with.

756
00:51:21,933 --> 00:51:22,933
What did the association say?

757
00:51:22,933 --> 00:51:25,767
They're in a frenzy looking
for an interpreter right now.

758
00:51:25,767 --> 00:51:29,533
But how can they find
the interpreter at this hour?

759
00:51:29,533 --> 00:51:32,900
Little cuttie, go ahead up first.

760
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,533
Go ahead.

761
00:51:35,533 --> 00:51:38,000
Can't the coach speak English?
I can interpret it in English.

762
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,067
He said he needs an Italian interpreter.

763
00:51:40,067 --> 00:51:44,567
- Italian?
- You just wait for now.

764
00:51:44,567 --> 00:51:46,233
- Yes.
- Yes, hello?

765
00:51:46,233 --> 00:51:48,233
Hey.

766
00:51:51,767 --> 00:51:55,200
Thanks to you, I'm one step closer to my wish.

767
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,867
Thanks to this bracelet.

768
00:51:56,867 --> 00:52:00,500
The wish comes true when the bracelet breaks.

769
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:05,133
But the bracelet helps you get
closer to your wish, one step at a time.

770
00:52:05,133 --> 00:52:06,933
Right?

771
00:52:06,933 --> 00:52:09,000
So,

772
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,800
I picked it up on the way.

773
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,067
Mama mia!

774
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:19,367
My heart is racing.

775
00:52:19,367 --> 00:52:21,433
It's burdensome. It's too much.

776
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:23,267
It's awesome.

777
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:26,433
So, is this a couple's bracelet then?

778
00:52:28,133 --> 00:52:29,200
Put the bracelet on me.

779
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,333
I have to do that for you?

780
00:52:31,967 --> 00:52:37,367
I made it while looking at the manual,
but I'm not sure if it's made properly.

781
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,733
Please make sure I can find that person.

782
00:52:43,733 --> 00:52:46,467
Do you wish to find something?

783
00:52:46,467 --> 00:52:48,300
Yes.

784
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,500
I'm actually looking for someone.

785
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,167
Someone? Who?

786
00:52:53,167 --> 00:52:55,467
I…

787
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:58,000
Just a moment.

788
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Who is it?

789
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,400
The national fairy.

790
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,533
Ah, Player Si On.

791
00:53:02,533 --> 00:53:05,300
I sincerely congratulate you on
becoming a national team member.

792
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,533
Did you meet the coach?

793
00:53:06,533 --> 00:53:08,933
I'm still alone.

794
00:53:08,933 --> 00:53:11,467
He went to the car to get my bag.

795
00:53:11,467 --> 00:53:15,667
I was only a little nervous earlier,

796
00:53:15,667 --> 00:53:19,200
but as time is delayed, I get
more and more nervous.

797
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,933
What should I do in this situation?

798
00:53:20,933 --> 00:53:23,267
Is it delayed? Was there an incident?

799
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:26,400
I heard that the interpreter
ran away, or something.

800
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,467
They're in a frenzy here trying
to find an Italian interpreter.

801
00:54:05,667 --> 00:54:09,800
I have never worked a day
in my life since I was born.

802
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,333
Can I do it well?

803
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:14,200
Your Italian pronunciation
was so good last time.

804
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,600
They will probably pay you a daily wage.

805
00:54:20,467 --> 00:54:22,833
Come here.

806
00:54:22,833 --> 00:54:26,600
- Excuse me, you're Goon's friend, right?
- Yes.

807
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,700
I've brought an interpreter.
Where should I take her?

808
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,133
- An interpreter?
- Yes.

809
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:31,367
- Interpreter.
- Are you the interpreter?

810
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:32,600
- Yes.
- Come quickly, this way.

811
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,967
- What? Oh, yes.
- Yes, quickly, hurry.

812
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:37,067
Just a moment. I'll come back
after earning a lot of money.

813
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:40,233
Come quickly.

814
00:54:40,233 --> 00:54:44,333
Excuse me, let's talk for a moment.

815
00:54:51,567 --> 00:54:53,600
We're short on time, so let's keep it brief.

816
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,167
- Please don't loiter around Goon anymore.
- What?

817
00:54:57,167 --> 00:55:00,800
Doctor, you know very well how difficult Goon

818
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,700
has been living all this time, right?

819
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,133
You probably know why he threw himself

820
00:55:06,133 --> 00:55:10,067
into the Han River after the alumni reunion.

821
00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:14,800
I'm sure you know because I told you
that it's because of his first love.

822
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,500
Oh, that… Are you worried that

823
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,900
since I'm his first love, he might
regain his past memories?

824
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,233
If that's the case, I'll do my best to be by
his side so that he doesn't regain memories.

825
00:55:24,233 --> 00:55:26,133
That's really shameless.

826
00:55:26,133 --> 00:55:27,900
You can't be by his side.

827
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,667
Because it'll be hard for all three of you.

828
00:55:30,667 --> 00:55:32,600
All three?

829
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,800
Goon, you, and…

830
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,800
Where are you? Did you find your first love?

831
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,633
Yes, I found her, thankfully.

832
00:55:43,633 --> 00:55:46,767
I shouldn't ask for more.

833
00:55:47,567 --> 00:55:49,633
- That's how it should be.
- Did you pretend to know?

834
00:55:49,633 --> 00:55:51,133
Hey, you should go and confess to her.

835
00:55:51,133 --> 00:55:55,933
But she was already with someone else.

836
00:55:58,633 --> 00:56:00,100
It was taken away again.

837
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,900
Taken away? To whom?

838
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,567
Lee Shin.

839
00:56:04,567 --> 00:56:07,833
Taken by someone close.

840
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:09,700
That person…

841
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,800
Please stop making Goon suffer anymore.

842
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,333
Please quit being a team doctor and
a doctor in charge and leave him alone.

843
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:16,800
Between the two brothers…

844
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,000
What are you talking about?

845
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,367
Player Lee Shin.

846
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:24,933
Are you saying that Dr. Kyung and
I have some kind of relationship?

847
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,967
What are you two doing now?

848
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,133
Are you denying it now?

849
00:56:31,133 --> 00:56:34,433
You, on the day of Goon's accident.

850
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,867
The alumni reunion.

851
00:56:36,867 --> 00:56:39,167
Don't you remember?

852
00:56:41,867 --> 00:56:44,967
[J Hotel]

853
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:06,500
The place in that memory was here.

854
00:57:07,933 --> 00:57:12,600
Then, that memory wasn't a fantasy?

855
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:51,600
Goon saw everything.

856
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,300
That day, you and his first love

857
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,767
were together.

858
00:58:32,867 --> 00:58:35,800
If the person I kissed that day

859
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,400
was my brother's first love,

860
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,267
it wasn't you.

861
00:58:42,267 --> 00:58:46,967
Then, my brother's first love is…

862
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:59,967
Hello, I am Jeon Sae Yan,
your interpreter for the day.

863
00:59:02,133 --> 00:59:04,533
Please take care of me.

864
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,267

Haven't we met each other somewhere before?

871
00:59:53,533 --> 00:59:54,633
Your face looks familiar.

872
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:56,633
So that my brother's bad
memories won't come back.

873
00:59:56,633 --> 00:59:58,333
Cooperation, let's do that.

874
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:00,800
Why do you tell a lie that's quickly found out?

875
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,333
If you haven't committed a crime,
why do you run out barefoot?

876
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,933
Staying up all night with me is not a big sin.

877
01:00:04,933 --> 01:00:06,733
I should go to where that woman is.

878
01:00:06,733 --> 01:00:09,433
Have you ever seen Goon's past diary?

879
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:11,267
Everything about me will be written there.

880
01:00:11,267 --> 01:00:12,433
I need to find it first.

881
01:00:12,433 --> 01:00:15,500
