[Bad Memory Eraser]

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,367
[We followed the production guidelines
when filming child actors and animals.]

3
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:43,633
First, promise to never see me as a woman.

4
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:46,800
Second, you must respect my
privacy outside of working hours.

5
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,867
Third, you should undergo a brainwave
test and detailed consultation once a week.

6
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:52,367
Fourth, you don't have to provide
the four major insurances and salary.

7
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:56,167
Just provide room and board
for exactly three months.

8
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:58,700
Please read the rest as well.

9
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:07,033
I'm making a big decision by accepting
the offer to be the team doctor.

10
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:11,133
Normally, I should just write a standard
contract, negotiate, and just get it done.

11
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:14,300
I just have written it down briefly.

12
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,200
Why…

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,267
If there's a part of the terms you don't like,

14
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:29,600
we can make concessions and modify it.

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,233
There's no need for modifications.

16
00:01:31,233 --> 00:01:33,067
Because I'm not going to sign the contract.

17
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:35,533
If you're done talking, please leave.

18
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:36,867
Just a moment.

19
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:38,133
Why?

20
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:40,000
You introduced me as the team
doctor in front of the investors,

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,900
and now you're saying
you won't sign the contract?

22
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,933
Because my mindset has changed since then.

23
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:50,200
Back then, I liked you,

24
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:53,667
but not anymore.

25
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:02,433
That's good, then.

26
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:05,300
You shouldn't have feelings for
someone you met through work.

27
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,100
I'm so relieved.

28
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,100
Now I can focus only on work.

29
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:14,300
Since I have a lot to do.

30
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,200
Please leave.

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,433
But you said the team needed a doctor.

32
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:21,367
I got permission to take
time off from the hospital.

33
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:23,667
Please leave.

34
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,133
You're kicking me out at this
hour? My phone battery is dead.

35
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:30,067
I can't leave now.

36
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,267
Please understand that this is
skinship due to a home invasion.

37
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:35,667
Oh my.

38
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:53,100
Since I drank a glass of wine earlier,

39
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,067
I can't even give you a ride now.

40
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:58,233
No, I have no reason to take you home.

41
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:01,633
Charge your phone in the guest
room and go home on your own.

42
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:04,833
Then could I charge this…

43
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:05,900
Do it yourself.

44
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,467
Oh, yes, I will.

45
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,200
The test subject has been discharged.

46
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,533
Discharged?

47
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:50,167
But the hospital director said
that even outside the hospital,

48
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:53,767
I should observe the test subject and
gave me time off from my hospital duties.

49
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:57,800
Thanks to that, the work is
going on without any hitches.

50
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,567
So, it would be better to
observe his everyday behavior

51
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:05,100
naturally outside rather than in a hospital.

52
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,100
Yes.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,567
It's quite scary, isn't it?

54
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:12,867
That pufferfish poison.

55
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:16,400
It's said to be about ten
times as potent as cyanide.

56
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,733
They're born without poison,

57
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:20,833
and are weak with tiny fins when they're born.

58
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,233
But they eat poisonous food

59
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,967
to protect themselves

60
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:29,533
and to survive in the jungle.

61
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,067
That's frightening.

62
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:42,433
Don't worry, and just drink.

63
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:53,000
If we want to protect the subject,

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,400
we have to become even stronger.

65
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:59,767
Gosh, that startled me.

66
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,167
This darn weather.

67
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,867

All the people in the world love me.

71
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:17,800
The universe revolves around me.

72
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,533
Now, let's start the day fresh today as well.

73
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:23,300
Concentrate on the breath coming in,

74
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,267
and concentrate on the breath going out.

75
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:30,833
Three, two, one.

76
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,767
You are awake?

77
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:38,900
What's this…

78
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:41,867
I ordered delivery.

79
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:45,200
I thought you left at dawn,

80
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,233
but you are even having breakfast?

81
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:48,967
This is my true self.

82
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:53,033
This is what I always look like at
home, except when I go to work.

83
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:55,067
Why are you doing this?

84
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:56,767
You just have to not fall for me.

85
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:58,567
You said I was firm with
men, right? That's right.

86
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,767
Just think of me as wearing
a suit thicker than Iron Man's.

87
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:03,333
I will ask you once again.

88
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,467
What is your intention behind this?

89
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:07,967
The intent.

90
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,933
Because you are my patient.

91
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:11,500
To take your side,

92
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,200
to be responsible till the end.

93
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,167
Oh, you little cutie.

94
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:23,567
Why are you calling at this hour?

95
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,400
What?

96
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,633
What happened? Tell me properly.

97
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:32,500
Alright, I'll go to the rehab center now.

98
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:37,200
Did something happen to
one of the affiliated players?

99
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,600
Is that so?

Oh my, where is he?

104
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:58,700
Oh my.

105
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,133
Something happened to the player, right?
This is when you need a team doctor.

106
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:12,567
Let's go together.

107
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh my.

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,800
What are you doing?

109
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,200
What are you doing?

110
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:22,500
Seriously, are you really going to do this?

111
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,767
Are you really leaving?

112
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:27,033

113
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:29,433
Hey!

114
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:40,900
Thank you.

115
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:45,967
Oh, you startled me.

116
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:48,533
Ma'am.

117
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:51,200
Why are you out here so early in the morning?

118
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,933
It's still cold outside.

119
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:55,800
Well, Ju Yeon hasn't come back yet.

120
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,567
Oh, l envy her.

121
00:07:57,567 --> 00:08:01,000
She must be relieved to have
her mom so worried about her.

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,867
Are you jealous of her?

123
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,733
Should I treat you like Ju Yeon?

124
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:07,533
Really?

125
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:08,967
Then that'd be so good.

126
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:12,300
This is the Korean style. It's affection.

127
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,233
Then I would feel relieved too.

128
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:16,433
Seung Hyun, go inside.

129
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:18,467
Hurry up.

130
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:21,067
Yes.

131
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,700
I treated you well because
you are my friend's daughter.

132
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,033
You stayed out all night
without saying anything?

133
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:32,667
Oh my, oh my, ma'am.

134
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,233
Do you think here is a guesthouse?

135
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:37,333
Coming in and leaving when you want!

136
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,033
If you're going to do that, leave right now!

137
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:41,900
- Why are you doing this? Please calm down.
- What?

138
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,867
Yesterday, you brought sweet potatoes,
and today you brought potatoes?

139
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:47,300
What are you doing outside?

140
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,133
You.

141
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:53,733
When I called your mom, she
didn't even know you were here.

142
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,400
Did you contact my mom?

143
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,000
You came to Korea and stayed out
all night without saying anything?

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,067
If you stay out once more!

145
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:05,000
I'll kick you out immediately.

146
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,100
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,467
Darn it.

148
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:17,700
I wonder if my mom told dad.

149
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,800
Are you surprised? Don't
you know taxis are fast?

150
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,167
Okay, I'll leave.

151
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:34,500
But, if I lose the bet, I'll leave.

152
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,467
- A bet?
- Let the player have the deciding power.

153
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:40,767
If the affiliated player
says she doesn't like me,

154
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:42,800
I won't bother you any further and will leave.

155
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,867
I never lost a bet.

156
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:48,500
Then, you will bet?

157
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,633
What if the player says no?

158
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:51,033
I'll leave without saying anything.

159
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:53,233
But, never change…

160
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:56,200
Deal is a deal.

161
00:09:57,267 --> 00:10:00,033
Who is the affiliated player?

162
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:06,033
I said I wouldn't do it. I said
I wouldn't do rehab or anything.

163
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,233
I'm a psychiatrist, Kyung
Ju Yeon from the agency.

164
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:28,967
I came to help you.

165
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,233
Player Si On.

166
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,767
Shall we sit down calmly and talk?

167
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:42,100
[Lee Goon]
This is Lee Gun. You are Si On's mother, right?

168
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:45,333
Little cutie is…

169
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:49,000
I was late in greeting you because
Si On said you were overseas.

170
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,533
Does it make any sense to be excluded
from the national team candidacy?

171
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:56,033
You said you were a former player.

172
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:58,467
Don't you know better than anyone
that it's not often that you get the chance

173
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:00,100
to go to an international competition

174
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,800
as a national representative
in an international competition?

175
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,533
Since the knee injury won't be problems
by the end of the national team game,

176
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:10,967
if she wants, I'll appeal to
the association and get tested.

177
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:15,300
I already made her take all the tests. Oh my.

178
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,333
Please don't worry too much
and just trust me and wait.

179
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,733
I will resolve things well
with the association.

180
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:23,000
Let's go.

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,033
Oh, Si On's mother.

182
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:27,367
You know that a contract without
the guardian's consent is void, right?

183
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,400
Let's go.

184
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:38,600
Have a drink of something nice.
What kind of business card is this?

185
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:45,167
Could you tell me about your
emotion that's making you cry now?

186
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:48,600
Why?

187
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,667
Think of me as a human diary,
and if you tell me everything,

188
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,667
you'll feel relieved.

189
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:55,800
A human diary?

190
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,433
Shall I tell you about the last diary I wrote?

191
00:11:58,433 --> 00:12:00,033
Title, love game.

192
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:03,867
I made an unforced error by missing
a down-the-line shot at a break point one.

193
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:06,467
After that, I only missed passing
shots, angle shots, and drop shots,

194
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:08,033
but then I lost the set
and started to collapse,

195
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:11,300
breaking the history of my love game.

196
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,800
I was in the top tier in the ITF,

197
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,467
but then started to fall behind in the KTA,

198
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:18,000
and now, I could not make
it to the national team.

199
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:21,600
Do you understand what I'm saying?

200
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,300
You're upset because you couldn't
make it to the national team, right?

201
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,433
You know what a love game is, right?

202
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:35,300
That's what they say when couples play tennis.

203
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,700
Right, that love game.

204
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,333
Yeah, I guess you're more upset
because you lost to your boyfriend.

205
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,367
From talking about boyfriends
to fighting between players.

206
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:47,367
Well, there can be discord within the team too.

207
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:51,567
I'll help you get through whatever it is.

208
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:53,433
So, shall we start the consultation?

209
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:56,300
But I don't have much time.

210
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,467
Maybe we can talk about it while
we're rehabilitating together.

211
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:03,567
Okay, well… What rehabilitation
should we receive first?

212
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,267
Excuse me, player Si On.

213
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:19,400
Player Cha Si On!

214
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,667
You didn't leave, right?

215
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:27,333
I thought you left, Player Si On.

216
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,933
Did you become closer with player Si On?

217
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:33,300
This is just the beginning.

218
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,833
Could you please put me down for now?

219
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:39,000
Do you know what this position is called?

220
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,833
To me, it looks like a Superman pose.

221
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,067
Stop talking nonsense and put me down now.

222
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:46,700
I've never seen this before
either. How do you do it?

223
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,167
I don't know how to use it.

224
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:50,700
Is it done like this?

225
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,200
I feel dizzy, stop it, just stop.

226
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,600
Put me down now, and stop joking around.

227
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:58,200
Professor Han.

228
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,800
What brings you here
at a non-consultation time?

229
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,400
Oh, it's good that you're here.

230
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,733
Could you and your family
please persuade your brother?

231
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:10,667
It's an emergency because
he got discharged overnight.

232
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:12,867
He doesn't listen to anyone.

233
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:17,333
And I can't exactly say that he's
in the middle of a clinical trial…

234
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:21,200
Fortunately, he doesn't seem
to dwell on the lost memories.

235
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,633
If memories of the past were to surface,

236
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:26,333
we don't know what effect it
might have on his brain circuits.

237
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:31,567
If even a small memory comes to
mind, it will come back like dominoes.

238
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:34,300
Will he remember everything?

239
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,467
I guess so.

240
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:46,900
Are you anxious?

241
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,100
Are you anxious about your brother
returning to his former self?

242
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:57,800
Everyone is satisfied with the present.

243
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,667
You've been taking
the medication regularly, right?

244
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:04,800
For panic disorder.

245
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
Yes.

246
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,967
It's not that I take medication
because it's become a routine,

247
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:12,700
but I get anxious when I don't take it.

248
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:14,800
But more importantly,

249
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,600
it seems like today is
Dr. Kyung Ju Yeon's day off?

250
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,900
She is busy, so there'll be a temporary
suspension of medical services.

251
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,400
Huh? Why, why?

252
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,167
Just give me her contact information.

253
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:31,033
- I have something to talk to her.
- Huh?

254
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:32,733
What are you going to do with it?

255
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:35,167
Why do you need the medical staff's contact?

256
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:40,067
I just thought we could grab a meal together.

257
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:42,867
Then would you like to
eat with me? That's great.

258
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:45,567
Today, I mean, actually today…

259
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:48,033
Goodbye, I'll get going.

260
00:15:56,667 --> 00:16:01,400
He's so clueless. I don't know how
he can figure out what I'm thinking.

261
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,767
Ah, I should've asked for
her number beforehand.

262
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:06,867
I know her neighborhood, though.

263
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:08,967
The neighborhood?

264
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:11,033
The neighborhood!

265
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:26,233
It has been reported stolen.

266
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,967
Mom told it to Dad.

267
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:34,233
Ms. Sae Yan, I'll just give you one of these.

268
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:36,367
It's on the house!

269
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:41,767
You're totally the country grandmother
type. I mean you're full of affection.

270
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:45,200
Ma'am, seriously!

271
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Thank you so much.

272
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,333
Oh my, drink it slowly.

273
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:56,033
Wow, you're really gulping it down.

274
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:58,200
Is that a special skill?

275
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,500
Hey, you.

276
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,800
You, Lee Shin!

277
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,733
Are you a stalker? You followed me, right?

278
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:06,767
No, I came here because I have stuff to do.

279
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,233
Maybe you are the one who knew I'd come here,

280
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:09,667
and came here in advance.

281
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:13,600
Why are you drinking a beer
with my picture displayed on it?

282
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,200
Well, that's because,

283
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,467
after I finish drinking it,
there is even this kind of fun.

284
00:17:21,467 --> 00:17:23,300
I wondered how you found me.

285
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,400
Did you come here after seeing the address
I told you to send the bracelet to?

286
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,767
Why? Because I rejected you,
do you still have feelings for me?

287
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:36,600
We went on three dates and drank
beer all the time, and then again?

288
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,600
All I remember is the beer tour
during the Italian game tour.

289
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,867
Wow, you seem to remember it all so vividly.

290
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:46,100
Give it up.

291
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,867
Since you hit me, this molar
over here really hurts.

292
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,767
That must be a wisdom tooth.

293
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:53,400
So, can you stop your unrequited love for me?

294
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,200
If you keep doing this,
I'll report it to the reporter.

295
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,467
No.

296
00:17:57,467 --> 00:18:02,333
Now that my dad knows I'm in Korea,
there might be someone following me.

297
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,833
It would be better to be careful.

298
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:09,933
Unless you want to be quietly buried
under the artificial turf of the tennis court.

299
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:14,000
Since you'll never see me again,
look whenever you want.

300
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,000
Let's never see each other again.

301
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,767
I want that too.

302
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,933
Oh my, they are exactly the same.

303
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:31,600
Both the athlete and the CEO.

304
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:34,400
You have had a hard time.

305
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,767
Well… you had an argument
with the hospital director too?

306
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:43,867
I heard you didn't go against it, either.

307
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:45,133
Well…

308
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:49,033
That… I found out late too.

309
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:53,400
The hospital director and Te O
colluded and to our subject…

310
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,867
It's not that I couldn't refute because
I was afraid of the hospital director.

311
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,700
It's the test data examined by the neurosurgery
department without our knowledge. Take a look.

312
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,133
By erasing bad memories,

313
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:15,933
the medial prefrontal cortex was overactivated.

314
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:19,233
Whenever questions related
to the first love are asked,

315
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:22,200
the results are inconsistent.

316
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,700
Does that mean his self-esteem
went down every time I rejected him?

317
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,033
I'll keep an eye on the hospital.

318
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,667
You manage the subject well.

319
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:33,400
Does this mean they are going
to do something to the subject?

320
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,200
No, of course, they won't go that far.

321
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,967
Under the pretext of a new surgical
method rather than a simple clinical trial,

322
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:45,600
how can we know what experiments
the neurosurgery department will do?

323
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,267
I will protect my patient.

324
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,700
Oh my.

325
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,733
Oh?

326
00:19:55,267 --> 00:19:57,500
Now that I think about it, it's already…

327
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,633
Wow, time flies.

328
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:03,367
Professor, do you have time today?

329
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:05,800
Huh? Oh, yes, I do.

330
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,400
I mean, I don't have a wife or kids, so…

331
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,767
I have time!

332
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:11,467
That's good.

333
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:14,567
Then, please tell me some
tips for counseling athletes.

334
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:15,967
Like a know-how.

335
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:18,400
- What?
- Yes.

336
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:31,800
Figure it out yourself.

337
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,133
I was startled.

338
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:39,600
- It's today, right?
- Yes.

339
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:42,433
Why are you giving her money?

340
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:44,667
Are you planning to buy something?

341
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:45,667
That's…

342
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:48,033
Actually,

343
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:53,533
I feel a bit strange saying this to you.

344
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:57,033
Oh my, alright, enough.

345
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:59,800
That's not even necessary.

346
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,033
We also need to take care of camaraderie.

347
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:05,700
We decided to pool the money.

348
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,000
Because today is the day
for the money pool payout.

349
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:11,267
Oh my, why are you gathering it at this hour?

350
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:13,267
Go and do your work!

351
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:15,200
Ah, camaraderie?

352
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,633
I bluntly wrote that it's my birthday on SNS.

353
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,533
Dr. Song, do you have a phone charger?

354
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:26,500
Ah, I don't have a charger.

355
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:35,467
Dr. Te O.

356
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:37,367
Dr. Te O, do you have a phone charger…

357
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:40,233
No, it's okay.

358
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,100
Be quiet, be quiet.

359
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,867
I said be quiet.

360
00:21:47,867 --> 00:21:50,200
Sit down, no, that's lying down.

361
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Sit, like this, sit like this.

362
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,600
Turn around, turn around.

363
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
Like this, turn around like this.

364
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,800
Can't you do this? Show me your hand.

365
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,867
Huh? You did it…

366
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:06,700
Why do you keep stressing out
the one who doesn't understand anything?

367
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,533
He understood everything, but
he's just pretending not to hear.

368
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:11,967
Cola, you don't have to do such things.

369
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:16,000
You can live freely the way you want to.

370
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,667
Oh, you startled me.

371
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:20,667
Should I also tell you that you're cute?

372
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:23,900
Why do you keep sitting on my lap?

373
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,133
Oh.

374
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:29,100
Okay, today's menu is boiled pork.

375
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,833
I don't eat meat that's been boiled in water.

376
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,000
Even now?

377
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,367
What?

378
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:36,600
No, I know, I know.

379
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,533
I knew that already, so I prepared pork belly.

380
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:40,700
Let's eat pork belly.

381
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,900
Okay, Dad.

382
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,000
- Alright.
- Alright.

383
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,567
Alright, let's eat, let's eat.

384
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:46,867
Thank you for the meal.

385
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,933
Thank you for the meal.

386
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:52,533
- It's delicious, right?
- Yes.

387
00:22:52,533 --> 00:22:56,200
You shouldn't stare when someone
else is counting money or eating.

388
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,900
Cola.

389
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,000
You have gained too much weight recently.

390
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,600
Eat diet feed later, okay?

391
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,433
Shin, did you hear about
the national team coach?

392
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:09,433
Ah, they said he's a foreigner.

393
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:10,900
A foreigner?

394
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,833
Let's meet him together when
you meet the general director.

395
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:14,867
Why?

396
00:23:14,867 --> 00:23:17,633
Because you'll gain weight as soon
as you enter the athletes' village.

397
00:23:17,633 --> 00:23:20,267
You should tell them in advance
that you're managing your diet.

398
00:23:20,267 --> 00:23:22,633
I can't go chasing after you and keep watch.

399
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:26,133
Ah, I know the experts would take care of it.

400
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:31,033
But I'll contact the agency
and tell them to do it right.

401
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:32,967
Have your meal.

402
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:34,000
Okay, I got it.

403
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,400
I'll eat the broccoli.

404
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,800
Yes, eat the spinach too.

405
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,367
You said you wouldn't eat meat that was boiled.

406
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:44,467
You're eating well.

407
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:48,167
I think I should go now.

408
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:51,133
It's good that you are doing business,

409
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:52,967
but do you really have to live there too?

410
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:55,033
Would it be better if you worked from home?

411
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:59,300
Yeah, someone might think you've
got a woman hidden in your office.

412
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,333
Ah, what are you talking about right now?

413
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,867
Is now the time for me to fall for a woman?

414
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,767
Why? Oh dear.

415
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:14,167
In front of your first love then,

416
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:18,633
you used to say, "Isn't she eating so lovely?"

417
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:20,967
First love? What first love?

418
00:24:20,967 --> 00:24:22,933
Did you have a woman you liked too?

419
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:25,367
Lee Goon has a first love?

420
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:27,133
I was mistaken.

421
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:30,300
Now that I look, the way
she eats isn't lovely at all.

422
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,633
He got dumped.

423
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:33,967
Is she pretty?

424
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:36,133
Yes.

425
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,867
First love is just a thing of the past.

426
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:41,600
I'd rather you not mention
my first love anymore.

427
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,167
Fine, let's say you got dumped.

428
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,567
- He got dumped.
- Did he really get dumped?

429
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:51,133
Ah, right, where's my suitcase?

430
00:24:51,133 --> 00:24:53,000
- I threw it out.
- I sent it for service.

431
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,567
Ah, I sent it for service
and then threw it out.

432
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:56,600
You threw it away?

433
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,967
Oh, they said it couldn't be serviced.

434
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:02,733
But that was something I cherished.

435
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:05,833
Just buy a new one. It doesn't cost that much.

436
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,233
I got it.

437
00:25:10,233 --> 00:25:11,767
Enjoy your meal.

438
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:15,867
Goon, you've got to finish
your meal before you go.

439
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,300
Why is he…

440
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,633
Is your first love pretty?

441
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:21,900
How did you get rejected?

442
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,667
Lee Goon really got rejected.

443
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:29,300
We're now just acquaintances who met
through work, so it's not a first love thing.

444
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,533
You brought your first love into the workplace?

445
00:25:31,533 --> 00:25:34,400
It's so heartbreaking.

446
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,000
Would you like me to tell you
a secret to change her mind?

447
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,633
I can help you.

448
00:25:38,633 --> 00:25:41,067
Oh, right.

449
00:25:41,067 --> 00:25:44,100
That day, the day I had the accident,

450
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,933
did I just stay at home that day?

451
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:48,267
You said I fell down the stairs.

452
00:25:48,267 --> 00:25:53,367
Well, you slept all day at home and fell
down the stairs because you weren't awake.

453
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:58,433
The accident happened when the family was
all together, so you were discovered quickly.

454
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,033
But why are you asking that?

455
00:26:01,033 --> 00:26:05,267
It's not like you're remembering
old memories or anything, right?

456
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:07,667
Not yet.

457
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,933
Yes.

480

Ju Yeon, just lend me ten thousand won

to buy four cans of these beers.

482

This works much better
than a sleeping pill at night.

483
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:30,267
That's alcohol dependency.

484
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:37,467
It'd be nice to have something to depend
on when there's no one to rely on, right?

00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,100
Did I?

492
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,267
Yes.

493
00:29:57,267 --> 00:29:59,167
This is a wish bracelet.

494
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:01,733
You said if I wear this and then
it breaks, my wishes come true.

495
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,267
You said to wear it when I
have a wish I want to make.

496
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:07,867
Do you still believe that?
You're not a kid anymore.

497
00:30:07,867 --> 00:30:10,000
I saved it without using it
for just any wish, and then,

498
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,833
I took it out with a big decision.

499
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:14,400
It's not about making a wish,
but about making an effort.

500
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,133
If you don't make an effort
but only make wishes, who will…

501
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:23,067
Well, there are things that don't
come true even with effort.

Where would we even go?

510
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:58,633
Ah, this is why you don't usually drink much.

511
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:02,967
I had just one wish in my life.

512
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:05,600
So I studied to death to achieve it

513
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,733
and I devoted six years to do the research.

514
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:12,300
Far from having my wish come true,

515
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,133
I feel so empty inside, just like this.

516
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,200
What? Is the glass leaking?

517
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,100
Still, you are doing well for yourself,
given all the studying you did.

518
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,133
Wasn't that your wish?

519
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:24,267
It's all about the process
for the wish, the process.

520
00:31:24,267 --> 00:31:27,467
Do you know how lonely

521
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:28,800

522
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,367
How precisely must a wish be crafted.

523
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:35,133
Because I pursued perfection,

524
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:38,500
even my coworkers don't
want to have lunch with me.

00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,567

526
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:43,600
I was taken advantage of by a senior I trusted.

527
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,433
And then,

528
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:51,367
I was abandoned by the only patient
I was wholeheartedly committed to.

529
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,267
I'm envious of you.

530
00:31:53,267 --> 00:31:55,867
It would be nice if we
were born swapped, right?

531
00:31:55,867 --> 00:31:59,533
I envy you, Jeon Sae Yan.

532
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:02,433
Everyone likes you.

533

Grew up without the twists and turns of life,

534
00:32:04,867 --> 00:32:09,900
and grew up with plenty of
love without any worries,

535
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,200
without concerns…

536
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:16,267
I envy you.

537
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:22,900
You really don't remember anything, right?

538
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:26,700
What you see isn't everything.

539
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,933
I can't see anything.

540
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,433
I'm not going. I won't go!

541
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:41,900
The boss told me to bring you back.

542
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,767
Tell them I'll return after work.

543
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:47,467
I don't have options.

544
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,600
I said I'm not going!

545
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,067
- You rascal!
- Oh, you startled me.

546
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:55,200
Come over here.

547
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,433
If you came here for a trip, you
should have fun and then go.

548
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:02,133
Get lost! Go! You little brat, go.

549
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:03,367
- Interpret it.
- Uh, well…

550
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:04,467
Interpret it now!

551
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:07,167
I'll call my dad myself.

552
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:12,433
If you don't keep the promise, next
time I'll take you no matter what.

553
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:17,033
He said he's sorry and asked you to forgive
him just once. He said he would go right now.

554
00:33:17,033 --> 00:33:20,567
- He got scared.
- Yes.

555
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:22,600
Go!

556
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:31,667
The self-defense you taught
me in Italy, I did it well, right?

557
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:36,633
If you touch her, I won't stay still!

558
00:33:36,633 --> 00:33:39,100
I'll keep an eye on it.

559
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,167
Are you okay?

560
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:46,333
Of course.

561
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:48,500
- We have to go.
- Where are we going?

562
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,367
- We should go to the fourth round.
- No.

563
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:55,000
What are you talking about?
This is the fourth round now.

564
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:11,333
That's wrong.

565
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:15,167
That man knows me.

566
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:18,100
Can't go in, can't go in.

567
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,200
I can't help but wait here.

Ju Yeon.

569
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,033
I want to go back again.

There's no van.

572
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:56,033
He hasn't come back yet.

573
00:34:56,033 --> 00:35:00,133
I'll have to wait here until he arrives.

574
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:02,333
Ju Yeon, it's too late now.

575
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:05,300
Let's come here again early
tomorrow morning, okay?

576
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,800
Ju Yeon, you're drunk now.

577
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,633
Drunk?

578
00:35:10,633 --> 00:35:12,233
Me?

579
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:15,833
Me? I'm not drunk. I'm totally sober now.

580
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:18,433
Go ahead.

581
00:35:19,533 --> 00:35:23,000
Really? But how can you leave like this?

582
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,600
If you don't go, I won't go, either.

583
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:28,167
Huh?

584
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:31,900

585
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,933
Ah, good.

586
00:35:32,933 --> 00:35:36,567
What are you doing? Get up now, please.

587
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,433
It's okay. I'll sleep without
washing up, just like this.

588
00:35:39,433 --> 00:35:42,567
What are you talking about? Get up now!

It's been a while since we lay down together.

593
00:36:01,067 --> 00:36:05,000
Okay, I will protect you.

594
00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:11,733
The pillow is hard.

595
00:36:11,733 --> 00:36:13,800
Of course.

00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:30,467
Of course, whose wish is it?

599
00:36:30,467 --> 00:36:36,533
Right, it's the stubborn

It's been nearly half a century
for me to devote only to research.

603
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:07,167
I treat the loneliness of the patients.

604
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:10,600
But who treats my loneliness?

605
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,867
Professor Han.

606
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:16,467
Professor Han.

607
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,500
Oh, why?

608
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,433
I called you several times,
but you didn't answer.

609
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:23,767
Gosh, this is heavy.

610
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:25,200
This is kimchi.

611
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,033
We made this kimchi at home and
also made some for you, professor.

612
00:37:29,033 --> 00:37:33,567
Dr. Song, why are you giving this
to me? Your family should eat this.

613
00:37:33,567 --> 00:37:36,533
Colleagues are like family too.

614
00:37:36,533 --> 00:37:39,533
You can't eat without kimchi, right?

615
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:41,467
I'm not sure if it'll suit your taste though.

616
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,000
Make sure to have it with your meals.

617
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,800
What else do we have
at our age? Health is the best.

618

Does she want to be family with me?

621

She even knows my taste.

622
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,533
Does she…

623
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,400
Does she like me?

00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:26,167
Yes, sir.

else's room? You must be crazy.

Your drinking habits are also the worst.

If it's a way to get rid of
affection, it's very successful.

That's fortunate.

Just a moment, wait.

00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,133
I should meet the investor first too.

00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:48,000

Please come in.

00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,067
You should drink some
herbal remedy to sober up.

663
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:28,333
I almost took the wrong
way while going to buy this.

664
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,667
I don't need things like this.

But I'm loyal to you, right?

666
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,133

embarrassed sleeping there alone.

Yes, I'm extremely grateful.

And you even covered me with the blanket.

669
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,900
Well, it was not quite hotel-grade,

670
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,200
but it was like the hotel parking lot.

671
00:41:59,233 --> 00:42:01,633

672
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:05,333
You go ahead.

673
00:42:09,433 --> 00:42:12,733
What is this smell?

674
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:16,233
Did you drink and stay out last night?

675
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:18,167
You must have braced
yourself to get in big trouble.

676
00:42:18,167 --> 00:42:19,933
- You've lost your mind.
- Mom.

677
00:42:19,933 --> 00:42:21,900
I had a really hard time.

678
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,933
- Get out.
- No.

679
00:42:22,933 --> 00:42:25,533
You little rascal, come here now.

680
00:42:35,067 --> 00:42:37,333
If you want to get an investment,

681
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:41,267
you'll need the contract of a star player.

682
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,967
The player Cha Si On has some issues,

683
00:42:42,967 --> 00:42:46,667
so we plan to finalize the contract
by the end of this week.

684
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:49,400
I heard that you're
the player Lee Shin's brother.

685
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:52,667
Ah, yes.

686
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:56,633
He's at the Big Picture Agency,
which you have invested in.

687
00:42:56,633 --> 00:42:57,967
I heard he's about to renew his contract.

688
00:42:57,967 --> 00:43:03,167
It's hard to gauge whether he'll
go to CEO Hong or to his brother.

689
00:43:07,867 --> 00:43:10,833
If you're going to take
a picture, take a good one.

690
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:13,833
What's with this face?

691
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:16,733
At least do some editing.

692
00:43:16,733 --> 00:43:19,200
Just took a picture without
the sender's info and sent it.

693
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,800
Would he or she have sent it to
the reporters without a message?

694
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,700
If it was sent, the reporters
would have contacted us first.

695
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,200
There's no need to worry.

696
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,067
You've become more lenient with
scandals, but will the sponsors be too?

697
00:43:28,067 --> 00:43:30,367
There's nothing to worry
about because I'm honest.

698
00:43:30,367 --> 00:43:33,067
Oh, I met her by chance…

699
00:43:36,067 --> 00:43:39,867
And if she was going to send it to
reporters, she wouldn't send it to me.

700
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:43,267
Who? Who sent it?

701
00:43:45,233 --> 00:43:47,467
She did.

702
00:43:47,467 --> 00:43:50,967
Her family is pretty influential.

703
00:43:50,967 --> 00:43:54,833
Her family is a gangster, so they warned me.

704
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:56,133
A warning?

705
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,000
I just need to make sure
not to run into her again.

706
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,033
Shred it without missing a single page.

707
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:04,700
I came here all nervous for
nothing when I'm busy.

708
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,167
I'm going to the practice room.

709
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:08,933
When are you going to
sign the renewal contract?

710
00:44:08,933 --> 00:44:11,467
You have to speak up if you need something.

711
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:17,633
Traitor.

712
00:44:17,633 --> 00:44:18,667
Where are you going?

713
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:21,067
To work, I can't give up.

714
00:44:21,067 --> 00:44:24,267
My wish is also desperately needed by someone.

715
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,333
Your hand.

716
00:44:38,733 --> 00:44:40,867
Why are you giving this to me?

717
00:44:40,867 --> 00:44:43,467
Let's make a wish with reverent hearts.

718
00:44:43,467 --> 00:44:45,733
Ah, it's fine. I'm not
a child. Take it off now.

719
00:44:45,733 --> 00:44:47,400
Oh, you shouldn't say that.

720
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,033
What's this in Korea?

721
00:44:49,033 --> 00:44:51,767
Take that back now.

722
00:44:51,767 --> 00:44:53,867
Take that back.

723
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:59,233
Please make her works go well.

724
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,467
What about your wishes?

725
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:06,600
You are more important to me than myself.

726
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,300
What was your wish?

727
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,467
I…

728
00:45:12,867 --> 00:45:14,767
I'll put aside my wish for a moment.

729
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:19,167
If you need anything, whether it's
love or work, tell me everything.

730
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:23,167
I'll help you with everything.

731
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,600
Even pufferfish have natural predators.

732
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,833
Only humans eat pufferfish
knowing the lethal dose of its poison.

733
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:36,067
Uniquely.

734
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:47,967
That's how venomous people
are, more than pufferfish venom.

735
00:45:47,967 --> 00:45:52,967
If there are no flaws, you have to find them.

736
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:55,067
Isn't that so?

737
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,800
It seems like this patient,
Lee Goon, likes me too.

738
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,100
After seeing us dating,

739
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,233
saying don't mess with his things.

740
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:18,267
He even punched you and
discharged himself from the hospital.

741
00:46:18,267 --> 00:46:20,067
That's about Kyung Ju Yeon.

742
00:46:20,067 --> 00:46:22,000
He said Kyung Ju Yeon was his first love.

743
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,133
He may want to challenge you.

744
00:46:25,133 --> 00:46:29,800
You should be nervous. Why do
you always come to this snack bar?

745
00:46:30,533 --> 00:46:35,700
I didn't realize it before, but
patient Lee Goon is handsome.

746
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,500
Is it really confidence that
makes someone attractive?

747
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,067
Before? You've seen that patient before?

748
00:46:41,067 --> 00:46:42,633
Yeah.

749
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,300
That… that's the person from back then.

750
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,767
The person who killed mouse number
107 with a car at the hospital.

751
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:50,733
- What?
- Oh.

752
00:46:50,733 --> 00:46:52,067
You weren't here, right?

753
00:46:52,067 --> 00:46:55,100
Back then, Dr. Kyung and that patient

754
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,233
seemed to be sworn enemies.

755
00:46:57,233 --> 00:47:00,800
And she suddenly became his first
love after he got the brain surgery.

756
00:47:01,467 --> 00:47:04,167
That's so nice.

757
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:06,433
I'm jealous of her.

758
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,067
[Tennis Training]

759
00:47:28,667 --> 00:47:29,967
'Love Game.'

760
00:47:29,967 --> 00:47:35,033
'A scenario in a tennis match where
one player fails to score any points'

761
00:47:35,033 --> 00:47:38,100
'and it means zero?'

762
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:41,300
Wasn't a love game a couples game?

763
00:47:43,267 --> 00:47:46,700
Ah, how embarrassing.

764
00:47:57,733 --> 00:48:00,633
- Please, charge this as well.
- Yes.

765
00:48:16,567 --> 00:48:18,767
Ju Yeon.

766
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:22,400
I didn't intend to interrupt.

767
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,533
Did you come to see me? I went to see you too.

768
00:48:25,533 --> 00:48:26,933
Ah, that…

769
00:48:26,933 --> 00:48:30,733
I'm trying to learn about
tennis for the consultation.

770
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:34,700
Are you perhaps offering to counsel me?

771
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,367
Player Cha Si On.

772
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,367
Cha Si On.

773
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:42,467
I read that book and kept
watching tennis broadcasts

774
00:48:42,467 --> 00:48:46,600
but I studied in a rush, so no matter how much
I read, I can't understand the rules well.

775
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,567
I did memorize quite a few words though.

776
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:55,167
Do you know what dating
and sports have in common?

777
00:48:55,867 --> 00:48:59,900
It's not done with the head, but with the body.

778
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,633
You remember it by doing it yourself.

779
00:49:02,633 --> 00:49:05,500
Otherwise, you might forget by tomorrow.

780
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,467
I've never tried it before.

781
00:49:09,467 --> 00:49:13,167
Wait a minute, just a moment.

782
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,867
Now.

783
00:49:21,867 --> 00:49:24,467
How do I do it?

784
00:49:28,567 --> 00:49:30,333
Like this, like this.

785
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:33,000
- Try holding it again.
- Okay, again.

786
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,633
Now, look.

787
00:49:34,633 --> 00:49:36,000
I'll count one, two, three.

788
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,133
One, two, three.

789
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:40,300
- Like this.
- Ah.

790
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,633
Okay, let's try again, just like this.

791
00:49:42,633 --> 00:49:46,167
One, two, three.

792
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:48,100
Is this right?

793
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,133
Well done.

794
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:52,133
Well done.

795
00:49:52,133 --> 00:49:54,733
Ah, then shall we try a backhand too?

796
00:49:54,733 --> 00:49:57,000
- Good.
- The backhand is the opposite way.

797
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,767
Okay, just like that.

798
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:02,567
- One, two, hit.
- Hit.

799
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:04,433
- Your arm comes up like this.
- Ah.

800
00:50:04,433 --> 00:50:06,233
Okay, I'll try it.

801
00:50:06,233 --> 00:50:09,333
One, two, three.

802
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:12,333
Is this right?

803
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:14,467
It was perfect.

804
00:50:14,467 --> 00:50:16,033
Now I get it.

805
00:50:16,033 --> 00:50:19,167
Alright, then let's try one forehand,
one backhand, in succession.

806
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:20,633
- In succession?
- Yes.

807
00:50:20,633 --> 00:50:22,967
- But…
- One, two, three.

808
00:50:24,467 --> 00:50:26,000
How was it? Was it correct?

809
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,300
It was perfect.

810
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,167
Ah, now I understand.

811
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:32,433
This is fun.

812
00:50:48,367 --> 00:50:49,700
Why are you here at this hour?

813
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,667
Surprise!

814
00:50:52,667 --> 00:50:55,333
My friend.

815
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:59,100
The time is… Hey, slippers, slippers!

816
00:50:59,867 --> 00:51:01,967
Wow.

817
00:51:01,967 --> 00:51:04,667
Hey, look at this place.

818
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:07,500
What? Why is this place so good?

819
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,433
'Agency Goon.'

820
00:51:10,433 --> 00:51:13,100
It's tremendous.

821
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,900
This is totally a hotel, a hotel.
Whose room is this?

822
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,733
Hey, this isn't a house, it's a company.

823
00:51:19,733 --> 00:51:20,767
A bedroom.

824
00:51:20,767 --> 00:51:22,767
But why are you here without contacting?

825
00:51:22,767 --> 00:51:25,600
Hey, I don't have to call before coming, right?

826
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,000
Here it is.

827
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,633
I'm going to look around a bit.

828
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:31,500
So this is my room.

829
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,433
- Why are you lying there?
- It's good, I like it.

830
00:51:36,167 --> 00:51:37,733
Ta-da.

831
00:51:37,733 --> 00:51:39,900
Ah, come out, come out.

832
00:51:46,067 --> 00:51:49,067
Somehow I thought it was strange.

833
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:50,067
What?

834
00:51:50,067 --> 00:51:54,867
You worked all night at the sports agency?

835
00:51:54,867 --> 00:51:56,533
What is this? What is this?

836
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:58,033
Huh? What's this?

837
00:51:58,033 --> 00:52:02,533
Give it back to me. This belongs to our team
doctor. No, it's the candidate team doctor's.

838
00:52:02,533 --> 00:52:04,900
A team doctor?

839
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,800
There's a team doctor in the agency?

840
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,900
But it seems the team doctor is a woman, right?

841
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,100
Well, I'll re-hire the team doctor.

842
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,233
A man I have no interest in at all.

843
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:20,233
Interest? Interest?

844
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:23,367
That means you have some interest in her.

845
00:52:23,367 --> 00:52:24,967
No, that's not it.

846
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:29,533
It's that person you met
at the hospital before… that…

847
00:52:29,533 --> 00:52:31,367
First…

848
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:33,900
First love.

849
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,167
It's her, but it's not working.

850
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:38,900
Even if I've sorted out my emotions now,

851
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,467
it could suddenly pop out like a virus carrier.

852
00:52:41,467 --> 00:52:44,267
So I'm trying to block it from the start.

853
00:52:44,267 --> 00:52:46,333
Hey, that's a good thought.

854
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:48,533
Send her out right now.

855
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:51,267
But why are you telling me to send her out?

856
00:52:51,267 --> 00:52:52,733
What?

857
00:52:52,733 --> 00:52:55,900
Well, I mean… There's no chance it'll go well.

858
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:59,133
Why would you insist on keeping
your first love by your side?

859
00:52:59,133 --> 00:53:01,433
Hey, well. I'll have to keep an eye on you.

860
00:53:01,433 --> 00:53:04,267
I'm going to take a shower,
so please get me a towel.

861
00:53:04,267 --> 00:53:07,300
Hey, hey, why are you going there?

862
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,033
I'm going to sleep over.

863
00:53:09,033 --> 00:53:11,233
What are you planning to
do after sending me away?

864
00:53:12,633 --> 00:53:14,167
Hey, hey, hey.

865
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:15,867
I said I'm going to sleep over.

866
00:53:15,867 --> 00:53:17,867
You are banned from visiting after 7 P.M.

867
00:53:17,867 --> 00:53:18,967
Oh, and,

868
00:53:18,967 --> 00:53:22,667
I heard you're a candidate for the national
coach, you're getting closer to success.

869
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:25,500
Congratulations, do it well.

870
00:53:26,767 --> 00:53:31,233
That…

871
00:53:31,233 --> 00:53:34,833
Wait, first love?

872
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
In the past, she had something with Shin.

873
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,700
I can't even tell him about this.

874
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,967
Shall I go?

875
00:53:43,967 --> 00:53:47,100
[Reserved]
Ah, yes, let's set off.

876
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,133
- Isn't that player Lee Shin?
- Player Lee Shin.

877
00:53:58,233 --> 00:54:00,167
Where is this place?

878
00:54:00,167 --> 00:54:02,400
Did you move?

879
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,433
No, there's a place I need to drop by.

880
00:54:06,433 --> 00:54:08,767
I'll go on my own from here.

881
00:54:08,767 --> 00:54:11,133
The expert even gave a one-on-one lesson.

882
00:54:11,133 --> 00:54:12,767
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

883
00:54:12,767 --> 00:54:16,667
Tomorrow, I have to go to the hospital
to consult with the player Cha Si On.

884
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:17,833
Medical test.

885
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:19,867
Just by chance!

886
00:54:19,867 --> 00:54:22,267
I'm going tomorrow too. How about tomorrow?

887
00:54:22,267 --> 00:54:24,333
What?

888
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:28,233
You said, "Let's have a meal together."
Was that just a passing remark?

889
00:54:28,233 --> 00:54:30,467
Why is everyone like that?

890
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:32,500
Promises must be kept.

891
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:35,733
Yes, yes, let's have lunch tomorrow.

892
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:48,233
Here.

893
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:56,367
Mine's out of battery, but…

894
00:54:58,267 --> 00:55:00,400
I'll go.

895
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:05,167
Is that bracelet in fashion?

896
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:07,933
Next lesson, we will play a game.

897
00:55:07,933 --> 00:55:11,567
A game with an active player?
It's obvious it will be a love game.

898
00:55:11,567 --> 00:55:13,133
Let's do that.

899
00:55:13,133 --> 00:55:14,767
Love game.

900
00:55:14,767 --> 00:55:16,833
Okay.

901
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:23,433
A very intense love game.

902
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:51,400
Yes.

903
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,267
Respect solely for the benefactor of life.

904
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:55,000
No, no.

905
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,067
Welfare for the prospective
employee candidate, yes.

906
00:55:59,667 --> 00:56:01,933
Oh, I'm a good person.

907
00:56:07,967 --> 00:56:10,233
Oh my, what's going on?

908
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,000
What's going on?

909
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,167
Oh my, oh my.

910
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:18,267
What's so good about that kind of woman?

911
00:56:18,267 --> 00:56:21,167
Look at that, look at that.

912
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:23,833
She keeps behaving indiscreetly like that.

913
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:25,533
It's driving me crazy.

914
00:56:25,533 --> 00:56:27,600
I want to

915
00:56:28,767 --> 00:56:29,767
keep helping her.

916
00:56:29,767 --> 00:56:31,233
Do you need some help?

917
00:56:31,233 --> 00:56:34,000
No, it's okay. I can do it myself.

918
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,067
Oh my, oh my.

919
00:56:35,067 --> 00:56:36,167
I'll help you.

920
00:56:36,167 --> 00:56:38,233
I said it's okay.

921
00:56:38,233 --> 00:56:40,667
Ah, yes.

922
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:48,167
But she is firm to all men, not just me.

923
00:56:49,867 --> 00:56:51,033
Geez.

924
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:53,367
Geez, oh my.

925
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,100
She has strong pride and bad drinking habits.

926
00:57:00,967 --> 00:57:03,967
Ugh, she's the worst.

927
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:53,567
Oh right, battery.

928
00:58:05,133 --> 00:58:07,200
Who are you?

929
00:58:13,733 --> 00:58:15,767
Hey!

930
00:58:25,933 --> 00:58:27,100
Oh?

931
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,833
You are the lady back then.

932
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:31,467
Why are you here again?

933
00:58:31,467 --> 00:58:34,600
Right, here…

934
00:58:55,867 --> 00:58:58,800
I came because I couldn't
properly apologize to Ju Yeon.

935
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,867
Sneaking up on her like
a cat burglar to apologize?

936
00:59:03,633 --> 00:59:06,000
Ah, nosebleed.

937
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:10,767
We made a deal that we'd date
once Ju Yeon returned from the U.K.

938
00:59:10,767 --> 00:59:13,400
But I ended up dating another researcher.

939
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,067
Ju Yeon firmly believes
she will go out with me.

940
00:59:16,067 --> 00:59:18,467
My girlfriend has no idea about this situation.

941
00:59:18,467 --> 00:59:22,467
I also had such a hard time
between the two women.

942
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:32,000
Even if it looks like I'm playing
a double game, isn't it a good thing?

943
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,933
Explain directly to
the person who was hurt by you.

944
00:59:35,933 --> 00:59:40,300
Why are you explaining all the details to me?

945
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,933
Since Ju Yeon is your first love,

946
00:59:42,933 --> 00:59:45,600
so it seems like you have animosity towards me.

947
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,000
And you're suddenly discharged after that day.

948
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,933
Well…

949
00:59:49,933 --> 00:59:54,967
If you are uncomfortable with me being your
primary doctor, I'll recommend another doctor.

950
00:59:58,633 --> 01:00:01,933
Surely, the primary doctor
knows my body the best.

951
01:00:02,467 --> 01:00:04,267
I will get the test done on time.

952
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,567
By the way,

953
01:00:06,567 --> 01:00:09,433
you said Ju Yeon was your first love.

954
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:15,033
Do you remember how you met
Ju Yeon when you were young?

955
01:00:15,033 --> 01:00:19,000
I was embarrassed because you
suddenly said that she was your first love.

956
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,500
I'm not sure why that's curious to you.

957
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:26,533
I don't want to take up my busy
time to play nostalgia with you.

958
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:28,967
Are you sure?

959
01:00:28,967 --> 01:00:31,767
That Ju Yeon is your first love?

960
01:00:31,767 --> 01:00:33,933
Are you sure?

961
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:47,300
Why is he ringing the bell?

962
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,633
He can just come in without doing that.

963
01:00:55,467 --> 01:00:57,800
Ta-da!

964
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,100
Why are you here?

965
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,067
Then you are

966
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:12,800
my brother's

967
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,867
first love?

968
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:24,600
Yes, she's my first love.

969
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:35,133
[CEO's Office]

970
01:02:04,733 --> 01:02:09,800
[Bad Memory Eraser]

971
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,867
Nice to meet you for the first time.

972
01:02:10,867 --> 01:02:12,333
Is he mad because I didn't tell him about it?

973
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:14,267
Are you scared that I'm
joining as the team doctor?

974
01:02:14,267 --> 01:02:16,500
It's just that I feel uncomfortable.

975
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,033
It's not like I'm working naked.

976
01:02:18,033 --> 01:02:21,267
Shin, do you want to live like everyone
else? Are you the only one sacrificing?

977
01:02:21,267 --> 01:02:23,467
Player Lee Shin, is there
really something going on?

978
01:02:23,467 --> 01:02:25,167
Who exactly are you looking for?

979
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:26,500
The person I love.

980
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,933
That person used to live here when I was young.

981
01:02:27,933 --> 01:02:29,133
Have you fallen for me?

982
01:02:29,133 --> 01:02:31,300
Then, I might end up really liking you again.

983
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,233
That's all I can do for you.

984
01:02:33,233 --> 01:02:35,267
I've brought an interpreter,
and where should I take her?

985
01:02:35,267 --> 01:02:37,500
This was the place in that memory.

986
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,100
You can't be by his side.

987
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:42,567
Please don't give Goon trouble
anymore and just leave.
