00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:17,333
it would be better to give him
some time to think on his own.

181
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:34,400
When I turned around,

182
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,600
my brother had already fallen into the water.

183
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:45,433
I immediately ran down the bridge

184
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:48,233
and called 911.

185
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,333
According to the paramedic log,

186
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:57,367
he was already saved just
before the paramedics arrived.

187
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:01,300
After I rescued him, the paramedics arrived and

188
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,300
he underwent CPR and had surgery
for a traumatic brain hemorrhage.

189
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,133
Even if

190
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:10,933
he is your elder brother,
it's not easy to do that,

191
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:12,733
but you did a great job.

192
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,767
Oh, yes.

193
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:20,367
But is that possible
because you are an athlete?

194
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:22,433
It would be impossible to save someone

195
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:26,000
who fell from a bridge
in that short amount of time.

196
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:42,067
Hello, I'm the president
of player Lee Shin's agency.

197
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:45,133
I came today as a lawyer.

198
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:47,167
Oh, yes.

199
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,467
We don't plan on making this matter public.

200
00:12:56,733 --> 00:13:01,300
Shin doesn't want his family to be
embarrassed because of his fame.

201
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,933
I'd like to ask you to take care to prevent
this incident from being leaked to the outside.

202
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:08,667
Oh, and you know that our Shin will be
representing the country next month, right?

203
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:13,133
If the game is ruined due to psychological
discomfort caused by this incident,

204
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:17,067
wouldn't the police officers
become traitors to the nation?

205
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:20,533
Don't make a fuss, you know?

206
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,267
You're not using this incident

207
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:32,933
as an excuse to renew my contract, right?

208
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:34,733
Who do you think I am?

209
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:39,267
Renewing the contract is your choice.

210
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:41,833
But,

211
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:46,900
rumors tend to spread from the closest people.

212
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:49,533
Let's go.

213
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:53,933
Since you have to manage
the diet, eat uncooked tofu.

214
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:25,967
The side effects of surgery are
a secret between you and me.

215
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:27,800
Don't tell about it to Te O, either.

216
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,833
Te O is on the same team, but how could I…

217
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,500
Only until the cause is found.

218
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,067
Don't trust anyone, and don't tell anyone!

219
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:42,733
Yeah, if something goes wrong,
I can't hold Te O responsible

220
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:46,267
Wait, that will help us with
our tracking experiments.

221
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:47,400
Right?

222
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,800
Even now, we're having a hard time
because of unpredictable subjects.

223
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,400
But, the doctor is the subject's first love?

224
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,033
Wouldn't he be cooperative?

225
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:56,867
That's good.

226
00:14:56,867 --> 00:14:59,333
Oh, Kyung Ju Yeon. You are capable.

227
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,500
This is a chance, a chance.

228
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,533
Yeah.

229
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:08,767
Oh? You carry a key ring well.

230
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:11,900
You know I chose this with great care, right?

231
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,233
I always carry this with me.

232
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:17,533
Because it was my first
birthday present from you.

233
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:23,367
Even though this looks cheap,

234
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:27,867
I chose it with you in mind while
I was busy with the Paris conference.

235
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:32,267
Ah, the smell of metal.

236
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,700
I can't smell anything.

237
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,633
I wear this all the time too.
I have a metal allergy.

238
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:40,967
It's a gold!

239
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:43,533
- Couple items.
- Couple items.

240
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,933
The Eiffel Tower is really pretty.

241
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:47,700
Oh, are you alright?

242
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,867
Who did that!

243
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:57,400
Oh my.

244
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:21,933
What is this?

245
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:26,067
Isn't this the Menbosha that Chef
Lee Yeon Bok personally made?

246
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:30,500
They say shrimp melts in my mouth, right?

247
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,400
Isn't this the pork cutlet that Chef
Paik Jong Won recommended?

248
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,600
I heard it came by plane from Jeju Island.

249
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,433
It came by plane from Jeju Island.

250
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:43,767
Hey… Hey! You…

251
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:46,700
Are you melting?

252
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,867
Mango shaved ice dessert made
with Hawaiian apple mango.

253
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:51,500
This is such a shame.

254
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,133
People should go on a date
at a restaurant like this.

255
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:58,267
Not in a hospital cafeteria
that smells like disinfectant.

256
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:03,667
Te O, let's eat deliciously too…

257
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:07,933
Would you like me to have a bite?

258
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:10,867
What should I eat first?

259
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,067
It's melting, it's melting.

260
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:19,833
Lee Goon, how are you feeling?

261
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,667
I'm feeling bad.

262
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,133
It'll get better soon.

263
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:31,900
This is a delicious restaurant.

264
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,800
Ju Yeon, you should come and eat some.
It's a waste if there's food left over.

265
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,367
I'll go first.

266
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,700
What are you doing?

267
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,867
Are you… okay?

268
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:00,767
- With this…
- I can just go to the bathroom and clean it.

269
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:03,333
But, it's…

270
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,533
Oh, it's an emergency patient.

271
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:07,333
I haven't eaten it all.

272
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:11,033
Ju Yeon, buy me coffee later.

273
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:13,200
Yes.

274
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:18,033
You look sad.

275
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:21,300
Why can't you say anything to that guy

276
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,400
but being so mean to me?

277
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,633
Then please stop acting like that.

278
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:29,433
Because I already have someone I like.

279
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:31,167
Does the goal not go in just
because there's a goalkeeper?

280
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,700
Yes, the goal won't be scored.

281
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,567
Even if a goal is scored,
the goalkeeper doesn't change.

282
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:36,700
- Even if I score 10 goals?
- Yes. Even if you score 10 goals.

283
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,267
If I score 10 goals, the coach will change.

284
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:40,333
The new coach is planning to
change the goalkeeper.

285
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,633
Won't change.

286
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:42,733
I'm an impregnable woman.

287
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:45,500
I'm a straightforward guy.

288
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,200
[Observation Subject No. 1]

289
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:56,067
I'm on a date with Te O for the first time
in a while, but why is he here, seriously?

290
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:58,633
I'm no good with his type.

291
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:01,367
Well, it was like that from the beginning.

292
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:04,733
It's hard to pretend to be his first love
when it starts off as a bad relationship,

293
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:07,700
but I also have to act like a lifesaver.

294
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,567
But,

295
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:16,267
he fell into water when he was little?

296
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:19,400
Then he must have had trauma
from falling into water.

297
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,100
Why did he jump into the water again?

298
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:35,633
Okay, nice.

299
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,333
One.

300
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,600
A little faster.

301
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:41,767
- Faster.
- Shin.

302
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:44,467
You have to swing all the way through.

303
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:47,533
Shin, you have to move your feet.

304
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,733
Bend your knees further.

305
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:52,433
Bend your knees further! One, two!

306
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:54,800
Oh, honey. Shh!

307
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,467
- Oh my.
- He's doing his best.

308
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,300
Shall we take a 10-minute break?

309
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,367
Yes.

310
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:08,133
You came?

311
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:09,533
Oh, president.

312
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:11,567
Yes.

313
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:17,233
Did you go to the police station with him?

314
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,667
Honey, relax. Leave it to me.

315
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:24,600
Listen to me.

316
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,533
The competition schedule is full
starting tomorrow, a day like today.

317
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:32,900
I've had a good conversation
with the police officers.

318
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,633
I strongly urged him not
to say anything after that.

319
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,733
You should have called us before investigating.

320
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:39,800
Oh, I really don't like it.

321
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,933
Honey, relax. Leave it to me.

322
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:45,367
President.

323
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:47,267
You can't just leave while we are talking.

324
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:49,400
Next time, tell me in advance…

325
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,867
What are you doing? Signing a ball?

326
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:55,900
Did you just make him do this?

327
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,767
No, Shin asked for these new balls.

328
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:02,833
Guk Bong is an after-school teacher.

329
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,500
It's a day when I go to Guk Bong's
work and mentor him for a day.

330
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,400
For those kids who want to be tennis players…

331
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,500
What?

332
00:21:11,033 --> 00:21:14,133
Did you know this?

333
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:16,300
What?

334
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,633
Honey, you know the donation of talent, right?

335
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,633
What are you talking about?

336
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:27,700
You know he has a match tomorrow, right?

337
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,567
Why do you make his schedule like this?

338
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:33,333
You checked his condition earlier, right?

339
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,600
That's a good thing, though…

340
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Put off that schedule until later.

341
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,933
See.

342
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:41,667
You have to do the PT you missed
today in the remaining time.

343
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,133
Since there is a game tomorrow,
he has a tight schedule today,

344
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:47,767
including going to the hospital,
mental coaching, and sports massage.

345
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:51,800
Hello, yes.

346
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,200
Yes, yes. Thank you.

347
00:21:56,433 --> 00:21:59,667
Honey.

348
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:05,433
You guys treat me rudely at home. I asked
you to save some face in front of others.

349
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:07,567
And your hands, your hands!

350
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:10,067
Did you forget that you used
to be a volleyball player?

351
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:12,467
With that hand like Thor's hammer.

352
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:15,100
That's kind of attempted murder.

353
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,833
And all day long,

354
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:21,333
I make sacrifices like this
to make Shin the best player.

355
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:27,533
Salute!

356
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:31,667
I'll go after all my schedules and
have some time left, Mother.

357
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:35,000
Don't worry.

358
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,367
Don't be mad.

359
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:39,567
Yeah, my son.

360
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,633
- Honey.
- Dad.

361
00:22:44,633 --> 00:22:47,000
- Don't be mad, Dad.
- Oh, go to your mom.

362
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,967
Honey, I'm sorry for hitting you.

363
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:52,033
Calm yourself down.

364
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:56,133
I was fooled back then,
so I just said I wouldn't drink.

365
00:22:56,133 --> 00:23:00,033
You told me to just trust you.

366
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:03,133
Why did I drink alcohol back then?

367
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,067
Seok.

368
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,400
Come here.

369
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:13,467
Seok.

370
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:23,000
It was really hurt.

371
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,467
Let's do it well.

372
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:29,333
Coach, let's get started right away.

373
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,900
Guys.

374
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,867
I've seen

375
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:37,833
Shin since he was young.

376
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,733
I'm an after-school teacher now,

377
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:44,767
but when I was younger,
I was a very promising athlete.

378
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:48,900
Would you like to get an autograph
from the player Lee Shin later?

379
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,967
- Me.
- Me.

380
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:52,367
Oh, guys.

381
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:56,200
Since I'm in a good mood,
I'll buy you some pizza later.

382
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,733
Thank you.

383
00:24:43,633 --> 00:24:45,267
Alright, guys.

384
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:49,167
I am here.

385
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:53,833
I heard that this is where I worked.

386
00:24:58,867 --> 00:25:01,033
Yeah, good. Over there.

387
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,533
This way too.

388
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,733
That's very nice.

389
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:10,367
Who is this?

390
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:15,033
I thought you quit work because
you were absent without notice.

391
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,600
Oh my.

392
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:24,867
Yes, please feel free to eat.

393
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:27,100
It's okay.

394
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,967
I'll tell you straightly.

395
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:37,033
Shin said you were sick.

396
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:39,500
Did you hurt your head?

397
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,167
To be blunt, I ask you to take
good care of me in the future.

398
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:51,167
Even though I lost my memory, I don't think
I lost my excellent analytical skills.

399
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:56,367
I'm willing to donate my
talent to this company.

400
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:04,100
He saved you, but it looks
like you hurt your head.

401
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,800
Is this why he told me
not to publish the article?

402
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,400
[Cha Si On]

403
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,433
Oh, Cha Si On. Youngster.

404
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:12,467
Okay, then.

405
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:15,967
Take care of your agency, and I'll leave.

406
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,233
Okay, let's see what you can do.

407
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:25,467
If you win the Cha Si On's contract,

408
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:28,267
I'll guarantee your employment
for life. How about that?

409
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:36,267
For some reason, I hate him.
I don't want to see him.

410
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:40,600
Who saves whom?

411
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:47,033
I clearly said I fell down the stairs.

412
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:51,967
Anyway, I don't like him.

413
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:08,833
No way, again?

414
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:11,267
Oh, Lee Goon!

415
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:15,000
What is it?

416
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,233
Have you finished filling out the test paper?

417
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:23,333
I was really sleepy.

418
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:31,767
Yes, take some rest.

419
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:36,033
I'll take you there. Let's go.

420
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,467
Yes.

421
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:51,367
Why are you being so kind today?

422
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,667
Does Dr. Te O have a girlfriend?

423
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:59,200
I don't know.

424
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,667
Why? Are you interested in him?

425
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:05,400
Yes, I'm interested in him, but I
don't want to be interested in him.

426
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:09,533
Stop, stop!

427
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:12,667
What is that Eiffel Tower thing?

428
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:17,267
This one?

429
00:28:17,267 --> 00:28:19,900
This is what Dr. Te O bought
us when he came back from

430
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,900
a business trip to Paris last year.

431
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,733
He didn't give it to me right away,

432
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:29,733
but he gave it to me on my birthday,
saying, 'I'm giving it to you only.'

433
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:32,133
He gave it to everyone?

434
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:35,133
All of our lab members received it,

435
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:38,233
and there were some patients
who received them from him too.

436
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:41,233
That's something like 20 for 10 dollars.

437
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:45,000
Te O is originally a bit stingy.

438
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,133
He probably wouldn't spend a
penny even if he got a girlfriend.

439
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:51,867
That's what it was.

440
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:54,700
Lee Goon, how are you feeling?

441
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,200
Not good.

442
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,533
Achoo, frugaller.

443
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,700
Oh, frugaller.

444
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,100
Dr. Kim?

445
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,433
Yeah, we need to get some advice

446
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:13,500
on how to reverse the side effects.

447
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,133
If we consult with neurosurgery department,
it's obvious the director will know it.

448
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:20,733
When it comes to brain science,
no one can match Dr. Kim.

449
00:29:20,733 --> 00:29:22,767
I can trust Dr. Kim.

450
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:26,800
I hope it gets resolved quickly
so I can focus on my thesis.

451
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,100
Professor, please don't worry
about patients with reservations.

452
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,100
Yes.

453
00:29:33,867 --> 00:29:38,233
Once the side effects are resolved,
the troublesome role of first love will end.

454
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:43,000
From now on, there will only
be good days with Te O, right?

455
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:49,667
Why is that car moving
like that in the hospital?

456
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:22,233
Hey, don't you know this is a hospital?

457
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:25,100
It's dangerous.

458
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,067
First, the accident-inducing ball game.

459
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:30,967
Second, violating the vehicle speed
limit. Third, even running at full speed.

460
00:30:30,967 --> 00:30:33,967
Okay. Throw me the ball, quickly, quickly.

461
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:36,100
Pass, pass, pass.

462
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,033
Oh, the balls.

463
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:49,033
Please pick up the balls.
Those are important balls.

464
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:52,700
Wait.

465
00:30:57,533 --> 00:30:59,733
Stay there, freeze!

466
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,233
It's a ball.

467
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:09,833
Oh, that was close.

468
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:11,767
Oh, Dr. Kyung.

469
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:15,467
What are you doing here? Do you need help?

470
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:19,333
It's okay. It's part of the treatment process.

471
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:20,667
See you at your next appointment.

472
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:23,667
Oh, please continue with the treatment.

473
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:27,300
Then, I'll go.

474
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:38,733
Don't look at me. Please just pass by.

475
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:40,067
Dr. Kyung?

476
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:41,733
Dr. Kyung?

477
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,733
What are you doing here?

478
00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:47,500
I'm stretching.

479
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,433
Here?

480
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:52,333
Professor Han is out of the office today,
so you have to see all the patients

481
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,267
who have appointments.

482
00:31:54,267 --> 00:31:57,433
When you're done stretching, please stand up.

483
00:31:57,433 --> 00:31:59,233
Ju Yeon, are you okay?

484
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:01,333
- Oh my.
- Oh.

485
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,367
Why are you doing this on the street?

486
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:04,567
Oh, here…

487
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,167
Quickly sort it out…

488
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,533
Are you monitoring the patient Lee Goon well?

489
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:22,567
Yes.

490
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:24,667
Did you check the condition of the mouse 109?

491
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,867
Yes, sure.

492
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:30,433
I'll go to the office.

493
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,000
[Guk Bong]

494
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:38,267
I'll go.

495
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:40,567
You guys, take care.

496
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:44,900
Please answer the phone.

497
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:48,167
Oh my.

498
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,767
Sir, when will Shin come?

499
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:52,667
Right.

500
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:55,267
Yes, Shin.

501
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:57,800
Are you coming here?

502
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:03,767
30 minutes? Yes, okay.

503
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:06,167
Guys.

504
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:08,067
Player Lee Shin is coming here.

505
00:33:08,067 --> 00:33:10,200
- Yes.
- Really?

506
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:25,367
The balls.

507
00:33:34,867 --> 00:33:39,133
I've never seen a woman lay down for me.

508
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:40,333
I have nothing to give you.

509
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:42,900
I don't want your autographed ball.

510
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:49,167
To relieve your fatigue…

511
00:33:49,933 --> 00:33:51,167
That's fine.

512
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:54,533
I've already developed a tolerance to tonics,
so they don't even relieve my fatigue.

513
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:55,967
No.

514
00:33:55,967 --> 00:34:00,300
Look at my face here and relieve your fatigue.

515
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:06,167
I have a consultation, goodbye.

516
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:08,433
Well,

517
00:34:08,433 --> 00:34:11,667
I am that patient today.

518
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:15,367
Oh, Professor Han went
on a business trip today.

519
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,700
Doctor.

520
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,967
Can I leave early today?

521
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:26,267
Do you think this is school?

522
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,100
I really need to go to school.

523
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,033
Please keep it a secret from my mom and coach,

524
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:35,300
and just give me a prescription please.

525
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,667
I'm a doctor, not a mind reader.

526
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:40,800
There is no prescription without treatment.

527
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:51,500
I really don't have time today
because I have something to do.

528
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,533
I really need the medicine because
there is a competition tomorrow.

529
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:56,567
Then, shall we begin the consultation?

530
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:58,900
Oh, just a moment.

531
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,133
This is it, right?

532
00:35:04,133 --> 00:35:06,133
That… That dog that drools
when someone rings the bell?

533
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:08,100
Whose dog was it?

534
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,767

00:48:51,567 --> 00:48:52,900
Are you her spokesperson?

715
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,167
Anyway, since I'm in Korea, I'm planning
to stay at your house for a month.

716
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:58,067
You're going to live here for a month?

717

At my house? In my room?

718
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:04,567
Why are you so surprised? You
don't even come home often.

719
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,667
Here, eat my beans.

721

You don't eat beans.

722
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,200
I'm eating this on behalf of her.

723
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,400
She said she can't eat beans.

724
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,567
Being protective?

725
00:49:21,567 --> 00:49:23,333
Beans are good for kids.

726
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:24,800
And I'm not a kid.

727
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,867
Oh, right!

728
00:49:26,867 --> 00:49:31,367
I bought you gifts, wait.

729
00:49:34,033 --> 00:49:36,700
What's going on, Mom? Do you owe
her something? You got money from her?

730
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,200
Seung Hyun, since when
have you been eating beans?

731
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,867
Why are you two suddenly doing this?

732
00:49:40,867 --> 00:49:44,367
She lived abroad, so she is not good at Korean.

733
00:49:44,367 --> 00:49:46,533
At first, you might get a little upset,

734
00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:49,133
but as you spend more time with her,
you'll find she has a good personality

735
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:52,400
and is very affectionate, right?

736
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:06,833
Oh, it's delicious.

737
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,367
- It's a little bit heavy.
- Is it delivery?

738
00:50:09,367 --> 00:50:11,033
You don't usually deliver.

739
00:50:11,033 --> 00:50:14,100
- Ma'am.
- Oh my.

740
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,500
It was heavy, right?

741
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,400
I fell while jogging yesterday,

742
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,833
and she saw me and
delivered it to me in person.

743
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:21,733
Thank you.

744
00:50:21,733 --> 00:50:25,767
Oh my, I was at home cutting
vegetables and my hands are dirty.

745
00:50:25,767 --> 00:50:28,400
It's warm and nice.

746
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,267
This stinky vegetable smell.

747
00:50:31,267 --> 00:50:33,600
Come by next time, and I'll
pack some vegetables for you.

748
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,267
Really? That would be good.

749

- Yes.

I came from the community center.

Repair work has been scheduled to begin
today on the sidewalk block where you fell.

753
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,600
- Really?
- What?

754
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,667
That sidewalk block in
front of that intersection?

755
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:51,800
Oh, yes, yes.

She took over my family and
the neighborhood in one day.

760
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:09,167
And soon she left us all confused.

761

00:51:46,567 --> 00:51:49,600

My key ring.

769
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,500
It's the key ring that Te O gave to me.

770
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,500
It's a birthday gift that he
gave me for the first time.

Dr. Kyung is acting weird these days, right?

775
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,567
She's been acting weird ever
since she came back from the U.K.

776
00:53:19,767 --> 00:53:22,300
This is short.

777

Oh my.

Does it smell good?

00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,433
You can smell it yourself.

Oh, that's such a shame.

787
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:07,300
You cherished it so much that
you even have a metal allergy,

788
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,533
but why are you doing this?

789
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:20,233
I guess I could buy 20 of those for 10 dollars.

790
00:54:20,233 --> 00:54:23,200
What does price matter? It's
the meaning of an object that matters.

That thing?

792
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:29,200
I'll go to Paris and buy it for you.

793
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,067
So, stop looking for it.

794
00:54:32,633 --> 00:54:34,433
It also matters who gave it to me.

00:54:34,433 --> 00:54:36,900
No matter how trivial the object is.

00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:41,100
Honestly, weren't you disappointed
to receive that as a birthday present?

No, I wasn't.

- You're lying.
- I don't lie.

00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,600

01:00:53,633 --> 01:00:55,067
Are you alright?

892
01:00:55,067 --> 01:00:56,300
The player Lee Shin?

893
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,500
Talk with me for a moment.

894
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,700
I opened an agency.

895
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,633
What's going on? Is this
Lee Goon I knew before?

896
01:01:01,633 --> 01:01:03,933
Is this really the jinx-breaking routine?

897
01:01:03,933 --> 01:01:05,233
Something that makes you laugh,

898
01:01:05,233 --> 01:01:07,233
something that cheers you up,
and something that makes you eat.

899
01:01:07,233 --> 01:01:11,000
Either you don't look into what I want
or you don't know how to look into it.

900
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,667
Winning is not important.

901
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:16,567
What's important is doing something
that makes you truly happy.
