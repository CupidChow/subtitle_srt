[Bad Memory Eraser]

2
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,367
[We followed the production guidelines
when filming child actors and animals.]

3
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:13,067
Hello, I am Jeon Sae Yan,
your interpreter for the day.

4
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:15,333
Please take care of me.

5
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:19,900
Nice to meet you.

6
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,467
First love, so what?

7
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:24,533
What?

8
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,900
Dr. Kyung Ju Yeon is my brother's first love.

9
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,300
So what?

10
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,133
Right, we kissed in the hotel
parking lot that night.

11
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:35,933
It seems he saw that.

12
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:38,700
So, what does it matter?

13
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,467
You bastard…

14
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,500
Now that I think about it, you
did that on purpose, right?

15
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,800
You showed up at Goon's
alumni reunion purposely,

16
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,133
and you hit on Goon's
first love purposely, right?

17
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:50,767
Don't you feel sorry?

18
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:51,900
Why should I be sorry?

19
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,000
You bastard…

20
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,533
Are you okay?

21
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,367
That's not it. I'll explain everything.

22
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:01,333
We're not in a romantic relationship.

23
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,867
Coincidentally, it was an underground
parking lot, so my brother misunderstood.

24
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:06,067
At that time, I didn't even know
who my brother's first love was.

25
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:09,133
I don't understand why I have to
explain this to you in such detail.

26
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:13,533
I'll think of it as your concern for my
brother that you grabbed me by the collar.

27
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,467
Okay.

28
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:17,233
Even if what you said is true,

29
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:21,800
shouldn't you two not meet anymore?

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,167
Seeing the two of you might bring
back the bad memories he had erased.

31
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:26,300
All have been erased. The bad memories.

32
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,933
The relationship between me and his first love.

33
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:30,033
Ended career as a player instead of me.

34
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:33,000
And falling into the river because of me.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,800
If there were any bad memories left,

36
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,967
he wouldn't have called his
first love to be the team doctor.

37
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:41,467
And he wouldn't have made eye
contact with me, like in the old days.

38
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:43,800
So don't make a big deal out of it.

39
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,200
I'm the one who's afraid his
memories might come back.

40
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,700
Don't act too excessively and watch your mouth.

41
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,800
He asked when Player Lee Shin would be here?

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,700
With an agitated voice.

43
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:02,133
- If I get caught in this…
- Lee Shin, why aren't you here?

44
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:03,567
Why isn't Shin coming?

45
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:06,100
If this happens, won't both of us
be cut from the doubles selection?

46
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,700
What are they saying?

47
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,233
They said, "Coach, would you like
to experience Korean culture?"

48
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:21,433
In Korea, we brew our own coffee.

49
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:22,967
'Dalgona coffee,' that's what it's called.

50
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:25,767
- 'Dalgona?'
- Dalgona.

51
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:28,133
Dalgona coffee.

52
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:31,300
Dalgona coffee.

53
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,267
It's easy to make.

54
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:39,333
Add coffee powder and sugar in a 1:1 ratio.

55
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:43,867
Add a little water.

56
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:49,000
And now, stir it like this.

57
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,700
We gained some time, but
that's going to be really tough.

58
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,833
Wouldn't that make things worse?

59
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,800
What are you doing? Go
and look for him quickly.

60
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,900
Like this, like this.

61
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:17,500
Why did you lie? You know
I'm not his first love.

62
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:21,933
Because I think

63
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:25,600
I know why you had to lie.

64
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,067
It's here.

65
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,633
The place where I saved my brother.

66
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:36,567
My brother cried out just before the accident.

67
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,700
He said he wanted to forget
everything if it couldn't be undone.

68
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,100
He said it as if he was dead already.

69
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:46,167
My brother, who was my idol when I was young,

70
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:50,267
lost his successful career
as a player because of me.

71
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:56,033
It was so painful to see him change
into someone with so many complexes.

72
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:59,967
So I went to Professor Han that
day, got on my knees and begged.

73
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:03,000
Please let him participate
in that clinical trial.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,400
To erase those bad memories.

75
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,100
Saying I'd take any side effects.

76
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:14,733
At first, I thought it was for
the sake of the subject,

77
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:18,133
but it became more and more agonizing.

78
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:20,133
I lied to him,

79
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:23,600
but every time he looks at me with sincerity.

80
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:28,300
Fortunately, not now.

81
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:33,167
Besides these side effects,
doesn't he look really happy?

82
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,300
It's thanks to you that he has become happy.

83
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,733
Don't blame yourself.

84
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:40,700
You did it for your brother.

85
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,833
Let's do it together.

86
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,267
He's happy and I'm happy because
everything worked out just as we wanted.

87
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:57,167
So, don't struggle alone,
pretending you're his first love.

88
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:59,567
I'll also do anything.

89
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,500
So that my brother's bad
memories won't come back.

90
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,300
For my brother's happiness.

91
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,300
Cooperation, let's do that.

92
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,333
- Oh, Goon.
- Right.

93
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,133
Where's Lee Shin?

94
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:17,633
Lee Shin? Actually, it's…

95
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:21,300
He came earlier, and then left,
saying there was an urgent matter.

96
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,367
He came and left?

97
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:26,700
What could be more urgent than this right now?

98
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,267
Ah, I'm really going crazy.

99
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:33,567
But I bet he'll be grateful to your company?

100
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:37,767
Because your team doctor
introduced us an interpreter.

101
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:42,000
That interpreter was
recommended by our team doctor?

102
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:48,633
That first love, the real first love.

103
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:51,133
The person you said you kissed.

104
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:52,967
Are you still in contact now?

105
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:57,367
His first true love could be
the trigger for all his bad memories.

106
00:06:57,367 --> 00:07:00,733
If he runs into her, even if he
doesn't remember right away,

107
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:04,767
all memories might unfold
like dominoes at any moment.

108
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:08,300
She hasn't met him since then.

109
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,667
No, I mean… Now that I've
become aware of her existence,

110
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:16,133
I think I'll feel a little better if I explain
the situation and ask for consent.

111
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,833
Since you said you two were
dating, the social media…

112
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,733
Dating?

113
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:23,700
There really wasn't anything between us.

114
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,633
I totally got kissed without wanting to.

115
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:35,167
Anyway, you aren't my brother's first love.

116
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,467
I knew you wouldn't be his type.

117
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:47,033
His taste in women was
completely opposite to mine.

118
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,300
As expected.

119
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
I've never had such delicious coffee before.

120
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,567
- Is it good?
- It's incredibly good.

121
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:03,300
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

122
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,933
It's the third one. Amazing.

123
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:12,500
Oh, my arm hurts.

124
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,733
Think of it as the first training schedule.

125
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:20,600
He said you worked your arms, so
you can consider this your first workout.

126
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,800
Coach, you are now an insider!

127
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,833
An insider?

128
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,467
It means someone trendy.

129
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:29,400
An insider? An insider!

130
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,800
- An insider!
- An insider!

131
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,333
An insider.

132
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,400
[My brother, Goon]

133
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:46,433
You said there was a meeting
with the coach today.

134
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:50,833
It's okay for a star player like me.

135
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:56,233
Ah, right! No, why didn't you show up
for the lunch appointment yesterday?

136
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:59,233
I waited for quite a while.

137
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,733
Are you planning to eat double today?

138
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:03,767
What?

139
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:06,833
If we're going to collaborate,

140
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,700
we have to match words.

141
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:13,033
Let's go.

142
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:17,033
For cooperation, delicious
restaurant is the best.

143
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:21,333
Thank you for thinking of your brother.

144
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,200
Why? It's for my brother.

145
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,367
As family, I should be more grateful.

146
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,233
Of course.

147
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:34,700
Let's go.

148
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,867
But the big data was very
impressive. Unbelievable.

149
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:45,333
He said the big data was very impressive.

150
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,600
I'm really glad it was helpful.

151
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,133
I'm really glad it was helpful.

152
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:51,567
A total insider, ciao!

153
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:55,200
- A total insider.
- A total insider, ciao!

154
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,233
The first money I earned from working!

155
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:06,100
What? Am I a career woman now, or what?

156
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,900
Ju Yeon? Where are you?

157
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,067
What do you want to eat? Tell
me everything. I'll buy it all for you.

158
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:15,367
You left?

159
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:21,200
Okay, I will head home.
See you at home, alright.

160
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,767
She left.

161
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:54,300
Why, what? You hit someone?

162
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,667
When did you get on?

163
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:58,800
Weren't we supposed to go together?

164
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,467
- What?
- I thought you were giving me a ride.

165
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:03,667
- Who?
- This lady is totally giving off a cool vibe.

166
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:04,867
You're my style!

167
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:07,133
You're my style too!

168
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,300
Crazy.

169
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,300
The meeting was all over, but
he doesn't contact me at all.

170
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,633
I don't know.

171
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,633
Did the meeting go well?

172
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,100
No, no.

173
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,567
Did you meet the interpreter well?

174
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,667
No, no.

175
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,333
What time should I start work tomorrow?

176
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,067
I don't know.

177
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:57,900
How should I send it?

178
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:01,600
Are you sleeping?

179
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,867
No, I think this is like something
sent from an ex-boyfriend.

180
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,400
I heard you introduced
an interpreter to our company?

181
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,300
Oh, no, this is not it. This looks too cold.

182
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,200
The interpreter is sleeping now.

183
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,800
So, take her now.

184
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,100
No, please take her with you.

185
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,533
What would be good?

186
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:32,400
Take along, take along…

187
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,767
[Patient Lee Goon: The interpreter
is sleeping now. So take her.]

188
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,500
The interpreter is sleeping now. So take her?

189
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,433
Take her?

190
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:57,700
How can he say it in a commanding tone?

191
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,367
Those eyes… Those eyes!

192
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:03,067
Do you think it's a taxi?

193
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:07,700
Since you sleep so well, I'm worried that
it's dangerous for you to take a taxi alone.

194
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,967
Did I mention the address?

195
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:12,400
How did you know I live here?

196
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,033
Aren't you living with Dr. Kyung Ju Yeon?

197
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:19,000
That bracelet…

198
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,767
How did you know Ju Yeon gave me this?

199
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:28,467
So why were you measuring other people's
wrist size to make me excited?

200
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:29,933
Thank you for giving me a ride.

201
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:32,233
No, no, no.

202
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:37,600
Why don't you call Ju Yeon to come pick you up?

203
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,400
No way.

204
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,267
Why? What, what? Why?

205
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:46,367
No way.

206
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,467
You were worried about me walking at night?

207
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:51,600
Oh, what? You're even sweeter than I heard.

208
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,467
You're a sweet guy.

209
00:13:56,133 --> 00:14:01,433
I mean, I am a man who's sweet and sugary.

210
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:06,433
What does Dr. Kyung usually talk about me

211
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:08,833
that you know me so well?

212
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,633
So,

213
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:13,067
does Dr. Kyung

214
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:17,200
like the sweet type?

215
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:23,100
Haven't we seen each other
somewhere? You look familiar.

216
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,633
No, no.

217
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:30,833
Probably not.

218
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:39,633
Hey, Lee Shin! Where are you?

219
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:41,167
- No, look at this.
- Yes, you did a good job.

220
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:42,667
- It's real money.
- Yeah, I got it.

221
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:45,300
Hey, you wait.

222
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,267
But it was easier with an interpreter, right?

223
00:14:56,867 --> 00:15:02,900
[Episode 8, The Common Words of Thanks]

224
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:05,833
Look!

225
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:09,667
I was in full career woman mode.

226
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:11,133
It's my first time earning money.

227
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:16,133
So I didn't know what they meant when
they said that beer after work tasted good.

228
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:17,567
Now I got to know.

229
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:20,500
I learned the joy of making money.

230
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,867
So the CEO said thank you and took you home?

231
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:25,300
I don't think so.

232
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,733
I worked my butt off, but there
wasn't even a single 'thank you'?

233
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:30,333
Right? That's what I'm saying.

234
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:34,467
I don't want warm words. What's so difficult
to say common, ordinary words 'thank you'?

235
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:37,100
It's not like I'm showing off
for introducing you to him.

236
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,633
I really put so much effort into it.

237
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:43,667
But what do you call that?

238
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:45,067
He acted careless on the outside,
but was actually very soft inside.

239
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:48,300
And he was sweeter than I thought.

240
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,133
'So sweet?'

241
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:51,667
'So sweet'?

242
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,767
Has all the sweetness in
the world frozen to death?

243
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:57,567
How can a sweet person just walk away
when someone is dangling from a rehab device?

244
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:00,133
He made me carry his heavy
luggage just because it's heavy.

245
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:04,567
'So sweet'? No, he's a person
filled with extreme self-love.

246
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:07,500
It's not even funny.

247
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,200
Date? Date?

248
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,700
Okay, okay.

249
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,867
I'll go to the coach
tomorrow and beg like this.

250
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:27,300
There was a good reason for it today.

251
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:30,367
I must be crazy. I must be crazy.

252
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:31,800
Because I've fallen for a woman.

253
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,900
Oh, I got it, I got it.

254
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:40,600
What happened to your lips?

255
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,867
Did you get punched in the face by that woman?

256
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:45,500
Ah, this…

257
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:51,167
She put some medicine
on my chapped lips like this.

258
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:57,667
I don't know what kind of woman
she is, but she has bad taste in men.

259
00:16:57,667 --> 00:17:00,333
Like our team doctor.

260
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,733
Speaking of that team doctor.

261
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:11,833
You don't still have feelings for her, right?

262
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:18,933
Ah, what is it? Dog hair!

263
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:21,433
Why is the dog sleeping on the bed?

264
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:24,667
If he does this all the time and just
look in the mirror, what's the use?

265
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:27,933
He pretends to be a man
and acts like a crybaby.

266
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:30,933
He was only slightly injured, but I
thought something big had happened.

267
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,267
Hey, you're in big trouble.

268
00:17:33,267 --> 00:17:35,700
You need to improve your taste in men.

269
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,900
They say overreacting like
that is even more suspicious.

270
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,500
Oh my, what's suspicious?

271
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,333
I have to sleep early for my
first day at work tomorrow.

272
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,367
Turn off the lights.

273
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,833
Did you really erase me from your heart?

274
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:54,900
That…

275
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,100
Are you sure?

276
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,333
Of course.

277
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:03,733
Does that mean I can like you again?

278
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,200
It's a dream, so what does it matter?

279
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,567
Hey!

280
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:39,200
No way, my lips!

281
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,767
My pure lips.

282
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,967
Where did you go? Where did you go!

283
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,733
Hey!

284
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,933
I've even forgotten all
about the kiss right now.

285
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:59,500
You kissed my lips?

286
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,433
Isn't that too much?

287
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,533
Because of you, because of
you… It was all a crazy dream.

288
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:08,367
You're banned from approaching me from now on.

289
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:10,600
Ugh, it's disgusting.

290
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:18,567
Yes, Professor Han.

291
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:21,833
Today is my official first day of work.

292
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,067
Yes, I'm about to start the counseling.

293
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:26,767
I will drop by the hospital later.

294
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:29,433
You seem excited?

295
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:31,767
Me?

296
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,867
You usually keep your distance from everyone.

297
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:47,133
Don't get emotionally involved with patients.

298
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:53,200
You know that whether you feel good or
bad, you have to act rationally, right?

299
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,367
Here it is.

300
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:00,200
I…

301
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,600
Oh, right. I have to pay for it.

302
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,900
What are you doing?

303
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,100
Ah, just in case.

304
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,633
There are two grown men and women,
so I guess I should do this much.

305
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,933
During the three months of working here.

306
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:18,567
Daily counseling, sleep
tests once a week, EEG tests.

307
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:19,700
You just have to adhere to these conditions.

308
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,500
Is there anything else?

309
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,100
Like no physical contact between men and women.

310
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,533
To begin with, it's not a relationship between
men and women, but we're just colleagues.

311
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:30,900
Now, let's start the counseling.

312
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,433
Alright, sit comfortably in a relaxed posture.

313
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,667
- Is it now?
- Oh, this is so good.

314
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:39,867
Then first, you have to write an emotion diary.

315
00:20:39,867 --> 00:20:42,400
You just write down all the emotions you feel.

316
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,467
Here.

317
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:47,100
Yes, I got it.

318
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,367
Write comfortably. I'll be waiting.

319
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:57,267
- Did you finish writing it already?
- Is it done?

320
00:20:57,267 --> 00:20:59,300
Yes.

321
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,667
No.

322
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,700
I didn't ask you to scribble!

323
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:15,433
You don't listen at all.

324
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:17,733
"Extremely unluck?"

325
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:23,233
"The subject is full of self-esteem
and unlucky due to self-adoration?"

326
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:24,367
Are you going to write like this?

327
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,300
Rather than an observation diary,

328
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,067
it's just notes that I have made so far.

329
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:32,067
My honest feelings about the subject.

330
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:33,900
I told you not to be emotional.

331
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,500
It's only your personal feelings
without any medical opinion.

332
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,767
I haven't even counseled yet.

333
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:41,500
Now we've just started working
together day and night under one roof.

334
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,467
Now I have to formally counsel.

335
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,467
I think I should at least give you a necklace.

336
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,967
Are you going on "Show Me the Money"?

337
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:55,133
You're getting weirder.

338
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:57,167
I'm saying this because I'm worried.

339
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:59,300
If you stay with the subject day and night,

340
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,633
and once in a while you start
to feel strange emotions.

341
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:04,352
What kind of emotions?

342
00:22:04,352 --> 00:22:05,600
Ah, you startled me.

343
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,167
Am I the kind of person who can't
distinguish between public and private?

344
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:11,467
And because of work, I don't have
time to have romantic feelings.

345
00:22:11,467 --> 00:22:13,467
I study like a job seeker
to observe the subject.

346
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:15,467
Groveling to look good to the young athlete.

347
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,333
See? I rubbed my palms so hard

348
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,667
that palm lines have almost disappeared.

349
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:23,767
I think you'll take the necklace.
You are an excellent rapper.

350
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:28,167
What I'm saying is to separate
public and private life.

351
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:29,667
Yes.

352
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:31,767
Oh my.

353
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,767
Professor, about that earlier…

354
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,267
Oh my.

355
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:35,800
Just a moment, please be careful.

356
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,100
It's heavy, be careful, be careful.

357
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,967
Oh, Dr. Kyung is here too.

358
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:46,367
Yes, then you two can talk comfortably.

359
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,400
You can distinguish between
public and private, right?

360
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,467
Well, maybe you have feelings for Nurse Song?

361
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:01,167
What did I do?

362
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:04,467
As a coworker who has
worked together for a long time.

363
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:07,400
She is a single mom, and she has a hard
time raising her children and working hard,

364
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,833
so isn't it only natural that I,

365
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:13,200
a bachelor, would do this much for her?

366
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,767
Anyway.

367
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:19,200
If you don't want to be misunderstood
with the test subject, just keep it neutral.

368
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:25,367
There won't be such a thing,
so don't look at me with bias.

369
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:27,733
And since I told him to
write an emotional diary.

370
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:32,533
I'll observe very rationally from the side.

371
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:33,800
Wait a minute.

372
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,767
Come to think of it, when the test
subject came for counseling 10 years ago,

373
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:42,700
I told him to write emotion diary,
but I don't know if he did that.

374
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,433
What?

375
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:16,567
Oh, look who's here.

376
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:20,000
So you've come to beg the investors.

377
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:24,133
It seems you think of fundraising as begging.

378
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:29,567
That's why there are rumors
you're struggling financially.

379
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:32,567
I have a close relationship with the chairman.

380
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:34,533
Good luck.

381
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:37,067
You're wearing something nice?

382
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,633
You bastard.

383
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,833
Sir, why are you coming out?

384
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:53,133
- Ah, Mr. Lee.
- How have you been?

385
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:56,267
The chairman is waiting for
your briefing, come along.

386
00:24:56,267 --> 00:24:57,867
- Yes.
- Ah.

387
00:24:57,867 --> 00:25:00,333
Mr. Hong, wait here.

388
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:04,167
Me? Not him?

389
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:12,867
Go greet the chairman.

390
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,900
This is Lee Gun, the CEO of 'Agency Goon'.

391
00:25:23,533 --> 00:25:27,933
Then, I'll start the business plan briefing.

392
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,833
Unlike other agencies, our 'Agency Goon'

393
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,633
analyzes the big data of each player

394
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:41,100
to prevent injuries and…

395
00:25:48,067 --> 00:25:49,733
Congratulations.

396
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:51,067
Yes, thank you.

397
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:52,900
This is all thanks to you, sir.

398
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,433
Now you need to be introduced to all
the sponsors and advertising industry people.

399
00:25:56,433 --> 00:25:58,500
Oh, no.

400
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,333
How about a drink tonight?

401
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,433
I have some places to stop by today.

402
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:05,167
I will visit you again soon.

403
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:07,233
- Let's do that.
- Yes, thank you.

404
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,233
It has to be.

405
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,800
Understood.

406
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,867
Thank you.

407
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,600
The investment you promised me last time…

408
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,233
Mr. Hong, what happened with
the renewal of Player Lee Shin's contract?

409
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:26,467
I will make sure of that soon…

410
00:26:26,467 --> 00:26:30,133
Let's talk again after you
make him sign the contract.

411
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:32,167
Sir!

412
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,533
Nothing gets done because
of that darned brother.

413
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:41,033
But what brain surgery did he have
to change his personality like that?

414
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,300
Even his gait has changed.

415
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,900
Let go. I said I'm going in.

416
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,500
You should have done that earlier.

417
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,967
You must do it today!

418
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:55,100
No, but honey,

419
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,700
other people are watching

420
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,867
and he's not a criminal.

421
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:59,567
- Holding him like this is…
- Honey, please.

422
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:01,200
Hold on tight. Let's go.

423
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,500
Dad, Dad.

424
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,667
Oh my, Shin's mom.

425
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:07,033
Oh, Shin. Did you come here for a medical test?

426
00:27:07,033 --> 00:27:10,767
- Hello.
- Hello.

427
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:14,833
I thought this was a Miss
Korea selection contest.

428
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,333
Seems like everyone's here for
the national team's medical test?

429
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:22,967
Honey, take Shin and register it now.

430
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:24,300
Yes.

431
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,667
Truth, goodness, beauty.

432
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:29,033
Goodbye.

433
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:32,000
Shin always looks dashing.

434
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,833
You can say that Shin has already
won the gold medal. I'm jealous of you.

435
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:40,800
I'll give up the silver and
bronze medals to you.

436
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,267
Now, if your eldest son does
well, everything will be fine.

437
00:27:44,267 --> 00:27:45,433
That would be nice.

438
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:49,067
Is he still cooped up at
home drinking every day?

439
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,633
Oh my, that worries me.

440
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:55,067
Oh, Dr. Kyung!

441
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:57,533
Ah, hello.

442
00:27:57,533 --> 00:28:00,733
Today is the day Shin takes a medical test.

443
00:28:00,733 --> 00:28:03,367
Everyone here is a player's mother.

444
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:04,967
But who is this?

445
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:06,500
Oh, that…

446
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,767
Goon's… You know.

447
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:13,067
Lover.

448
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:20,967
Oh my, I envy you.

449
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:22,833
Yes, I'm Mr. Lee Goon's attending physician.

450
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,733
She was reunited with him
as his attending physician.

451
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:27,000
She was Goon's first love from childhood.

452
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,367
No, rather than a first love, it was…

453
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:31,800
It's kind of puppy love.

454
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,967
Now, it's true love.

455
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:38,000
What are you saying…

456
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,933
Oh, your face has turned red.

457
00:28:39,933 --> 00:28:43,033
An athlete as a son and a doctor as
a daughter-in-law, it's just perfect.

458
00:28:43,033 --> 00:28:46,267
You've got everything.

459
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:49,533
- No.
- Look, her face has gone red.

460
00:28:49,533 --> 00:28:52,467
Dr. Kyung is so pretty, isn't she?

461
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:54,433
No, no. It's not like that.

462
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,467
- Dr. Ju Yeon?
- Miss Ju Yeon.

463
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:58,600
When did she…

464
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,533
You were here? You called me, right?

465
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:07,100
Yes.

466
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,300
Isn't he Player Lee Shin?

467
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,733
Isn't she your sister-in-law?

468
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:13,700
She's my brother's attending physician.

469
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,333
She's my brother's former
first love and unrequited love.

470
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:21,367
You said you hadn't seen him once
since he was discharged, right?

471
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:24,100
You go away.

472
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,400
How is it? I suit her better
than my brother, right?

473
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:32,320
You prankster.

474
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,500
Well.

475
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,000
Why did you tell a lie
that'll be quickly found out?

476
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,233
I'll explain everything to them later.

477
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:41,333
It's okay as long as I
don't get caught by them.

478
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:45,400
Then you won't be the only one being suspected?

479
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,600
If there's a scandal…

480
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:51,267
Are you that famous?

481
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:56,333
Even kids who don't know me pass
by and say, "That's Player Lee Shin!"

482
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:58,400
We're on the same team now.

483
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,867
Try saying 'Shin.'

484
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:05,767
Oh! Have you ever seen
Mr. Lee Goon's past diary?

485
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:07,067
An emotion diary.

486
00:30:07,067 --> 00:30:11,333
I heard that when he was consulting with
a professor, he asked him to write that down.

487
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:12,767
An emotion diary?

488
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:14,767
Yes.

489
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:19,033
If it has past feelings written on it.

490
00:30:19,867 --> 00:30:23,133
What if my brother sees it first?

491
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:25,867
Maybe the lost memories
could naturally come back?

492
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:30,433
Yes, can you try to find it?

493
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:33,500
Okay, I got it.

494
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,833
I'll search through
the entire house to find it.

495
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,900
Okay.

496
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,833
Is it time for exercise again?

497
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:43,300
No, it's mealtime.

498
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,733
Have you eaten? Would you
like to have a meal together…

499
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:47,233
Ah, I have to go.

500
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:49,300
Please contact me if you find it.

501
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,567
- Okay.
- I'll go.

502
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:02,400
Since we're collaborating, we
naturally find time to meet.

503
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:07,167
If I sign with the agency, we
could see each other more often.

504
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,000
Please give me one of set number 1.

505
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,167
Yes.

506
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:14,867
Oh, that… Please give me
one of set number 2 as well.

507
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:16,900
Yes.

508
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:34,467
I'm going to have lunch.

509
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:41,300
Excuse me? Anyone in there?

510
00:31:51,267 --> 00:31:54,567
I'm sorry. Because it is a hotel, we
cannot show you the CCTV footage

511
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:56,433
due to the nature of the location

512
00:31:56,433 --> 00:31:59,700
and the privacy of the person being exposed.

513
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:05,067

[J Hotel]

515
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,367
You slept at home all day and
fell down the stairs half asleep.

516
00:32:12,367 --> 00:32:14,700
Which one could be correct?

517
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,867
The memory of Lee Shin.

518
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:20,700
Or a memory like my afterimage.

519
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,667
Are you alright?

520
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:12,400
Yes.

521
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,767
By the way, how long has this tree been here?

522
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:19,067
It's an event tree that has been here
since our hotel was first built.

523
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:21,100
It is used as a tree for Christmas.

524
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,867
And on days with events or weddings,

525
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:26,100
it's also used as a guestbook tree.

526
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,167
Yes, I understand.

527
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:47,700

00:33:58,467 --> 00:34:00,567
On the emergency transport certificate,

529
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:03,033
there's no record under the name of Lee Goon.

530
00:34:03,033 --> 00:34:05,833
If you're certain about
the date and the neighborhood,

531
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:09,467
there're no records of a patient
who fell down the stairs.

532
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:12,867
So there were no patients
transported from J Hotel?

533
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:16,833
If the patient has lost consciousness
and is in critical condition,

534
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:21,067
the name of the guardian may be written
down when the patient is transported.

535
00:34:21,067 --> 00:34:24,900
Then, what about 'Lee Seok Du?'

536
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,133
'Eun Ji Sun' or 'Lee Shin'?

Oh? It's here.

539
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:40,367
The record matches
the transport to Hanseom Hospital.

540

Where is the place of the accident? A house?

541
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:48,100
Or could it be a hotel?

542
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:10,400
It says a drowning man was rescued and
transported from the southern Han River Bridge.

What happened that night?

546
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,000
You fell down the stairs.

547
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,767
You slept at home all day and
fell down the stairs half asleep.

548

We found you relatively
quickly after the accident

549
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,033
when the whole family was together.

550
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:32,867
But, why are you asking that?

551
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:35,800
One thing for sure is that
my family's testimonies are lies.

552
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,367
Why? Why is that?

553
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:41,967
Why are they lying?

554
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:06,300
What is this memory?

555
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,967
Who was that person?

556
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,467

I'm on my way to the police station,
but he is not answering my call.

- I see.
- Yes.

- Officer Kim.
- Yes.

was meant to be a therapy dog.

they start growling at each other.

00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:07,133

to come here after the workout.

What next time? We're also busy.

687
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:50,300
- I brought some side dishes.
- Why did you bring this dog?

688
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,500
Your mom did. I have no idea.

689
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,133
- Give it to me.
- No, it's fine, let go, let go.

690
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,567
Ugh, it's heavy.

691
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:03,333
Goon, put all of this in the fridge.

692
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,400
- Yes, please give it to me.
- My arm hurts.

693
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,067
Ugh, it's hot.

694
00:45:08,067 --> 00:45:09,400
Why is it so hot?

695

Ah, Mom, why?

696
00:45:12,267 --> 00:45:14,467
No, I was going to open
the door because it's hot.

697
00:45:14,467 --> 00:45:15,900
Ah, I'll open it.

698
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,267
If it gets hot and then suddenly
gets cold, you might catch a cold.

699
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:23,467
Why are you suddenly so worried about me?

700
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:24,500
It's natural for a son to worry about his mom.

701
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,900
What should I do?

702
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,467
Hey, Goon, bring me some water.

00:57:09,367 --> 00:57:13,600
Let's sit down first and
talk. I'll explain everything.

878
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,800
Why?

879
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,533
Did you know everything?

880
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,200
Are you okay?

881
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,333
I can just tell the truth and get treated.

882
00:57:37,333 --> 00:57:40,067
You can't do that.

883
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:45,333
What about this?

884
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,200
Mr. Lee Goon, are you okay?

885
00:58:04,533 --> 00:58:07,033
You bastard.

886
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:12,933
There was no CCTV, which is strange.

887
00:58:12,933 --> 00:58:15,033
I wondered why.

888
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:17,700
It broke because it rained?

889
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:23,333
But you're right there in the picture.

890
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,933
You're the only witness, and
your brother can't even remember.

891
00:58:28,933 --> 00:58:33,367
Did you think you were the only one
who knew the truth about that day?

892
00:58:33,367 --> 00:58:36,967
Even after saving your
brother's life? Why is that?

893
00:58:36,967 --> 00:58:40,200
Why would you try to hide it so much?

894
00:58:42,167 --> 00:58:44,700
Now I know why you

895
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,467
tried to cover up your brother's accident.

896
00:58:51,867 --> 00:58:54,267
Take a good look.

897
00:58:54,933 --> 00:58:56,867
What do you think?

898
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:59,167
It's clear, right?

899
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,967
Why?

900
00:59:03,967 --> 00:59:08,500
Do you now remember what happened that day?

901
00:59:16,867 --> 00:59:20,867
Can you hear me? Mr. Lee Goon! Mr. Lee Goon!

902
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,833
That day, you pushed

903
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,033
your brother.

904

905
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:51,200
♫ Stunning ♫

906
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:56,633
♫ Going backwards to you ♫

907
01:00:00,733 --> 01:00:05,733
[Bad Memory Eraser]

908
01:00:05,733 --> 01:00:07,700
It all seems like my fault from the beginning.

909
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,433
Both pain and side effects.

910
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:12,000
Are you hiding anything from Shin and me?

911
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,500
Are you sure there is nothing?

912
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,633
Why are you coming out from there?

913
01:00:14,633 --> 01:00:16,000
I got a job here as the interpreter.

914
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Quit right now.

915
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:17,767
What if I don't want to?

916
01:00:17,767 --> 01:00:19,933
If you haven't eaten,
let's eat together at least.

917
01:00:19,933 --> 01:00:22,033
I'm sorry, but today I…

918
01:00:22,033 --> 01:00:23,900
I missed her for a very long time,

919
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,333
and we were finally reunited, but
the result was as you know…

920
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:28,567
If I had been your first love,
I wouldn't have hurt you like that.

921
01:00:28,567 --> 01:00:29,567
Do you like my brother?

922
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:32,500
Your eyes sparkle whenever
the story about my brother comes up.

923
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,400
It can't be. It shouldn't be.

924
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,100
Because I'm not his real first love.
