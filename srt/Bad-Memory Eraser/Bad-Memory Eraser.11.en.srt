[Bad Memory Eraser]

2
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,367
[We followed the production guidelines
when filming child actors and animals.]

3
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:42,300
That's a lie.

4
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,467
Look into my eyes and say it.

5
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:48,733
If that's the truth,

6
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:51,800
look into my eyes and say it clearly.

7
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:04,067
You are such a fool.

8
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,667
Even if you deceived me,

9
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:10,900
don't lie to yourself.

10
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:15,567
Let's stop pretending

11
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:18,000
we're okay.

12
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:43,167
What are you doing stopping
the car in the middle of the bridge?

13
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:45,733
Other cars can't get through.

14
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:48,833
Especially in this cold weather.

15
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,400
Hurry up and move the car.

16
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:04,833
It's already getting dark
because we're in the countryside.

17
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,700
There isn't a single light around.

18
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,867
Yeah, that's true.

19
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:12,667
Not a single person passing
by, nor a dog in sight.

20
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:15,900
Anything that happens here, no one would know.

21
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:18,433
Right.

22
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:20,900
Is there something you want to do now?

23
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,033
When did I ever say that I
wanted to do something?

24
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:26,000
What do you expect? You
really have a sneaky side.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,467
What on earth…

26
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:32,633
What did you imagine that
makes you think I'm sneaky?

27
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:36,800
Ugh, I'm so sleepy and tired. Let's
head to the accommodation quickly.

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Alright.

29
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:42,333
I mean, what…

30
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,667
What did you imagine?

31
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:47,300
Oh, I'm sleepy.

32
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,900
Is this our accommodation?

33
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,467
This is my grandmother's house.

34
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:16,667
Just a moment.

35
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:21,633
If it's his grandmother's house,
isn't it a bad memory for him?

36
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:29,833
I transferred here.

37
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:33,800
I don't remember it very well.

38
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,000
And my grandmother isn't here
anymore, but I really wanted to visit.

39
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:44,300
Then, your grandmother is…

40
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,367
My grandmother is…

41
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,900
It seems like I brought up
something unnecessary.

42
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:03,767
She's in Hawaii at my eldest uncle's place.

43
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:06,933
Are you trying to tease me on purpose?

44
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:09,533
What did you say?

45
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:11,133
Why?

46
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:14,433
Is my grandmother not supposed to be alive?

47
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:15,833
No, no.

48
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,033
That…

49
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,833
Cute, you are so cute.

50
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:29,467
It's really fun to tease you.

51
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:34,233
By the way, are you not hungry?
Shall we eat something?

52
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,467
Right, let's see if there's anything
edible in Shin's suitcase.

53
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:38,533
Oh, yes.

54
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:44,100
♫ I can't help it, restless
and lost for words ♫

55
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,400
♫ This moment is embarrassing ♫

56
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,500

57
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,533
♫ I don't really want to say it ♫

58
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:04,233
♫ Even without words, my feelings now ♫

59
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:05,633
Try it first.

60
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:08,800
No, please go ahead and eat.
I'm not a fan of instant food…

61
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,400
And I definitely don't eat
meat that's been in water.

62
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,567
So, please go ahead and eat.

63
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:16,267
Come on, just try it once.

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,133
Right.

65
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,367
It's tasty, right?

66
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:29,433
What is this?

67
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:32,967
It must taste even better because you fed me.

68
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:35,633
After my hospital appointments, I spent
so much time staying up all night in the lab

69
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:39,033
that I ended up eating convenience
store food almost constantly.

70
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:41,933
But putting aside the hospital appointments,

71
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:45,567
is the research really that important?

72
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,800
I became a doctor because of that.

73
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,300
My long-time dream is to cure mental illness

74
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,133
through brain research.

75
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,367
Then,

76
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:59,267
that bracelet is also…

77
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:02,167
My wish bracelet.

78
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:04,433
That's my wish too.

79
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:09,800
Making my subjects happy through my research.

80
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:17,600
Stop worrying about others,
and take care of yourself first.

81
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,533
But I'm more worried about you.

82
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:33,833
I'm thirsty.

83
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,233
What's that?

84
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:45,800
There was some tea. I think it was burdock tea.

85
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,733
I'll drink this. It's really delicious.

86
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:49,733
Please drink it.

87
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:51,200
You are also good at cooking…

88
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,800
I boiled it by hand with
barrenwort that I picked myself.

89
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,167
Didn't CEO Hong give it to you?

90
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,467
Ah, I must have left it in the car.

91
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:01,933
You left something that valuable in the car?

92
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:03,567
Go get it right now…

93
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:05,567
Never mind.

94
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:08,400
Just leave it and bring it in the morning.

95
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,633
You must never drink that at night.

96
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:13,800
Why is that?

97
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:16,633
Well, that's because if you drink that,

98
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:19,900
your stamina will be boosted!

99
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,500
- Oh my.
- Honey!

100
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,767
Ah, why?

101
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:24,867
What are you saying to Shin now?

102
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:28,267
He's now in Athletes' Village,
so he wouldn't cause any trouble.

103
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:29,767
Jeez.

104
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:31,667
Oh dear.

105
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:32,767
What is Cola doing?

106
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:35,133
By the way, Cola doesn't move much

107
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,200
because he misses you so much.

108
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,500
Cola.

109
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:41,833
Here, Cola.

110
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,200
- Cola.
- Come on, say hi, look at your brother.

111
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,800
Hello?

112
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,233
- Cola.
- Hello.

113
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,733
How is it?

114
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:52,300
- Cola.
- Brother, hello.

115
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,567
Hello, sir.

116
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:56,733
Dad, I have to get up early
tomorrow, so I'm hanging up.

117
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:57,733
- Yeah.
- I'll hang up.

118
00:07:57,733 --> 00:08:01,100
Alright, for the final farewell. Goodbye!

119
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,700
Cola, goodbye. I'll call again.

120
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,100
Yeah, let's go to bed early.

121
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,700
If you want to look good on
screen at tomorrow's media day.

122
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,867
Oh, wait.

123
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:13,300
Face mask, face mask!

124
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,133
It's the start of life in
the Athletes' Village.

125
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:21,400
How am I supposed to

126
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:25,900
endure a month?

127
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:33,900
[Episode 11, Friday the 19th]

128
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:49,700
Ugh, it's hot.

129
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,533
Why is it so hot?

130
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,600
It's strange.

131
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,967
I feel like I'm running a fever.

132
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:02,200
But the floor is cold.

133
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:15,800
Ugh, it's hot.

134
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,300
It's too hot.

135
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,300
Let's go to sleep quickly.

136
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,567
Let's sleep.

137
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,767
What am I thinking? Like an amateur.

138
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:33,000
Why do I keep thinking about it?

139
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,800
Forget it, forget it!

140
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,733
Let's think about something else.

141
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,933
I think I'm losing my mind.

142
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,000
What is this place?

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,267
Am I possessed by a ghost or something?

144
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:04,133
Buddha, God, all the deities of the world.

145
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:09,333
Please save me from the lewd
demon. Please, please!

146
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,933
Come here. Come here

147
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,533
Kyung Ju Yeon, come this way.

148
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,200
Kyung Ju Yeon, Kyung Ju Yeon!

149
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,400
Why, why, why?

150
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,767
Why is it all about kissing even in dreams?

151
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:38,133
Are you going to keep doing
this over a single kiss, huh?

152
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44,667
Overcome it with willpower, okay?

153
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:48,267
I'm more rational than anyone else.

154
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,233
It's hot. It's really hot.

155
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,067
It's hot.

156
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:02,667
Why? Is it hot?

157
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:07,133
It feels a bit hot since
the sleeping place has changed.

158
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,467
Just sleep without worrying.

159
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:14,400
Do you feel stuffy and feverish?

160
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:18,433
Then why don't we…

161
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:30,000
If it's okay, why don't we…

162
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,800
Oh my, why are you acting so ill-mannered?

163
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,733
Mr. Lee, were you this kind of person?

164
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,733
As responsible adults,

165
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:39,833
we should act rationally.

166
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:45,033
No, let's change the blanket.

167
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:48,133
I tend to get cold easily.

168
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:50,467
I'm already struggling because of the fever.

169
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:52,000
Are you feeling feverish? Maybe…

170
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,267
- Do you have a fever?
- Oh my.

171
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:57,867
Don't even think about sneaking skinship.

172
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,733
A mouse… I think there's a mouse.

173
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,667
- Mouse?
- A mouse?

174
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,433
There's a mouse back there.

175
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:20,767
Are you acting like this because
you're scared of the mouse?

176
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:23,833
This is really unbelievable.

177
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:27,533
I've been living with lab
rats for six years now.

178
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:29,433
- Where is it?
- There's not just one or two.

179
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:31,100
Something… It's here.

180
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,467
But leave that mouse alone.

181
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:36,400

00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:53,200
Do you know how much I wanted
to see you since this morning?

360
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,433
I don't know anyone here.

361
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,667
The real first love

362
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:08,433
and the fake first love

363
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,500
are both with him.

364
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:29,433
It's an honor to have become
a national representative first.

365
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:31,900
Although I don't have much
experience in doubles matches,

366
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,533
I'll work hard not to disappoint the fans.

367
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:39,100
Where is Player Lee Shin…

368
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,533
I will take the interview on his behalf.
I also eat rice for two people.

369
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:44,600
Understood.

370
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,167
You moved to a new agency recently.
Is there a reason for your choice?

371
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:50,967
It's because the CEO is handsome.

372
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:53,567
I'm just kidding.

373
00:26:53,567 --> 00:26:55,833
I had faith in it being a good agency.

374
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:59,300
I plan to be more active as an athlete.

375
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,200
As senior Lee Shin has a lot of
international competition experience,

376
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,133
I'll try to follow him well and achieve
good results in the competitions.

377
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:08,467
Thank you.

378
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,200
Coach, please say a word as well.

379
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,900
- They ask you to say something.
- Understood.

380
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,633
In the Athletes' Village,
the national representatives

381
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:20,733
will compete in good faith

382
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:22,867
to determine their qualification
for international events.

383
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:26,033
Through thorough analysis and big data,

384
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:28,300
we'll maximize the players' potential abilities

385
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,467
to the fullest extent.

386
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:35,233
In the Athletes' Village, the national
representatives will compete in good faith

387
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:37,800
to determine their qualification
for international events.

388
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,733
No, you know I have interview anxiety.

389
00:27:40,733 --> 00:27:41,733
Hey.

390
00:27:41,733 --> 00:27:43,533
You know the rookie player
our agency is fostering, right?

391
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:47,500
If you do a solo interview, they say he
can be the cover model from next time.

392
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,733
Meaning, there's an offer for an ad coming in.

393
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:52,533
I won't do it, I won't.

394
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:55,633
Lee Shin, are you really going to be like this?

395
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:03,333
- Thank you.
- Thank you for your efforts.

396
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,367
Good work.

397
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:07,067
Ciao!

398
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:08,333
- Good work.
- Let's go.

399
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:10,433
Ciao!

400
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:21,400
Mom.

401
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,700
Pack your things right now.

402
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,300
No, there's no need to pack.
Just take your passport.

403
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,800
I'll ask Ju Yeon's mom to mail the luggage.

404
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,933
Mom, I'm sorry I ran away, but…

405
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:36,933
Look at this, I became an interpreter
for the South Korean national team.

406
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:38,567
The coach also said I did an excellent job.

407
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:40,100
People have also been very nice to me.

408
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,133
And if I do well at interpreting,

409
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:44,133
I might even appear on TV like a career woman.

410
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:46,200
Stop it.

411
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,967
Mr. Lee.

412
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:55,667
I'm sorry.

413
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,500
Our agency deals with sponsorships

414
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,100
and endorsements, as well as

415
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,933
things like financial management,
consulting for individual athletes

416
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:04,500
and post-retirement care.

417
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,700
We are trying to expand our role as advisors.

418
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,733
Sports is ultimately a psychological battle,
so we manage the mental health of the athletes.

419
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:14,367
You can't quit because of the interpreting job?

420
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:17,900
Do you think I don't know
what you've been up to?

421
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:22,133
- That's…
- Quit right now.

422
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,400
He's just a biological father. That's all.

423
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,933
He was nothing but trash.

424
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,400
He never even registered
you in his family registry.

425
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,267
I have never received a single
penny in child support from him.

426
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:37,867
He's just a person of no significance.

427
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:40,733
Still,

428
00:29:40,733 --> 00:29:42,867
I want to meet him at least once.

429
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:45,267
I told you not to talk back.

430
00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:48,300
Don't you ever think about your father now?

431
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,100
When we went to Italy penniless and homeless,

432
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,200
it was your father who took us in.

433
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,033
If it weren't for him, no one
would have even glanced at us,

434
00:29:58,033 --> 00:30:01,800
no matter how long we stayed on
the streets. Do you understand?

435
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:06,267
I'm an adult now… And if I start
looking for my biological father here…

436
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:09,067
Who are you calling father?

437
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:11,000
It's better not to know such a person.

438
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,833
And you know what he's like
when he gets angry, right?

439
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:16,167
Pack your things right now.

440
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:20,167
If you don't want to see
me die, you understand?

441
00:30:24,133 --> 00:30:25,300
Oh my.

442
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,633
Are you, by any chance,
our interpreter's mother?

443
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:33,467
Yes.

444
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:35,900
I apologize for the late introduction.

445
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,033
I'm 'Agency Goon's' CEO, Lee Goon.

446
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:43,933
Ms. Sae Yan is working with our company.

447
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:47,133
She's contracted with
the agency as an interpreter.

448
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,733
A contract?

449
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,867
How much is it? I will send
it to you within 10 minutes.

450
00:30:54,867 --> 00:30:57,000
We need to leave for Italy real soon.

451
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Then that's it, right?

452
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:03,333
So Ms. Sae Yan is very rich in Italy.

453
00:31:04,267 --> 00:31:05,633
But what should we do now?

454
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:08,233
It seems you won't be able
to leave the country immediately.

455
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:13,367
I'm going to sue Ms. Sae Yan for
fraud and request a travel ban.

456
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:14,767
What?

457
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:17,333
I overheard involuntarily.

458
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,233
Did she enter Korea for a different purpose?

459
00:31:20,233 --> 00:31:23,067
She was given a work visa on
the premise that she came to work.

460
00:31:23,067 --> 00:31:26,933
In other words, it's a case of a cover job.

461
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,133
A cover job?

462
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:36,867
Through our agency, she became
the interpreter for the national team.

463
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:40,233
If she just leaves, it's expected to have
a significant impact and ripple effect

464
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:43,567
on our company's trust, so
there's nothing we can do about it.

465
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:47,067
Especially since the work visa was
granted to do work for the country.

466
00:31:47,067 --> 00:31:50,200
I will file a complaint through my lawyer

467
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,433
within the next 10 minutes.

468
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,933
So were you jealous?

469
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:05,033
This feeling of jealousy is natural.

470
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:06,200
Just be jealous.

471
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,700
People are appropriately imperfect
and appropriately perfect.

472
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,700
Really?

473
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,433
Of course, natural feelings
are the most important.

474
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,200
The same goes for love.

475
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,200
If you want to love, don't
hesitate even for a moment.

476
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,700
If you do it as much as you want
and fully, well, eventually…

477
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,967
You are dating with Mr. Lee, right?

478
00:32:24,967 --> 00:32:28,633
No? It's a misunderstanding,
a misunderstanding…

479
00:32:28,633 --> 00:32:31,100
Seeing you react, it seems you do
want to date with him in your heart.

480
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,667
Be honest with yourself, doctor.

481
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:37,567
Even Senior Shin is head over heels for
Sae Yan and unable to come to his senses.

482
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:41,800
I don't know why everyone pretends not to.

483
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,033
Now I'm dead.

484
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,733
My father won't stay still
if he hears about the lawsuit.

485
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:53,800
He is an incredibly scary person.

486
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:58,600
My dad is in an Italian gang.

487
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,267
Gang? What kind of gang?

488
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:12,400
You don't mean that gang, right?

489
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,033
And it's the biggest…

490
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,233
Call your mom now.

491
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:19,933
Tell your mom that the contract
talk earlier was all a lie

492
00:33:19,933 --> 00:33:22,067
and that there was a slight misunderstanding.

493
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:23,733
- Quickly, quickly…
- No, I can't do it.

494
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:25,267
Then I'll have to go back to Italy.

495
00:33:25,267 --> 00:33:26,633
What does it matter?

496
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:29,167
Call her right now. I'll do it for you.

497
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:30,167
There's no other way.

498
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:32,833
We must find my real
father as soon as possible.

499
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:35,867
I refuse… I don't want to
be involved with you anymore.

500
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:37,900
There's nothing we can do.
We're already on the same boat.

501
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,300
You will be driving, right?

502
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,400
Ah, this is driving me crazy.

503
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,333
Why did I get involved
with her in the first place?

504
00:34:10,367 --> 00:34:12,767
Player Lee Shin.

505
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:19,067
Are you undergoing treatment?

506
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:22,267
You must have been very
busy, ignoring my messages.

507
00:34:22,267 --> 00:34:24,900
I'm totally miffed.

508
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,833
What did you send?

509
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:30,667
My phone's battery died.

510
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:33,600
So it wasn't that you read and ignored it?

511
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,767
I was totally freaked out.

512
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:39,300
I sent something important yesterday.

513
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,733
I did an ex-boyfriend cosplay
and texted 'Are you asleep?'

514
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:49,367
But you're in rehabilitation treatment, right?

515
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:54,033
Are you by any chance not doing the interview?

516
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:58,567
Could it be that CEO Hong asked you to do this?

517
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:00,900
To persuade me?

518
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,067
No, then the reason for coming here is also…

519
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,067
I don't want to lie.

520
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:09,567
Oh my, he's taking advantage of you.

521
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:13,600
CEO Hong handles things very well.

522
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,033
It's not quite counseling.

523
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:20,533
Shall we just have a cup of coffee?

524
00:35:23,433 --> 00:35:27,500
Is this like a date or something?

525
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,400
The treatment actually has 20 minutes
left, but I'll just take 5 minutes.

526
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:37,133
Don't go anywhere.

527
00:35:43,633 --> 00:35:46,367
No, I have the right to my image.

528
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:49,567
I'll buy your portrait rights. Smile for me.

529
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:52,333
Don't do it.

530
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:59,467
You're good at taking photos like this,

531
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:02,467
but you don't like standing
in front of the camera?

532
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:08,833
I'm afraid everything will be exposed.

533
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:13,700
Originally, there is no Player Lee Shin.

534
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,733
I was just acting as my brother.

535
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:20,100
"Would my brother have played like this?"

536
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,033
"Would my brother have managed like this?"

537
00:36:23,033 --> 00:36:26,167
I've come this far by deceiving people.

538
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:29,133
But whenever I stand in front of the camera,

539
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:31,967
it feels like it's about to be exposed

540
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:35,100
that I'm just an empty shell.

541
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,867
It feels like people will recognize it.

542
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:42,267
That's an impostor.

543
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,433
What?

544
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:47,333
It's called "Impostor Syndrome."

545
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:51,900
Successful people often think,
"I've made it by luck, not by skill,"

546
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,133
'"What if I don't meet people's expectations?"

547
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:57,867
They always feel anxious.

548
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,100
Impostor Syndrome.

549
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,433
What's the cure?

550
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:03,867
"Acknowledge it."

551
00:37:03,867 --> 00:37:06,467
"And be honest with your feelings."

552
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:09,367
It says so in the theory book.

553
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:11,900
Does that make it better?

554
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,333
No, but you'll get used to it.

555
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:18,700
You just keep trying until you get used to it.

556
00:37:19,233 --> 00:37:22,100
Getting used to it…

557
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,333
Exercise is just about pushing
through with sweat, blood, and tears,

558
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:28,467
so I just have to endure and get it done.

559
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:33,667
But this thing never listens to me…

560
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:38,567
Because you and I are different.

561
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,667
How do I seem to you?

562
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:44,633
Do you think that, because I work in
mental health, I don't have any worries

563
00:37:44,633 --> 00:37:50,367
and that work, love, and life just
goes smoothly with a bit of mind control?

564
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:54,700
Not at all.

565
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,167
Even I can't have things my way.

566
00:37:57,167 --> 00:38:01,700
I also make up my mind
and reaffirm it many times.

567
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,500
Even after covering my ears, closing my eyes,

568
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:10,767
and clearing my mind, I find that
I end up getting distracted again.

569
00:38:12,967 --> 00:38:16,100
That's the worst for a doctor, isn't it?

570
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,167
We both have flaws.

571
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:22,100
I'll give you a prescription.

572
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,567
"Acknowledge it," and "be
honest with your feelings."

573
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,833
Let's do it together.

574
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:32,733
To acknowledge and be honest.

575
00:38:36,267 --> 00:38:38,467
By any chance,

576
00:38:38,467 --> 00:38:43,100
your brother's first love
hasn't contacted you, right?

577
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,433
Not at all.

578
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:48,400
Even the name is becoming vague.

579
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,733
Don't worry too much about his first love.

580
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,333
[Supporting the National Team]

581
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:11,500
[Media Day for the Republic
of Korea National Team]

582
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:16,800
If I had a talisman, I think I could
achieve what you mentioned earlier.

583
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,900
Come on.

584
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,567
A talisman.

585
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:35,767
I'm nervous.

586
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:38,533
Don't go anywhere and wait. Okay?

587
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:39,667
Oh, Shin.

588
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:43,000
Shin, it's ready inside. Let's go in.

589
00:39:57,233 --> 00:39:59,667
Here's the list of the youth department.

590
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:02,000
I barely got it.

591
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,767
Then the people who used to live there.

592
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:05,400
Are they all listed here?

593
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,967
Yes, they're all written down because
of the youth membership fees.

594
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:12,200
Well, if the numbers have changed,
there's nothing that can be done.

595
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,400
This is like looking for a needle in a sandbox.

596
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,967
By the way, who is this person?

597
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:20,233
You look familiar.

598
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:23,000
He's so good-looking that it feels like
you've seen him on TV or somewhere, right?

599
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,900
Indeed, I have something
of an idol's look, but I…

600
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,333
No, I don't watch TV.

601
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:31,000
Do you possibly not know me?

602
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,067
I feel like I've seen you somewhere.

603
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:39,100
Perhaps with that lady by the water yesterday…

604
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,600
Let's hurry. We're running out of time.

605
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,400
His grandmother used to
live here a long time ago.

606
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,633
What's her name?

607
00:40:49,267 --> 00:40:53,033
Her name is Jang Yang Rae.

608
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:55,533
The elder from the pear tree house?

609
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:57,600
Lee Shin's grandmother?

610
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,933
Oh my,

611
00:40:58,933 --> 00:41:02,033
Then are you Lee Goon?

612
00:41:02,033 --> 00:41:03,633
Has my grandma been talking about me?

613
00:41:03,633 --> 00:41:05,433
Oh my, what are you talking about?

614
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:08,433
It's me, you know? The persimmon tree
house uncle. Don't you recognize me?

615
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,100
I'm not really sure about that.

616
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,367
I lost my memories when I was young.

617
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:15,133
What's going on?

618
00:41:15,133 --> 00:41:18,533
Anyway, you've grown up so well.

619
00:41:18,533 --> 00:41:23,400
When you were young, you really
gave your grandmother a hard time.

620
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,200
- Me?
- Yes.

621
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,200
Back then, you didn't go to
school or speak for a while,

622
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,700
so your grandmother had a really hard time.

623
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,267
What was it that people said?

624
00:41:36,267 --> 00:41:40,467
They said someone died
because of the grandchild.

625
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:51,567
Oh my, Mr. Lee, are you alright?

626
00:41:53,867 --> 00:41:56,233
Try opening your eyes.

627
00:41:56,233 --> 00:41:58,733
Are you okay?

628
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,300
Hey, come out now.

629
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,133
Come out quickly.

630
00:42:07,133 --> 00:42:10,200
Stop joking and come out now.

631
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,333
Mom, take me with you.

632
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,467
Mom.

633
00:42:37,533 --> 00:42:39,300
No.

634
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,600
My medal!

635
00:42:43,033 --> 00:42:44,533
No!

636
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:46,667
Mr. Lee, you mustn't.

637
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:51,667
Mr. Lee, please don't do this.

638
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:03,900
Mr. Lee, are you okay?

639
00:43:05,867 --> 00:43:07,933
Are you alright?

640
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:08,933
Open your eyes.

641
00:43:08,933 --> 00:43:10,733
I can't see the face.

642
00:43:10,733 --> 00:43:13,033
The face of Ms. Ju Yeon.

643
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:16,800
- My medal…
- I'll bring it to you.

644
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:25,767
Just come out.

645
00:43:26,533 --> 00:43:29,167
Come out now.

646
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:58,733
Let's do it together,
acknowledge it and be honest.

647
00:43:58,733 --> 00:44:02,600
Accepting my feelings
and being honest about it.

648
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,800
Am I not unqualified?

649
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,600
Isn't that not allowed?

650
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,900
Where did Ju Yeon go?

651
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,533
- The power's off…
- Ah, right, right.

652
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:29,633
She said the phone was turned off.

653
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:33,600
Hey, have you been interviewing up
until now? What's the occasion?

654
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,167
Have you seen Ju Yeon?

655
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:36,400
- Dr. Kyung Ju Yeon?
- Yes.

656
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,133
No, I haven't seen her.

657
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,333
Got it.

658
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:43,433
Why is he so excited?

659
00:45:17,267 --> 00:45:20,033
Don't go, not anywhere.

660
00:45:20,033 --> 00:45:23,367
Don't disappear in front of me.

661
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:25,867
You.

662
00:45:25,867 --> 00:45:29,300
I thought you were dead.

663
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,633
You said you would bring it back to me.

664
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,100
Because of me.

665
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:40,367
I thought you died because of me.

666
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:43,200
It's enough now.

667
00:45:45,933 --> 00:45:49,200
It's enough now that you're in front of me.

668
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:55,700
I was afraid that even your
existence might be an illusion.

669
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,600
Thinking I was afraid that
it might all be an illusion.

670
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,767
Seeing your face,

671
00:46:12,767 --> 00:46:14,600
it's enough.

672
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,300
Since you're in front of me,

673
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,867
it's enough.

674
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:33,667
I'm not going anywhere.

675
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,400
I can't go now.

676
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:42,433
 00:48:00,400
- Here it is.
- What's this?

677
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,400
Sorry for being so prickly all day today.

678
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,000
Thanks, but were you prickly towards me?

679
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,367
I didn't even notice.

680
00:48:10,433 --> 00:48:12,600
Thank you.

681
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,267
Today, the swim team members said they would
show me how to do rehab through swimming.

682
00:48:19,267 --> 00:48:21,200
Let's go together.

683
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,433
Rehabilitation? What rehabilitation?

684
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:26,167
I'm not even an athlete, and I'm busy.

685
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:29,233
I have places I need to call one by one.

686
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:37,500
So, I can stay out late
with the guys today, right?

687
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,633
What?

688
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,700
- Sae Yan.
- Huh?

689
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,933
The zipper isn't all the way up.

690
00:49:21,267 --> 00:49:23,033
Why? Does your stomach hurt?

691
00:49:23,033 --> 00:49:25,733
Huh? No, that…

692
00:49:27,367 --> 00:49:31,167
I… I need to use the restroom for a moment.

693
00:49:35,733 --> 00:49:38,833
It's not that painful, is it?

694
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:45,033
How do I do this?

695
00:49:45,033 --> 00:49:47,367
Ah, well…

696
00:49:56,733 --> 00:49:59,000
Si On.

697
00:50:16,467 --> 00:50:18,733
Excuse me.

698
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,733
Go.

699
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:33,733
Ugh, hey, I…

700
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,733
Save me, please.

701
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,500
This zipper…

702
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,667
The zipper isn't going down.

703
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:51,467
My stomach hurts so much.

704
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:54,333
Just do it here.

705
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:56,967
Hey, I…

706
00:50:56,967 --> 00:51:01,800
I'm dying of embarrassment.

707
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:23,767
Jeez.

708
00:51:23,767 --> 00:51:28,067
How can I live with this embarrassment?

709
00:51:32,333 --> 00:51:35,533
Dr, Kyung said so.

710
00:51:35,533 --> 00:51:39,267
Expressing emotions, even jealousy, is normal.

711
00:51:39,267 --> 00:51:41,100
I told you to do it in a healthy way.

712
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,933
If you want to cry, cry, and
if you want to shout, shout.

713
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:46,567
This isn't expressing emotions, it's a crime.

714
00:51:46,567 --> 00:51:49,133
Apologize to her, now.

715
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,633
I'm sorry.

716
00:51:55,633 --> 00:52:00,867
Well, at least you didn't shit on
your clothes, so that's a relief.

717
00:52:20,033 --> 00:52:22,867
I'll give you exactly five minutes, come here.

718
00:52:22,867 --> 00:52:26,400
Really? What's the occasion?

719
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,600
If not, never mind.

720
00:52:34,767 --> 00:52:36,367
Of all people,

721
00:52:36,367 --> 00:52:39,600
I had to embarrass myself in front of Lee Shin.

722
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,167
Why do you always fight
when you meet Player Lee Shin?

723
00:52:43,167 --> 00:52:46,700
I don't know. Maybe we
were enemies in a past life.

724
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,433
How can he be so different from his brother?

725
00:52:49,433 --> 00:52:52,767
His brother even took me to
the countryside and helped me.

726
00:52:52,767 --> 00:52:54,700
With Mr. Lee, in the countryside?

727
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,467
Yes, the place I used to live.

728
00:52:57,467 --> 00:53:00,133
Mr. Lee said he lived there for a while
when he was a kid with his grandma.

729
00:53:00,133 --> 00:53:02,733
Ah, that place?

730
00:53:02,733 --> 00:53:04,667
Come to think of it, Lee Shin is such a liar.

731
00:53:04,667 --> 00:53:08,367
He insisted he didn't know anyone there,
but it turns out he lies every time.

732
00:53:08,367 --> 00:53:10,100
I'm looking for my real dad.

733
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:15,167
But last time he kept saying sorry and
claimed he figured out who I was looking for.

734
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:16,467
Your father?

735
00:53:16,467 --> 00:53:20,433
No? He thought I was looking
for some kind of first love.

736
00:53:20,433 --> 00:53:23,367
Out of the blue, what first love?

737
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:29,267
Crying suddenly makes me sleepy.

738
00:53:30,267 --> 00:53:32,400
So because of that, he…

739
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,533
He tried to get me fired…

740
00:53:36,433 --> 00:53:40,167
Get you fired? Why?

741
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:51,767
They say a child is the prettiest
when asleep. That's just right.

742
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:19,800
Do you want to go stargazing?
See you in 10 minutes at the entrance.

743
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,467
Hello?

744
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:32,467
Who is it?

745
00:54:38,848 --> 00:54:39,900
[National Team Training Center]

746
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,133
You don't remember me, right?

747
00:54:43,133 --> 00:54:46,933
I've heard about you from
my mother occasionally.

748
00:54:46,933 --> 00:54:50,500
And I've heard from Sae Yan too.

749
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,533
Then you must not have heard good things.

750
00:54:54,533 --> 00:54:58,033
After meeting Sae Yan and on my way back,

751
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,033
I was wondering if you could help me a bit.

752
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:05,867
Ever since she was little,

753
00:55:05,867 --> 00:55:10,500
you were the only person Sae Yan ever followed.

754
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:15,667
She used to sing about visiting
Ju Yeon when she grows up.

755
00:55:15,667 --> 00:55:17,600
Maybe,

756
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:23,100
she liked you more than me?

757
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,967
Please persuade our Sae Yan and send her back.

758
00:55:28,967 --> 00:55:31,767
The sooner, the better.

759
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:38,233
I'm sorry to say this, but…

760
00:55:38,233 --> 00:55:42,467
Sae Yan actually enjoys what she's doing now.

761
00:55:42,467 --> 00:55:45,500
Perhaps because it's the first time
she's trying something on her own,

762
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,133
she's even more diligent.

763
00:55:50,233 --> 00:55:53,300
You're probably wondering why I'm stopping her

764
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,267
from meeting her biological father, right?

765
00:55:56,267 --> 00:55:59,833
You might even doubt if I'm her real mother.

766
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:06,300
I can't tell you everything,

767
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,867
but it's all for Sae Yan.

768
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,867
I'm sorry,

769
00:56:13,867 --> 00:56:17,533
but no matter what the reason
is, Sae Yan is a grown adult,

770
00:56:17,533 --> 00:56:19,000
and neither I nor you, ma'am,

771
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,500
have the right to stop her life.

772
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,100
It's for your sake too.

773
00:56:27,733 --> 00:56:29,900
Me?

774
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,700
It would be better to convince her.

775
00:56:33,367 --> 00:56:38,033
I met with the agency CEO earlier,

776
00:56:38,033 --> 00:56:40,267
and that person was also on Sae Yan's side.

777
00:56:40,267 --> 00:56:45,533
Turns out he's Player Lee Shin's brother.
So that's why he protected her, right?

778
00:56:45,533 --> 00:56:47,100
Player Lee Shin?

779
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:51,700
Yesterday, he begged to take Sae Yan away.

780
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:56,367
If he finds out we are together now,
there might really be trouble.

781
00:56:56,367 --> 00:56:59,633
I'm not sure what you mean.

782
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:05,400
When he came for training in Italy,

783
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,367
it seems like the two of them met briefly.

784
00:57:07,367 --> 00:57:09,800
So when her father went to see him,

785
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,933
he was like,

786
00:57:11,933 --> 00:57:14,900
"I'm not the type to fall deeply for a woman."

787
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,167
"I just planned to meet a few times."

788
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:19,633
It was shocking.

789
00:57:21,633 --> 00:57:27,367
So those two knew each other before?

790
00:57:37,433 --> 00:57:42,000
You haven't been in touch with
your brother's first love, right?

791
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,100
Not at all. I barely remember the name.

792
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:49,200
I haven't met her since then.

793
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,600
If all that was a fabricated lie…

794
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,767

795
00:57:54,767 --> 00:57:56,267

Goon saw everything.

797
00:57:58,067 --> 00:58:02,100
That day, you and his first love were together.

798
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,133
That's right.

799
00:58:04,133 --> 00:58:07,267
We kissed in the hotel parking lot that night.

800
00:58:07,267 --> 00:58:10,333

Ta-da.

803
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,600
So the first love he was with…

804
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,633
Mr. Lee said he lived there for a while
when he was a kid with his grandma.

805
00:58:27,933 --> 00:58:30,533
Sae Yan is…

806
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:36,433
Sae Yan was his real first love.

807
00:59:21,133 --> 00:59:25,133
Player Lee Shin, where are you? Let's meet now.

808
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:06,967
Speak honestly.

809
01:00:06,967 --> 01:00:09,633
Is it true that you're not in touch with

810
01:00:09,633 --> 01:00:11,867

811
01:00:12,467 --> 01:00:15,000
That first love.

812
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,100
It's Jeon Sae Yan, right?

813
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,467
That's correct.

814
01:00:26,467 --> 01:00:28,733
Jeon Sae Yan.

815
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,933
Why…

816
01:00:33,933 --> 01:00:37,633
Why didn't you tell the truth back then?

817
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:39,333
Is that important?

818
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:42,433
If I had mentioned it back then, do you think
I could've hidden it in front of Jeon Sae Yan?

819
01:00:42,433 --> 01:00:44,000
You should have told me.

820
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,867
Would anything change?

821
01:00:45,867 --> 01:00:49,167
Back then and now, you are just
the first love my brother misunderstood.

822
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:52,000
Nothing more, nothing less, right?

823
01:00:53,267 --> 01:00:55,367
Why?

824
01:00:55,367 --> 01:01:00,933
Did you develop feelings for him
while pretending to be his first love?

825
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,500
Nothing will change.

is Jeon Sae Yan or not

As you have done so far, Ju Yeon, you just

829
01:01:12,967 --> 01:01:15,967
need to keep pushing him away.

830
01:01:25,267 --> 01:01:26,967
