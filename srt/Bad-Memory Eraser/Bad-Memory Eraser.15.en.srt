Whatever you do, you are caught
in self-pity and feelings of inferiority

11
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:06,200
since you'll never be able to
escape from past memories

12

13
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:09,933
Hey, are you out of your mind?

14
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:12,267
Why are you talking about injuries to him?

15
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:13,800
Just do your own job well.

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,267
And yet you live off your
younger brother shamelessly.

17
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:19,967
Mom!

18
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:26,300
Mom, take me too!

00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,767
No.

25
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:43,533
Thank you.

26
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:51,633
I heard about it from Shin

27
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:56,700
that you tried to protect Goon till the end.

28
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:00,833
But I ultimately couldn't protect him.

29
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,300
It's not your fault.

30
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,167
Before coming here,

31
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:10,700
I stopped by the police station
and saw the accident video.

32
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:15,600
You heard it from Shin, right?

33
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:21,533
That my two sons are living such unhappy lives.

34
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:24,233
I had no idea.

35
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:27,567
It's my fault for not taking care of my sons.

36
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,700
My son, Goon.

37
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,800
Can he get better?

38
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,767
The fact that we are by his side.

39
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:38,800
I'm not sure if that will be of help.

40
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,600
He needs

41
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,000
the family's support more than anyone else.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,067
The origin of his trauma
was a wrist injury, but

43
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:54,433
the trauma from being hurt and abandoned
by the family was the most severe.

44
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:59,267
There was no family to lean on
when times were the hardest.

45
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:05,733
All he has with us are bad memories, but how…

46
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:10,633
You can fill his bad memories
about family with good ones.

47
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:16,200
Will that make the memories
of the past disappear?

48
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,567
They won't disappear.

49
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:20,967
But,

50
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:25,700
the goal is to increase the importance
of current memories over past ones.

51
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:34,500
Every day, you lock yourself in that
gloomy room, drinking away.

52
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Do you know that our family is
suffocating because of you?

53
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
What kind of way is that
to talk to your brother?

54
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,867
What have you done so well?

55
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:43,300
You're both the same.

56
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,067
Ah, Mom, he's…

57
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,633
Oh my.

58
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:51,100
I can't believe this is why I gave birth

59
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,200
to you guys 27, 28 years ago.

60
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,100
Why do you talk like that again?

61
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,233
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:57,233 --> 00:05:00,100
I shouldn't have been born.

63
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,000
If I weren't here, everyone
would have been relieved.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,400
I should just disappear.

65
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,300
If I don't want to see this state
of affairs, I should leave home.

66
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,000
No, I'll leave.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,433
Everyone, come here and sit down.

68
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,600

69

Why are you making a fuss, taking
down all the trophies and photos?

70
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,033
Come here, and sit down now!

71
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,000
Come.

72
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:52,600
Up until now, I…

73
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,567
For the peace of the family,

74
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:58,467
I've been watching over, stepping down
from being the head of the household,

75
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:00,233
but it can't be like this anymore.

76
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:02,100
Starting today,

77
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,033
anyone who disturbs the peace
of our home will not be forgiven.

78
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,833
Your dad is right.

79
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,333
Grown-ups are still fighting each other.

80
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:15,560
The head of the family is talking!

81
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,700
Starting today, our family will be reborn.

82
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,533
In that sense,

83
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:23,400
let's create good memories as a family,

84
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,967
and take a new family photo.

85
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,033
From today on, there is no past.

86
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:29,867
There is only the present.

87
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:32,567

One more favor, please. Can
you take a picture of our backs?

94
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,867
Hey, turn around.

95
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:56,067
- One, two, three.
- Our backs.

Hey, it's really nice, right?

100
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,267
It's family's first-ever unity event.
It's just so heartwarming.

101
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:12,867
Even so, a picnic in
the dead of winter is a bit…

102
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,400
No, all their birthdays are in winter.

103

Let's eat up. Come on, eat up.

106
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:24,100
Wow, that looks delicious.

107
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,500
- Well, wow, that looks delicious.
- Ah, it's cold.

108
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,933
- Cola.
- Hey, don't open it, don't open it.

109
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:34,133
What's the occasion?

110
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,933
No dust got in, right? Alright, it's fine.

111
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,633
Huh, what's this?

112
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,067
Ah, it startled me.

113
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:47,667
Now, let's eat again.

114
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:51,433

- Yes?

You guys just go.

129
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,200
- Go?
- Do we have to go?

130
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,467
- What should we do about this?
- This…

131
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,033
How… Should we clean it up?

132
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:55,767
- Have some cake.
- Oh, cake.

133
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,033
It's delicious.

134
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:59,033

and helps with a good night's sleep.

140
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,533
Yellow curtains help alleviate
a lack of motivation.

141
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:56,033
Blue bedding reduces stress levels.

142
00:10:56,033 --> 00:11:00,200
Green rugs relieve physical and mental
fatigue and generate positive energy.

143
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,833
They aid emotional balance
and provide mental comfort.

144
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:08,633
I hope it's been of some help.

145

Have you by any chance not seen Sae Yan today?

160
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,333
You ask me every time. I said she hadn't come.

If you happen to see our Sae Yan,
please be sure to let me know.

Alright.

163
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,533
Come in.

164
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:08,667
Are those foreigners looking for Sae Yan?

165
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:12,200
How can there be absolutely no news like this?

166
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,067
It seems she is with her father in Seoul.

167
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:19,333
I wonder where she's hiding.

168
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,933
I shouldn't have sent her away coldly.

169
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:29,533
Is she upset with me? And is
that why there's no contact?

170
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:34,867
Should we… really not report it to the police?

171
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:37,333
No, don't report it to the police.

172
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,433
If the police find him.

173
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,100
Sae Yan will find out, right?

174
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,467
She'll find that her father
has a criminal record.

175
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:50,200
I don't want her to know that
her father is such a person.

176
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:57,333
I'm just worried that if her father harms her.

177
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,267
She's his daughter, surely not.

178
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:02,733
Oh, right.

179
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:06,133
Should I tell honestly to Ju Yeon?

180
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:08,433
Since they are close, they might
contact each other separately.

181
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:10,667
What about my daughter?

182
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:13,600
What about the pain my daughter will endure?

183
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,900
Do you mean that it's not okay for Sae Yan
to be hurt, but it's okay for Ju Yeon?

184
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,300
If you're going to say that,
don't ever come here again.

185
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,067
Ah, that…

186
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:28,133
It seems like I lost my reason
thinking too much about Sae Yan.

187
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:32,333
Sorry. I'm sorry.

188
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,967
Resignation letter?

189
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:43,100
What do you mean by this?

190
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,767
If someone has to resign, it should
be me. But why are you quitting?

191
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:50,233
It was me who persuaded you
to cover up the side effects.

192
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:55,033
Since it all started with my thesis,
I should take responsibility.

193
00:17:56,433 --> 00:18:01,400
The one who used the subject was
Te O, but it was not you, right?

194
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:05,833
Look.

195
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,467
Unlike mouse number 109,

196
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:12,600
there's no damage to the brain fuse,
and all brain circuits are normal.

197
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,833
It's just that everything has
returned to the way it was before.

198
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:20,433
What about the wounds
the test subjects received?

199
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:24,200
What about the shock and
pain of feeling betrayed?

200
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,767
Just like he said,

201
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:28,567
I turned his good memories

202
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:31,800
of a first love into bad memories.

203
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,000
And,

204
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,667
I also directly referred myself to
the ethics committee for disciplinary review.

205
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,800
Then I'll be the one to take that discipline.

206
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,633
I can't block my junior's
future just to save myself.

207
00:18:44,633 --> 00:18:47,800
Please promise to stay at
the hospital until the end

208
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,067
and take responsibility for the subject.

209
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:54,300
I can't trust Senior Te O.
Please take care of it.

210
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,867
Hey, Kyung Ju Yeon.

211
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,933
You are really…

212
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,067
A contract termination agreement?

213
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,733
Could you wait just a little longer?

214
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:33,467
He is momentarily anxious, so…

215
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:35,333
There's no more to say.

216
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,367
Stamp your seal on the contract
termination agreement. Don't drag it out.

217
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,567
I will continue as Si On's team doctor as well.

218
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:43,567
I'll at least manage to ensure there's
no problem with the rehabilitation.

219
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:46,867
If you could be understanding about
the CEO's vacancy for just a while.

220
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:49,867
CEO also agreed with it.

221
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:53,167
Shin's mother.

222
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,233
You said I'm your role model, right?

223
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,633
This is my sons' scrapbook.

224
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,300
For 20 years,

225
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,500
I collected articles about their
victories while taking care of them.

226
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,767
Oh my, this many?

227
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:31,733
That's really impressive.

228
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:35,367
Every time I collected a page,

229
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,533
it felt like my own medal of honor.

230
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:42,700
Because I was with them 24 hours a day

231
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:48,100
as their training coach, as a rehabilitation
therapist, and as a nutritionist.

232
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,900
I'm trying to transfer her company
to make Si On like this as well.

233
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,267
Please understand.

234
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,667
Shin's mother.

235
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,767
I realized I was never actually
a mother to my two sons.

236
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:29,167
Don't make the same
mistakes I did, Si On's mom.

237
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:56,267
Excuse me, Si On's mother.

238
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,600
Hey, Shin, Lee Shin.

239
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,867
If the termination agreement has been sent,
that is enough, but why call a busy person here?

240
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:11,067
It's you, right? You're the one who
spread the video of our Shin, right?

241
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:12,267
Oh my!

242
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:13,967
Don't come close. You have bad breath!

243
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,967
And this is a custom-fit suit!

244
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:19,033
Well, I just stated facts. Did I
commit forgery or something?

245
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:23,567
Thanks to you, CEO Hong, the ad
agency cut ties with us first,

246
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:26,133
and we don't even have
to pay the penalty, right?

247
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:28,767
Yeah, I'm the one who tipped them off.

248
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:31,500
It's kind of like a deposit.

249
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,733
Let's say you make a comeback after a year.

250
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:35,800
How would I know where you would go to?

251
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,133
You have to contract with
a big agency like ours

252
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:43,600
to completely clean up your negative
image, and rehabilitate your career.

253
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:47,433
There he comes.

254
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:51,267
Since you'll obviously join that rookie
agency just because the CEO is your family,

255
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:55,267
I need to half-ruin it, so you'll understand
how tough this industry really is, right?

256
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:56,333
Oops.

257
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,600
I heard that even Cha Si On terminated
her contract with your agency.

258
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,067
Are you shutting down now?

259
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:04,600
Look at you. You've totally
turned into a loser.

260
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,200
A loser, Lee Goon.

261
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
A loser? You're calling my son a loser?

262
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,633
Stop grabbing this!

263
00:23:09,633 --> 00:23:12,767
CEO Hong!

264
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,767
I made Shin to contract with your
agency for 10 years out of loyalty.

265
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:34,867
But what? What did you dare say to my sons?

266
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:36,367
Jeez.

267
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:38,700
Shin's, uh… No, ma'am!

268
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,400
In this business, once a contract is broken,
loyalty and everything else get trampled on,

269
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,633
tossed aside, and you're left
hanging. That's just how it works.

270
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:48,267
Are you talking about loyalty without
realizing how scary the big agencies are?

271
00:23:48,267 --> 00:23:50,300
I'm a former lawyer!

272
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,667
You know what a lawyer is, right?

273
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:54,433
Judges, prosecutors! They're all my friends.
I have many friends in the court.

274
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,833
You know a judge? Don't laugh!

275
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:00,767
I mean…

276
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:06,967
How did Si On's mother get here…

277
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,233
This is all a misunderstanding.

278
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:15,733
It's like a situation play…

279
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:20,100
If Player Lee Shin hadn't called,
I would have been fooled too.

280
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,733
It's collaboration with Ju Yeon.

281
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,933
I'll wait only while my daughter
is in rehabilitation.

282
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,000
Oh my, this contract…

283
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,000
No, I…

284
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:25,567
It's my first time drinking with my sons.

285
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:29,267
I never let you drink alcohol
since you are athletes.

286
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:32,200
I've drunk without you guys knowing, though.

287
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,667
It's my first time seeing Mom drink.

288
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:37,367
I'm a heavy drinker.

289
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:44,700
Shall I tell you a funny story?

290
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,280
When there was an accident 15 years ago,

291
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:56,267
when Goon injured his
wrist trying to save Shin.

292
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:59,160
Do you know what I was thinking?

293
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,060
I thought it would be better Shin got hurt.

294
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:10,230
I thought it would be better if Shin's
wrist was broken, not athletic Goon.

295
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,200
I'm cruel, right?

296
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,200
I was originally an ace volleyball player.

297
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,333
I damaged my growth plate
due to poor management.

298
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:39,367
As a volleyball player, I couldn't grow tall,

299
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:42,810
so I went from the court to the warm-up zone.

300
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:47,440
But after seeing Goon's athletic ability,

301
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:51,167
my heart fluttered again.

302
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:53,133
My son could do it.

303
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:56,460
I thought I should teach
him everything generously.

304
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:02,600
We pulled out the deposit for our rental,

305
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,667
made your dad retire,

306
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:08,967
and even scraped together his severance pay

307
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:12,833
to send all the money for Goon's coaching
and immigration costs to Australia,

308
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,800
but Goon's wrist got injured.

309
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:23,490
It must have broken Goon's heart,

310
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,530
so I shouldn't have done that.

311
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:31,870
I thought Shin would be able
to do it, if Goon couldn't do it.

312
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:35,167
To Shin,

313
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:38,733
I placed on him all the crowns
it was originally meant for Goon.

314
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:41,033
"You must do well."

315
00:27:41,033 --> 00:27:43,567
"You have to do both your
part and your brother's."

316
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:47,000
"Your brother's dreams
were hurt because of you."

317
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,770
"You must fulfill them all in his stead."

318
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,333
I brainwashed him, over and over again.

319
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:01,970
I thought that was for the sake of my two sons.

320
00:28:09,433 --> 00:28:11,370
No.

321
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,990
On second thought,

322
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:19,400
the grades you received,

323
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,200
the medals, the career,

324
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,910
all of it felt like it was mine.

325
00:28:28,867 --> 00:28:31,330
Through you, I…

326
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,970
I wanted to achieve the dreams I never could.

327
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,860
Shin.

328
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,020
It's time to stop.

329
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,400
You can stop sacrificing for the family.

330
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:56,610
You've done enough.

331
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:04,510
Goon.

332
00:29:07,733 --> 00:29:13,710
Don't get hurt because of your
greedy and selfish mom.

333
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,770
If your life is hurt because of me,

334
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:27,560
then your life would be too pitiful.

335
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:37,940
When there is thunder and lightning,

336
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:41,200
that's when I felt it.

337
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,190
The embrace of the mother I longed for…

338
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,340
"Now I have to hold you…"

339
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:52,550
That's what I thought.

340
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:09,500
Goon.

341
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,010
I'm sorry to you guys.

342
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:29,200
Parents aren't born as parents, right?

343
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,767
She wasn't a mother from the beginning,

344
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:35,080
and I wasn't a father from the start, right?

345
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,350
I'm sorry for being clumsy.

346
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:42,660
I'm sorry.

347
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:44,800
I'm sorry to you guys.

348
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,700
- Mom.
- Dad.

349
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,790
I love you.

350
00:30:57,333 --> 00:31:01,533
Oh, what a relief! Isn't it great?

351
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:04,567
Oh my, it's so nice.

352
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,500
You saw CEO Hong earlier, right?

00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,267
He probably has a palm
tattoo on his back by now.

354
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:18,233
What a foul temper…

355
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:20,167
Did you just say that to me?

356
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:22,333
Did I? When?

357
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:24,100
What…

358
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:28,767
Ugh, that refrigerator is really noisy.

359
00:31:29,933 --> 00:31:32,000
Goon.

360
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,133
Do you know why your mom
brought a refrigerator into this room?

361
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:39,660
I know that.

362
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:42,200
She just wondered what you were doing.

363
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,633
But it was awkward to just
open the door and look,

364
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:48,467
so she made up an excuse
about taking out side dishes,

365
00:31:48,467 --> 00:31:51,400
and looked inside more, right?

366
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,300
Lying here all together makes
me think of the old days.

367
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,600
Do you guys remember?

368
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:06,333
When Goon was assessed as a tennis prodigy,

369
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,667
we wanted to teach you well.

370
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:13,580
So we took out the lease deposit
and all crammed into a tiny room.

371
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,033
Ah, even though we lived in a tiny room,

372
00:32:18,033 --> 00:32:22,450
we were so happy being all together.

373
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:27,133
Hey, you guys might not know,

374
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:30,167
but when you guys were sleeping next to us,

375
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:32,267
we've done everything, even slept together.

376
00:32:32,267 --> 00:32:34,467

- Jeez.

377
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:36,133
Ah, why? You said it was thrilling.

378
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:39,200
- What are you saying? I can't hear it.
- Oh my.

379
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,267
Is it really tinnitus? I
hear something strange.

380
00:32:42,267 --> 00:32:43,633
Right? Goon, you can't hear it either, right?

381
00:32:43,633 --> 00:32:47,367
Really, why are they saying things like that?

382
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,333
The fact is,

383
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,167
I wasn't sleeping that day.

384
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:55,200
- Hey!
- What?

385
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:01,233
It's a joke.

Didn't you see something that day?

390
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:13,700
But Goon, what's gotten into
you? You are even making jokes.

391
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,167
What? We all just slept.

392
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,600

It's a complete mess because
there's no Dr. Kyung here.

has totally spread that they took a rebate.

But why do you call her Dr. Kyung
instead of calling her Elsa?

403

Actually, Dr. Kyung seems cold
because she's such a perfectionist.

There's no such a person like her.

Please leave.

530
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,700
Hey! You!

531
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,633
You!

532
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,033
Hey!

533
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:31,600
I'm sorry.

534
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:48,233
My medal…

535
00:47:48,233 --> 00:47:50,500
My medal.

536
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,500
- Excuse me.
- Just a moment.

537
00:47:55,367 --> 00:47:58,200
Where did the person with this medal go?

538
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,800
She was here few minutes ago.

539
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,033
Oh, there!

540
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:29,933
How about it? Let's see each other again.

541
00:48:29,933 --> 00:48:31,267
What, what?

542
00:48:31,267 --> 00:48:33,600

543
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,767
let's break up!

544
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:53,200

545
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,833
Lee Shin…

546
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:07,500
Then who is the person who threatened Lee Shin?

547
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,667
I can't just let go of the guy who bullied you.

548
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,233
This guy retired thanks to me.

Do you like my gift for you?

550
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:29,867

551
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:36,233
You didn't mess with Ju Yeon's family, right?

552
00:49:36,233 --> 00:49:39,600
Please don't hurt them. They didn't bully me.

553
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,433
Everyone has been really nice
to me. Like a real family.

554
00:49:42,433 --> 00:49:46,333
They have been the people I
loved the most since I was young.

555
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,667
Oh my, my daughter.

556
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:53,580
My daughter, you're so naive,
so it makes me worry.

557
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:59,130
Why do you think those people
are being so nice to you?

558
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,400
What does that mean…

559
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,733
Those people.

560
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:07,450
They are trying to get revenge on you.

561
00:50:09,467 --> 00:50:10,767
Revenge?

562
00:50:10,767 --> 00:50:13,300
Revenge for her own father.

563
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,033
Ju Yeon's father?

564
00:50:16,033 --> 00:50:18,320
Don't worry.

565
00:50:19,467 --> 00:50:23,960
They should know if they bully my daughter,
their own daughter will also be in danger.

566
00:50:25,133 --> 00:50:27,667
Don't worry.

567
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:29,867
Let's just see.

568
00:50:29,867 --> 00:50:35,080
It would be safest for you
to stay here for now.

569
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,900
Dad, dad.

570
00:50:50,433 --> 00:50:53,033

571
00:50:53,033 --> 00:50:56,033
Dad, please open the door.

572
00:50:56,033 --> 00:50:58,900
Ah, please!

573
00:51:13,867 --> 00:51:16,860
You know it's a fake pain.

574
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:22,680
Please don't call the doctor.

575
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:30,467
I can't call her anymore.

576
00:51:30,467 --> 00:51:34,790
Because Dr. Kyung is going to be resigned.

577
00:51:36,067 --> 00:51:39,867
I heard that she will be facing
the disciplinary review

578
00:51:39,867 --> 00:51:42,880
that will soon take place at
the ethics committee alone.

579
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:50,020
That has nothing to do with me.

580
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:53,133
This experiment.

581
00:51:53,133 --> 00:51:57,790
Before you, there was someone
who volunteered as a test subject.

582
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:00,720
Dr. Kyung.

583
00:52:05,167 --> 00:52:09,010
Dr. Kyung also has memories she wants to erase.

584
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:14,533
Her father is Professor Kyung Sang Hyun.

585
00:52:14,533 --> 00:52:18,133
He listened to all the stories
from the patients.

586
00:52:18,133 --> 00:52:22,933
He was famous for his high
reputation in mental health.

587
00:52:22,933 --> 00:52:25,670
But at the place where he went
for medical volunteer work,

588
00:52:27,133 --> 00:52:29,500
he was brutally murdered

589
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,000
by a patient.

590
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,800
And Dr. Kyung

591
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,050
happened to see it herself.

592
00:52:39,533 --> 00:52:41,800
At just 13 years old.

593
00:52:47,133 --> 00:52:49,933
Ah, dad.

594
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,733
- The clinic was stained with blood.
- Ju Yeon.

The face of that murderer.

597
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,830
She probably wanted to erase all her memories.

598
00:53:02,633 --> 00:53:07,333
She forgot all her memories
because of the shock.

599
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:12,260
But she remembers the face
of the murderer clearly.

600
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:16,270
She is still suffering from the trauma.

601
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:25,240
That's why she is even
more concerned about you.

602
00:53:25,867 --> 00:53:28,080
Because she's like you.

603
00:53:32,767 --> 00:53:37,000
You might not let go of your feelings,

604
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,820
but Dr. Kyung tried to protect
you until the end, Mr. Lee.

605
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:49,020
She deceived and used me.

606
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,920
She experimented with
my feelings, like a lab rat.

607
00:53:57,533 --> 00:54:01,160
