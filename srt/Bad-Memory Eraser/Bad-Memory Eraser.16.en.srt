The subject under review,
please state your case.

21
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:07,433
I am Kyung Ju Yeon, a psychiatrist
at Hanseom Hospital

22
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:11,133
and affiliated with the brain research center.

23
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:12,867
As the person in charge of
this clinical experiment,

24
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:16,933
please impose a fitting punishment
on me for hiding the side effects,

25
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:20,633
and I also requested the discontinuation
of this experiment,

26
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:25,167
which caused the side effects.

27
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,700
Who are you?

28
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,600
I'm Lee Goon, a subject in the clinical trial.

29
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,733
Mr. Lee Goon.

30
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:43,500
You're probably still not in good condition.

31
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,033
Please take a seat over there.

00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,967

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,600
Are you alright?

34
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,733
Originally, he was the patient suffered from
somatization disorder caused by bad memories.

35
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:14,233
It was a phantom pain.

36
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:17,200
When the bad memory was
erased, the pain disappeared,

37
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,800
but the pain returned like that
due to the reset experiment.

38
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,200
This proves that the reset
experiment is perfect.

39
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,267
Witness, can you continue?

40
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:34,467
If you're okay with it,

41
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:36,833
I will step out.

42
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:42,033
Facing me will be difficult for the subject,
as I am associated with his bad memory.

43
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:19,233
I heard that specific memories
were corrupted due to side effects.

44
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:20,767
Have they returned now?

45
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,467
No.

46
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:26,500
That memory is still the same.

47
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,533
Still the same?

48
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,933
How can that be?

49
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:35,367
Then Dr. Kyung Ju Yeon erased
Mr. Lee Goon's bad memory,

50
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:38,667
so do you not resent the clinical experiment?

51
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:42,233
I do not resent it.

52
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,533
Then, I will ask one last question.

53
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:51,267
Would you recommend this
clinical experiment to others?

54
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:56,067
The question is whether you would erase
a bad memory if you could go back to the past.

55
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,667
After the experiment,

56
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:08,767
I lived as someone else for a while.

57
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:15,633
I felt like I had gone from someone's
sidekick to the main character.

58
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:19,667
But then I realized that, too,
was a part of who I am.

59
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,467
While the past cannot be changed,

60
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:27,550
I learned that I can change myself.

61
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,860
If you ask me if I would
conduct clinical trials again,

62
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:36,600
no, I won't.

63
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:41,600
Because I

64
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:49,133
already know how to live differently now.

65
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,867
Then I'll inform you of the ethics
committee's review results.

66
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:24,433
Dr. Kyung Ju Yeon is recommended

67
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:28,733
to suspend clinical trials for three months.

68
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,133
Also, regarding the feasibility
of continuing the experiment…

69
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:36,567
Oh, Minister.

70
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:39,467
I heard it from Dr. Kyung.

71
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:43,110
They said it had totally deviated from
the original intention of the experiment.

72
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:45,133
No, it hasn't changed.

73
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:47,567
The ethics committee is the one
that approves this experiment,

74
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:50,100
but our institution is
the one providing support.

75
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,033
Is it true that you concealed
the death of a test subject

76
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:55,300
and proceeded with the clinical trial?

77
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:58,067
No, that's…

78
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:00,300
Yes.

79
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,567
It is true.

80
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:04,780
The subject was also unaware of this fact.

81
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,467
Were you aware of this, Director?

82
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:10,870
I just learned about that fact today as well.

83
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:13,200
I am ashamed.

84
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
We will withdraw our institution's support

85
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,267
and reclaim the remaining funds.

86
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:23,033
Furthermore, someone must
take responsibility for this matter.

87

Oh… Minister, Minister!

88
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,600

father, but there's been no contact.

He's a person with a criminal record

I can't go into details,

but he is a dangerous individual
who has committed murder.

00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:43,967
Why would Sae Yan's father try to harm Shin…

161
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,133
He's a stranger after all.

162
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:50,860
And yet he followed me so persistently.

163
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:53,833

Do you know him?

165

Huh? No.

166
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:05,867
Did you say that Ms. Jeon Sae
Yan has returned to Italy?

167

Are you going to meet your first love?

169
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:16,567
I heard that she didn't go
to Italy but is in Korea.

170
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:18,200
Strangely, I can't get in touch with her.

171
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,367
What do you mean by that?

172
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:20,867
What do you mean you can't
get in touch with her?

173
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:23,967
It seems like she found the father she had
been searching for and is staying with him.

174
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:28,800
So you mean she's with her real dad
now and can't even be contacted?

175
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,600
Yes, apparently her phone
has been off for a while?

176
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,200
Even without that,

177
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,100
it's a bit awkward to report to the police,
so I've decided to look with Ju Yeon.

178

00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:03,767
Have a seat.

359

[Consultation room]

360
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,567
Oh my, 2,000 won.

361
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:16,767
Right, Sae Yan's mom would be nice.

362
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:19,100
Sae Yan's dad returned from abroad, didn't he?

363
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,067
I heard you moved here
permanently to live with Sae Yan.

364
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:23,467
Do you like living together?

365
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:26,667
Did that person come here?

366
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:30,867
Yes, I even told him your home address.

367
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
Haven't you met him yet?

368
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,133
For now, take Sae Yan and stay out of sight.

369
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:41,433
Did I make any mistakes?

370
00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:44,100
I should inform Ju Yeon's father.

371
00:35:11,433 --> 00:35:14,867
Ah… Dad.

372
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:18,400
Ju Yeon, Ju Yeon.

373
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:21,300
Ju Yeon.

374
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:10,233
Ju Yeon, no.

375
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:12,633
No.

376
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:05,500
Ju Yeon.

377
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,433
Are you feeling better?

378
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,133
Mom.

379
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:11,833
What happened?

380
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:13,900
Where's Sae Yan?

381
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,933
She's safe.

382
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:18,733
You don't need to worry.

383
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,600
Ju Yeon.

384
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,933
Ma'am.

385
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,933
Ju Yeon.

386
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:39,700
It may sound funny

387
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,467
to say sorry,

388
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:47,033
but I'm really sorry.

389
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:51,167
Because of us,

390
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:54,033
we only gave you scars that can't be erased.

391
00:37:54,033 --> 00:37:56,100
Just…

392
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,867
Blame me for the rest of your life.

393
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:08,633
But even resentment was futile.

394
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:12,533
After Ju Yeon witnessed the incident,

395
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:15,567
she developed aphasia.

396
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:17,967
Her father died so miserably,

397
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:21,933
leaving no savings, and she was sick.

398
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,933
Because my daughter was suffering.

399
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:28,367
So far from resentment, I even
forgot about my husband's death.

400
00:38:28,367 --> 00:38:32,500
I had to become strong enough that
there was no business I hadn't tried.

401
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:39,600
That day, Sae Yan came to me,
but I couldn't turn her away.

402
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,967
What fault could she have?

403
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:45,233
If she were to find out,

404
00:38:45,233 --> 00:38:49,333
that bright face would
be shadowed for a lifetime.

405
00:38:49,933 --> 00:38:53,400
I forgave her for my own peace of mind.

406
00:38:54,567 --> 00:38:59,633
Ju Yeon, you can follow your heart.

407
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:09,667
I'm sorry.

408
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:12,833
I'm so sorry, so sorry.

409
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:15,667
Sorry, sorry.

410
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:39,167
I am sorry.

411
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:44,933
Sae Yan.

412
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:04,233
It's my fault.

413
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:07,233
Because of me, your dad…

414
00:40:07,933 --> 00:40:12,867
You and your dad…

415
00:40:14,933 --> 00:40:16,667
Is that why you're just standing like that?

416
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,500
You're not even comforting me.

417
00:40:20,767 --> 00:40:23,800
I'm not qualified for that.

418
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,500
It hurts.

419
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:34,200
Does it hurt? Should I call a doctor?

420
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,767
Hug me.

421
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,167
Ju Yeon.

422
00:40:54,867 --> 00:40:57,900
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

423
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:05,167
Stop, okay?

424
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:19,600
I think I should see you
once before I go back to Italy.

425
00:41:21,033 --> 00:41:26,267
She just woke up, and you
haven't visited even once, right?

426
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:28,933
She has gotten a lot better.

427
00:41:28,933 --> 00:41:31,600
I thought you might be wondering.

428
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:37,733
That…

429
00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:40,800
I heard it from Lee Shin.

430
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,733
That medal…

431
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:47,000
The medal that was said to be hanging
at the alumni reunion house, that…

432
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,667
Yes, I'm aware of it.

433
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:51,767
That it was you who hung it up.

434
00:41:51,767 --> 00:41:55,500
Yes, but now…

435
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,533
I heard that the person who found that medal

436
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:02,633
is both your lifesaver and your first love.

437
00:42:02,633 --> 00:42:06,333
It's not me.

438
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:11,867
I just kept it because it was
at the house I used to live in.

439
00:42:11,867 --> 00:42:16,633
I'm not your first love.

440
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,167
Then…

441
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:21,600
Then the person who found that medal

442
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,933
is the person who saved me?

443
00:42:24,933 --> 00:42:26,933
Is that important?

444
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:29,933
It's true that you came to like her because
you thought she was your first love.

445
00:42:29,933 --> 00:42:32,700
But it's not for that reason
that you like her now.

446
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:37,533
You still like Ju Yeon, right?

447
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,900
Today is the only chance to hold onto her.

448
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,100
Because she's leaving in a few hours.

449
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:57,167
- Ma'am, I'll call every day.
- Okay.

450
00:42:57,167 --> 00:43:01,767
Seung Hyun, take care of yourself
and avoid catching a cold.

451
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,900
You can come back again.

452
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,600
How can you not shed a single tear?

453
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,367
It's enough to have cried and
made a fuss for a week.

454
00:43:11,367 --> 00:43:14,233
Oh dear, even as a child, you were a crybaby.

455
00:43:14,233 --> 00:43:16,100
As a child?

456
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,200
Did your memories from childhood come back?

457
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,900
So what happened to that medal?

458
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,433
Who is the lifesaver?

459
00:43:24,433 --> 00:43:26,633
Could it be…

460
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,733
Isn't it pretty? Here, take this.

461
00:43:51,067 --> 00:43:54,333
Stay here, Sae Yan.

462
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:56,800
I'll catch it for you.

463

Please help here!

464
00:44:14,733 --> 00:44:18,233
Someone fell into water!

Are you okay?

466
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:34,800
Open your eyes!

467
00:44:36,433 --> 00:44:38,867

471
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,067
Did she go home?

472
00:45:29,933 --> 00:45:32,533
Sae Yan.

473
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:41,667
Did she go to Dad's hospital to find me?

474
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,433
No, Ju Yeon.

475
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:18,300
Ju Yeon's dad.

476
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,267
It seems that Sae Yan's dad
has just come out of prison

477
00:46:20,267 --> 00:46:22,533
and he has found out their house.

478
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:24,300
I heard that he's here now.

479
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,800
Sae Yan's mom went ahead
to run away with Sae Yan.

480
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,567
Stop your voluntary work
today and come home quickly.

481
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,667
Hello?

482
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,900
- Mom, where are we going?
- Where's Ju Yeon?

483
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,433
We can't see her anymore. Let's go quickly.

484
00:47:09,433 --> 00:47:11,800
Ju Yeon said she would
catch a butterfly for me.

485
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,733
I told you to hurry. Let's go quickly.

486
00:47:13,733 --> 00:47:17,633
Ju Yeon! Ju Yeon!

487
00:47:26,067 --> 00:47:30,133
- Oh dear, hey.
- Hey, Goon.

488
00:47:39,633 --> 00:47:43,633
Ju Yeon, it's Mom.

489
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:46,167
Ju Yeon, wake up, huh?

490
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:48,433
Ju Yeon.

491

Honey.

493
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:21,533
It wasn't a side effect.

494
00:48:21,533 --> 00:48:26,467
It's just that blurred memories
have become vivid again.

495
00:48:27,067 --> 00:48:31,033
Then Ju Yeon… Ju Yeon…

496
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:35,600

504

With a paper on the natural
healing ability of the human brain,

505
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,867
she has contributed to the advancement
of mental health medicine.

506
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:06,100
Congratulations. Please share
your acceptance speech.

507
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,500
Thank you.

508
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:14,000
My patient said this.

509
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,367
"If you bleed, you can apply ointment,"

510
00:50:16,367 --> 00:50:20,367
"but there's no ointment for a bruised heart."

511
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:21,900
"But,"

512
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:26,567
"bad memories also become
cherished memories as time passes."

513
00:50:26,567 --> 00:50:29,967
At first, I wondered, "How can a bad
memory become a cherished memory?"

514
00:50:29,967 --> 00:50:34,633
I thought, "Isn't that just
a so-called mental victory?"

515
00:50:34,633 --> 00:50:38,067
So, for the past three years, I studied

516
00:50:38,067 --> 00:50:41,000
the natural healing abilities
of a wounded human brain.

517
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,433
And,

518
00:50:42,433 --> 00:50:46,233
I discovered an amazing function of the brain.

00:50:46,233 --> 00:50:52,067

bruised wounds in the heart.

What are you doing here now?

523
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:13,733
How can a person's face be
so splendidly made-up?

524
00:51:13,733 --> 00:51:15,333
I look like an idol, right?

525
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:17,467
You are just crazy.

526

Ah, yes, CEO.

532
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,633
I told you to listen to what I'm saying.

533
00:51:30,633 --> 00:51:33,733
It's a one-man agency, but I have confidence
to achieve as much as Lee Goon's agency.

534
00:51:33,733 --> 00:51:37,067
CEO, our agency's player is
not happy with her makeup.

535
00:51:37,067 --> 00:51:38,267

Thank you, let's talk over there.

539
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,433
Ah, the atmosphere is nice.

540
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,167
Sir.

541
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,800
Sir.

542
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:56,867
Hold on.

543
00:51:56,867 --> 00:52:00,100
Are you by any chance the president's driver?

544
00:52:01,267 --> 00:52:06,567
Is there no way to meet
the chairman, not the president?

545
00:52:06,567 --> 00:52:10,767
Here, I will…

546
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:17,833
If you let me meet the chairman,
I'll take even more care of you.

547
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:20,433
I reported Lee Goon's condition to him,

548
00:52:20,433 --> 00:52:22,100
but only our agency was
ditched, only our company.

549
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,267
Is this fair?

550
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,833
With the chairman, huh?

551
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:31,600
Huh? Chairman.

552
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,500
I was waiting after receiving the call.

553
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,367
Oh my, thank you.

554
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:39,500
The chairman?

555
00:52:43,633 --> 00:52:44,900
Ah, yes.

556
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,833
Mr. Lee, come here.

557
00:52:48,633 --> 00:52:52,167
This is our chairman whom I've
been wanting to introduce to you.

558
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:54,200
Then…

559
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,900
is this person the chairman?

560
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,067
Well… Hello, I'm Lee Goon.

561
00:53:02,067 --> 00:53:06,200
Mr. Lee, it's been a while.

562
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,300
I dislike showing off,

563
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,133
but I've come to show off to you.

564
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:19,267
Our Dr. Kyung has come to Korea.

565
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:22,700
Dr. Kyung Ju Yeon?

566
00:53:30,367 --> 00:53:33,800
[You are invited to the 16th
Dongshin Medical Award Ceremony]

567
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,733
I owe Dr. Kyung Ju Yeon a bit,

568
00:53:36,733 --> 00:53:41,267
so I haven't stopped investing in your company.

569
00:53:41,267 --> 00:53:43,667
Of course, because I'm a businessman,

570
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:46,933
I also assessed whether
it was worth investing in.

571
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,633
Excuse me,

572
00:53:50,633 --> 00:53:53,800
if by any chance you meet Dr. Kyung,

573
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,967
please convey my regards impressively.

574
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,733
Please tell her that I paid off the debt.

575
00:53:59,733 --> 00:54:00,833
How so?

576
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:03,233
Impressively!

577
00:54:03,233 --> 00:54:04,800
Well then,

578
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,867
goodbye, I'm off!

579
00:54:06,867 --> 00:54:09,567
Chairman, let's go together.

580
00:54:16,267 --> 00:54:17,533
Dear, dear.

581
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:20,433
Did you receive the piggy bank
well? That's an Italian pig.

582
00:54:20,433 --> 00:54:25,067
I thought you meant to multiply the money.

583
00:54:25,067 --> 00:54:26,467
Do you know what happened to me today?

584
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:28,200
At the place where I work part-time…

585
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,000
Seung Hyun, let's eat.

586
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,267
Ma'am.

587
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:33,167
Yes.

588
00:54:33,167 --> 00:54:36,100
Auntie, you eat too.

589
00:54:37,533 --> 00:54:41,767
Oh my, aren't you busy all day?

590
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:44,800
It's just my routine. What's
the side dish for today?

591
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,767
Are those old-fashioned bowls still around?

592
00:54:46,767 --> 00:54:49,000
It's still the same.

593
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,667
Right! I've made bracelets for our family.

594
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:53,000
Want to see it? Just a moment.

595
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:57,000
Grandma, Mom wants stew.

596
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
No, not that stew, the soup next to it.

597
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,033
Ta-da!

598
00:55:07,033 --> 00:55:09,933
What? Where did she go? Ma'am! Seung Hyun!

599
00:55:09,933 --> 00:55:11,133
What? Where did everyone go?

600
00:55:11,133 --> 00:55:14,533
Seung Hyun! Are you doing this to
me just because your mom is here?

601
00:55:15,467 --> 00:55:19,000
I'll wait, chew your food well.

602
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,333
Professor Han.

603
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:33,300
Oh dear.

604
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:37,600
How long do we have to keep
this relationship a secret?

605
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,500
Because it's embarrassing. That's why.

606
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,300
What is embarrassing?

607
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:46,733
By the way, Dr. Kyung is
also stopping by tomorrow.

608
00:55:46,733 --> 00:55:50,300
Let's clear things up this time.

609
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,167
No, I can't.

610
00:55:52,167 --> 00:55:55,200
I can't because it's embarrassing.

611
00:55:56,133 --> 00:55:59,833
No, we are not children…

612
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:03,233
What's there to be embarrassed about?

613
00:56:03,233 --> 00:56:06,033
I mean…

614
00:56:06,033 --> 00:56:10,633
I usually consider a man's appearance
important when meeting him.

615
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,200
I can't say it because it's embarrassing.

616
00:56:15,733 --> 00:56:20,567
What part of me did she look at?

617
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:24,200
Am I embarrassing?

618
00:56:25,533 --> 00:56:27,300
Nurse Song.

619
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,567
Nurse Song.

620
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:40,600
We almost got caught dating.

621
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,967
By the way,

622
00:56:41,967 --> 00:56:45,067
everyone at the hospital knows
that those two are dating.

623
00:56:45,067 --> 00:56:46,800
But why are they acting like that?

624
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:50,533
Usually, a secret office romance is
only a secret to the couple involved,

625
00:56:50,533 --> 00:56:54,533
and everyone else knows about it.

626
00:56:54,533 --> 00:56:56,767
Shall we continue

627
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,067
what we were doing?

628
00:57:11,733 --> 00:57:15,267
Oh my, how beautiful.

629
00:57:15,267 --> 00:57:16,600
Ah, my foot hurts.

630
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,400
Oh my, what should I do? Ah, I am sorry.

631
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,400
Honey.

632
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,533
You didn't step on this on purpose, right?

633
00:57:21,533 --> 00:57:23,567
No, no, that's not it…

634
00:57:23,567 --> 00:57:26,967
They say, "Experience tells the truth."

635
00:57:26,967 --> 00:57:30,400
I should have tried dancing like this to know.

636
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,000
Since we have a lot of time,

637
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,767
it's so nice to share
a hobby together like this.

638
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,100
- Sleeping in too…
- Ah, sleeping in?

639
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,500
Is waking up at 5 A.M. sleeping in?

640
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,667
You have to wake up at 5 P.M.
for it to be considered sleeping in.

641
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,800
Wait a minute, just a minute.

642
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,467
I have prepared it.

643
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,467
Jeez.

644
00:58:04,767 --> 00:58:05,800
Oh, I am sorry.

645
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,833
Honey.

646
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:11,133
If dancing doesn't suit you,
how about kickboxing as a hobby?

647
00:58:11,133 --> 00:58:15,200
No, no, I think dancing is in my blood.

648
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,133
Oh my.

649
00:58:18,867 --> 00:58:20,567
I've seen a lot about dancing.

650
00:58:20,567 --> 00:58:22,567
Jeez.

651
00:58:22,567 --> 00:58:26,267
- Aren't you going to learn dancing?
- No.

652
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,933
- I'm home.
- Oh, come on in.

653
00:58:28,933 --> 00:58:30,200
Oh? You came early?

654
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,367
Cool, isn't it?

655
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:41,833
The kids won't play with me.

656
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:43,533
- Why?
- Why?

657
00:58:43,533 --> 00:58:46,467
Hey, you should get along. You're
going to college, aren't you?

658
00:58:46,467 --> 00:58:49,533
They are ostracizing me just because I'm old.

659
00:58:49,533 --> 00:58:54,400
Hey, you still have to go to school.
What if the teacher doesn't go to school?

660
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,300
Get along well with others. Oh, right!

661
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,733
I'm hungry, so could you
please make some ramyeon?

662
00:58:58,733 --> 00:59:02,067
And add two eggs!

663
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:05,367
Alright.

664
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,933
Feels like you're going to fly away?

665
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:32,033
Aren't we going to end up
in a competition like this?

666
00:59:34,967 --> 00:59:36,000
Yes, Mom.

667
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,400
The awards ceremony is over,
and now I'm heading up to Seoul.

668
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,467
I came for the awards ceremony,
so I have to go back in a few days.

669
00:59:42,467 --> 00:59:43,933
Right away?

670
00:59:43,933 --> 00:59:48,667
Your sister and Seung Hyun is waiting for you.

671
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:50,533
Come safely.

672
00:59:50,533 --> 00:59:52,900
Okay, got it.

673
01:01:30,767 --> 01:01:35,167
You're lucky because you're my first love.

674

675
01:01:40,233 --> 01:01:43,233
