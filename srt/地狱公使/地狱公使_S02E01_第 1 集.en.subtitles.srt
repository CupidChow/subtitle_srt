1
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,442
YULHYE ANGELS HAVEN

2
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,846
Heejung.

3
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,529
Jung Jinsu!

4
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,741
Don't move, you bastard.

5
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,162
Where is Heejung?

6
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,457
I will tell you where she is

7
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,335
after you listen to my story.

8
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,881
Twenty years ago…

9
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,218
I received a prophecy.

10
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,554
"Jung Jinsu."

11
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,560
"Twenty years from now, at 10:30 p.m…

12
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,398
you are bound for Hell."

13
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,952
The prophecy will be fulfilled…

14
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,539
ten minutes from now.

15
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,292
Why did you use my daughter?

16
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,795
What do you think my sin is?

17
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,423
Why did you get my daughter involved?

18
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,467
Please, Detective.

19
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,638
Please. Just listen to me.

20
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,141
Your sin?

21
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,393
Probably none.

22
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,646
Or maybe something
as petty as stealing a pencil or two.

23
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:27,564
Why?

24
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:33,027
How can I not have sinned
when I am bound for Hell?

25
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,572
You didn't grill Park Jungja
about her sins.

26
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:39,784
You would have if you were sure
that only sinners were bound for Hell!

27
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,206
No wonder you're a detective.

28
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,338
But you know…

29
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,634
I have never…

30
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,806
stolen anything in my life.

31
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,725
I have never lied

32
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,936
or hurt anyone's feelings.

33
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,356
I've never done anything wrong.

34
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,610
I believed…

35
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,865
that my mother would come back for me…

36
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,785
if I behaved myself.

37
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,627
I thought God had made a mistake.

38
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,794
Think about it.

39
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,797
God wouldn't punish humans at random.

40
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,010
But it turns out He does.

41
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,097
I have been living every moment in fear…

42
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,311
ever since I received the decree.

43
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,188
For 20 years.

44
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,899
For 20 long years.

45
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,653
Isn't that too long?

46
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,155
"Would this be a sin?"

47
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,823
"Would that be a sin?"

48
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,035
You cannot afford to be complacent,
even a second.

49
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,996
People don't understand
how privileged they are

50
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,249
to be complacent and oblivious!

51
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,503
I was saving people
while trembling in fear,

52
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,047
but they didn't even realize

53
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,175
how much of a privilege it was
to stand and do nothing,

54
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,469
even though they were all sinners.

55
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,389
People need to feel the fear.

56
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,141
The fear of sin.

57
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,228
The fear of possibly committing a sin.

58
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,814
The fear of ignoring the sins of others.

59
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,858
The fear that is relentless.

60
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,654
The fear of eternal pain.

61
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,741
That fear

62
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,953
will save mankind.

63
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,290
And it will…

64
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,835
set us all free from sin.

65
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,841
Your daughter

66
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,136
should be waiting for you at home.

67
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,764
I will give you free will, Detective.

68
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,934
You have two options.

69
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,230
Those creatures will come…

70
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,067
and kill me now.

71
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:24,198
Filming it and showing it to the world
will spark chaos among people.

72
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,287
Then you can go home…

73
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,794
and arrest your own daughter
for murdering your enemy.

74
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,713
If you do that…

75
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,344
you might be able to keep
your ideal world for a little longer.

76
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,097
If that's not what you want…

77
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,685
just keep quiet about my death…

78
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,898
and you can freely enjoy…

79
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,069
this new world I created

80
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,072
with Heejung.

81
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,122
They are here.

82
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,754
I'll leave the world in your hands.

83
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,133
If you choose to keep quiet…

84
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,640
please take care of my remains.

85
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,507
Enough.

86
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,868
You scared me.

87
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,497
What's wrong?

88
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,875
Who are you?

89
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,334
What?

90
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,630
Did you have a bad dream?

91
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,304
It's okay.

92
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,098
It's okay.

93
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,309
You're awake now.

94
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,937
Tomorrow is the day.

95
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,440
Come pick me up at two o'clock.

96
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,108
And then

97
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,236
we'll start a new life.

98
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,114
Just the two of us.

99
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,201
Just you and me.

100
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,287
No one else.

101
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,748
A fresh start.

102
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,255
Go back to sleep.

103
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,591
Okay?

104
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,695
-Ducks?
-Quack, quack.

105
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,364
-Sparrows?
-Tweet, tweet.

106
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,574
-Pigs?
-Oink, oink.

107
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,660
-Honeybees?
-Buzz, buzz.

108
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,495
-Ducks?
-Quack, quack.

109
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,288
-Sparrows?
-Tweet, tweet.

110
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,248
Pigs?

111
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,964
I told you to wait in the car.
We have to leave before Jinsu sees us.

112
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:50,881
That's me.

113
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,593
And you

114
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,803
are my mom.

115
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,097
What do you mean?

116
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,307
You're my mom!

117
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,892
What are you saying?
We have to go before Jinsu sees us!

118
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:33,883
What now?

119
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,934
How could you?

120
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,230
You said you'd be back soon.

121
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,732
I see.

122
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,610
It was because of a guy.

123
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,614
What are you talking about?

124
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,324
What's your damn problem?

125
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,159
Why did you abandon me?

126
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,829
Let go!

127
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,207
Let go of me, you fucking asshole!

128
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,168
Go ahead! Kill your wife and kid!

129
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,503
Just kill everybody!

130
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,101
Dad, please stop!

131
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,024
Get back inside, Jinsu!

132
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,361
Jung Jinsu!

133
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,449
Jinsu!

134
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,284
Go back to your room!

135
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,831
I told you to stay in your room!

136
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,114
No.

137
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,116
Stop.

138
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,882
Please stop.

139
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,968
Where am I?

140
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,306
Who am I this time?

141
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,256
Excuse me.

142
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,426
Are you all right?

143
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,428
Excuse me.

144
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,482
Jung…

145
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,068
Jung Jin…

146
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,195
Chairman Jung Jinsu!

147
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:32,908
Chairman Jung!

148
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:44,962
Jung…

149
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,672
Jung Jinsu.

150
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,283
HELLBOUND SEASON 2

151
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,996
Join the demonstration!

152
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,123
Judgment day is here!

153
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,482
THE ARROWHEAD SHOWS GOD'S MERCY

154
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:56,658
Demonstration is the only redemption.
The Arrowhead is God's only apostle.

155
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,967
Greetings, everyone.

156
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,971
I'm Miss Sunshine.

157
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,061
Sinner Jung Gyeongseok here

158
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,980
received a decree one month ago.

159
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,774
Isn't that right?

160
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,067
Yes, that's right.

161
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:34,071
And in 20 minutes,
he will receive his demonstration.

162
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,990
Yes, you are correct.

163
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,078
Why are you going to Hell?

164
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,706
What could your sin be?

165
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,999
-Spill it!
-Well…

166
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,044
Back when I was a student…

167
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,966
I was a bully at school!

168
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,970
Did you know that the kid you bullied

169
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,347
is still suffering from the trauma

170
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,475
and living a tormented life?

171
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,478
I had no idea. I really didn't know!

172
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,564
You ruined someone else's life,

173
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,900
and then went on
to live a happy and successful one

174
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,735
supported by your parents.

175
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:19,741
Have you ever considered
how that would make the victim feel?

176
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,909
No, I haven't.

177
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,123
You truly are a scumbag.

178
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,458
Mr. Jung.

179
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,629
You scumbag!

180
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,684
Stand by.

181
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,187
One, two, action.

182
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,063
All right!

183
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,774
Hello, fellow members of the Arrowhead!

184
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,401
This is Pinwheel.

185
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,238
Cultural critic Kim Seokcheong
is joining us today

186
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:03,076
on our broadcast
of Sinner Jung Gyeongseok's demonstration.

187
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,204
The Arrowhead!

188
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,039
The Arrowhead.

189
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,333
Now.

190
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,001
What do you think?

191
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,588
Do you believe Mr. Jung's sin

192
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:19,801
is something that can be forgiven by God
through our efforts?

193
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,719
You see,

194
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,014
school violence is a serious issue.

195
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,642
What makes it so serious

196
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,145
is that it leaves victims
with severe childhood trauma.

197
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,064
It can be quite serious.

198
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,441
Do you mean he's unlikely to be forgiven?

199
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,902
Exactly. It wouldn't be easy.

200
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,612
However,

201
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:45,953
Sinner Jung Gyeongseok came to us
to inform us of his decree.

202
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,705
Not the New Truth,

203
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,875
who exploit God's divine intervention
for their own gain.

204
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,877
He came to us, the Arrowhead,

205
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,047
who would do anything
to uphold God's will.

206
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,090
That's right!

207
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,800
-Yes!
-That's right!

208
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,178
You did the right thing,
Sinner Jung Gyeongseok.

209
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,099
Facing your demonstration
with the New Truth

210
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,142
would be an insult to God's name.

211
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,187
By choosing us, the Arrowhead,

212
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,232
you have earned
a chance to redeem yourself.

213
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:20,737
The Arrowhead!

214
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:31,081
God sent a decree to an innocent baby

215
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:34,584
to punish its mother and father
for their sins.

216
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:40,173
Bae Youngjae and Song Sohyun
always mocked and distrusted God's will.

217
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,343
They even dared to disrespect God

218
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,554
by attempting to hide the decree.

219
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,600
However, they had a change of heart
in their final moments.

220
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,980
They submitted themselves
to God's retribution,

221
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,649
accepted the flames of purgation,
and went to Hell.

222
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:04,031
That is the reason we pay tribute
and commemorate their deeds.

223
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:09,036
And all of this
was God's merciful intervention,

224
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:16,293
guiding us in the ways of repentance
and the pursuit of atonement for our sins.

225
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:19,171
The Arrowhead!

226
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,726
She's bringing out the big guns already!

227
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,728
It's lighting a fire in my heart.

228
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,693
I lost this arm
during Sinner Kim Minjae's demonstration.

229
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,238
I threw myself over him
to join his demonstration,

230
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,993
and the executors from Hell
burned it off alongside him.

231
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,540
God… took my flesh,

232
00:22:56,333 --> 00:23:00,420
but He did not forgive Kim Minjae
for his sins.

233
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,923
However,

234
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:07,552
seeing all of you filled with such faith,

235
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:11,431
I am certain
that things will be different today.

236
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:24,861
Today, I stand here before you
to atone for my sins once again.

237
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:29,032
When Sinner Jung Gyeongseok
faces his demonstration,

238
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:33,412
I will again throw myself over him
to protect him.

239
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,665
Thank you, Miss Sunshine.

240
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,458
Everyone,

241
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,211
are you with me?

242
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:47,509
The Arrowhead!

243
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:51,471
The Arrowhead!

244
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,953
They're here!

245
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,413
Hang in there!

246
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,416
Three minutes from now!

247
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,753
Hold your ground, everyone!

248
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:24,796
You must hold on!

249
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,966
Right. Bae Youngjae and Song Sohyun
held out for three minutes

250
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,801
before facing their demonstration.

251
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:33,763
That's what we're trying to reenact here.

252
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:37,976
Go!

253
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,487
Move out of the way!

254
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,117
Pull him!

255
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,093
Untie him!

256
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,225
Stop it, you crazy bastards!

257
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,101
I'm not going to die!

258
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,572
What did I do wrong?

259
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,990
Why do I have to die?

260
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:43,959
Grab him!

261
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,006
Stay away from me!

262
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,259
Get away from me, motherfuckers!

263
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,103
You are all crazy.

264
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,022
You crazy bastards.

265
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,899
You're all crazy.

266
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,412
No.

267
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,413
No!

268
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,503
No!

269
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,338
Pile on him!

270
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,938
They… were not forgiven.

271
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,858
Our dear Miss Sunshine

272
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,528
has passed on
along with Sinner Jung Gyeongseok.

273
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,989
Such a noble sacrifice!

274
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,452
We were with her every step of the way…

275
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,414
and God will take care of our souls.

276
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,749
Yes, that's right.

277
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,001
I'm certain.

278
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,380
By the way…

279
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,259
what the hell is the New Truth doing?

280
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,512
What's Kim Jeongchil doing?

281
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,848
Eight years have passed
since Chairman Jung Jinsu vanished,

282
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,476
leaving behind a clue about God's will,

283
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,020
but they're only spreading lies
to make personal gains.

284
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:14,109
No one believes you're the ones
carrying out God's will anymore.

285
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,027
Who on earth would believe that now?

286
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,323
Kim Jeongchil is the real cult leader!

287
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,993
We, the Arrowhead,
will not just sit back and watch.

288
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:29,124
The New Truth is not embodying
God's message for humanity

289
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,458
genuinely nor truthfully!

290
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,795
We swear on our name
that we will not forgive you.

291
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:36,881
The Arrowhead.

292
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,216
The Arrowhead.

293
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,134
The Arrowhead.

294
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:40,760
The Arrowhead.

295
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:42,721
The Arrowhead!

296
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,818
IS KIM JEONGCHIL FOLLOWING
JUNG JINSU'S INTENTIONS?

297
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,777
BY KIM SEOKCHEONG

298
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,071
This goddamn bastard.

299
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,283
How many were at my lecture today?

300
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:06,202
Around 200, I think.

301
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,789
How many seats were there?
A lot of them were empty.

302
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,792
There were 400 seats,
but today is a weekday.

303
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,671
It seems the Arrowhead reserved
most of the seats and then canceled.

304
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,966
I don't get it.
What the hell is their problem?

305
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:24,179
They wouldn't even exist
if it weren't for us.

306
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,180
You're right.

307
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,266
What's going on?

308
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,312
For God's sake, these bastards.

309
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,066
Hey! Back up!

310
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,860
-Yes, sir!
-Drive!

311
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:39,778
I'm on it!

312
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:41,780
Fuck!

313
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,740
Hey! Back up!

314
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,074
Go! Hurry!

315
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,581
Sir!

316
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,336
-Get him!
-Come here!

317
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,046
Kim Jeongchil!

318
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,219
No!

319
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,075
Get going!

320
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,256
Sir!

321
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,925
Sir!

322
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,302
Are you okay?

323
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:52,851
For fuck's sake!

324
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,773
Get off!

325
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,048
Sir!

326
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,431
-Get the symbol off the car now!
-Yes, sir.

327
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:34,601
-Didn't you know about the rally?
-We'll tighten security for the--

328
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,436
Security? Are you kidding me?

329
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,438
-No public events from now on.
-Yes, sir.

330
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:41,232
Sir.
Senior Secretary Lee Sugyeong is here.

331
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,568
Senior secretary? What's she doing here?

332
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,114
Sorry, sir.

333
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:51,117
She just barged in this morning,
demanding to see you.

334
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,285
Where is she now?

335
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,078
She's waiting in your office.

336
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,464
Chairman Kim.

337
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,092
-You can go.
-Yes, sir.

338
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:16,851
Did you get hurt?

339
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,020
Well, yes. Just a little.

340
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:19,938
Dear me.

341
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,856
Those Arrowhead bastards.

342
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:26,903
You even moved your main office
to the outskirts of Seoul to avoid them.

343
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,031
But you're still having a tough time.

344
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,787
It's a pleasure to meet you.

345
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,123
I'm Lee Sugyeong,
senior secretary to the president.

346
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,126
Right!

347
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,381
I just love mountains.

348
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,592
I try to go hiking whenever I can.
That's why I look like this.

349
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:55,682
The new government just took office.
I'm not familiar with all the new faces.

350
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:56,975
Right.

351
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,434
Can I get you a drink?

352
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:09,362
These days, nobody really cares
what the government does, do they?

353
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,949
It's the age of religion now, you know.

354
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,744
So what can I do for you,
Senior Secretary Lee?

355
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,000
The president

356
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,671
is deeply concerned about the way
things are in the world these days.

357
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,259
The baby's demonstration
significantly weakened

358
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,344
the New Truth's influence, didn't it?

359
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:39,600
The Arrowhead interpreted the case first
and used it to expand its power,

360
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,269
and now, well,

361
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,732
they are flouting the entire legal system.

362
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,694
Those crazy bastards
are inciting terror all over the place.

363
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:53,489
What's the point of the police
catching them and taking them to court?

364
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,158
If they don't like the verdict,

365
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:59,203
they dox the judges
and terrorize them too.

366
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,623
So who would give them
the punishment they deserve?

367
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,002
At this rate,

368
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:10,548
those maniacs will soon be controlling
the whole country.

369
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,514
There are frauds everywhere.

370
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,603
But still,
a fraud with dignity like the New Truth

371
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,607
is a touch better, don't you think?

372
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,444
What? Fraud?

373
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,364
Why?

374
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,409
Aren't you a fraud?

375
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,252
Chairman Kim.

376
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,422
We must bring it back.

377
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,969
We must bring the world back
to the place where rules stand.

378
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,931
The Arrowhead has already
spread like cancer,

379
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,724
so how do we do that?

380
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:06,604
The moment Park Jungja's demonstration
was broadcast to the entire nation,

381
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,816
the world crossed the Rubicon.

382
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:13,277
But we still need to maintain
some level of control.

383
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:18,074
A society without rules cannot survive.

384
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,408
So,

385
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:26,958
let's find a way together
to make people listen to the New Truth.

386
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,379
So, what? You want us
to come up with a new doctrine?

387
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:36,717
We were the first to interpret
the newborn's demonstration.

388
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,262
The Arrowhead just copied what we did.

389
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,305
Sure, I'm well aware.

390
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,225
I know that whatever
the Arrowhead and New Truth say,

391
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,602
it's pretty much the same thing.

392
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,981
But what do you think makes
the Arrowhead's voice louder?

393
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,860
Frankly speaking,
has anyone from the New Truth

394
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,821
thrown themselves
at these so-called "flames of purgation"?

395
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,114
-No.
-That's…

396
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,661
That is a blasphemous sin
that distorts God's will

397
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,788
and obstructs His divine intervention!

398
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,292
I'm not asking you
to throw yourself at them.

399
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,960
Don't get worked up.

400
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,713
What's important is
to have something symbolic.

401
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,967
The New Truth also needs
a symbolic figure like that.

402
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,053
The story doesn't matter,
but the character does.

403
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,055
You need a compelling character.

404
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,558
A character?

405
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,023
Is that how you wanna play it?

406
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,953
My staff had to work really hard
to find this.

407
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,678
How did you…

408
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,402
The New Truth has Park Jungja now, right?

409
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,994
Where is she?

410
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,492
How long have you kept her here?

411
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:11,414
Four years ago, our security caught her
walking out of the sacred site

412
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,583
when she came back to life.

413
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,670
How is she? Is she able to talk?

414
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,800
It's only been a year
since she started talking to us.

415
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:27,596
Before then,
she just kept muttering gibberish

416
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,475
and calling out her children's names,
Eunyul and Hayul.

417
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,354
I think she might tell us something
if she sees her kids,

418
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,274
but Sodo hid them so well.

419
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:42,361
So you've found out nothing so far?

420
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,909
Didn't she talk about Hell
or something like that?

421
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,456
Indeed, she talks,
but no one can understand her.

422
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,666
What she says doesn't make sense.

423
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,962
She just talks to herself
rather than responding to our questions.

424
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,175
It's impossible to find a truth
that the public would understand.

425
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,391
There's no such thing as the truth!

426
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,018
Man.

427
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:22,985
It's funny how a cult leader
is seeking the truth.

428
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,990
Have you lied so much
you've started to believe your own lies?

429
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,623
Listen carefully.

430
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,668
If the opposition
wins a majority in the assembly,

431
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,671
it will be the Arrowhead's world.

432
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,758
Anarchy without any rules whatsoever.

433
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,427
Would they take it that far?

434
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,846
Opposition or not, they're politicians.

435
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,556
That's exactly why.

436
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,644
All they ever care about
is the election ahead of them.

437
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,728
Don't you know that?

438
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,399
What the government badly wants

439
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,360
is an ideology that can be controlled.

440
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,238
What exactly are you suggesting?

441
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:12,159
The government will provide all resources,

442
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,370
whether they are financial or human.

443
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:19,333
We should elevate Park Jungja
above the New Truth or the Arrowhead

444
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:23,796
and use her to announce
the new doctrine for a new society.

445
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:29,343
We will use this opportunity
to write a doctrine with principles

446
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:34,306
that can define the Arrowhead as a cult
and restore some social order.

447
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,310
Do you understand what I mean?

448
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:51,073
In six months, we'll have a grand revival
with Park Jungja in the spotlight.

449
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:23,522
We train her to announce the doctrine
even if it means hiring a circus trainer.

450
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,609
She's not the only one
who received a demonstration.

451
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:30,613
What if someone else comes back to life
and says something different?

452
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:35,784
Like I told you earlier,
what's important is the character.

453
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,579
Not everyone can become a symbol

454
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,706
just because they rise from the dead.

455
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,626
The only people who can be one

456
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,629
are Park Jungja and the baby
whose demonstration failed.

457
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,965
We're still looking for the baby.

458
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,135
But for now, we have Park Jungja,

459
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,764
so let's go ahead
and make a new doctrine through her.

460
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:05,314
There's one more person
who can be this symbol you speak of.

461
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,400
And who is that?

462
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,110
Chairman Jung Jinsu.

463
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:16,951
Didn't he disappear eight years ago?
I thought he was traveling or something.

464
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,245
No one's heard from him since.

465
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,956
He was subjected to a demonstration.

466
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,709
I see.

467
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,088
So that's what happened.

468
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,382
He received a decree decades ago.

469
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,842
That's how he found the New Truth.

470
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:38,013
He recommended me as the next chairman
in exchange for my silence.

471
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,433
If Jung Jinsu
comes back to life and returns,

472
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:45,604
he could create
greater chaos than the Arrowhead.

473
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:49,191
Even if we come up with a doctrine
that people could accept,

474
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,778
they'd still believe Jung Jinsu instead.

475
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,826
Where did his demonstration take place?

476
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:00,744
I have no idea.

477
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,541
There's someone who might know.

478
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:07,918
Who's that?

479
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:14,842
He said he was going to meet a detective
right before his demonstration.

480
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,886
A detective named Jin Kyunghun.

481
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,140
He said he would leave the world
to this person.

482
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,768
"Leave the world"?

483
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,771
And did the detective
do anything after that?

484
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,358
He disappeared.

485
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,402
Without doing anything.

486
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:36,739
Jin Kyunghun.

487
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,824
Okay.

488
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:43,996
It seems like we need to find him first
by any means necessary.

489
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,406
The New Truth are making
fools of themselves again.

490
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,783
Fucking idiots.

491
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:26,372
The whole world was spoon-fed to them,
but they ruined it. Crazy bastards.

492
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,503
Don't stay up too late, Heejung.

493
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,172
I'm off to work.

494
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:54,733
Heejung.

495
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,742
Get up. Take these.

496
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,704
Take these pills.
They'll make you feel better.

497
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,372
Take them.

498
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,799
You'll be okay.

499
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,094
You'll feel better soon.

500
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,931
The pills will help.

501
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:26,890
It's okay.

502
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:07,885
