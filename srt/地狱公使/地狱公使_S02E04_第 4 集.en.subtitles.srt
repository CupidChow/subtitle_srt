1
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:16,391
Chairman Jung clearly emphasized
the importance of following God's will

2
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:19,019
by actively pursuing justice and good.

3
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:20,854
Next slide, please.

4
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,272
A COMPARISON OF JUNG AND PARK

5
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:27,068
When an unexpected question came up
in his last interview,

6
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:31,614
he inadvertently said
God has given us the ability to do so.

7
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:37,537
And now the Arrowhead is propagating it
as if it were his primary doctrine.

8
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,708
However, the idea that each person
carries a code of conduct

9
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,627
ultimately means
that there is no such code.

10
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:49,424
Therefore, our main goal would be
to realign these conflicting codes,

11
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,969
thought to reside
in the arbitrary realm of people's minds,

12
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,346
back into the framework of God's New Will.

13
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,684
Accomplishing this
should dispel the misconception

14
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,687
that joining the demonstration
will lead to forgiveness,

15
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,981
a belief stemming
from the baby's demonstration.

16
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,358
With that in mind--

17
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,902
Listen here!

18
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,572
We've already debunked
and clarified that issue!

19
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,283
Why reiterate that it's wrong?

20
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,202
People refuse to believe us anyway!

21
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,995
There's no need to get upset.

22
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:25,794
Analyzing logic and dissecting it
is just what professors do.

23
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,046
Why are you getting so worked up?

24
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:36,971
I trust the professors
will come up with a solid new doctrine.

25
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,140
You're the experts.

26
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,435
There's one thing I'd like to request.

27
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,481
It's about the script
that the Resurrected One will read out.

28
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,900
That's what's important.

29
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:52,946
It should be very concise and powerful.

30
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:57,408
It should sound insightful initially,

31
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:03,748
but the more you ponder it,
the more perplexing it becomes.

32
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,583
Something like that.

33
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,628
Don't you get it?

34
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,133
The thing about words

35
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,803
is that the ones
with confusing and ambiguous meanings

36
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:22,142
that seem to make sense in any context

37
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,770
tend to stick around for a long time.

38
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,691
Never try to make people understand.

39
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:33,069
What they understand, they analyze.

40
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:38,032
And once they start analyzing,
you will never be feared or admired.

41
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,245
Understand?

42
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,623
Right, yes. We'll do as you said.

43
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,709
All right. Let's continue.

44
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,835
-Okay.
-All right.

45
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:52,714
Up next, we have Ms. Park Yulgeum,

46
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,675
a world-class designer
who oversees our visuals.

47
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,969
She will update us on her progress.

48
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:13,902
The theme of this design
is "transcendence."

49
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:18,907
By portraying an image of a being
transcending human limitations,

50
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,743
our goal is to ensure
that the Resurrected One's message

51
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,913
resonates deeply
with the hearts of the audience

52
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,081
rather than their minds.

53
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:31,711
I've visualized her association
with the New Truth

54
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:35,048
by incorporating
the color of the deacons' uniform

55
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,841
and creating a design

56
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:42,222
that combines divine grandeur
with aristocratic moderation.

57
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,683
Regarding the makeup,

58
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:50,396
I intend to emphasize her existence
as surpassing human boundaries

59
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,068
while maintaining
her inherent facial characteristics.

60
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,780
This way,
we'll be able to effectively convey

61
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:03,826
that the Sinner Park Jungja
we used to know

62
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,412
has risen from the dead and returned.

63
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,065
HELLBOUND SEASON 2

64
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,695
MOTEL SMILE

65
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,169
Let's eat first.

66
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,718
Do we just wait around like this?

67
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,597
I messaged them from my wife's account.
I'm sure they'll see it.

68
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:52,226
The Arrowhead got very cautious
once Park's resurrection was announced.

69
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,484
You said Pinwheel had
the biggest influence on the Arrowhead.

70
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,444
Are you certain?

71
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,072
He goes around doing live broadcasts.

72
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,283
The Arrowhead is pretty much
under his control now.

73
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,204
About my demonstration--

74
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,872
I didn't tell them you were back.

75
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,793
People don't know
about your demonstration anyway.

76
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,603
Your eyes seemed to be troubling you.
Maybe these will help.

77
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,149
Thank you.

78
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,861
These might help.

79
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:51,911
They replied!

80
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,206
They're an hour away. Let's go.

81
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,689
Let me ask you something.

82
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,400
Why the Arrowhead?

83
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,821
Wouldn't the New Truth be better?

84
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,576
The New Truth and Sodo
never had any faith.

85
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,494
Their sole focus is on

86
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,290
using these strange phenomena
for their own gain.

87
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,793
The world is in this mess

88
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,504
because of fanaticism.

89
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,550
And to fix the mess caused by fanaticism,

90
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,555
we must first fix the craziest fanatics,
like the Arrowhead.

91
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:57,977
Let's go.

92
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,199
Senior Secretary Lee?

93
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,367
Hello there.

94
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,702
Hi.

95
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,413
What brings you here this time?

96
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,416
I came to ask you something.

97
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,043
Have a seat.

98
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:35,097
My staff analyzed
Park Jungja's interview records

99
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,767
and found something interesting.

100
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,768
Interesting?

101
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,980
Yes. During her interview
with Vice Chairman Oh two years ago,

102
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:47,151
Park Jungja mentioned a Mercedes
out of the blue.

103
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,072
In another interview
with Advisor Jung Yongcheol,

104
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,533
she mentioned a silk pillow.

105
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,035
She's always been like that.

106
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,996
She speaks gibberish out of the blue.

107
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,291
She couldn't communicate at all
until I stepped in.

108
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,794
"Gibberish"?

109
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:10,216
Right. However, in her interview
with Vice Chairman Lee Sanggil,

110
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,386
she mentioned the name "Lee Yumi."

111
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,012
Who?

112
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,973
Vice Chairman Lee Sanggil?

113
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:21,269
Yes, he died six months ago from a stroke.

114
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,356
So what did you find out?

115
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,318
We did some digging

116
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,821
and found out that the name of the doctor

117
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:36,117
who performed CPR on the vice chairman
until he was declared dead

118
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:37,868
was Lee Yumi.

119
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,915
So…

120
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:48,713
so what are you trying to say?

121
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:54,343
The things Park Jungja says
may not all be random gibberish.

122
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,846
I thought

123
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,892
she could perhaps see
the moment of people's deaths.

124
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,233
Of course, this is all just speculation.

125
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,319
It's just hypothetical.

126
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,322
But to see if it's true,

127
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,742
we need to check how the interviewers die.

128
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,328
But since Park Jungja never mentions

129
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,497
the time of their death
or anything like that,

130
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,084
it's difficult to verify this hypothesis.

131
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,879
Yes. I guess you're right.

132
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:38,387
Is Park Jungja's current state
going to affect our future plans?

133
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,768
Well, I don't think so.

134
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:49,398
But I've gone through all these records…

135
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,695
and I couldn't find any record
of your interview with her.

136
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:59,033
Did she say anything strange to you?

137
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,790
Chairman Kim.

138
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,584
You know,

139
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,755
she says all kinds of nonsense,
so I don't quite…

140
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,760
Right. Well,

141
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:23,182
I'm not saying
that they are particularly meaningful.

142
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,185
I'm so tired.

143
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,187
I'd better get going.

144
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:32,274
-How is the grand revival progressing?
-It's coming along.

145
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,069
Okay. Keep up the good work.

146
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,904
I'll see you later.

147
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,952
You know,

148
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,872
I went to see Park Jungja
before I came here.

149
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:47,790
I was curious.

150
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,166
Sorry?

151
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:54,255
I asked her if she could see anything
when she looks at me.

152
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,176
She said she couldn't see anything.

153
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,850
I'll get going, then.

154
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,352
Don't mind me. I'll see myself out.

155
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,563
SOLAR TRAIN

156
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,675
Hello?

157
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,220
Ms. Min, we have an emergency meeting.

158
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,387
Where are you?

159
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,890
I'm close by. I'll be there soon.

160
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,874
Resurrected One, are you napping?

161
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,798
Well, did you have a dream?

162
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,137
Listen.

163
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,641
I came to ask you something.

164
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,311
When I came to talk to you before,

165
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,314
you said something, didn't you?

166
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,442
What was it?

167
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,237
I see…

168
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,867
a bird like a phoenix…

169
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,372
and colorful, beautiful scenery.

170
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,042
That's what I see from you.

171
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,711
What exactly are those things?

172
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,298
I don't know what they are exactly.

173
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,718
They're just feelings.

174
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,722
Why do you ask?

175
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,310
I forgot what you said.

176
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,104
Am I…

177
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,151
seeing people's deaths?

178
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:03,861
What?

179
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,280
I was just wondering

180
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,074
if I have that kind of ability now.

181
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,537
Perhaps.

182
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,967
Can you also see when it will happen?

183
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,720
No, I don't know anything like that.

184
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,097
It's all images.

185
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:44,526
That scenery you see from me,
what impression does it give you?

186
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,445
Is it a negative one?

187
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,406
No, not at all.

188
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,367
Actually…

189
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,288
it looks gorgeous and magnificent.

190
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,711
By the way,

191
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,839
when will you start

192
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,092
your so-called plan?

193
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,887
Our committee members
will soon explain in detail

194
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,931
what you should do.

195
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,350
You just need to do what we ask.

196
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,772
Get some rest now. You'll be busy soon.

197
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,281
What's going on?

198
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,660
They haven't said much yet.
Please have a seat.

199
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,586
We lost Jung Jinsu.

200
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,089
Are you serious?

201
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,176
Didn't you say Cheon Sehyeong
was Miss Sunshine's husband?

202
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,430
How can you be sure
he's not one of the Arrowhead fanatics?

203
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,599
Many of our dedicated members
have family in the Arrowhead.

204
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,059
We thoroughly checked--

205
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,730
If he had been thoroughly checked,
this wouldn't have happened!

206
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,149
What if he hands Jung
to the Arrowhead or the New Truth?

207
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,777
The New Truth has already dominated
the media with Park's resurrection.

208
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,114
Now, a leader who returned from Hell?

209
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,491
How on earth will we deal with that?

210
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,452
That won't happen.

211
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:21,874
It seems like he decided to punish
Jung Jinsu himself out of vengeance.

212
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,877
We're tracking him. We'll find him soon.

213
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,845
Stop.

214
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,403
Can I help you?

215
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,989
I'm here to see Mr. Pinwheel.

216
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,742
I'm Cheon Sehyeong,
Miss Sunshine's husband.

217
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,124
See that bike?

218
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,876
Follow it.

219
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,798
-Hey, let them through.
-Open it.

220
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,223
This way.

221
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,432
Come on, move it.

222
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,457
Cut it out!

223
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,959
Come on.

224
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,045
CHANCE NIGHTCLUB

225
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,797
He's here.

226
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,476
Are you him?

227
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,896
Miss Sunshine's husband?

228
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:55,235
Hello. I'm Cheon Sehyeong.

229
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,154
Who did you bring?

230
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,531
It's impressive.

231
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,619
People following God's will
are gathered at a place

232
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,915
where people used to come
for momentary pleasure.

233
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,583
What the hell?

234
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,103
So it's true.

235
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:36,151
It really is you. For real!

236
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,115
It's Chairman Jung Jinsu.

237
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,536
Chairman Jung Jinsu. I…

238
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,248
Chairman Jung Jinsu!

239
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,795
I've waited so long for you!

240
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,006
I've waited so long for you!

241
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,177
I knew you'd come back to save us

242
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,681
from a world ruined by the fake chairman.

243
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,813
I'm impressed.

244
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:14,898
It must've been hard.

245
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:20,487
Yet you fought against the world
with such strong faith all these years.

246
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,405
No.

247
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:22,906
Not at all.

248
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,411
I have been living for this very moment.

249
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,589
How is your health? Is it good?

250
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,427
Please have a seat.
We have a lot to talk about.

251
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,470
Mr. Cheon, you should wait over there.

252
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,597
-Wait, but…
-Come on.

253
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,227
We have a place for you to wait.

254
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,611
You can wait here.

255
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,529
Right.

256
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,617
But there's something I need to tell him.

257
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,501
I still-- When can I talk to--

258
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,504
Hello?

259
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,424
Hello? Open the door, please!

260
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,844
Hey!

261
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,221
Please open the door!

262
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,558
Let me out! You bastards!

263
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:32,893
Open the door!

264
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,354
-Let me out!
-What a pain.

265
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,439
-Open the door!
-You two guard the door.

266
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,940
-All right.
-Let me out!

267
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,819
Open this… Please let me out!

268
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,198
Let's discuss our rescue plan
for Park Jungja.

269
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,492
We're out.

270
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,910
We're out too.

271
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,329
We already agreed in our last meeting.

272
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,998
Things are different now, aren't they?

273
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:58,460
We should blow up the entire place
to stop the New Will announcement.

274
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,003
Why do we need to rescue her?

275
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,381
I'm all for blowing the place up.

276
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,717
Right now,
it would look like the Arrowhead's doing.

277
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:10,514
It could stop the announcement
and undermine the Arrowhead's influence.

278
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,809
When did we become a terrorist group?

279
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,022
That's why we're pulling out.
Because we're not terrorists.

280
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,775
Mr. Kim Sungjip and Ms. Min Hyejin.

281
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:26,071
Good luck rescuing her peacefully.

282
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,951
I'll go alone. That was my plan anyway.

283
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:35,288
No, you're the symbol of Sodo.
I can't let you go alone.

284
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,876
I must be a burden, not a symbol.
Everyone seems reluctant to act.

285
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,254
I'll come up with a rescue plan.

286
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,881
I'll call you when I'm done.

287
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,242
Do you know why I am called Pinwheel?

288
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:16,163
A pinwheel doesn't have a will of its own.

289
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:19,124
It just spins whenever the wind blows.

290
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,962
I can't believe you came to me.

291
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,339
I always knew this day would come.

292
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,259
To fix this world,

293
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,761
we need people like you.

294
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,391
What do we do?
Should I go live and announce your return?

295
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,353
No. I think we should delay
the announcement of my return.

296
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,189
Why?

297
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,150
Before anything…

298
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,779
I want to meet Ms. Park,
known as the Resurrected One.

299
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,573
Ms. Park Jungja?

300
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,534
Right. Yes, of course.

301
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,412
If anyone should meet her, it's you.

302
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,538
Absolutely.

303
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,166
If they find out I'm back,

304
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,253
they'll never let me meet her.

305
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:09,257
The government and the New Truth
will do everything they can.

306
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,259
I must go there myself

307
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,804
and meet Park Jungja in secret.

308
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,266
We'll announce the real truth

309
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,270
instead of the false doctrine
the New Truth is coercing her to tell.

310
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,275
So then, you will be on the podium and…

311
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,778
On the stage the New Truth has set up,

312
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,280
you, together with the Resurrected One…

313
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,954
And also with you, Mr. Pinwheel.

314
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,587
I wouldn't dare…

315
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,132
You've been protecting God's will
on my behalf.

316
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,384
It'd only be right.

317
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,562
I'm so glad to be alive!

318
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:11,861
I've been holding back my urge
to plunge into the flames of purgation.

319
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,699
It must've all been for this moment.

320
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,995
I'll do anything to get you there.

321
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:24,124
I'm going to make sure
Park Jungja stands next to you!

322
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,463
By the way,

323
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:35,010
what should we do
about Miss Sunshine's husband?

324
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,481
Jiwon.

325
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,901
GRAND ASSEMBLY
FOR THE DECLARATION OF THE NEW WILL

326
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,412
-Are you going now?
-Yes.

327
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,164
-Please look after Jaehyeon.
-Of course.

328
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,793
Be careful.

329
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,640
So what's our plan?

330
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,225
Once we're there

331
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,686
and everyone joins us,

332
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,312
I'll tell you.

333
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,277
Take this.

334
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,329
I got one for you and one for myself.

335
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,635
What are you doing?

336
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,221
I just need one bullet.

337
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,558
I only need them to believe
that the gun is loaded.

338
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,565
It's going to be a long day.

339
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,194
We're going to go get Park Jungja now.

340
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,111
And then?

341
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,031
Are you going to get Park Jungja

342
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,035
and try to save the world?

343
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,831
I hate to break it to you…

344
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,836
but I don't care
what happens to this world anymore.

345
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,506
What?

346
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:45,510
During my time in Hell,
I was in countless different worlds.

347
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,973
And I'm not even sure…

348
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,101
if this is the real one.

349
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,480
Then why do you want to meet Park Jungja?

350
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,079
When I look in the mirror…

351
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,626
I see the executors.

352
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,756
The ones that ripped me apart
and burned me endlessly.

353
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:30,847
I see them…

354
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,604
chasing me in the mirror.

355
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,731
They chase me…

356
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,235
and suffocate me.

357
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,492
How much longer will this go on?

358
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,789
Will it ever end?

359
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,209
Park Jungja.

360
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,463
I thought…

361
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,635
she might know the answer.

362
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,268
Then what have I been doing all this time?

363
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,454
Do you know why you ended up like this?

364
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,377
Because you left everything
in the hands of others.

365
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:47,423
Your wife's life,
her death, and her revenge.

366
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,968
You left it all to others.

367
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,349
You even left your last chance up to me.

368
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,357
There is nothing you can find out

369
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,110
on your own.

370
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,868
-Get your hands off!
-He's deceiving you all!

371
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,121
Jung Jinsu is crazy!

372
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:21,958
He's a lunatic who came back from Hell!
Jung Jinsu is a sinner!

373
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:22,959
Jung Jinsu is--

374
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:35,847
I hope

375
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,391
your wife is waiting for you.

376
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,037
I get it now.

377
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,207
I finally know what God's will is.

378
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,670
He wants to give meaning
to something meaningless

379
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:12,050
and fill the world
with people who kill each other.

380
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,261
Do you know what that is?

381
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,014
It's Hell.

382
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,475
God is trying

383
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,229
to turn this world into Hell!

384
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,233
I finally get it!

385
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:09,816
Park Jungja! The Resurrected One!

386
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:06,873
A lot of our members
are also on standby outside.

387
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:12,336
They'll pretend to support the New Truth
and spring into action upon our signal.

388
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,594
A huge crowd has gathered
at the New Truth Square.

389
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:23,890
Even the Arrowhead, which has been
clashing with the New Truth,

390
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:27,768
appears to welcome the announcement
of the New Will by the Resurrected One.

391
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,105
The police have announced
traffic control in the area

392
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,816
to prevent any casualties
due to the large crowd.

393
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,610
In case of unforeseen circumstances,

394
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,988
emergency personnel
are also on standby at the scene.

395
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:56,881
Park Jungja, the Resurrected One,
will appear soon!

396
00:36:56,964 --> 00:37:00,760
All members of the Arrowhead,
heed God's message!

397
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:06,474
We, the Arrowhead, welcome the New Will
from Park Jungja, the Resurrected One!

398
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:08,851
Where is everyone?

399
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:15,066
The Resurrected One! The Arrowhead!

400
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,573
Ma'am, over there.

401
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,452
Are we supposed to do this with them?

402
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,871
What exactly is the plan?

403
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,422
Thank you for coming all this way.

404
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,471
I'm sorry.

405
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,889
Please don't be.

406
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,436
I believe this is my mission.

407
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,861
It's an honor to meet you.

408
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,993
Could I please shake your hand?

409
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:08,619
Sure.

410
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,629
Please.

411
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,843
Help Ms. Park Jungja meet her children.

412
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,167
Camera A, check. Camera B, check.

413
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,127
We're going live now.

414
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,671
Five, four,

415
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,883
three, two, one.

416
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,556
All right! All members of the Arrowhead
in the country!

417
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,600
As I previously mentioned,

418
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:18,814
today's broadcast will expose
every single lie the New Truth has told!

419
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,275
This broadcast will change history!

420
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,694
We've got an amazing surprise for you!

421
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,447
Pay attention, everyone!

422
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,164
Just relax and do as we practiced, okay?

423
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,418
You just need to read
the script displayed on the screen.

424
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,718
The chairman is coming onstage.

425
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,098
THE RESURRECTED ONE
PLEASE TEACH US GOD'S WILL

426
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,659
What are you doing? Get started!

427
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,214
Go!

428
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,592
-It's the Arrowhead!
-Run!

429
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:18,434
The New Truth is trying to impose
false doctrine using Park Jungja tonight!

430
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,854
Today, we are going to expose their lies!

431
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:47,755
I…

432
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,217
Park Jungja, the Resurrected One…

433
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,355
What's going on?

434
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,401
That's right.

435
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,111
Come at me.

436
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,942
Your plan was to involve
someone who received a decree?

437
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,152
All right, let's move!

438
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,416
Hey! Take Park Jungja!

439
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,834
-Yes, sir!
-Hurry!

440
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,045
-Bring her inside.
-Hurry!

441
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,171
This way, sir!

442
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:45,033
