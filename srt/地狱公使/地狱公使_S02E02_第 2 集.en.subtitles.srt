1
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,392
Is she in a lot of pain?

2
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:20,895
Yes.

3
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,606
It didn't seem as bad before…

4
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,652
but it was unbearable this time.

5
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,488
She was screaming in pain.

6
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,741
I'll prescribe some stronger painkillers.

7
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,745
We've drained the fluid
three times in the last month.

8
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,914
It may be difficult
to take care of her at home now.

9
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:43,376
I can write you a referral
if you plan to put her in a nursing home.

10
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,840
Right. I see.

11
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:50,592
Thank you.

12
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,096
-Your prescription is ready.
-Thanks.

13
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,351
Eight. Here you go.

14
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,269
Thank you.

15
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,783
Weep for our sins!

16
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,618
Confess!

17
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,120
Confess your sins!

18
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,664
Atone for your sins!

19
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,043
We speak to all sinners hiding their sins!

20
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,003
Repent your sins!

21
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,673
God is giving you a chance!

22
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,258
Atone for your sins!

23
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,475
Hello, chief.

24
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:45,230
Yeah, I don't think
I can come to work for a while.

25
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:46,981
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,610
Well, it's just some family matters.

27
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,031
Okay. Sure.

28
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,284
Yes, of course. Thank you, sir.

29
00:01:59,077 --> 00:01:59,911
Bye.

30
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,407
Excuse me.

31
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,325
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,290
-I'll go this way.
-All right.

33
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,876
I think he went this way.

34
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,001
HELLBOUND SEASON 2

35
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:24,889
Yes.

36
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,641
We'll take his daughter first.

37
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,354
He's here! You bastard!

38
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,772
Hey! It's Jin Kyunghun!

39
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:33,982
What are you doing?

40
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:34,899
Heejung!

41
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,070
-Get her in the car!
-Heejung!

42
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,196
Let me go!

43
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,365
Don't let him go! Stop him!

44
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,075
Let go, you bastard!

45
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,243
Stop him!

46
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,370
-Heejung!
-Dad!

47
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,454
Heejung!

48
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,872
Stop fighting! Cut it out!

49
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,249
-Dad!
-Let go of me!

50
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,500
Mr. Jin Kyunghun.

51
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,336
You did so well
hiding behind a new identity.

52
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,838
You weren't easy to find.

53
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,673
Let me go!

54
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,759
The committee just wants to ask you
a few things, so calm down.

55
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,012
-Why are you so worked up?
-Dad!

56
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,264
-Hurry! Get her in the car!
-Yes, sir!

57
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,937
Stop him, for God's sake!

58
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,690
Get him! All of you!

59
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,027
Dad!

60
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,361
-Let me go!
-Hey, stop!

61
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,156
Grab a hold of him!

62
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,454
-Hey, get him in the car. Let's clear out.
-Stay still!

63
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,913
-Let's clear out.
-Yes, sir.

64
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,791
-Hold him tight, or he'll escape.
-Back up!

65
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,337
You can't come through here!

66
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,341
What the hell?

67
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,603
-That's Min Hyejin!
-It's Min Hyejin!

68
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,230
-Hey!
-Stop her!

69
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,454
Go! Just go!

70
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,122
-Let's go!
-Go!

71
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,665
Hurry! Go!

72
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,293
Hey!

73
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,921
-Hey! Shut the door!
-Dad!

74
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,255
-Shut the door!
-No!

75
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,009
You're not going anywhere!

76
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,803
No!

77
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,597
Get in that car. Hurry!

78
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,474
This way, sir.

79
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,309
Get in the car! Come on!

80
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,561
Hey!

81
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,233
After them! Run!

82
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,238
-Let go of me!
-Stay still!

83
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,966
Heejung, are you all right?
Are you hurt?

84
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,468
-Over here.
-Heejung!

85
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,472
Come on.

86
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:58,871
It's okay now.

87
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,414
Don't worry. I got you.

88
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,103
What?

89
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,604
Are you sure?

90
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:27,858
Yes, she even had a scar on her face.
It was definitely Min Hyejin.

91
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,488
But how did they know about our plan?

92
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,951
We've weeded out all the fucking moles
over the years, so how?

93
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:40,705
We're working with the government on this.
Maybe there was a leak on their end.

94
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,915
Fuck those goddamn vermin.

95
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,919
Don't tell anyone about this for now.

96
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,754
-Not even our own, okay?
-Yes, sir.

97
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,757
And make a list of people
who know about this. Understood?

98
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,259
Yes, sir.

99
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:54,927
Get out now.

100
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:55,886
Yes, sir.

101
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,346
I'm sorry.

102
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:14,363
You can consider it a preparatory phase
to boost our approval ratings.

103
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,698
-Understood.
-All right.

104
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,370
This is Lee Sugyeong.

105
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,206
Hello, Senior Secretary Lee.
This is Kim Jeongchil.

106
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,542
I have an urgent matter to discuss.

107
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,464
The detective got away.

108
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,009
How did that happen?

109
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:38,429
We literally put everything together
and handed it to you.

110
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:43,851
It looks like that skank Min Hyejin
and the Sodo people got to him first.

111
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:44,769
I'm sorry.

112
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,772
Sodo? I see.

113
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,901
I didn't expect
your security to be that lax.

114
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,321
We can't be sure it was leaked from our--

115
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,740
Still, I'm glad it was Sodo that took him.

116
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,991
Sorry?

117
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,202
It's better than if it were the Arrowhead.

118
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,329
If it's Sodo, well…

119
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:07,583
They haven't done anything
with the baby all these years.

120
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,170
Even if they found Jung Jinsu,
they'd simply hide him.

121
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:15,257
If Jung Jinsu decides to show himself,
I'm sure he'll come to you.

122
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,467
You think so?

123
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,469
More importantly,

124
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:24,016
this means that they already know
about Park Jungja as well.

125
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,896
We should speed things up.

126
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,357
"Speed things up"? What do you mean?

127
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,820
Let's announce
Park Jungja's resurrection tonight.

128
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:36,862
Can you do it?

129
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,324
But we don't even have
the first draft of the New Will yet.

130
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,661
We can take our time
with things like that.

131
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,831
What's important right now
is that we make the headlines first

132
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,749
before they spoil it.

133
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,419
Make Park Jungja's resurrection public.

134
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,753
As for the New Will,

135
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,715
let's announce it
in three months or so.

136
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,508
Good with that?

137
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,803
Yes, I'll make sure
everything goes smoothly.

138
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:06,225
Oh, and we'll put together our own team
to handle the New Will.

139
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,477
Please hurry the announcement.

140
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,397
-Right, okay.
-All right.

141
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,205
What's taking them so long?

142
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,170
They're here.

143
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,509
How long has she been sick?

144
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,847
About five years.

145
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:32,394
After surgery and chemotherapy,
she seemed to be getting better,

146
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,980
but her cancer came back.

147
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,776
They say they can't do
anything else for her.

148
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,363
I've heard a lot of stories…

149
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,827
about you.

150
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,790
So why are both you and the New Truth

151
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,252
chasing after us?

152
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,464
According to our informant
planted inside the New Truth…

153
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,344
Ms. Park Jungja has come back to life.

154
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,349
Man, at this point,

155
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,310
nothing surprises me anymore.

156
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,482
Well, Eunyul and Hayul
would be happy to hear that.

157
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,278
It looks like the government
and the New Truth

158
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,698
are going to announce a new doctrine
using Ms. Park.

159
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,409
But there's a risk to their plan.

160
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,912
A risk…

161
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,500
Is it the possibility
of Jung Jinsu coming back to life?

162
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,586
Yes.

163
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:44,508
They fear he may come back to life,
and things will get out of control.

164
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:50,055
Then I guess you all want to know
where his demonstration took place.

165
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,392
Yeah.

166
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:54,894
Of course.

167
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,771
You know, don't you?

168
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,735
Could you please tell us?

169
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,999
You must have resented me deeply.

170
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,004
Why did you

171
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,593
keep it a secret that Jung Jinsu
had received a decree 20 years ago?

172
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:32,598
Well, if I didn't…
would things be different?

173
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,687
Heejung has less than three months.

174
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,815
I won't waste that time

175
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,944
destroying everything she believes in.

176
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,197
Please leave us now.

177
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,617
Thank you for saving us though.

178
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,996
You have a sick daughter.
What will you do?

179
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,461
We've prepared a place for you.
Stay there with your daughter.

180
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,256
I won't force you to answer us, so--

181
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,591
You know, that baby

182
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,427
who survived the demonstration…

183
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:16,517
From time to time,
I wonder if that baby's… doing well.

184
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,353
We have the child safe in our custody.

185
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,565
Yes, I'm sure,
but I'm not talking about their safety.

186
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,320
Is the child…

187
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,907
getting the love they deserve?

188
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,955
Have you told them about their parents?

189
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,500
Have you ever told them

190
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:47,047
that their mom and dad loved them…
more than anything in the world?

191
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,347
It was the orphanage.

192
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,437
In the room at the end of the second floor
of the orphanage where he grew up.

193
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,274
Just promise me one thing.

194
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,695
Please make sure Heejung never finds out

195
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,948
about Jung Jinsu's demonstration.

196
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,953
While your job is to tell the truth…

197
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,249
mine is to hide it.

198
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,218
All right, easy. There.

199
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,222
Please get in.

200
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,061
Shall we go now?

201
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,395
Let's go.

202
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,396
Please.

203
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,378
Good work today. I'll be in touch.

204
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,073
THE ARROWHEAD SHALL MAKE NEW HISTORY

205
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,201
KARAOKE BAR
DO NOT SEEK PLEASURE

206
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,775
-Welcome back.
-Thanks.

207
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,033
Rough day, huh?
I heard you found the location.

208
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,410
Yes, the northern branch will handle it.

209
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,786
How's Jaehyeon today?

210
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,039
Nothing special about her today.

211
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:10,000
She walked to the edge
of the restricted area.

212
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,127
Did she get all the way there?

213
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:17,174
Ever since the Arrowhead wrecked the area
to dismantle the pleasure industry,

214
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,800
no one really comes here anymore.

215
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,803
"Old man,
where does your singing voice come from?"

216
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,889
"It comes from my mouth."

217
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,017
"Liar. That kind of voice
never comes out of our mouths."

218
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,811
"Oh boy, what I mean is…"

219
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,357
"Just then, one of the goblins yelled,

220
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,524
'That's it, old man!'

221
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,569
'We'll give you treasure,
so sell your singing sack to us.'"

222
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,947
Aunt Hyejin…

223
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,657
What?

224
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,117
When will Aunt Hyejin be back?

225
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:49,414
Ms. Min is going to be back late,
so let me read to you tonight.

226
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,415
Are you sleepy?

227
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,502
It's more fun when Aunt Hyejin reads it.

228
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,962
Why?

229
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,755
It's the same story, Jaehyeon.

230
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,717
She does the voices when she reads.

231
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,221
She does? How should I do it?

232
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,643
"That's it, old man!"

233
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,690
He'd be too scared to sell it
if the goblin sounded like that.

234
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,650
Sorry.

235
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,819
Let me try again. Sorry.

236
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,071
She's making Sora sweat.

237
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,990
She's just a normal child.

238
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,492
What?

239
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:32,958
There's nothing special about her
that explains how she survived.

240
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,584
Don't jump to any conclusions.

241
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,671
She is the sole survivor
of the demonstration.

242
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,632
Assumptions like that
might make you overlook the truth.

243
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,427
Come on, I'm just saying.

244
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,765
Wait, I'll just quickly wash up
and take over for you.

245
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:49,933
You don't have to.

246
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,310
You must be tired.

247
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,575
Only our people know about this place,
so you can stay without any worries.

248
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:17,294
And here's some medicine
our doctors prepared.

249
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,211
Thanks.

250
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:22,257
We'll be in the basement.
Let us know if you need anything.

251
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,967
Good night, then.

252
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,094
-Thank you.
-Anytime.

253
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,529
My…

254
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,032
my phone.

255
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,785
Well…

256
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:55,791
I'll get you a new one tomorrow.
In the meantime, rest.

257
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,250
No.

258
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,711
I need it now!

259
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,216
We don't know what kind of crap
the New Truth might be up to.

260
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,134
I need to keep an eye on them.

261
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:11,264
Do you have any idea how many people
are waiting for my commentary?

262
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,267
I'm the only one

263
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:18,563
who really understands
what's going on right now!

264
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:26,321
So get me a phone, a laptop, or whatever.

265
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,574
Bring it to me right now!

266
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,159
There's something I don't understand.

267
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:36,581
Why is the New Truth after us?

268
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,876
Do you know what it might be?

269
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,294
You're the expert.

270
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,589
Well, isn't it obvious?

271
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,843
Now that Kim Jeongchil is losing ground,

272
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:51,096
they're trying to erase
everything about Chairman Jung Jinsu.

273
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:56,143
They want to destroy
Chairman Jung's reputation

274
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:59,396
by revealing what he and I said.

275
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,859
So they probably needed our testimony.

276
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:10,365
But I'd never have said a word anyway,
even if they had taken me.

277
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,828
You can never say anything either.

278
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,455
Okay?

279
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,499
Of course. I won't say a word.

280
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,628
You and Chairman Jung worked so hard
to create this world.

281
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,591
We must protect it until he comes back.

282
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:28,925
That's right.

283
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,428
Tell me…

284
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,474
tell me again
about the last time you met him.

285
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,975
My goodness.

286
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,645
Aren't you tired of hearing it?

287
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,731
Come on.

288
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,900
Tell me.

289
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:47,986
Let's see.

290
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:54,493
Back then, I almost… got beaten to death,

291
00:24:55,827 --> 00:25:00,957
but Chairman Jung made a video call
and saved my life.

292
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:06,004
But at the time,
I thought he had kidnapped you.

293
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,799
I cursed him out and went after him.

294
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,763
And…

295
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,141
there he was.

296
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,770
He said, "Detective Jin,

297
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,025
Heejung is the only person I've met

298
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,112
who truly understands God's will
as well as I do."

299
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,324
"That's why I chose her."

300
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:42,749
"Heejung and I have gifted
a new world to humanity."

301
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,001
"But I am leaving now."

302
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,422
"But when the new world

303
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:54,261
is in need of new enlightenment,

304
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,179
I will come back."

305
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,391
"By that time…

306
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,229
I'm sure…

307
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,984
Heejung will have grown
even more faithful."

308
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,197
"Please freely enjoy the world…

309
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,786
that Heejung and I have created."

310
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,559
We go live in one minute. Please stand by.

311
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,978
I think he needs a bit more here and here.

312
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,698
You just need to look at the camera
and read the script.

313
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,617
Don't do anything we didn't discuss.

314
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,619
Let's stand up straight.

315
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,245
All right, good.

316
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,914
The chairman is ready.

317
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,249
We're going live

318
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,127
in five, four, three,

319
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,879
two, one.

320
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,466
Hello, everyone.

321
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,011
I'm Chairman Kim Jeongchil
of the New Truth.

322
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:23,391
I stand before you today
with a special announcement.

323
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:27,729
This is the security camera footage
from the sacred demonstration site

324
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,482
where Sinner Park Jungja's remains
were kept

325
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:33,234
after her demonstration eight years ago.

326
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,904
Four years after the demonstration,

327
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:40,283
Sinner Park Jungja rose from the dead
in the exact same place.

328
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,744
Over the last four years,

329
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,289
through intensive interviews
with Park Jungja

330
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,041
and various studies about the case,

331
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,755
we have discovered the message
that God wishes to send us through her.

332
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,718
Therefore, we, the New Truth,
hereby declare Park Jungja

333
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,513
no longer a sinner
but the Resurrected One.

334
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,767
In three months, we will announce
the new revelations of God's will,

335
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,436
bestowed upon us through Park Jungja,

336
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:13,358
and thereby restore His sacred will,
which was tainted by a faithless mob.

337
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:17,445
Park Jungja, the Resurrected One,
will announce God's will herself

338
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,241
at our upcoming grand revival meeting
in three months.

339
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:26,538
The New Truth will call it "the New Will."

340
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,458
We hope proclaiming the New Will
enlightens not only our fellow citizens

341
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:34,045
but also people worldwide, fostering
a better understanding of God's will.

342
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,840
May it inspire all
to further virtuous acts

343
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,967
and embody righteousness in their lives.

344
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,596
Lastly, details regarding
the grand revival meeting…

345
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,977
That's a bold move by Kim Jeongchil.

346
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,731
This means we have to find others
who were resurrected.

347
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,608
The demonstration subjects
are scattered all over the place.

348
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,152
Makes them hard to track.

349
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,279
We can't just do nothing.

350
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,497
Excuse me. Something is up with Jaehyeon.

351
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,300
What's she doing?

352
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,553
Damn, what's she got there?

353
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,657
Bae Jaehyeon, what's that in your hand?

354
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,003
Where did you get that?

355
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,672
I found it

356
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,968
when I went out for a walk earlier.

357
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,063
You should all go.

358
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,075
Can I take a look?

359
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,453
Wow, what is it?

360
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,040
Solar Train.

361
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:35,875
"Solar Train"?

362
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,793
Yes.

363
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,885
SOLAR TRAIN
GOING ON A BRAVE ADVENTURE!

364
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,557
You read this to me before. Solar Train.

365
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,435
The five of them are a team.

366
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,021
This is Happy Train.

367
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,692
Don't you remember?

368
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,319
You're right. I remember.

369
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,612
Yes, Solar Train.

370
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,198
Didn't these guys get energy
from sunlight?

371
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:12,328
Not sunlight but the solar energy
of love from the sunlight.

372
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:15,039
These train heroes
recharge their energy with it.

373
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,209
This one is Power.

374
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,629
These are Smart, Thunder, and Funny.

375
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:25,008
You said Funny was your favorite.

376
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:28,720
Later on, they combine into one.

377
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,139
And when they do, they get really tall!

378
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,600
Probably as tall as you, Aunt Hyejin.

379
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,498
How long do we have to keep
Jaehyeon like this?

380
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:58,833
What do you mean?

381
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,003
She's completely cut off from the world,

382
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,256
getting DNA tests, blood tests,
and psychological tests every month.

383
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,550
It's not normal.

384
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:14,515
We need to find something
which explains the current situation.

385
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:19,020
Jaehyeon is just an ordinary child
who needs to be loved.

386
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,106
We can't make her live like this forever.

387
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:26,486
She's only five,
so let's not jump to conclusions.

388
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:30,156
"We must pursue the truth persistently
without rushing."

389
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,326
Isn't that what you always say?

390
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,622
That only applies
when there's actually a truth to pursue.

391
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,792
Even if she's just an ordinary child,

392
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,461
she must grow up
to be the symbol of our organization.

393
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,382
She will be
our most powerful ideological weapon.

394
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:52,178
And we lost six of our members
just to save that one child.

395
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,395
It's all set. Could you please check?

396
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,146
All right. Give me a minute.

397
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,942
This is equipment
used for nature documentaries.

398
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:09,404
It works by detecting
specific sounds, lights, or motion.

399
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,532
We don't know
when Jung Jinsu will be resurrected,

400
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,243
but if something happens here,
we'll know right away.

401
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:19,872
But we'll need someone here at all times
if we are to secure him.

402
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,917
We don't know when it's going to happen,

403
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,045
and, for security reasons,
we can't have many people on shift.

404
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,715
One person will do the job.

405
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,633
He'll be living nearby.

406
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:31,968
One person?

407
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,638
He would wait a hundred years
by himself if he had to.

408
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,391
Who is he?

409
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:42,437
Let's just say he wants to meet
Jung Jinsu more than anyone.

410
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,232
Actually, there he is.

411
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,744
Hello, Ms. Min Hyejin.

412
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,661
Well,

413
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,830
I'm Cheon Sehyeong.

414
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,427
3 MONTHS LATER

415
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:44,791
MOTION DETECTED

416
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:54,509
SECURITY CAMERA

417
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,389
He's here.

418
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:09,250
JUNG JINSU HAS RESURRECTED

419
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,388
Excuse me.

420
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:24,807
Are you all right?

421
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,560
Excuse me.

422
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,152
Jung…

423
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,448
Jung Jin…

424
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,618
Chairman Jung Jinsu!

425
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,372
Chairman Jung!

426
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:54,962
Chairman Jung!

427
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:35,956
