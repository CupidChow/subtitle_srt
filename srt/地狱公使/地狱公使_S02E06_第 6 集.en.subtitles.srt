1
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:16,224
With a sudden demonstration
and the appearance of Jung Jinsu,

2
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:19,394
the revival has descended
into total chaos.

3
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:23,356
The authorities are fully committed
to addressing the current situation,

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,776
but signs indicate that the disruption
is spreading nationwide.

5
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,031
Meanwhile, Chairman Jung Jinsu appeared
on the Arrowhead's online broadcast,

6
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,408
criticizing the current practices
of the New Truth

7
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,453
and demanding to meet
with Park Jungja, the Resurrected One.

8
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:40,040
The Arrowhead livestreamed
a group assault on Chairman Kim,

9
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:43,668
whose status remains unknown.

10
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,337
We have just received breaking news.

11
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:50,008
The Arrowhead has resumed
their live broadcast.

12
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:53,970
They're displaying a restrained man,
seemingly in his fifties,

13
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,347
and urging viewers
to report information about him.

14
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,433
Here is the footage.

15
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,561
Take a good look at this man!

16
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,981
We need your help with information.

17
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,234
This man is a member of the infidel Sodo.

18
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,113
He snuck in here
to kidnap the Resurrected One.

19
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:16,743
He's also a sinner who will be subjected
to a demonstration soon.

20
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,705
This is his cell phone.
Do you see the timer?

21
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,084
The Sodo people
have kidnapped the Resurrected One.

22
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,003
They're hiding
somewhere in this building right now.

23
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:31,800
This man planned to use his demonstration,
scheduled in 25 minutes, as a distraction

24
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,135
to help them escape the building.

25
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,013
It has become evident

26
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,682
that Sodo was also behind
the earlier demonstration!

27
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,395
The decrees and demonstrations
are God's divine intervention,

28
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,067
yet these devils have the audacity
to use them for their own gain!

29
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:54,197
We will broadcast
this sinner's demonstration shortly.

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,865
SENIOR SECRETARY LEE SUGYEONG

31
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,910
This man will not get a single chance

32
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,788
to repent and atone for his sins.

33
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,708
And we will not join his demonstration!

34
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,338
The Arrowhead!

35
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,073
HELLBOUND SEASON 2

36
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,618
At the New Truth's announcement
of the New Will,

37
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,538
executors suddenly appeared
and performed a demonstration.

38
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,916
Meanwhile, a large group of people,
seemingly from the Arrowhead,

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,836
is trying to break into
the New Truth's main building.

40
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,717
How are you feeling?

41
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,053
I'm all right.

42
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,142
Are my children

43
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,853
doing well?

44
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,981
Yes, they're doing well.

45
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,318
I'll take you to them
once we're out of here.

46
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,403
Don't worry.

47
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,865
Mr. Jeong was taken by the Arrowhead.

48
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,160
What's happening outside?

49
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,080
A complete mess. It's turning into a riot.

50
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,961
Then we should get to the van quickly.

51
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:32,962
Let's go.

52
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:33,880
Hang on.

53
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,508
Let me talk
to our intelligence team first.

54
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,571
WE'RE TAKING PARK JUNGJA
AND PROCEEDING WITH OUR INITIAL PLAN

55
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,249
CULT LEADER
HELLO, MS. LEE SUGYEONG…

56
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,088
HELLO, MS. LEE SUGYEONG
THIS IS JUNG JINSU

57
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,765
TODAY'S EVENT MUST BE YOUR WORK

58
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,105
THAT MEANS YOU WERE ALSO BEHIND
SODO KIDNAPPING PARK JUNGJA

59
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,257
Hello, Senior Secretary Lee.

60
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,219
Mr. Jung Jinsu?

61
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,684
What do your messages mean?

62
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,312
Maybe it was the best option
for the government.

63
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,108
After all, you must have total control
over two conflicting ideas

64
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,319
to control this society.

65
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,160
And you chose the New Truth and Sodo.

66
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,999
Your goal with this revival
wasn't to unite everyone

67
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,836
but to split everyone
into just two groups, wasn't it?

68
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,548
No need to play innocent.

69
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,009
I understand your intentions
better than anyone.

70
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,346
You're a clever man.

71
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:50,767
So…

72
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,604
what do you want?

73
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,314
I'd like you to tell me.

74
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,483
I want

75
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,361
to meet Park Jungja.

76
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:05,865
Park Jungja.

77
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,202
What are you going to do with her?

78
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,370
Nothing, really.

79
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,998
I just need to speak to her privately.

80
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,711
As you know, she's the only one
who's experienced what I have.

81
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,589
But Sodo has taken Park Jungja,

82
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,801
and these fanatics are not very reliable.

83
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,178
So…

84
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,600
I'd like you to bring Park Jungja to me.

85
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,518
I'm…

86
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,272
in a bit of a hurry.

87
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,569
I see. You're in a hurry. Right.

88
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,363
All right.

89
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,658
So you meet her, and then what?

90
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,702
After I meet her,
I'll do whatever you want.

91
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,414
If you want her back, I'll give her back.

92
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,041
If you want my help in fooling the world,
you've got it.

93
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,918
I'm not sure if you know,

94
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,588
but one word from me right now

95
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,550
could have Park Jungja killed.

96
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,306
Is that right?

97
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,687
Then let me put it this way.

98
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,023
Just a single word from me

99
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:26,904
could turn these crazy Arrowhead fanatics
into obedient sheep for you

100
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,740
or do the exact opposite.

101
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:37,415
I'm sure all of you listening to this
are smart people.

102
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,961
Why don't you all discuss this?
I'll give you five minutes.

103
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:43,963
Bye for now.

104
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:07,862
Prof. Hong.

105
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,282
Could I have a cigarette?

106
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,648
GET MOVING ONCE HIS DEMONSTRATION BEGINS

107
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,402
The Arrowhead will broadcast
the demonstration soon,

108
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:52,782
so everyone will likely be too busy
watching the broadcast.

109
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,285
That's when we should head
to the parking lot and make our escape.

110
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,634
We've received a tip about the sinner!

111
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,011
His name is Jeong Hyeoksang,

112
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,680
52 years old.

113
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,226
He teaches ethics
at Seongun Middle School.

114
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,186
He teaches ethics!

115
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,065
His wife is Bae Myeongsuk, 38 years old.

116
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,736
His daughter, Jeong Minhui, is 18
and attends Seongun Girls' High School.

117
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,531
His son, Jeong Minu, is 15…

118
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,658
We've already hidden his family.

119
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,746
He is an ethics teacher,
yet he failed to lead students

120
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,748
onto the right path
according to God's will.

121
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:47,920
Instead, he imposed outdated human ethics
tainted by unrighteous customs.

122
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:48,838
No.

123
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,172
However,

124
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,883
regardless of his past sins,

125
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,304
nothing compares to the sins
he committed after the decree.

126
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,974
The sin of rejecting
God's offer of repentance

127
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:04,812
and reducing His divine intervention
to a tool for an infidel terrorist group.

128
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,606
No.

129
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,774
For a human who can make such choices,

130
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,235
Hell is an inevitable consequence.

131
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,571
Go to Hell!

132
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:17,158
It is the path
you have chosen for yourself!

133
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,457
Ten! Nine!

134
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,459
-Eight!
-I'm not a sinner.

135
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,418
Seven!

136
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,004
-Six! Five!
-This isn't how it's supposed to be.

137
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,382
Four! Three! Two!

138
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,467
One!

139
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,099
Let's move.

140
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,352
Come on.

141
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:21,847
Let's go.

142
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:00,928
This way!

143
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,425
Let go of me, you bastards!

144
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,803
-No!
-It's a gun!

145
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:43,721
Hey!

146
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,598
Stay still, asshole!

147
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,943
We've captured the remnants of Sodo!

148
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:05,284
Man, we finally caught
these goddamn pests.

149
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,827
Let's see.

150
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,080
Well, I don't know who this bastard is.

151
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:12,958
Min Hyejin!

152
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,879
The leader of the infidels!
The devil's pawn!

153
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,925
Damn, look at this bitch
shooting daggers at me.

154
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,718
Unfortunately,

155
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,765
you're not the one in the spotlight,
so we'll come back to you later.

156
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,770
Park Jungja, the Resurrected One.

157
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,774
She was about to be used
by Kim Jeongchil and Min Hyejin,

158
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:40,444
but we have successfully rescued her!

159
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,114
And now here he comes!

160
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:48,786
The man who ventured to the ends
of the earth in search of God's message!

161
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:54,500
He now stands before the Resurrected One,
who is herself God's final message!

162
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,132
Jung Jinsu! Let Park Jungja go!

163
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,266
Let her go.

164
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,268
Sorry?

165
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,395
Why?

166
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,817
I said let her go!

167
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,163
Ms. Park Jungja!

168
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,500
Please, I have something to ask you.
Ms. Park Jungja!

169
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,460
Please look at me. Look at me!

170
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,715
I'm just like you.

171
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,593
I've also been resurrected.

172
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,304
I need to ask you something.

173
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:50,806
Do you

174
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,809
also see the executors?

175
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,146
When you look in the mirror,

176
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,316
you see them coming at you, right?

177
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,234
What are you talking about?

178
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,152
Why…

179
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,571
why are you…

180
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,324
why are you acting like you don't know?

181
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,285
I told you. I'm just like you.

182
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,788
I've been resurrected too.

183
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,000
I also went through
all those different worlds.

184
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,296
They ripped us apart again and again.

185
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,298
Look at me.

186
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,885
Do you… do you know who you are?
You don't, do you?

187
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,262
You are confused, too, aren't you?

188
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,430
I do know!

189
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,601
I know who I am.

190
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,980
I am…

191
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,108
Eunyul…

192
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,236
and Hayul's…

193
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,698
mother.

194
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,744
Even in all those different worlds,

195
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,955
I was always

196
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,958
their mother.

197
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,838
What are you talking about?

198
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,592
How can you be sure?

199
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,388
How can you be so certain?

200
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,143
Perhaps your Hell

201
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,813
and mine…

202
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,525
were different.

203
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,569
What?

204
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,409
You must be the only one
who sees those executors.

205
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,831
When I look in the mirror,

206
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,126
I don't see anything behind me.

207
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,714
And those executors are not behind you.

208
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,883
They're within you.

209
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,594
I don't believe it.

210
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,306
Now I can clearly see…

211
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,603
why you were chosen for that.

212
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,525
It's because…

213
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,117
you were a coward.

214
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:23,834
You're lying.

215
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,340
You're lying to me.

216
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,677
Stop lying.

217
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,557
Stop lying.

218
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,560
Look.

219
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,520
Look closely in the mirror.

220
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,022
Don't you see the executor?

221
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,692
It's walking toward me.

222
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,187
It's gone.

223
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,113
It's gone.

224
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,812
What's going on?

225
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,899
Chairman Jung!

226
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,199
Are you okay, sir?

227
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:10,918
Sir!

228
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,628
What the hell?

229
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,443
Are you okay?

230
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,449
Let's go!

231
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:48,724
Please.

232
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,560
Please help me.

233
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,340
LIVE BROADCAST HAS ENDED

234
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,141
How are people responding?

235
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,437
How are they reacting?

236
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,521
Well,

237
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,899
they're not showing any reaction.

238
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:07,487
It's just like the first broadcast
of the demonstration eight years ago.

239
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:16,830
The riot's died down,
most people seem demotivated.

240
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:20,333
They're either crying… or stunned.

241
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,381
How do you think
the public will view Jung Jinsu now?

242
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,010
His authority and symbolism…

243
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,682
I'd say it's all destroyed.

244
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,020
Perhaps

245
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,440
this could be our chance to eliminate

246
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,151
the New Truth and the Arrowhead
at the same time.

247
00:24:56,661 --> 00:25:00,790
Once the chaos is over,
people will want an explanation.

248
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,709
Let's prepare one.

249
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:08,507
Summon the New Truth committee
and appoint a new chairman immediately.

250
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:14,596
Get them ready for the announcement
of God's New Will and Jung Jinsu's sins.

251
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,057
Monitor their statement closely.

252
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,685
This doesn't change anything.

253
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,897
We will eradicate the Arrowhead

254
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,609
and establish the New Truth and Sodo
as the two opposing powers.

255
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,236
Is that clear?

256
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,612
-Yes.
-Yes, ma'am.

257
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,699
Move quickly.

258
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,577
We may never get another chance like this.

259
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,456
Where are we?

260
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:28,169
Someone will come
to take Ms. Park Jungja to her family.

261
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:30,755
Let's go.

262
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,806
They'll be here soon.
They might already be here.

263
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,767
Who are they? Aren't you going to tell us?

264
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,938
Sodo's mission will be fulfilled
once Ms. Park reunites with her children.

265
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:18,261
A place with toys
and something that looks like an elephant…

266
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,431
That's

267
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,059
where you'll die.

268
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:42,744
Min Hyejin!

269
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,040
It's no use hiding!

270
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,625
Are you okay?

271
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,421
We must split up. Quickly!

272
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,263
Kim Sungjip!

273
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,101
What are you?
Are you also with the Arrowhead?

274
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:18,238
This is Sodo's decision,
not the Arrowhead's!

275
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:27,747
Now that everyone knows
we have Park Jungja…

276
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:34,713
we will be as powerful… as the New Truth.

277
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,469
Are you going
to lock Park Jungja up as well?

278
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,734
We won't lock her up.

279
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,028
We're going to kill her.

280
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,200
If we keep her alive
and someone else takes her,

281
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,996
the world will fall back into chaos.

282
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,585
But if we kill her now,
no one can take her away.

283
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,966
You're just as crazy as them!

284
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:39,152
The world needs a good lie right now.

285
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,907
Everyone is exhausted
from the unrelenting chaos.

286
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:48,703
We don't need a truth
that may not even exist.

287
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,830
A solid lie…

288
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,835
is the foundation we need
for a stable world.

289
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,841
But you want to take Park Jungja
to her family?

290
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,472
You want to plant
another seed of chaos in the world?

291
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:12,143
The Arrowhead,
the New Truth, and Jung Jinsu.

292
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,688
Do you think they ruined this world?

293
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,693
You're the one who ruined it, Min Hyejin!

294
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,488
It's you.

295
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:28,576
It's your principles…

296
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:33,039
that are throwing the world into chaos!

297
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,302
Come on.

298
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,184
Are you all right?

299
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,571
You think…

300
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,493
you're serving justice, don't you?

301
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,122
But you

302
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:30,336
just gave up the chance
for this world to return to normal.

303
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,968
Uncuff me.

304
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,764
This is our last chance.

305
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,186
Our last chance to save this world.

306
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,402
You'll have to save yourself
before you can save the world.

307
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,615
This place is out of business,
so hardly anyone comes by.

308
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:23,723
Min Hyejin!

309
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,809
Min Hyejin!

310
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,024
Min Hyejin!

311
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,401
You can't take Park Jungja!

312
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:13,981
Go with him.

313
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,485
He will take you to your children.

314
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,323
Can I

315
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:26,035
trust him?

316
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:34,502
He may be the only person you can trust
from now on.

317
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,137
Thank you, Ms. Min.

318
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,983
There's something I wanna tell you.

319
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:58,985
Okay.

320
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,705
Soon…

321
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,334
the world will come to an end.

322
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:18,838
So…

323
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,552
you should…

324
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,640
do what you want to do…

325
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,603
while you can.

326
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,315
What's…

327
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,277
Look over there!

328
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:16,789
Lee Sugyeong.

329
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:23,712
You will die two years from now
at 7:00 p.m.

330
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,676
And you are bound for Hell.

331
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:38,060
Make sure to notify them of the reason
for the arrest and their rights!

332
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:42,189
Follow protocol and make sure
everything's done by the book!

333
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,532
Kim Jongmin.

334
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:57,538
You will die three days from now
at 3:00 p.m.

335
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:04,044
And you are bound for Hell.

336
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,630
…you are bound for Hell.

337
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:41,999
What is that?

338
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:21,121
SIMULTANEOUS DECREES ACROSS THE NATION
CAUSE TERROR AND PANIC

339
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:26,252
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DECREES
HAVE BEEN REPORTED

340
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:45,980
Yeah?

341
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,315
What is it?

342
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:51,735
Sure.

343
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:01,620
This is your mom.

344
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:06,417
It's from… our picnic together, remember?

345
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:36,697
Heejung.

346
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,266
You've been strong.

347
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,312
Rest easy now, Heejung.

348
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,277
Hayul…

349
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,290
is waiting for you too.

350
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,883
You've grown so much.

351
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:25,556
My dear

352
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,392
Eunyul.

353
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,575
Thank you.

354
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,494
Auntie!

355
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,800
Aunt Hyejin, are you hurt badly?

356
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:35,811
Jaehyeon.

357
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,856
Do you want to come with me?

358
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:44,695
All right.

359
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:49,199
Let's get out of here, okay?

360
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,264
Is this the end for us?

361
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,778
A new world will begin soon.

362
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,991
Go find the world you each desire.

363
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,274
Jaehyeon, are you ready?

364
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,853
What's that drawing?

365
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,488
Jaehyeon.

366
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,450
I want to tell you a story

367
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,579
about your parents now.

368
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:06,753
About how much your mom and dad loved you.

369
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,509
And when I'm done…

370
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,930
I want to be your mom.

371
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,058
What do you think?

372
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:18,315
