1
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,321
Good to see you, Sungjip.

2
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,285
I was surprised to get a call from you.
What's the occasion?

3
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,289
What, we can't even call each other now?

4
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,667
When you were on our campaign team,

5
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,587
we used to talk on the phone every day,
didn't we?

6
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:32,759
This used to be
such a nice place, didn't it?

7
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,346
But look at it now.

8
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,141
Those damn Arrowhead fanatics.

9
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,560
Can we cut to the chase?

10
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,689
All those years at Sodo
seem to have made you

11
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,692
quite harsh.

12
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,864
How is your tae kwon do center doing?
And are your kids well?

13
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,575
You didn't call me here to ask me that.

14
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,414
How should I put this in simple words?

15
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,713
I want you

16
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,134
to kidnap Park Jungja.

17
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,851
Isn't the government working with
the New Truth on matters involving her?

18
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,311
That's right.

19
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,814
The Arrowhead has attained greater power,

20
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:31,901
so our plan was to return some of it
to the New Truth.

21
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,529
But then we realized

22
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,241
we shouldn't give the New Truth
all that power.

23
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,493
What do you mean?

24
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,623
See? I told you it wasn't a simple matter.

25
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,334
Listen.

26
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:53,715
If the New Truth announces
a new doctrine through Park Jungja,

27
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:57,343
all the attention will be on them.

28
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:01,514
In the meantime,
we'll weaken the Arrowhead's power.

29
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:07,228
If they make one final effort to resist,
we could wipe them out all at once.

30
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,232
So why do you want us
to kidnap Park Jungja?

31
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,904
Park Jungja is the protagonist.

32
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,576
She's not some abstract concept
or doctrine.

33
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,538
She's a person of flesh and blood,
just like us.

34
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,834
She was the protagonist

35
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,670
in the first chapter that shook the world.

36
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:38,384
Now she's the protagonist in the story
of restoring order to the world.

37
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:44,098
A story with such a strong character
doesn't fall apart easily,

38
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:48,186
which means the New Truth's power
will keep growing indefinitely

39
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,438
as long as they have Park Jungja.

40
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:55,777
But if Sodo takes her away from them,

41
00:03:56,444 --> 00:04:01,157
Sodo will physically have Park Jungja,
and the New Truth will have her influence.

42
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,533
That's how

43
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,495
you would share her. It's beautiful.

44
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,093
Why do you make things so difficult?

45
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,763
The government
should just take Park Jungja

46
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:27,558
and announce that these phenomena
aren't related to human behavior.

47
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:31,562
The president must be quite determined
if you're planning something like this!

48
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:40,488
You're still as naive as ever, Sungjip.

49
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,201
Sungjip.

50
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:52,041
What do you think people have craved most
in the history of humanity?

51
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:52,959
Any ideas?

52
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:03,386
It's God's punishment that can be seen…

53
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,433
in the real world.

54
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,646
Witnessing villains crying in fear,

55
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,400
confessing and repenting their sins,
and getting torn apart…

56
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:23,281
People have already tasted the pleasure
of seeing those things,

57
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:27,160
and you want the government
to take that away from them?

58
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,539
There will be a significant aversion
to public authority.

59
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,752
So what is it that you want?

60
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,215
The thing about people is
that when one idea starts dominating,

61
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,677
they are bound to feel
an urge to oppose it.

62
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,722
If we fail to keep
those urges under control,

63
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:52,018
terrorist groups like the Arrowhead
will spring up everywhere.

64
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,773
So what we want

65
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:02,528
is a world where two opposing ideologies,
ones we can regulate,

66
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,075
are locked in an endless battle.

67
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,827
A world that we can control,

68
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,997
yet one that still grants people
some level of freedom

69
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:17,210
to express themselves,
follow their passions, and so on.

70
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,380
A world with order, you know.

71
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:34,352
We didn't make all those sacrifices
to pass down that kind of world.

72
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:42,235
It seems you're no longer
the woman of principle I once worked for.

73
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,529
I'm going to go now.

74
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,075
Pass down what?

75
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:53,871
Look.

76
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:58,626
The world is already ruined.
What will be left to pass down?

77
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,920
Hey, Sungjip. Kim Sungjip!

78
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:05,091
Even if the world turns
into a fucking hell,

79
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:08,136
we still need a system to sustain it!

80
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,432
That's the best world
you could possibly create for your kids.

81
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,516
Do you hear me?

82
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,694
Even if we kidnapped Park Jungja,
we wouldn't be able to keep her.

83
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,156
Why? Because of Min Hyejin?

84
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,742
She will try to take her to her family.

85
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:37,999
I know.

86
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,460
I used to like her, you know.

87
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,006
I even wanted her to represent our party.

88
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,928
But that was back in the good old days.
Things are different now.

89
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,143
Min Hyejin has nothing to lose
except her principles.

90
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,061
But we are different.

91
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:04,525
You and I still have
a lot of people we cannot lose.

92
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,068
Don't you think?

93
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,573
Your plan was to involve
someone who received a decree?

94
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,160
All right, let's move!

95
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,815
HELLBOUND SEASON 2

96
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,490
Move! No, get off me!

97
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,913
No! Get off me!

98
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,456
I confess my sins!

99
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,375
Let me join the demonstration!

100
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,835
Let me join too!

101
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,004
I confess my sins!

102
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:17,557
The Sodo people are making their way
into the underground passage we secured.

103
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,394
More policemen were dispatched
as a precaution against potential riots.

104
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,398
Things are moving quicker than expected
but within our forecast.

105
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,734
The Resurrected One and Chairman Kim
safely left the scene.

106
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,237
All stations have started reporting
on the incident,

107
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,574
and NTBC is preparing
extensive special coverage.

108
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,786
Where are the Sodo people right now?

109
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,039
They entered Building A
via the exit on the west side.

110
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,210
The exit on the west side of Building A.

111
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,047
I see. All right, good.

112
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,426
Ms. Lee.

113
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,054
Pinwheel started streaming secretly
ten minutes ago.

114
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,224
He's telling the Arrowhead
to enter the main building.

115
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,892
I'll share it on the screen.

116
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,898
Hurry! Come to the main building now!

117
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,193
Today is gonna be one heck of a day.

118
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,695
Please hurry!

119
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,867
-To the main building!
-Let's go!

120
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,244
Pinwheel is calling us!

121
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,691
WHY IS THE ARROWHEAD GATHERING
AT THE NEW TRUTH'S MAIN BUILDING?

122
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,199
They must think law enforcement is a joke.

123
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,328
Who do they think they are?

124
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,247
Charge!

125
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,839
Gather around, everyone!

126
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,259
I should…

127
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,305
appear sooner than planned.

128
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:22,682
Yes, sir.

129
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,017
A message from Chairman Jung.

130
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,311
He wants to appear sooner than planned.

131
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,229
Okay, got it.

132
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,356
As promised,

133
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,983
we'll take our first step
towards the new beginning

134
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,362
and make a big announcement!

135
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,366
THE CHAIRMAN WANTS TO APPEAR EARLIER

136
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,284
Before we do that,

137
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,414
we need to capture
Kim Jeongchil and Park Jungja.

138
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:47,873
Fellow members!

139
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,917
We need your help!

140
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,586
Show them what we got!

141
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,046
Cut!

142
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,008
Hey, get me some water.

143
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,305
Chairman Jung, we've found a better place.

144
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,223
Let's go.

145
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,642
All right, let's go!

146
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,031
Mr. Jeong,
is your demonstration in an hour?

147
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,078
In about 56 minutes.

148
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,582
In area A18,
first floor of the outdoor parking lot,

149
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,041
there's a black van.

150
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,293
The key's inside.

151
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,336
The license plate is 3081.

152
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,381
We must rescue Ms. Park
and get to the van in 56 minutes.

153
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,301
Mr. Jeong here will help us escape.

154
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,596
What the hell are you doing now?

155
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,056
Are you using the demonstration subjects?

156
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,310
Isn't rescuing Ms. Park our priority?

157
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,980
Branch leaders wouldn't have agreed
if it weren't for this plan.

158
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,608
Ms. Min.

159
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,153
It's not true at all
that we're being used.

160
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,364
Both Ms. Lee and I agreed to do this.

161
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,826
Please fix this world.

162
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,414
Please don't let our deaths be in vain.

163
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,292
Please.

164
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,505
Ms. Min and I will go rescue Ms. Park.

165
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,674
Mr. Jeong, please stand by in the van.

166
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,592
Okay.

167
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,011
Where is she right now?

168
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,096
Our informant will let us know soon.

169
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,057
Mr. Jeong, you should go ahead.

170
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,974
Okay.

171
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,902
Many people got caught and hurt
in the demonstration.

172
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,905
You'll have to answer for that
when this is over.

173
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,326
I just hope we make it out alive.

174
00:13:58,754 --> 00:13:59,588
Push through!

175
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,840
Make way!

176
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:01,841
Out of the way!

177
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,259
You bastards!

178
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,812
Stop them. Stop them at any cost!

179
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,272
Sir.

180
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,526
The Arrowhead members
are charging into the main building.

181
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,362
That's…

182
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,786
CULT LEADER

183
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,166
Hello?

184
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,420
Ms. Lee. The Arrowhead is causing havoc.
Please get us out of here.

185
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,422
Right, please calm down first.

186
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,632
We're fully aware of the situation.

187
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,885
We've got a SWAT team nearby.

188
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,596
They'll enter the main building soon.

189
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:53,684
What's important is that you don't let
the Arrowhead take Park Jungja.

190
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:58,022
Do you think we want that?
Things are getting out of hand here!

191
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,232
I told you to calm down.

192
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,693
Where are you?

193
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,820
-Where are we?
-Second floor, Building C.

194
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,071
Second floor, Building C.

195
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,116
Pinwheel is now heading
to the first floor of Building A.

196
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,329
Listen carefully.

197
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,289
Head to…

198
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,001
the third floor of Building B.

199
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,087
-Third floor, Building B?
-Yes, go to the end of the hall.

200
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,257
We'll send in a rescue team soon.
Do you understand?

201
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,634
All right, fine.

202
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,511
A rescue team, a SWAT team, or whatever.
Send them now! Fuck!

203
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,978
Did he just say "fuck"?

204
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,397
Yes, he said "fuck."

205
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,784
Now, let's send Sodo over to them.

206
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,507
3RD FLOOR OF BUILDING B, END OF THE HALL

207
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,594
She is at the end
of the third-floor hall, Building B.

208
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,262
Let's move.

209
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,561
This is insane.

210
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,563
Man, what is this place?

211
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,329
What do you think?

212
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,583
Isn't this the perfect place
to announce your return?

213
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,378
This way, sir.

214
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,975
All right, we're going live

215
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:58,892
in five,

216
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:00,602
four,

217
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,438
three,

218
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,355
two,

219
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:04,940
one.

220
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,400
All right!

221
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,027
Let me ask you a question.

222
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,448
Who do you think can cleanse the world
of chaos and sin

223
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,116
and restore God's will?

224
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,826
No one!

225
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,119
Who?

226
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,872
Who could it be? Who?

227
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,000
Kim Jeongchil, the fraud?

228
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,127
Of course not!

229
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,714
Of course not!

230
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,928
The man who first enlightened us
about God's will.

231
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:39,558
Our world needs him again right now!

232
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,976
Right now, right here!

233
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:43,979
Chairman Jung.

234
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:49,610
Our one and only chairman has returned!

235
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,950
Chairman Jung Jinsu is back!

236
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,204
Chairman Jung Jinsu is here right now!

237
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,623
He's waiting for us!

238
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,250
Listen to his words!

239
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,628
Chairman Jung is back!

240
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,422
Listen to his words!

241
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,175
He's back! Chairman Jung is back!

242
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,052
Sir.

243
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,973
Jung Jinsu, the former chairman,
has shown up.

244
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,062
Right now, I'm standing
at the center of the New Truth.

245
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,233
Even when the current New Truth

246
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,194
led you astray
with false teachings of God's will,

247
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,990
I kept my faith and waited for them
to return to their rightful duties.

248
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,827
However…

249
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,706
I couldn't sit back and watch them

250
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,043
distort God's new message,
the resurrection,

251
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,963
for their own selfish interests.

252
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:52,589
That's why

253
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,967
I have returned.

254
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,888
Everyone, I would like to meet
Ms. Park Jungja, the Resurrected One.

255
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,225
And just like I did eight years ago,

256
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:09,898
I wish to present you
with the new, true will of God.

257
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,443
I sincerely ask you.

258
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,738
Please…

259
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,284
let me meet Park Jungja.

260
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,746
Chairman Jung wants to meet
the Resurrected One!

261
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,415
Push through!

262
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,097
To the chairman's office!

263
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,269
Capture Kim Jeongchil!

264
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,656
JUNG IS IN THE MAIN BUILDING
WITH THE ARROWHEAD

265
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,160
What is it?

266
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,120
Jung Jinsu is here.

267
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,038
What?

268
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,124
Kim Jeongchil!

269
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,459
Where are you hiding?

270
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,132
Chairman Jung wants to meet
the Resurrected One!

271
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,258
Search everywhere!

272
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,969
Building B is just around the corner.

273
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,900
KIM SUJEONG
DEMONSTRATION DATE: 8.1.2024

274
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,443
SINS: GROUP ASSAULT, ABETTING MURDER

275
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,079
Jung is looking for Ms. Park Jungja.
We must hurry.

276
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,420
Get him!

277
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,298
It's Min Hyejin!

278
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,466
Let everyone know!

279
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,776
Get them!

280
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,156
Are you all right?

281
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:39,816
What was that?

282
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,401
What was that gunshot?

283
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,987
Min Hyejin showed up on the third floor.

284
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:47,783
Min Hyejin, that bitch.
She always gets in our way.

285
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,755
Where's the end of the hall?

286
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:02,798
Come this way.

287
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:12,891
What the hell?

288
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,147
-Are you sure those lunatics aren't here?
-I'm not too sure.

289
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,816
But I think so.

290
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,775
Go check.

291
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:22,692
Me?

292
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,445
Go, you dumbass!

293
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,363
Yes, sir.

294
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,456
The world…

295
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,749
What's wrong with her?

296
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,168
She's been like that for a bit.

297
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,255
-What's she saying?
-Something about the world ending.

298
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,508
That goddamn nutcase! For fuck's sake.

299
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,386
Sir, we should move quickly now.

300
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,971
Come on, let's go.

301
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,934
The world…

302
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,782
Who are you?

303
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,159
Hurry. Get down there.

304
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,037
We asked a question.

305
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,790
Who are you? Are you a deacon?

306
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,418
No, I'm just…

307
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,837
I'm just a janitor here.

308
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,672
-Janitor?
-Yes.

309
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,258
-Should we let him go?
-Hang on. Let me ask first.

310
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,929
We've got someone here.
He says he's a janitor.

311
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,139
A janitor?

312
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,100
How old does he look?

313
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,770
Shit, he's an old man. Just let him go.

314
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:42,981
Wait.

315
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:44,608
Yes, sir?

316
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,277
Tell them…

317
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,614
to search the man.

318
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:52,782
Yes, sir.

319
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,913
Hey, search him just to be sure.

320
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:00,916
Okay.

321
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,084
Hey, grab him.

322
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,172
Stay still.

323
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,759
I don't have anything.

324
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,220
Wait, that's…

325
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:18,808
What's the timer for?

326
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,021
That's when I get off work.

327
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,190
Timer?

328
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,692
He set a timer?

329
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,362
He must've received a decree.

330
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,072
Sorry?

331
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,532
"A decree"?

332
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,493
Sodo is using sinners right now.

333
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,120
How much time is left on his timer?

334
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,831
How much time is left?

335
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,668
About 42 minutes.

336
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,462
The demonstration is in 42 minutes.

337
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,007
That's when they will take Park Jungja.

338
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,760
Tell them to bring him here.

339
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:54,928
Yes, sir.

340
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,807
Hey, bring him here right now.

341
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,433
That bastard is from Sodo.

342
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:02,769
Hey.

343
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,187
He is from Sodo.

344
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,652
Let's go!

345
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,993
Have you located Park Jungja yet?

346
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,870
No. We have members
searching for her everywhere.

347
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,173
The public's reaction

348
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,635
to Jung Jinsu's appearance
is quite concerning.

349
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,388
The police command is failing,

350
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,974
and civilians are in the way
of the riot police.

351
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:45,854
It would be difficult
to arrest Jung Jinsu in public.

352
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:48,648
At this point,

353
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,152
taking strong measures
against the Arrowhead

354
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,946
would negatively affect public opinion.

355
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,159
We should halt the operation

356
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:03,038
and call it a conflict between Sodo,
the New Truth, and the Arrowhead.

357
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,383
Not yet.

358
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:24,893
We just need to get Park Jungja out.
We can deal with the rest once she's out.

359
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,147
Third floor, end of the hall!

360
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,148
Where are they?

361
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,360
Where are they? Where's the rescue team?

362
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:36,321
-Where's the rescue team?
-I'll look for them, sir!

363
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,031
Where the fuck are they?

364
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,491
Where's Kim Jeongchil?

365
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,450
Where is he?

366
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,077
That's Kim Jeongchil over there!

367
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,662
-Come on, hurry!
-Come on!

368
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,247
Close the door now!

369
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,336
-The Resurrected One is here!
-Stop them!

370
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,966
Fuck. Get her!

371
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,510
Don't let her get away!

372
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,930
-We found the Resurrected One.
-Okay.

373
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,349
Chairman Jung, we're going back live.

374
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,684
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

375
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,685
Let's move out!

376
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,573
Hey! You crazy bitch!

377
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,537
We're doing all this crap because of you!

378
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,540
Don't try too hard.

379
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,625
What?

380
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,504
The world is already over anyway!

381
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,592
That crazy bitch!

382
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,473
Ms. Park Jungja. Are you all right?

383
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,059
Min Hyejin, you fucking bitch.

384
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:51,730
I should've killed you myself
instead of leaving it to the Arrowhead.

385
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,737
-He went that way! Get him!
-That way!

386
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,368
This time,
I'll leave you with the Arrowhead.

387
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,036
What?

388
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,580
It's Kim Jeongchil!

389
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,460
Min Hyejin is over there!

390
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,044
Get him!

391
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,755
There she is!

392
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:17,714
Go on ahead!

393
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:40,528
Pick up!

394
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,239
Hello?

395
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,408
The rescue team! Where's the rescue team?

396
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,868
Chairman Kim Jeongchil.

397
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:48,953
Where's Park Jungja?

398
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,789
I don't fucking know!

399
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,415
Min Hyejin took her.

400
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,542
Just forget her and get me out, okay?

401
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:06,513
How influential is Kim Jeongchil
within the New Truth?

402
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,641
He doesn't have much influence on his own.

403
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,937
Adviser Ju Cheolhwan wields influence
within the organization.

404
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,440
And Vice Chairwoman Geum Yeongsuk
has a prominent public presence.

405
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,151
He's certainly replaceable.

406
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,617
CULT LEADER

407
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,461
All right. That's good.

408
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,090
Pick up. Come on, pick up!

409
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,229
The man who betrayed God's will!

410
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,107
Kim Jeongchil!

411
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,114
Stop tainting God's will
and confess your sins to Him!

412
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,493
You goddamn cult fanatics.

413
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,162
What would you know about God's will?

414
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,499
I'm the chairman of the New Truth!

415
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,168
I'm the appointed messenger of God!

416
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:25,049
That's not your fucking place,
you motherfucker!

417
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:37,979
Jung Jinsu.

418
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,733
Chairman Kim Jeongchil.

419
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,193
Where's Park Jungja?

420
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,070
Jung Jinsu.

421
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,907
Min Hyejin took her.

422
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,330
Find Min Hyejin right now.

423
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,499
Jung Jinsu!

424
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,751
Help me!

425
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,836
Hey!

426
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,172
I know your secret.

427
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:08,509
I can expose your secret
to the whole world if I want to, okay?

428
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:10,845
Let go of him.

429
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,190
Go ahead.

430
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,359
What?

431
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,948
Go ahead and say

432
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,533
what you were gonna say.

433
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,749
Jung Jinsu is a sinner!

434
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,836
He received a decree 20 years ago!

435
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,431
He was subjected to demonstration,
went to Hell, and…

436
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:02,730
Is that all?

437
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,650
For your last words?

438
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,744
All right!

439
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:21,249
We will now perform good deeds
to repent for your sins.

440
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,500
Everyone!

441
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:26,462
We're not at liberty
to turn a blind eye to evil!

442
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:31,968
Everyone! Let's begin. Begin!

443
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,930
Send him to Hell!

444
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,682
Go to Hell!

445
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,645
Punish him!

446
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,648
Jeongchil, you need a good beating!

447
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,092
So that was it.

448
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,220
What Park Jungja was talking about.

449
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,027
Kill him!

450
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,712
Chairman Jung, are you all right?

451
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,341
Sir.

452
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,483
Ms. Park Jungja.

453
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,944
Listen to me! Pull yourself together!

454
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,488
Ms. Park Jungja! It's me, Min Hyejin.

455
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,079
Your lawyer.

456
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,793
Do you remember me?

457
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,176
I'll take you to your children.

458
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,977
The man I was with will be here shortly.
We'll go with him.

459
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,239
Toys.

460
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,619
Something like an elephant.

461
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,039
Sorry?

462
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:13,796
A place with toys
and something that looks like an elephant…

463
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,300
That's…

464
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,804
where you'll die.

465
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:59,837
