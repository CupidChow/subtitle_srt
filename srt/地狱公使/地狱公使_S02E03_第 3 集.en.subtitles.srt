1
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,333
Chairman Jung!

2
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,044
Are you okay?

3
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,256
Where am I?

4
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,177
This is where I live.

5
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:54,846
Don't you remember?

6
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,723
I found you on the mountain trail…

7
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,018
Am I really myself this time?

8
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,644
Sir?

9
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,828
If you need help, just tell me and I will…

10
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,882
Sir?

11
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,551
Chairman Jung!

12
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,689
Sir, are you all right?

13
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,235
Would you like some water?

14
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,324
Please.

15
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,744
Please stop.

16
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,286
HELLBOUND SEASON 2

17
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,293
Ms. Park Jungja.

18
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:54,424
The world is in total chaos,
and this country is close to collapsing.

19
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,594
Only you, Ms. Park Jungja,

20
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,139
who came back to life
after the demonstration,

21
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,183
can fix this chaos.

22
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,814
Say something. Anything.

23
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,819
All right, well…

24
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,906
What was Hell like?

25
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:22,785
It can't… be described with words.

26
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:28,124
We'll be the ones to determine
if you're making sense or not,

27
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:32,086
so just talk.
Aren't you tired of this? It's been years.

28
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,927
Does it sound like
I'm asking you for a favor?

29
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,471
I'm giving you a chance.

30
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,933
This situation is already out of my hands.

31
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,186
There are people out there
who will do anything

32
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:52,190
to make you say what we want
if you don't talk now.

33
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,191
Okay?

34
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,408
-Never-ending…
-What?

35
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:04,953
Despair!

36
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,414
Despair

37
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,459
that I may never be able

38
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,128
to reach them.

39
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,758
It makes me miss them even more.

40
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,847
As if the feeling of longing and despair

41
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,850
will go on forever.

42
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,520
That feeling.

43
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,605
That's what it feels like.

44
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,234
And you live that feeling.

45
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,489
How poetic of you.

46
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,005
All right. Let's continue.

47
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,174
You said you missed someone.

48
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,135
Who exactly did you mean?

49
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,015
My children.

50
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,519
Eunyul.

51
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,231
Hayul.

52
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,443
Enough with Eunyul and Hayul!

53
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,862
I would bring them here now

54
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:24,032
and pull out their goddamn nails
to make you talk!

55
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,909
Min Hyejin hid them so well
that they can't be found.

56
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,662
I've told you a million times!

57
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,707
Sinner Park Jungja.

58
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:37,003
Your dear children are living in a world
that is about to be ruined.

59
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,838
Have some sense of responsibility!

60
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,550
Among the countless sinners,

61
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,385
only you came back to life!

62
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,890
It's your duty to deliver God's message!
Do you hear me?

63
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,065
You know,

64
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,735
your children must miss you

65
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,197
as much as you miss them, right?

66
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,285
And?

67
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,664
It looks like
you're finally willing to talk.

68
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,840
PARK JUNGJA, WHO FACED DEMONSTRATION
EIGHT YEARS AGO, HAS RESURRECTED!

69
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,758
Look.

70
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,176
FOOTAGE OF PARK'S RESURRECTION REVEALED

71
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,762
The entire world knows
about your resurrection.

72
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,642
Eunyul and Hayul must know
about it as well, right?

73
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,770
So what do you think they'll do?

74
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,566
Obviously, they'd want to see you.

75
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,113
Min Hyejin might have hidden them well…

76
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,700
but we don't really have to look for them

77
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,120
because they will come to us eventually.

78
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,330
Why?

79
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,668
Because they miss their mom.

80
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,546
Because she's here.

81
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,136
I'll do it.

82
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,762
What?

83
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,557
I'll do anything.

84
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,061
Please leave my children alone.

85
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,896
Please make sure…

86
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,066
my children…

87
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,362
never try to come find me.

88
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,255
From this moment on,

89
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,425
you're not a sinner.

90
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,635
You're the Resurrected One.

91
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:55,641
The one who came back to this world
to declare the New Will of God.

92
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,439
Okay.

93
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,116
Kim Jeongchil, you crazy son of a bitch.

94
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,377
EUNYUL:
WE'RE WELL. TAKE CARE, MS. MIN!

95
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,338
THANKS, EUNYUL. KEEP ME UPDATED

96
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,388
MS. MIN, PLEASE SAVE MY MOM

97
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,431
I'LL THINK OF A WAY

98
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,518
Ms. Min.

99
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,019
Yes?

100
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,729
The meeting is about to start.

101
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:42,980
Okay.

102
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,612
Chairman Jung, are you feeling better now?

103
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,160
Yes, I'm okay.

104
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,412
Would you like me to take you to a doctor?

105
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,544
Can I get computer access?

106
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,713
Yes, of course. One moment, please.

107
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,267
Here. Please use it as needed.
I'm going out for a smoke.

108
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,329
THE NEW TRUTH

109
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,212
WHERE ARE SODO, MIN,
AND PARK'S CHILDREN?

110
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,798
WHEREABOUTS OF MIN,
LAWYER WHO DEFENDED PARK JUNGJA, UNKNOWN

111
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,845
KIM, THE NEW TRUTH'S 2ND CHAIRMAN!
"CHAIRMAN JUNG'S DECISION"

112
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:08,149
NEWBORN CHILD RECEIVES DECREE
AND SURVIVES THE DEMONSTRATION!

113
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:09,692
Yes, okay.

114
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,616
Yes.

115
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,328
So what do you need me to do now?

116
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,790
He seems to be out of his mind.

117
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,251
He screams for no reason.

118
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,630
He's not completely himself.

119
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,806
BREAKING NEWS
SINNER PARK JUNGJA RESURRECTED 4 YEARS AGO

120
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,321
Yes.

121
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,284
All right, I got it.
I'll bring him there, then.

122
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:01,827
Yes.

123
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,954
Just text me the address.

124
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:05,956
Okay.

125
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,144
SECURITY CAMERA

126
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,371
What the hell?

127
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:42,970
All right.

128
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,306
Everyone's here, so let's get started.

129
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,559
We'll begin with the most pressing matter.

130
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,228
Jung Jinsu has resurrected.

131
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,440
Is he really back?

132
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,318
We received this footage an hour ago.

133
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,622
He really is back.

134
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,584
A member living near the orphanage
captured him.

135
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,837
He'll be moved
to our branch's safe house soon.

136
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,380
Safe house…

137
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,010
What are we going to do with him?

138
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,596
Following the agreed
resurrection response plan,

139
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,515
we should isolate him

140
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,893
and investigate what happened
after his demonstration.

141
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,104
To see if Hell actually exists.

142
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,856
For how long?

143
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,068
The New Truth had Ms. Park Jungja
for four years,

144
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,986
but they didn't find out anything.

145
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,865
Either way, we need to keep him
until we obtain some useful information.

146
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,664
Are you saying
you want to lock him up indefinitely?

147
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,332
Ms. Min.

148
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,627
Legal thinking only matters
with a functioning legal system.

149
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,920
Should we let him go?

150
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,714
Or should we let everyone know
that Jung Jinsu is back?

151
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,592
We don't know
what kind of chaos it may bring

152
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,428
or how the Arrowhead
or the New Truth might abuse it.

153
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,723
The resurrection response plan
was approved in the last meeting.

154
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,058
Should we reevaluate?

155
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,686
No, I'll follow your decision.

156
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,022
Instead, I'd like to discuss
the rescue plan for Ms. Park

157
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,483
that I previously proposed.

158
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,819
With the upcoming announcement
of the New Will,

159
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,613
the New Truth's security
is as tight as the Blue House.

160
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,575
It's absolutely impossible
with our resources.

161
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,493
But if their announcement is successful,

162
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,997
the New Truth's doctrine
will become the country's new system,

163
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,957
turning Korea into a theocracy.

164
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,711
That may be better than the Arrowhead
taking over the country.

165
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,255
They're having their own power struggle.

166
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,424
Why meddle in that?

167
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,345
What exactly are you planning to do
after rescuing Ms. Park Jungja?

168
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,638
What do you mean?

169
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,474
Take her to her family, of course.

170
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,269
Don't you care
about the damage that might cause us?

171
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:59,189
He's right. It's way too risky
when we're uncertain about the benefit.

172
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,774
Hard to understand?

173
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:05,613
Does reuniting a mother with her children
really require any explanation?

174
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,114
"Risky"?

175
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,366
Name one thing we've done
that wasn't risky.

176
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,329
We used to sacrifice several members
just to save one recipient of a decree.

177
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:17,374
When did we become a political group
that acts solely based on gain or loss?

178
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:22,880
So you want to put us all in danger
for some kids we've never seen?

179
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,883
Where the hell are Park's kids anyway?

180
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,179
I'm Ms. Park Jungja's attorney.

181
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,015
Back then, I promised her

182
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,018
I'd keep her children safe
somewhere no one knew them.

183
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,563
Revealing their whereabouts
would be unethical.

184
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,441
So now you're a lawyer?

185
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,360
Ms. Min,

186
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:48,739
do you want to use us as pawns
while keeping crucial details to yourself?

187
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,659
You took the baby
who survived the demonstration,

188
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,620
and you refuse to share information
about Park's family!

189
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,830
Do you think
Sodo is your private organization?

190
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,583
I'm not trying to keep anything to myself!

191
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:03,045
Those people are not objects
you can own to gain power!

192
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,176
If you refuse to do it,
I'm going to do it on my own.

193
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,427
Come on, everyone!

194
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,806
Let's all calm down.

195
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,893
Ms. Min is right
about things getting out of hand

196
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,687
once the New Will is announced.

197
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,690
Since you're so determined,
we'll discuss it further.

198
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,108
Fine.

199
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:28,028
Whatever you decide,
please do it as soon as possible.

200
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,363
We don't have much time.

201
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:32,783
All branch leaders except Ms. Min,
we'll resume after a ten-minute break.

202
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,743
Please access the link I've sent.

203
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,846
Are you awake, Chairman Jung Jinsu?

204
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,475
Who are you?

205
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,770
Where are we going?

206
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,106
You'll be under Sodo's watch from now on.

207
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,902
-Sodo?
-Yes.

208
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,988
I didn't cover your mouth

209
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:57,659
because I won't get a chance
to talk to you once I hand you over.

210
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,078
So how do you feel?

211
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,831
About what?

212
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,253
I'm sure you saw on the Internet
how crazy the world is now.

213
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,755
I was curious

214
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,342
how you would feel,

215
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,095
seeing that the world you created
has become such a mess.

216
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,306
So?

217
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,477
Is this the kind of world you wanted?

218
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,439
Did you get
the kind of justice you wanted?

219
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,651
What do you want from me?

220
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,032
Do you want to take revenge on me?

221
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,368
Revenge?

222
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,831
How should I take my revenge?

223
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,291
Should I kill you?

224
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,799
Death wouldn't mean much to you
since you've already experienced it.

225
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,427
I just wanted to let you know
what you have done.

226
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,389
I don't understand what you're saying.

227
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,517
Why don't you break it down for me?

228
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:09,773
My wife…

229
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,404
was destroyed
by the idea you put inside her head.

230
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,992
We have breaking news.

231
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,411
Reports have emerged this afternoon
of strange creatures

232
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,955
seen near Hapseong Station
in the heart of Seoul.

233
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:30,377
Shocking eyewitness footage
filmed at the scene has emerged.

234
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:35,382
The videos are quickly spreading online
and across social media.

235
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,842
Jiwon.

236
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,886
I'm home.

237
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,263
…brutally kill a fleeing man

238
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,473
and disappear into thin air,

239
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,100
leaving viewers in shock.

240
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,060
Jiwon, what are you doing?

241
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:47,978
Hey.

242
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,730
You're back.

243
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,815
-Have you eaten?
-I have.

244
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:57,779
What's so interesting
that you can't take your eyes off the TV?

245
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,616
Something strange must have happened.

246
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,035
What is that?

247
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,621
Meanwhile, some speculate

248
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,833
that this incident was related
to a religious group called the New Truth.

249
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:14,630
Online, trending searches
are currently dominated by "The New Truth"

250
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,798
and the name of its chairman,
"Jung Jinsu."

251
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:47,913
Jiwon.

252
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,644
Those saying humans
are above everything else…

253
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,109
Jiwon!

254
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,445
Why are you still up?
You have work tomorrow.

255
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,947
I'll sleep in a bit.

256
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,412
The concept of sin exists
because humans choose to sin.

257
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,550
I'm sorry.

258
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,719
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

259
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,613
Ten.

260
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,157
Nine.

261
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,034
Eight.

262
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:08,618
Seven.

263
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:09,995
Six.

264
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,580
Five.

265
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,248
Four.

266
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:14,958
Three.

267
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,418
Two.

268
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,045
One.

269
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,644
Jiwon, let's go now, okay?

270
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:37,773
Jiwon.

271
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,258
Jiwon, don't go any closer. Jiwon!

272
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,013
Let's go, okay?

273
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,108
Jiwon!

274
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,994
Jiwon.

275
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,136
Jiwon, this is dangerous.

276
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,638
What's all this? You could hurt yourself.

277
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:35,891
Dear me.

278
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,273
What are you doing, darling?

279
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,696
The New Truth's next chairman
has been chosen.

280
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,241
Oh, really? Is it on the news?

281
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,242
No.

282
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,328
On the Internet.

283
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,792
They say an official announcement
will be made in three days.

284
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,511
Why don't we go for a drive?

285
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,346
Where is

286
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,598
Chairman Jung Jinsu?

287
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,977
You said you wanted to go the other day.

288
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,395
Let's go!

289
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:23,897
Okay?

290
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:38,203
Jiwon, remember the client
I told you about? The building owner.

291
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,623
He already confirmed everything,
but now he wants to back out.

292
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,458
What does he expect me to do?

293
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,127
He deserves a demonstration, doesn't he?

294
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,050
Sehyeong, don't say that.

295
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,093
What?

296
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,097
Oh, right.

297
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,807
Yeah, I'm sorry.

298
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,852
Winning the lottery is more likely
than facing a demonstration,

299
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,229
so I was only joking.

300
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,106
Don't talk about it like that!

301
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:10,777
Even if it happens to just one person,
it's like it's happening to all of us.

302
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,489
Mentioning demonstrations
with indifference is blasphemous.

303
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,491
Sorry, Jiwon. Please just calm down.

304
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,659
No!

305
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,412
It's not me you should be apologizing to!

306
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,250
Please.

307
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,004
Please!

308
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,297
All right. Sorry, Jiwon.

309
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,965
Calm down. I'm sorry.

310
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,017
I'm sorry, Jiwon. Honey.

311
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,778
We've got to finish the tiling
by next week.

312
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:54,904
I'll do my best.

313
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,949
We have no choice.
We need to install the drywall this week.

314
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:04,581
They must have thought
they could break our faith with this,

315
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,665
but not even close!

316
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,252
This baby's demonstration
has further proven

317
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:13,256
that our beliefs and the path
that we have pursued are correct.

318
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,842
All right.
Let me, Pinwheel, tell you this.

319
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,470
This was God's merciful intervention

320
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,389
to punish the child's mother and father
for their sins.

321
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,892
Through this couple,

322
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:29,939
God clearly showed us how we should repent
and seek atonement for our sins!

323
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,234
We must answer God's calling.

324
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,863
We must devote ourselves
to the opportunities God gives us!

325
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,825
The Arrowhead!

326
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,081
All right. Thank you.

327
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:48,875
Hello?

328
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:52,420
Ms. Oh hasn't come to work today.

329
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,256
Really? But I saw her
leaving the house this morning.

330
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:56,591
I see.

331
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:02,639
Is everything okay with Ms. Oh?

332
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,600
She's been looking a little down,

333
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:10,563
and she's been taking
a lot of days off lately.

334
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,484
I see. Let me talk to her
and get back to you.

335
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,860
All right, then.

336
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:16,820
Bye.

337
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,122
Jiwon.

338
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,592
Jiwon.

339
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,512
Oh Jiwon--

340
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,905
We, the Arrowhead,
must surrender to God's will

341
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,743
and engage as actively as we can
in God's intervention!

342
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:08,955
We're the only ones
who can spread the true will of God!

343
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:15,754
The Arrowhead!

344
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,645
Jiwon.

345
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,605
Let's go home.

346
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,107
Let's talk at home, okay?

347
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,276
I can't.

348
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,196
Our members will soon bring in a sinner.

349
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,032
So what if they do?
What are you going to do?

350
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,702
I'm going to join the demonstration.

351
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:34,791
I'm going to confess all my sins to God.

352
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,085
What are you saying?

353
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,839
Are you planning to kill yourself
or something?

354
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,382
Kill myself?

355
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:43,967
How dare you!

356
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,344
This isn't like that kind of sin!

357
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:51,015
I'm revealing all my sins before God
and asking for His forgiveness!

358
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,102
What sins?

359
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,524
You wouldn't hurt a fly,
so what sins could you have committed?

360
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,651
The sin of negligence!

361
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,487
The sin of neglecting this world
that refused to change

362
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,699
when God gave us an opportunity
by showing us the way!

363
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:10,827
Jiwon.

364
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,496
Please stop.

365
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,333
Please, okay?

366
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:19,919
Please!

367
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,130
I am

368
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,716
no longer Oh Jiwon.

369
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:31,347
I'm Miss Sunshine of the Arrowhead,
devoted to following God's will.

370
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:36,603
Chairman Jung Jinsu called this
a demonstration, no less.

371
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:40,189
He said God was showing us
what will happen to us when we die.

372
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,819
He also said
that we will all face it eventually

373
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,739
if we're not forgiven while we're alive.

374
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,657
Jiwon, please!

375
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,077
Please come to your senses, okay?

376
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,204
Come to your senses…

377
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:00,126
so we can go back to our ordinary life.

378
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,921
I beg you. Please.

379
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:03,880
"Ordinary"?

380
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,424
What I'm trying to do now…

381
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,887
is put an end to that ordinary world.

382
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,057
Don't you get it?

383
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,935
Everything that we thought was ordinary

384
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,520
was the evil of the world.

385
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,400
You're the one

386
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,694
who needs to come to your senses.

387
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:32,951
What's that?

388
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,037
-The sinner must be here.
-Jiwon!

389
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:43,878
What's going on?

390
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,547
The sinner is here.
His demonstration will begin soon.

391
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:47,924
What?

392
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,476
Here's the sinner!

393
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,855
Three minutes!
Just hold out for three minutes!

394
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,649
Get him! Come on!

395
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,404
Stay still!

396
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,206
Untie this now!

397
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,542
Bring him over here! Over here!

398
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,045
Over there!

399
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,713
Go! Hurry!

400
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,682
Hey! Give me a hand here!

401
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,601
-Quickly!
-Come on!

402
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,518
Hurry!

403
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,562
Come on, push!

404
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,191
Pull him! Quickly!

405
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,030
Here! Put him on this!

406
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,490
Hurry!

407
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:39,702
Hurry!

408
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,039
Go!

409
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,333
Keep pushing!

410
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,709
-Come on, push!
-Push!

411
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,877
Now!

412
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,595
Get down!

413
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,932
Push!

414
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,028
Everyone, pile on him!

415
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,863
Join the demonstration!

416
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,032
Let's save ourselves from our sins!

417
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,868
-To the path to atonement!
-I ask for your forgiveness!

418
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,541
I'm coming too!

419
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,086
Jiwon, no! Don't!

420
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,089
-Jiwon!
-No, let me go!

421
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,465
I have to join them!

422
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,467
I have to join them!

423
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,851
I have to join them!

424
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,894
Please stop, Jiwon. Let's go!

425
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:47,812
Let go of me!

426
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,579
Jiwon!

427
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,774
I am forgiven.

428
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,491
God

429
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,621
has forgiven my sins!

430
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:01,510
I have been forgiven!

431
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:08,601
The Arrowhead!

432
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:20,780
Jiwon.

433
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,791
The purgation is not only for the sinners!

434
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,086
The flames of purgation
burn off all of our sins!

435
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,213
MY LOVE, HOPE WE CAN HAVE DINNER
TOGETHER TONIGHT

436
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:41,133
We must all submit ourselves
to God's retribution!

437
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,846
This first divine appearance in millennia
signifies God's intervention…

438
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,765
I'LL BE A LITTLE LATE TONIGHT!
DON'T SKIP DINNER

439
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:53,354
…urging us to admit our sins openly
and seek repentance.

440
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,732
It is humanity's final opportunity!

441
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:01,070
The Arrowhead!

442
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,869
-We'll finish with paint.
-Yes.

443
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,080
Should we use the color you suggested?

444
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,540
Yes. Please be on time.

445
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,874
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

446
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,224
HONEY, I'M AFRAID I HAVE SINNED AGAIN
I MUST SEEK FORGIVENESS ONCE MORE

447
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,984
The Arrowhead!

448
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,798
Why?!

449
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,179
Why?!

450
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,604
Why?

451
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,690
Why?!

452
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,821
Why did you associate
those monsters with sin?

453
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,116
You knew it wasn't true!

454
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,328
You made it so that…

455
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,999
even if someone joins the demonstration…

456
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,337
and survives…

457
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:28,342
they can never escape their sins
as long as they are alive.

458
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,638
For your wife…

459
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,308
that was a pleasure.

460
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:38,561
What?

461
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:41,397
That feeling
of following God's will together.

462
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,024
That wholeness.

463
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,610
That sense of solidarity.

464
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,989
And the peace that brings.

465
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,325
All of that

466
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,497
gave her pleasure unlike any
she had ever known in her ordinary life.

467
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:04,170
She would've felt immense pleasure
when she joined the demonstration.

468
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,715
It's a pleasure…

469
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,016
she never felt in her marriage with you.

470
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,418
You goddamn bastard.

471
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:49,256
Don't you feel any guilt
over what has become of the world?

472
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,983
I've been through demonstrations
over and over again,

473
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,862
and you're using
human violence against me.

474
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:13,781
How touching.

475
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:19,578
So did you decide
to seek revenge for your wife

476
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,248
by handing me over to Sodo?

477
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,334
It's not about revenge.

478
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,670
We are…

479
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:34,301
We are trying to create a world
without more victims like my wife!

480
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,191
Is that what Sodo told you?

481
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,277
What?

482
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,904
Is that how they convinced you
to join them?

483
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,121
Listen carefully.

484
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:09,253
I know you miss the past,
but you can't go back now.

485
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,672
The world has changed.

486
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:15,384
The new world needs a new kind of justice.

487
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,761
Those fools lack the desire
and ability to do it.

488
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,431
Cut the crap, you bastard.

489
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:24,727
You think you know the world
from a quick glance on the Internet?

490
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,354
What has Sodo done
with the baby who survived?

491
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,148
It's already been four years.

492
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,068
If they wanted a change,
they wouldn't just sit back and watch.

493
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:34,945
They said…

494
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,532
they were studying the baby.

495
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,201
To find out the truth.

496
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:42,828
The truth?

497
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,248
The truth?

498
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,295
I'm the one
who saw the truth with my own eyes.

499
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,590
But what if the truth

500
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,509
isn't the one they wanted?

501
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,679
Would they really accept it?

502
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:06,393
They are merely drunk on the belief
that they're defending justice.

503
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,481
What will they do once you hand me over?

504
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:13,859
Investigate you.

505
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:15,569
They'll kill me.

506
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:21,575
Because the truth I know
is useless to them,

507
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:26,038
and my existence
is the biggest threat to them.

508
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,333
Cut the bullshit!

509
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:34,213
I bet that baby is already dead too.

510
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,130
No.

511
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:37,383
The baby…

512
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,886
is under Sodo's protection.

513
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,224
Have you

514
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,769
actually seen for yourself
how the baby is doing?

515
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,479
Or heard anything?

516
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:53,691
They'd probably only say
that they have the child.

517
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,402
Sodo likely approached

518
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:00,572
the families of the Arrowhead members
who had joined the demonstration

519
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,117
to convince them
to side with them for justice.

520
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:07,121
You

521
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:11,625
have been used by Sodo,

522
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,421
just like your wife was used
by the Arrowhead.

523
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,925
No.

524
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:24,388
You said you wanted to create a world
without more victims like your wife.

525
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,559
The only person who can do that…

526
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,562
is me.

527
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,440
And you know that.

528
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,663
Perhaps…

529
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,042
this is the last chance

530
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,712
to fix this world.

531
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,457
When will they arrive?

532
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,209
Any minute now.

533
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:43,008
Hey.

534
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,122
It really is Jung Jinsu.

535
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,045
-Move him to our car.
-Okay.

536
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:21,672
Come on out.

537
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,257
Yes, we've got him.

538
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,052
Yes. All right, got it.

539
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,764
Yes, it's definitely him.

540
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,856
Yes, understood. Okay.

541
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:44,653
Good job.

542
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:45,654
Sure.

543
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,699
What are you planning to do now?

544
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:50,951
With Jung Jinsu.

545
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:55,330
We'll probably take him
to a safe place to study him.

546
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:56,915
"Study him"?

547
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,208
-Yes.
-Right.

548
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,669
How long will you study him for?

549
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,838
I'm not sure.

550
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,841
Until we find out the truth?

551
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,010
I'm not too sure.

552
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:11,179
And what if the truth was something
that worked against Sodo?

553
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,057
I don't think that's for me to answer.

554
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,895
You should go home for now.
We'll be in touch.

555
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,771
Thank you.

556
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:20,689
-Let's go.
-Okay.

557
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,317
Will you kill him?

558
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:29,907
I'm sorry?

559
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,326
Jung Jinsu.

560
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,536
Will you kill him?

561
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:37,998
Kill him?

562
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:39,541
That's absurd.

563
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,044
Anyway, thank you.

564
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,306
You said you wanted to create a world
without more victims like your wife.

565
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,225
Perhaps

566
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:22,686
this is the last chance

567
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,522
to fix this world.

568
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,169
Don't they let people sleep in Hell?

569
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:52,799
You're back after eight years,
and you're sleeping? Really?

570
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:35,235
Jung Jinsu.
This is that last chance you talked about.

571
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,445
What do we do now?

572
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,490
Your wife was well-known in the Arrowhead.

573
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:42,659
And?

574
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,370
Take me to the Arrowhead's leader.

575
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:47,706
Why the Arrowhead?

576
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,294
The only group
that can change the world now

577
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,504
is the Arrowhead.

578
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,800
And get rid of your phone.

579
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,344
Sodo will be tracking it.

580
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:40,712
