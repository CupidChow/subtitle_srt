Episode 18

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Zi Yu!

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Zi Yu, you're sleeping so early.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Don't come over! I'm not wearing any clothes.

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Zi Yu, I left you on the street today.

8
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You're angry.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Don't turn around!

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What's that?

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What's that sound?

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not wearing clothes.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm wearing clothes.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Zi Yu, I left with Lord Ma today.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You're really not angry?

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Prince, do you have anything else?

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Zi Yu, I'm very happy today.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm happy too.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Prince, do you have anything else?

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Actually, I don't have anything else.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I just want to see you before I go to bed.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I want to say good night to you.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Then, good night, Prince.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Good night.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If there's nothing else, I'll leave first.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If there's nothing else, I'll leave first.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Good night.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Good night.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Zi Yu, come with me to the Prime Minister's mansion tomorrow.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Go to bed early.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I know.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm leaving.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Go!

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Master, this is the porcelain from Jingde Town that I gave you.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm very grateful.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's been years since I last saw you.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You've already come out so handsome.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Master, you're flattering me.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Ran'er is not young anymore.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We've arranged a marriage for her and the Su family.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We'll have to trouble the Prime Minister to get her married in my mansion.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I can see that the Crown Prince is getting married.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm very honored.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The Prime Minister is serious.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Father, I won't marry Miss Su.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You bastard!

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Do you have to talk to the Prime Minister about this?

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
When will you decide on your marriage?

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Prince, please calm down.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Marriage is a big thing.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I can't be careless.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let's have a feast first.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
After that, I'll talk to the Prime Minister.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
After that, I'll talk to Mo Ran.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's have a feast.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Please.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Please.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Your Highness, please have a seat.

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Please.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Guards, protect His Highness.

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Father, mother, master, are you hurt?

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm fine.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The thief is too arrogant.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He attacked the Prime Minister's mansion in public.

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Ran'er, you must investigate this matter thoroughly.

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You must catch the thief.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yes.

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The target of this thief is Mo Ran.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We must find out the truth.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes.

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We must find out the truth.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes.

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The thief is Mo Ran.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Master, do you see any lost items in the mansion?

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
No.

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That's strange.

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The thief seems to be looking for something.

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Maybe it's because the thief saw us too many people.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He couldn't steal the thief and ran away.

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Minister Ma, inform the city gate guards.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Everyone who goes out of the city must be checked.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You lead people to search for the thief.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes, minister.

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Fang Hui, you didn't get hurt, did you?

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Ran'er, the most important thing now is to find out the thief.

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He is a guard.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What does it have to do with the injury?

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This guard looks familiar.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Who?

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Minister, I was in the countryside.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I came to the capital a few months ago.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Ziyu, what father said today is not for you.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Don't take it to heart.

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm fine.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
How can I put this little thing to heart?

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Fang Hui.

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Long time no see.

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Look, what I brought you.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Fang Hui, don't misunderstand my marriage with Li Moran.

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I prepared some light food for you this time.

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You taste it.

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This porridge is so sweet.

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Of course.

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I know you like sweet food.

108
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I specially used rice bran and fresh lotus seeds.

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The little friends have been cooking for two hours.

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You eat slowly, don't get cold.

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So sweet.

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Are you done?

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What's wrong?

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You and I are going to get married.

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I like Fang Hui.

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm a guard.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm a guard.

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm a guard.

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm a guard.

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm a guard.

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm a guard.

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm a guard.

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm a guard.

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm going to get married to guard Fang.

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's why I'm close to him.

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You can't get married to guard Fang.

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Ziyu, tell him clearly.

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He's going to marry you.

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Miss Su.

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Actually I'm a girl.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm a girl.

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
How about I come back later?

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Come back.

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What did you hear?

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You want to get married.

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You like Fang Ziyu.

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Fang Ziyu, you come here quickly.

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Focus.

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
She's a girl.

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Close the door.

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What are you doing here?

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Your highness.

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
We compared the corpse of the prince and the corpse of the prime minister.

144
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
According to the investigation,

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
the weapons used by these thieves may be made of black iron.

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Black iron?

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This is a very rare thing.

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This kind of weapon doesn't even exist in the prince's mansion.

149
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So we suspect that the one who broke into the prince's mansion is the ghost.

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The real one.

151
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Fang Hui is a girl.

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Such a big thing.

153
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You still have the heart to investigate.

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I was going to go to the lantern with Fang Hui tonight.

155
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes.

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
How can you be a girl?

157
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Miss Su.

158
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I had no choice.

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So I had to hide my identity.

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let me go.

161
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Why are you standing on the edge?

162
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't want to.

163
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We are all girls.

164
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What's wrong with me?

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Anyway,

166
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I can't marry Fang Hui anyway.

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I can't watch the lantern with Fang Hui.

168
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Lantern?

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Ziyu.

170
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
How about we go to the lantern together tonight?

171
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I want to go too.

172
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I want to go too.

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You are going to go so fast.

174
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I...I want to go too.

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Then let's go together.

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Who did this?

177
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Do you have any idea?

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I think this has something to do with Fang Qianwei.

179
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Except you and me,

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
only Fang Qianwei knows about the lantern.

181
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I saw the thief today.

182
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Her eyes are so similar to that year's Fang Qianwei.

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And the guards around Li Moran.

184
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I think Fang Qianwei is similar to her.

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
When Fang Qianwei's daughter fell off the cliff,

186
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and we found them,

187
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
she was basically eaten by the wolf.

188
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
We found the token of the Dali Temple

189
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and confirmed her identity.

190
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What if she didn't die?

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I came here mainly to find the dust.

192
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
When you take control of Li family,

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
you can do great things.

194
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There must be something wrong.

195
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If you think it's suspicious,

196
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
why don't we start from the little guard around Li Moran?

197
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Then we can get to the bottom of it and release the news of the Dali clan.

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Is it beautiful?

199
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Guard Fang is really a woman.

200
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The light of the lantern is brighter than the light of the man.

201
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Ziyuan, you look so beautiful today.

202
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Miss Su is also beautiful.

203
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Well, I suddenly want to buy a lantern.

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'll go over there to open it.

205
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'll go over there to open it.

206
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'll buy a lantern.

207
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'll go over there to open it.

208
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Mr. Ma, let's go together.

209
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Your Highness.

210
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm afraid people will help us scatter.

211
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You can hold my sleeve.

212
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Isn't that a bad thing?

213
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Miss Su, don't be so stupid.

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What can you tell me?

215
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I... I'm not stupid.

216
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Miss Su, this is the little rabbit lantern I made for you.

217
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
This is the little rabbit lantern I made for you.

225
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
This...

226
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Isn't this what you bought?

227
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm fine.

228
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm just thinking about how Sister Fang is getting along with the crown prince.

229
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Miss Fang.

230
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Sister Fang.

231
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Miss Su, do you remember when we were young?

232
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You had to let the crown prince teach you how to ride a horse.

233
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You fell off the horse and you didn't cry.

234
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I... I'm not crying now.

235
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm not crying now.

236
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And when you were young, you sat there wearing a purple dress and playing the drums.

237
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The crown prince was laughing at you.

238
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I think you played it very well.

239
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The most bad thing I played was the drums.

240
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And...

241
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Your little red cake that you loved when you were young.

242
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I've prepared it for you.

243
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Why can't I do anything well?

244
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll stay with you quietly.

245
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Chen.

246
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Are you enjoying the taste?

247
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What a silly horse.

248
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The End

249
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Food, handkerchief.

250
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
This handkerchief is made of red beans.

251
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
This thing is made of red beans.

252
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's made of red beans, love and friendship.

253
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
If you put it on your body, it can keep you and your husband together.

254
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's a perfect match.

255
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I want them all.

256
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Thank you, sir.

257
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Give me your handkerchief.

258
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Help me put it on.

259
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'll put it on.

260
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
We'll come here to light up the lanterns every year.

261
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Ziyu.

262
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Your identity as a woman is in the guard.

263
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You can't hide it.

264
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So tomorrow,

265
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I want to tell my father and mother about your identity.

266
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I...

267
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I want to marry you to be the concubine.

268
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You're so nice to me.

269
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Aren't you afraid that I'll be sorry to you in the future?

270
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's my business to like you.

271
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
How can you treat me as your business?

272
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But I believe

273
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
you will never hurt me.

274
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He treated me like this.

275
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Should I tell him the truth?

276
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Actually, I...

277
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Ziyu, wait for me to come back.

278
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Boss, I want this.

279
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Okay.

280
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Wait a minute. I'll wrap it up for you.

281
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I can't believe that

282
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
the man was in the lanterns.

283
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
He really can't beat me.

284
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Where is he?

285
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
He was just here.

286
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Ziyu.

287
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Ziyu.
