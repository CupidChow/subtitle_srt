Episode 16

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Ziyu.

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Father.

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Doctor Zhao.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Doctor Zhao.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Father.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Father, why are you here?

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm worried.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Father.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, uncle.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You are Ziyu's father?

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Otherwise?

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But guard Fang's surname is Fang Ning, Zhao.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's a name.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's to prevent you from

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
being a sick patient.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But you two don't look like each other.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm going to pray.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Father.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is the crown prince of the King's mansion.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The crown prince of the King's mansion.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Father.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Uncle.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Well.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Ziyu saved my life.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So I keep him as my guard.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Then why don't you

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
find a woman as your personal guard?

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't like other women.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You see, you have a picture.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
No.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Ziyu is not...

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Uncle.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You...

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You believe me.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I won't let Ziyu be hurt.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Your Highness.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I have something to say to my father alone.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Then I'll come back later.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't look.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
She's gone.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Father.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Why are you here?

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We've made a plan.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We'll steal another account tonight.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm here to tell you about the plan.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I also heard that

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
President Yuan will send a letter to Dali Temple from the capital.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I see.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Well.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I think the crown prince

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
is a little bit innocent.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He's not a good person.

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Father.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He's just a warm-hearted man.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You have someone I know.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You have to remember.

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Men are not good.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Except your father.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Father.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I know.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We can't stay here for long.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You should go.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll think of a way to contact Brother Long later.

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay.

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm leaving.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
How did Uncle Fang leave?

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Do you want me to send someone?

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
No.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
My father said he hasn't been to the market for a long time.

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He wants to go around.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Did I do a terrible job just now?

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Next time I'll visit you in person

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and perform well.

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You think too much.

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Siyu.

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I have something that I can't decide.

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Can you help me?

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Let's go.

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll go.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Mr. Li.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You're here.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
How is it?

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Do you like it?

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Is this a gift for Prime Minister Wang?

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is so strange.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This is for you.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
For me?

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This...

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is for you.

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is for me?

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This...

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is for me.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This is for me.

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You can even forget your own birthday.

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Fortunately, I've seen your ID card.

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I've remembered it all.

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I don't even remember what it says.

103
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I thought you liked girls.

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Now I think

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
you're thinking about Yanxin.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I heard you say

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
about your past.

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You did everything for your father

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and your family.

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Today is your birthday.

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I just want you to be a normal girl.

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
When you come back,

113
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
you'll be my bodyguard.

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But...

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't worry.

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I can do anything.

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Try it if you like it.

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's go upstairs.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Every time I look back

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Every time I think back

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I always have your figure by my side

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The edge of fate

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The time I miscalculated

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Is the direction the stars move

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You smile and turn back to the past

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's a dream that appears in my dream

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You know I can't forget

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I just want to go far with you

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I tried to write a few lines

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
to find your address

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But I realized it was you

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The heart is like a flower

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The moon is like a silkworm

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The man is like a flower

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The moon is like a silkworm

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The moon is like a silkworm

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm waiting for you in the deep blue sky

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
In the middle of the night, in the middle of the night

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I just want to hide a name

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I just want to enjoy the sweetness with you

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I just want to stay by your side

142
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Guarding the life

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm waiting for you in the deep blue sky

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Every time I look back

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Every time I think back

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I always have your figure by my side

147
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The edge of fate

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The time I miscalculated

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Thank you, Miss Fang

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
for teaching me how to write the words

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm so happy

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm so happy

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm so happy

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm so happy

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm so happy

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm so happy

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Thank you, Miss Fang

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
for saving me from the water that day

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You're only grateful now?

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Miss Fang saved my life many times

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We met by chance

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We are so grateful

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm willing to do it for you

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
There are no good or bad things here

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
There are no crown prince and guards

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Only a common girl

167
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You are willing to accompany me

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
In the revenue Save you

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:47,620
I'm of the Java

170
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,440
I'm waiting for you

171
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,480
I'm waiting for you in the blue sky

172
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,920
You two

173
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,800
This color suits you

174
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,560
Yes, young master

175
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,320
Buy two dresses for the new one

176
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,920
The girl will look great in it

177
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,040
Boss, you misunderstood

178
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,680
We are not

179
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
Buy this dress

180
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,960
I'll make you some clothes when you go back

181
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,680
Buy this dress

182
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,480
Sir

183
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,760
Sir

184
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,760
What's up?

185
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,760
Where is guard Fang?

186
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,840
I'm here

187
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,800
Here

188
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,160
You look very happy

189
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,080
Sir, there is an accident in Dali

190
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,080
Fang Hongui

191
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,480
It's time to pay a foreign cost

192
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,640
Will each of you pay?

193
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,960
I'm a little bit unsanitary

194
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,080
Shall we go to see

195
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,280
Master Ma and Prince's daughter now?

196
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,360
You are not health wise

197
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,760
How about finding a physician for you?

198
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,280
Sir

199
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,160
Helping guard Fang is fine

200
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,240
I'll deal with some important minister

201
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,720
Go.

202
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,320
Go.

203
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,200
I'm late.

204
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,280
Sir, what are you doing?

205
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,720
Get up.

206
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,520
Did you find it?

207
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,240
No.

208
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,240
The old man hid it deep enough.

209
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,160
What should we do now?

210
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,680
Wait for me to arrange it tomorrow.

211
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,160
Okay.

212
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,920
Dad.

213
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,000
Don't wear a mask anymore.

214
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,880
It's not suitable.

215
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,360
I thought you liked it.

216
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,320
Let's go.

217
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,640
Ziyu.
