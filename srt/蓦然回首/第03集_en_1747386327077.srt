1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,760
I want to go far away with you

2
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,640
I only hide you in my heart

3
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,960
I just want to enjoy the sweetness with you

4
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,760
I just want to stay by your side and guard the melody

5
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,240
I'm waiting for you in the blue sky

6
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:01,600
I'm waiting for you in the blue sky

7
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,320
What's going on?

8
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,800
Why hasn't Wu Ji come out yet?

9
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,600
Yeah

10
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,480
Here he comes

11
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,320
He's a demon

12
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,120
Come on

13
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,080
Come on

14
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,880

Come on

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,760
Look at this

17
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,960
Come on

18
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,760
Come on

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,240
Come on

23
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,200
Come on

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,120
Come on

25
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,040
Come on

26
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,880
Come on

27
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,800
Come on

28
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800

Come on

45
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Come on

46
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Come on

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Come on

48
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360

Come on

52
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360

Come on

58
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Come on

59
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
Come on

60
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
Come on

63
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
Come on

64
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
Come on

65
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
Come on

66
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
Come on

67
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Come on

68
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
Come on

69
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,360
Come on

70
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
Come on

71
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
Come on

72
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
Come on

73
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,360
Come on

74
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Come on

75
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,360
Come on

76
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
Come on

77
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Come on

78
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,680
Brother

79
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,480
You were so caring

80
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,520
religantically this time

81
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
So good

82
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,640
Congratulations.

83
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,760
Good.

84
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,080
Man Zhao.

85
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,040
Come here to try the wine.

86
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,440
Please forgive me, Lord An.

87
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,880
This is my personal coffin.

88
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,280
I'll come to you for the wine

89
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,240
after I change my martial arts.

90
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,760
If you like the dance,

91
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,520
please come to the Linglong Pavilion tomorrow.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,160
Master Tu,

93
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,160
you're really good at business.

94
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,160
I'll be waiting for you anytime.

95
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,520
All right.

96
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,120
Go back as soon as possible.

97
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,120
Father, mother.

98
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,400
I have something to do.

99
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
I'll leave for now.

100
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,240
This...

101
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,240
Don't follow her.

102
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,120
And your advantageous side,...

103
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,080
There's no question that your father might run away.

104
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:38,480
Those tricks of your father who不敢

105
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,600
could save you two.

106
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Miss, please give me a cloth.

107
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Forgive me for being impolite.

108
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Just now, you were dancing and dancing on the banquet.

109
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
May I ask your name?

110
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
I'm Ya Zhu.

111
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
What's the matter with you?

112
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
You look familiar.

113
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
Have we met before?

114
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Do you always talk to me like this?

115
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Who is it?

116
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
I'll kill you.

117
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Miss Ya Zhu, run away.

118
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
This has nothing to do with you.

119
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Don't be involved.

120
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
You're still playing the hero at this time.

121
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Hahaha.

122
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Where are you going?

123
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:49,600
How do I know you're ANDY?

124
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
I don't know if Li Moran can stop here.

125
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,000
I can't find him.

126
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,600
Be careful, Your Highness.

127
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,680
Be careful.

128
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:15,720
I'm willing to stay in your dream

129
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,920
and follow you through the life and death.

130
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,120
Lin Meng Ran.

131
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,800
Lin Meng Ran, wake up.

132
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,640
Lin Meng Ran, wake up.

133
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,800
Your Highness.

134
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,520
Your Highness.

135
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,920
Your Highness.

136
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,520
Where are you?

137
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,040
Since you're not playing the j channels,

138
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:47,180
I will bust a door with all my strength and I'll save the important matter in my heart.

139
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,680
If you weren't so applauseable,

140
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,520
then I would not have let 딱on talk like this.

141
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,200
But when I was in также like this,

142
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,360
I also did not save the most important thing,

143
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,460
and went to bastards without responsibility for it.

144
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:03,520
So we also had to

145
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,400
That I killed the pretend spy in say he's the superhero of did this to me.

146
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,480
Childish,

147
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,780
You guys don't involve them in this matter

148
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,140
just for safety

149
00:09:43,280 --> 00:10:06,760
and essential

150
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,880
I'm in the hands of Prime Minister Wang.

151
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,640
Everything is fine.

152
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,920
Don't panic.

153
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,720
But

154
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,240
you shouldn't have sent someone to assassinate Li Moran today.

155
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,080
Li Moran has something to say.

156
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,520
I'm afraid he suspects me.

157
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,320
The fire ghost has appeared recently.

158
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,160
No one knows who it is.

159
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,960
This can be a disadvantage

160
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,160
and disrupt their direction.

161
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,560
Lord,

162
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,200
I've told you many times.

163
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,200
You're just a person who's not happy.

164
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,520
You'll be in trouble sooner or later.

165
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,320
If you stay with me...

166
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,680
Ma Yichuan,

167
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
how would I know that the Crown Prince

168
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,040
would have an accident in his uncle's mansion?

169
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,360
Please don't scold him.

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,080
I came here with my own ability.

171
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
I don't have a background.

172
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,800
Young Master Wuji, where are you going?

173
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,520
I'm going to the side hall to see Wuji.

174
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,880
You're going to see Wuji?

175
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,560
If I knew that the Crown Prince would have an accident,

176
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,040
I would never leave him.

177
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,120
All right.

178
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,600
I didn't expect the bodyguard to protect me.

179
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,600
There's no big problem now.

180
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,960
You can't disturb the guests.

181
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,960
And,

182
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,640
don't let my father know.

183
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,000
Yes.

184
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,800
Lord,

185
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,480
when the people of Prince An's mansion found you,

186
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,240
you were rescued from the lake.

187
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,840
Do you have any impression?

188
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,840
I didn't see his face clearly.

189
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,720
I don't know why he saved me.

190
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,280
He didn't want to attack me.

191
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,920
I've checked the fatal wounds of those dead assassins.

192
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,720
The same person did it with the group of assassins in the forest.

193
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,280
Fang Hui saw the swordsman who saved me.

194
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,800
He also saw Wuji.

195
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,480
Yes, you also saw Wuji.

196
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,040
The Crown Prince just fell into the water.

197
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,920
Have some ginger soup.

198
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,720
It's cold.

199
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,200
Do you have any impression of his appearance?

200
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,400
Drink it, Crown Prince.

201
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,800
I'm fine.

202
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
Could it be him?

203
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,960
I don't remember.

204
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,800
People all have eyes and noses.

205
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,720
It doesn't look likely.

206
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,640
If you want to know about Wuji,

207
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,040
go to ask the leader of Linglong Pavilion for help.

208
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,480
Lord,

209
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,400
I'm going to investigate the origin of those black artists.

210
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,160
Bell willingly gave me

211
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,800
the much-loved work of personification.

212
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,720
Black artists can only beawl after beingjudged.

213
00:12:50,720 --> 00:13:03,500
In my quick track so as to

214
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,040
to navigate the 집 and Dunhuang Tunnel,

215
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,040
I remember when I fell into the water,

216
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,040
I seemed to have been suffocated.

217
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
Your Highness,

218
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
you didn't get burned, did you?

219
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
Let me see.

220
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,040
Your Highness,

221
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,040
Prince An has prepared clean clothes for you.

222
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
Go get the clothes.

223
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
Change my clothes.

224
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Yes.

225
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Master,

226
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Yajuzuo has disappeared and never returned.

227
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,040
And Prince Ning's son is visiting.

228
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
Li Mo Ran.

229
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
Greetings, Your Highness.

230
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,040
What brings you here?

231
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
Don't bother.

232
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,040
Last night, Miss Yajuzuo was very impressive in the palace.

233
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
There were many guests in the palace that day.

234
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040
I was not able to escape.

235
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
So I came to visit you today.

236
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
Sir, have some tea.

237
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,040
Miss Yajuzuo disappeared yesterday at noon.

238
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
Master Tu,

239
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,040
it's too much of a coincidence.

240
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
Yesterday, I was killed in the palace.

241
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
It was this Miss Yajuzuo who saved me.

242
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Sir,

243
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,040
I went to the backstage to check last night.

244
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,040
Miss Yajuzuo was present at noon.

245
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,040
But I haven't seen Miss Yajuzuo since then.

246
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,040
Bring me the painting of Yajuzuo and all the dancers.

247
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
I'm sorry.

248
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
I'm sorry.

249
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
