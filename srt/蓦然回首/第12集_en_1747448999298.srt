Episode 18

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Where did you lose it?

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
How did you lose it?

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Who is it that wants to take Sister Fang away?

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Could it be the evil disciple of the witch?

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I've searched everywhere around

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
but I couldn't find Fang Hu...

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Miss Fang is here.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Sir, the informant reported that

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the escort team has taken her into the escort team.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Go to the main hall and find her.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hurry up.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Go.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll go too.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're awake.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's you.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's me.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm very curious about one thing.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Why did you help the King?

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Who are you?

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Why did you pretend to be a living ghost?

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What do you want?

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's my turn to ask you.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You're a guard and a living ghost.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You even went to the mansion to steal things.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What do you want?

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
How do you know?

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm afraid.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I know more than that.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Ziyue.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Ziyue.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
A good prince

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
is actually with a living ghost.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Are you okay?

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm fine.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Who tied you up?

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Long San.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Long San?

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He just said you were a living ghost.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I pretended to be a living ghost.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
He took it seriously.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Your Highness.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If I really were a living ghost,

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I would protect you.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Although the living ghost is righteous,

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
it stole the mansion and the Prime Minister's mansion.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's hard to change the situation.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You can scare people out of it.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But don't get too involved with it.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Do you understand?

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Protect the Crown Prince!

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Protect the Crown Prince!

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Your Highness.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Your Highness, are you okay?

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This watch has been sealed.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Fortunately, I sent someone to observe.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Fortunately, Li Moran arrived in time.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Mr. Ma.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You haven't been promoted for so many years.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
There's a reason.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's all my fault.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The person who kidnapped Ziyu this time

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
was all aimed at me.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's my fault.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Enough.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Sister Fang was scared.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Take her back.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Let's go.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Miss Su.

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll send you back.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Let's go.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Go back to Dali Temple.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Your Highness.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How can we report to Prince An?

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
No need.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't go.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm dizzy.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I want to be quiet.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Dad.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Mom.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Tian.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
My daughter.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I heard that there were bandits

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
who kidnapped the girl from Miaoling.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Fortunately, Mr. Ma sent a message

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
saying you were fine.

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Otherwise,

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
your mother would be so worried about you.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I was thinking that you and the Crown Prince were getting married.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I asked you to go out and relax.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Why did you...

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Well.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Well.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But I have to say.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Once you get married,

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
it will delay our Tian Tian's life.

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The relationship between the Crown Prince and Wu Ji

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
is so unclear, right?

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Dad.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Well.

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Look.

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
His throat is so numb.

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He's having a fever again.

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What's wrong with him?

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Actually,

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Mr. Ma is also a talented man.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Mr. Ma.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
A talented man is not a good man.

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let alone a handsome man.

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
A man like him

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
is as big as a bull in the market.

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The most important thing is that on this official field,

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
he is a shameless dead rat.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Dead rat.

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Dead rat.

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Dead...

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Dead brain.

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Dead brain.

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You know what?

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He was a high-ranking official three years ago.

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Now he is still a high-ranking official.

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If our Tian Tian is with him,

127
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
it will be ruined.

128
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I've investigated the case of Siyan.

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Actually, I can save it.

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Mr. Ma.

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Mr. Ma.

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Mr. Ma.

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You are still young.

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's not normal to start from three years old.

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You are just a platform

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
that has a thousand miles of travel

137
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and a long journey.

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Right?

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You still have a chance.

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You are young and capable.

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You have unlimited ability.

142
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Right?

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Miss Su has been sent off safely.

144
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm leaving now.

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay.

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm leaving.

147
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Dad.

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll send Mr. Ma to the door.

149
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay.

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Right in front of the door.

151
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Don't take my dad's words to heart.

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He didn't mean anything.

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He just didn't want me to be sad.

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I understand.

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Actually, you can wait a little longer.

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I can get promoted this time.

157
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What does Mr. Ma have to do with me?

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't have a family with a high status.

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm just an ordinary official.

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I've been in Dalin for so many years.

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Although I'm just a low-class official,

162
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I can definitely get promoted.

163
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I will work hard.

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I really work hard.

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Really.

166
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Mr. Ma is really a close friend.

167
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
How about I give you a ride?

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I have to send you back.

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You are so silly and cute.

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Thank you.

171
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Let's go.

172
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm not going to go.

173
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm going to go.

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm going to go.

175
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Thank you.

176
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's go.

177
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You're welcome.

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The two accounts have been received.

179
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Wait for my news.

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
We will use the foreign currency to steal the files of the past.

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Then we can get promoted.

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll handle it in Dalin.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Be careful.

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Be careful.

185
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
This...

186
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This...

187
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This is how the files were returned by Su's father?

188
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Your Highness,

189
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Su's father heard about Ran's matter.

190
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So he wants to cancel the marriage.

191
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What a bad luck!

192
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The family doesn't believe it.

193
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The family doesn't believe it.

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's true.

195
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The emperor is willing to delay his daughter's life.

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yes.

197
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Think about it.

198
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Think about it.

199
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If it doesn't work,

200
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
we can only marry a common woman.

201
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't believe it.

202
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Which common woman

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
doesn't want to marry into our family?

204
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Father, mother, you are all here.

205
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You still have the face to see us.

206
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Father,

207
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I haven't come to greet you for a long time.

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm angry.

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Where?

210
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's all your good deeds.

211
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You've ruined the face of our family.

212
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Su's family is canceling the marriage with us.

213
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
They cancel the marriage?

214
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That's good.

215
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I was thinking how to discuss it with you.

216
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You...

217
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Your Highness.

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Your Highness.

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You little bastard.

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Say it again if you have the guts.

221
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Shi Tian is not my favorite person.

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
My wedding is to marry someone I like.

223
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Today, I want to report to my parents.

224
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I want to marry Fang Hu Wei.

225
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Who?

226
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Who are you going to marry?

227
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Fang Hu Wei in our family.

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Father, why did you hit me?

229
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Why?

230
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You have such a shameless time.

231
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You still have the face to say it out.

232
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Father, let me explain to you.

233
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm so ashamed that you've lost me.

234
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Father, you misunderstood.

235
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Fang Hu Wei is a woman.

236
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
A woman?

237
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You should have said it earlier.

238
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
She was forced by the family's livelihood.

239
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So she dressed up as a man.

240
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Father was ill.

241
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So she went to the Dali Temple to look for a good livelihood.

242
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
She saved my life before.

243
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That's why I kept her by my side.

244
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
However,

245
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
it's not that simple.

246
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Think about it.

247
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
She can hide her identity as a woman

248
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and go to the Dali Temple to work.

249
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Then she came to our house

250
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
to be your bodyguard.

251
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm afraid this woman...

252
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Your Highness.

253
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
However,

254
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I misunderstood your father and I before.

255
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Although you have a relationship with this woman,

256
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
you still want me to look at your father first.

257
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yes.

258
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Father.

259
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Mother.

260
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I really want to marry Miss Fang.

261
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Let's see first.

262
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Greetings, Your Highness, Princess.

263
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Arise.

264
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Dressed as a man,

265
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I thought you were a man.

266
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I didn't expect

267
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
you're a beautiful girl.

268
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Princess.

269
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I...

270
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Ran told us about you.

271
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Since you're a woman,

272
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
you can't dress up as a man

273
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and stay with the crown prince.

274
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You can't be the bodyguard and the Dali Temple's postman.

275
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Or you'll be a nuisance in the future.

276
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Your Highness.

277
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I just want to do some tasks to make up for my family.

278
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
If so,

279
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
let me leave the mansion.

280
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Your Highness.

281
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Even if you're a woman,

282
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
you can stay with me.

283
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We'll get married soon.

284
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Then it won't be...

285
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Enough.

286
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Ran.

287
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
In my opinion,

288
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Miss Fang and you don't seem to have the kind of love-hate relationship

289
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
you mentioned.

290
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You mean the marriage.

291
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
We'll talk about it later.

292
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Miss Fang.

293
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
As a woman of the Liang family,

294
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
you must be with the crown prince

295
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and be careful about your words and identity.

296
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yes, Your Highness.

297
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Ran.

298
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You love Miss Fang.

299
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But you can't force her to do as you want.

300
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You can talk about Miss Fang later.

301
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Mind the etiquette.

302
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Men and women have their own ways.

303
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'll listen to your instructions.

304
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I made the decision this time.

305
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'll do it.

306
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You...

307
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Your Highness.

308
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You told the princess and the princess about my identity.

309
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

310
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I told you before

311
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
that I wanted to marry a princess.

312
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You didn't refuse.

313
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So I...

314
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm grateful for your kindness.

315
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But marriage is not as simple as you think.

316
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Don't you notice the princess' attitude?

317
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But we can't always do this.

318
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Did you ask for my family's permission?

319
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Did you respect me?

320
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Did you consider a woman like me

321
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
who has no family background

322
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and is married into the royal family,

323
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
how can she be carefree

324
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and like you will disappear at any time?

325
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Ziyu, I...

326
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I...

327
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I admit

328
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
that I thought it over.

329
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But I won't let you down.

330
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I believe

331
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
that after my parents know your character,

332
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
they will treat you sincerely.

333
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Miss Fang has a strange background.

334
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I feel

335
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
as if I've seen her somewhere.

336
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Besides,

337
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
she doesn't seem to be interested in Ran'er.

338
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I think

339
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Ran'er is the one who is similar.

340
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Your Highness,

341
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
should we

342
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
find someone to investigate her background and background?

343
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I don't think she is from a low position.

344
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm just afraid that someone

345
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
has a bad intention and wants to do something else.

346
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
We messed up the plan before.

347
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Now that we know,

348
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Ran'er got into trouble because she liked this woman.

349
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
We don't care about the rumors.

350
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But we need to find someone

351
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
to explain to the Su family

352
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
in case of our family's harmony.

353
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

354
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'll arrange it.

355
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Although our family is rich,

356
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
we are not a family of greedy rich people.

357
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You have to solve the difficulties between us

358
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
and get married.

359
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'll ask people to settle Uncle Fang

360
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and ask the imperial doctor to treat him.

361
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Then I'll ask him to agree to our marriage.

362
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Your Highness,

363
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
don't force me, okay?

364
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Siyu,

365
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I just want us to be together as soon as possible.

366
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Don't be angry, okay?

367
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's all because of you.

368
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I can't go out as a man anymore.

369
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You'd better go back to Dali Temple.

370
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Don't delay the matter.

371
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You'll blame me for it.

372
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Wait for me to come back.

373
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
We'll talk about the wedding.

374
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'll go first.

375
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Mo Ran,

376
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I didn't mean to hurt you.

377
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I just don't want you to be implicated.

378
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Your Highness,

379
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
the secret message we just received

380
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
will be stolen from the scrolls tonight.

381
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But the scrolls in the capital

382
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
haven't been delivered yet.

383
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Where did they get the information?

384
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
This news is suspicious.

385
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Your Highness,

386
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
should we take action?

387
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I don't know.

388
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I don't know.

389
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Don't move.

390
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What's their purpose?

391
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Only the real fire ghost can know its purpose.

392
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
We'll ambush in Dali Temple tonight.

393
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
We can't alert them.

394
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Go and make arrangements.

395
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yes.

396
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Your Highness,

397
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
the fire ghost is here.

398
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's the one who killed the fire ghost.

399
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's the one who killed the fire ghost.

400
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's the one who killed the fire ghost.

401
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's the one who killed the fire ghost.

402
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's the one who killed the fire ghost.

403
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's the one who killed the fire ghost.

404
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's the one who killed the fire ghost.

405
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's the one who killed the fire ghost.

406
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's the one who killed the fire ghost.

407
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's the one who killed the fire ghost.

408
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's the one who killed the fire ghost.

409
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's the one who killed the fire ghost.

410
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's the one who killed the fire ghost.

411
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's the one who killed the fire ghost.

412
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's the one who killed the fire ghost.

413
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's the one who killed the fire ghost.

414
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's the one who killed the fire ghost.

415
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I used the warmth of yearning to solve the problem.

416
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm showing my pain.

417
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm acting like a hero.

418
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Like a red neon.

419
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm willing to be free.

420
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I only feel the cold wind in my heart.

421
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
There is no such thing as a simple dream.

422
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I think I understand.

423
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The dream you said.

424
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
The shadow is always empty.

425
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm willing to be in the dream.

426
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I look back and follow you.

427
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The dream is in the heart.

428
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm willing to be in the dream.

429
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Let go of the old and the new.
