Episode 16

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Bring me the painting of the mute pig and all the five seasons.

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Sir.

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Go back to the mansion.

7
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Your Highness, wait for me.

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Are we still looking for the five seasons?

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We must look for it.

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But it's definitely not the mute pig on the painting.

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Sir.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Last night, there were many robberies in the city.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
According to what the people said,

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
the painting of the robbers is a living ghost.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The robbers call themselves living ghosts.

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's fake.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let the fake living ghosts come out to fight and rob.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
They just want to drive us away from the direction of our investigation.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So,

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
the fake living ghosts and the assassins who chased you are the same group of people.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Sir, do you have any clues about the five seasons?

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Since the painting is wrong,

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I can draw a portrait of the living ghosts and find the five seasons.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Do you still want to find the living ghosts?

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Living ghosts?

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Dad, this is the account book I found from the King of An.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
As long as we find the account book of Prime Minister Wang

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and the scrolls of the Four Seasons Annals of the Court of Judicial Review,

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
we can take it.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But,

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
after a few rounds of investigation,

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the scrolls may not be in Dali Temple.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Now,

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
you are working for Prince Ning.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This kind of person must be very anxious.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Maybe he is suspicious now.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is the first time I've heard someone

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
describe Li Moran with an anxious heart.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Dad, you look down on him too much.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You don't understand.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You don't understand.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Although you are working as a man,

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
you are a woman after all.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm afraid Li Moran will treat you...

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Dad, don't worry.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Li Moran is not interested in even the women of Linglong Pavilion.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He is naturally interested in me.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Then you have to be more careful.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Dad, didn't you tell me that

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
everything in this world is not fair.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If everyone is against the evil and rejects the evil,

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
how can there be a peace of mind?

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm not afraid of these dangers.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What we are talking about is not the same thing.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Ziyu,

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
you stay in Dali Temple and investigate in secret.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Prime Minister Wang must be a bird of the golden bird.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's not convenient to act at this moment.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Wait for news.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You are so stubborn.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Why don't you believe me?

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You said so much.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You just want to grab the money.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Under this light,

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
is there any law?

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
In this world,

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
no one can really have wealth.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You just temporarily keep it for others.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You can't take anything when you die.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Come out.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But I still don't want to give it to you.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's been a whole morning.

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's five o'clock.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Miss,

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
you don't need money.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You won't spend it.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why are you so secretive?

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm secretive?

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Then don't blame me.

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This fake ghost often appears.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Is it really like what Lin Moran said?

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You are so naive.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Miss, are you okay?

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Miss.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Miss.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Young Master.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Miss.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I heard that you had an accident outside the house.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Are you okay?

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Hongdie.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
When you first came here,

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
did you see a young master?

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I was kidnapped by a coward.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He saved me without any risk.

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Can you see his face clearly?

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I don't know.

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But I must find him.

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Miss.

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Miss.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Miss.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Miss, slow down.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Miss.

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Miss, don't draw.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Eat something first.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No.

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I must draw my savior.

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You go out first.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yes.

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Boss.

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,020
Mrs.

114
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,000
How's it going?

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The dead god could move the dead god's body?

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No.

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,460
We will draw in tteokbokki if we keep drawing,

118
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,000
don't worry.

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
While eating tteokbokki,

120
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,860
we are waiting for Her decentralized formula to poison with opium

121
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,900
and poison with f ì‚¬.

122
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,000
Xiao 300.

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,540
Honest,

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,060
as long as you can't eat something delicious,

125
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,000
it continues to poison with opium.

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Then how can it be hidden under nearby house?

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
How about here now?

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Fine.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That is fine.

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,720
You keep talking and don't let me disturb you.

131
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,360
This...

132
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,880
What should we do, Master?

133
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,000
How do I know?

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,920
Miss said

135
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,000
she was saved by a man in the city.

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,240
She must be found.

137
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,480
Hongdie.

138
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,400
Hongdie.

139
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,400
Shiting.

140
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,000
Take 500 pieces of her clothes.

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,520
I want to fill the city with them.

142
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,040
Go.

143
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,520
Go.

144
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,040
Shiting.

145
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,840
Master, what should we do?

146
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,720
Why do you always ask me what to do?

147
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,680
How do I know what to do?

148
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,360
This...

149
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,120
This...

150
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,360
This is a good drawing.

151
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,600
What can we do if we find this man?

152
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,800
Right.

153
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,680
No.

154
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,320
Tomorrow,

155
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,520
I'll go to your mansion

156
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,800
to discuss the marriage of Shiting and the crown prince.

157
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,800
What should we do?

158
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,720
Coins for following the papers

159
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,280
6th month of the 14th year of the house

160
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,560
You can't do this.

161
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,520
What?

162
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,360
You look liked this.

163
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,240
It might scare people.

164
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
You scared me to death.

165
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,560
What's wrong with me?

166
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,640
You came back from the summer?

167
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,400
I'm fine at home.

168
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
So I came back to take care of the crown prince.

169
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,600
Let's talk.

170
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,440
Tell me.

171
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,520
The person who saved me from the water.

172
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,240
Who is it?

173
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,520
What's wrong?

174
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,680
Are you suspecting me?

175
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,760
What are you doing?

176
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,760
You're so careless.

177
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,360
You always rub it on your face.

178
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,320
Oh.

179
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,920
Actually, before I fell into the water,

180
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,520
I had some contact with Linglong Pavilion's dancing machine.

181
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,720
It must be him who saved me.

182
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,440
Go and check it.

183
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,040
Post it to the city and tell them.

184
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,720
I must find him.

185
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,440
Recently, the fire has been raging.

186
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
It's normal to be scammed by the court.

187
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
But this...

188
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,240
The reward is so high.

189
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,240
Yes, it's so high.

190
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,720
The daughter of the Su's Mansion

191
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,720
has asked for a reward of 100 taels.

192
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,520
100 taels?

193
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,120
Really?

194
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,240
The portrait of the Prince of Ning's Mansion

195
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,440
is so low.

196
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,840
200 taels.

197
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,040
200 taels?

198
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,320
I've used it for my whole life.

199
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,440
The reward is so high.

200
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,440
Of course it's more difficult.

201
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,720
I have to find a good woman.

202
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,840
Forget it.

203
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,440
It's 300 taels.

204
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,040
I want to pay for myself.

205
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,720
I...

206
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,120
This young man looks familiar.

207
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,920
Yes, he does.

208
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,720
I don't care if he's a man or not.

209
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,520
Take him down.

210
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
Take him down.

211
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,720
Take him down.

212
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,320
Lei.

213
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,820
Take him down.

214
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,920
Take him down.

215
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,520
Lei.

216
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,720
Don't let him run away.

217
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,920
Yin Zi.

218
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,720
That old man, Yin Zi.

219
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,520
Take him down.

220
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,720
Yin Zi, take him down.

221
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,320
Run, catch him.

222
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,520
He ran away.

223
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
Take him down.

224
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
Hurry.

225
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,120
Hurry, take him down.

226
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,520
Run, catch him.

227
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,920
Hurry, take him down.

228
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,120
He ran away.

229
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,920
Hurry, take him down.

230
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,400
Go, go, go

231
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,040
Thank you

232
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,520
What's your relationship with Su's daughter?

233
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,200
Why did she come to you?

234
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,760
I don't know

235
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,200
By the way

236
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,200
A fake ghost appeared recently

237
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,560
and robbed people

238
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,640
I fought with it before

239
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,040
It seems to be a kind of

240
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,400
deliberately illegal robbery

241
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,800
It's just a trick

242
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,960
Go back to the crown prince

243
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,480
Don't go around recently

244
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,520
In case of any trouble

245
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,560
Okay

246
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:48,840
This ghost

247
00:12:49,640 --> 00:13:08,960
has been

248
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,560
very high-profile recently

249
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,080
What does it say?

250
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,200
â€“ What the hell are you talking about?

251
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Kick.

252
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Kick.

253
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Kick.

254
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Fall.

255
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
Kick.

256
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Turn.

257
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Two.

258
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Shake.

259
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
Shake.

260
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Come forward.

261
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Shoulder.

262
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Legs.

263
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Right.

264
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Lift.

265
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Come.

266
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Not so high.

267
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Kick.

268
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Fang Siyu.

269
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Can you be more serious?

270
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Your highness.

271
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Sir.

272
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Your highness.

273
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Let me.

274
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Yes.

275
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
To practice martial arts,

276
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
you need to show your manly spirit.

277
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Be gentle.

278
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Stop.

279
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Take the stick up.

280
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Lift.

281
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Then look forward.

282
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Got it?

283
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
You're so strict.

284
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
You can't do it.

285
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
I'm cold since I was a kid.

286
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,200
I can stand it.

287
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Okay.

288
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
That's all for today.

289
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Sir.

290
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Yes.

291
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Come with me.

292
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Yes.

293
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Practice hard.

294
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Bro.

295
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Is there anything new to tell in the city?

296
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Only the living ghosts are poor.

297
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,200
Miss Qianjin fell in love with the savior.

298
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
She can't love her son.

299
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Thank you, bro.

300
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
In the future,

301
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
tell me anything new.

302
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
Okay.

303
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,200
The cold wind blows.

304
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,200
The face is dim.

305
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,200
I think I know

306
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,200
the dream you told me.

307
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
The shadow is gone.

308
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
A dream.

309
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,200
The shadow is gone.

310
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
A dream.

311
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Let go of the past.

312
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Let the shooting star fall.

313
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:50,200
I'm willing to be with you in your dream.

314
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,200
I'll follow you to travel around the world.

315
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
A dream.

316
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
The shadow is gone.

317
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
A dream.

318
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Let go of the past.

319
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:12,200
Let the shooting star fall.
