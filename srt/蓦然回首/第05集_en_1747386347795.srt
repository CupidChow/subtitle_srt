Episode beer

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can't do this anymore.

4
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I must have a problem with you.

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Today we are talking about

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
the second and third times of the crown prince and his personal guard.

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It is said that the crown prince is very good at small things.

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The good brother who was born and died in the past, Mr. Ma,

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
was jealous.

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Because of this, the two of them have a perfect relationship.

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Look, look, I said so.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The good brother Li Zhi brought me back to kill the little brother.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What do you usually do with the crown prince in the mansion?

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I didn't do anything.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
After returning to the mansion from Dali Temple,

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
we just took a break and slept.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Sleep?

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Go, go, go.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Go, go, go.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Come.

21
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hello, sorry to bother you.

22
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You are?

23
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm here to see the doctor.

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Please.

25
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm the doctor.

26
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Here, here.

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Please.

28
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What's your name?

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
My surname is Zhao.

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Zhao.

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Is this place safe?

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You can find me in such a remote hospital.

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It should be safe.

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm relieved because there is no one in this place.

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I want to make sure that the interrogation is well-planned.

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
As for the price.

37
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Are you sure you want me to help you see people?

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Seeing the doctor is old, it must be a high-quality medical skill.

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
If it can solve my heartache,

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
there will be a good chance in the future.

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay.

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay.

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Come.

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Come.

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Why is the lion here?

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Isn't this my house?

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Your house?

48
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You, you stay here.

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Be careful.

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Doctor, what disease do you think I have?

51
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I think you have something to hide from me.

52
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Why don't you tell me first?

53
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You are really a master.

54
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Actually,

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I have a nightmare at night.

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Nightmare.

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I have a lot of dreams.

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Louder.

59
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What's your dream?

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I have a nightmare at night.

61
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I have a lot of dreams.

62
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Then I have a heart attack.

63
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's a shame.

64
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Since Shi Tian was rescued by someone in the city,

65
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
he has been looking for people without thinking.

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The lion and Shi Tian are childhood friends.

67
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If possible,

68
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I want to ask the lion to persuade him.

69
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You are welcome.

70
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
In this way,

71
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
the two children have reached the age of marriage.

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes.

73
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What do you want from me?

74
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I just bought some snacks for you on the street.

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Take it back.

76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I just ate it. I'm not hungry.

77
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Don't come over.

78
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Something is wrong with you.

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Is there anything wrong?

80
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
If the lion is fine,

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll go back first.

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Stop.

83
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Are you...

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't know anything.

85
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I saw you in the mountain and I saw you in the city.

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I lied to you to draw.

87
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I didn't expect you to be the lion.

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Then I became your bodyguard.

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I really have no other thoughts about you.

90
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I take you as my brother.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I usually pretend to be respectful and obedient to you.

92
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I just want to make more money.

93
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
There is no friendship between us.

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The lion, the prince and the princess are here.

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I pay respects to my father, mother and Mr. Su.

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I pay respects to the prince and the princess.

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Mr. Su.

98
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You let the prince and the princess know about my drowning.

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't know what's going on now.

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It happened suddenly.

101
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Besides, I'm fine.

102
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
How can you be fine?

103
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You're a man.

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
How could you do this?

105
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yes.

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Mother, don't worry.

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't know the past.

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Now I specially trained and learned.

109
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There will be no problem in the future.

110
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Mr. Su.

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This thing...

112
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This thing...

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This thing...

114
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It can be trained.

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It can be trained.

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Why not?

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I think Mr. Ma taught me.

118
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Mr. Ma?

119
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Mr. Ma is not like this kind of person.

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Mr. Ma has been good at it since he was a child.

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He is the most suitable candidate.

122
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
When I learn it,

123
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
this kind of accident will not happen again.

124
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay, okay, okay.

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What nonsense?

126
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Don't be ashamed.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Don't mention it in the future.

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Brother,

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
we just discussed with Mr. Su.

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We discussed.

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You and Shiting's marriage should be settled.

132
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Father,

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I always treat Shiting as my sister.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't have a sister.

135
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You...

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Your Highness.

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If you and I force her,

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm afraid she will be more rude in the future.

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
How about letting her get in touch with Shiting more often these days?

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Okay.

141
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Ran,

142
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
if you don't want to,

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
we can't force you to be a couple.

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But Shiting

145
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
has been in a bad mood recently.

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We want you to comfort her more.

147
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes.

148
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What happened to Shiting?

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Here's the thing.

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
A few days ago,

151
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Shiting met a traitor.

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
He kidnapped her.

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Fortunately, there was a hero to save her.

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
In order to find this hero,

155
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
she was always looking for him.

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I don't even know where she is now.

157
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't worry, Mr. Su.

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll buy some cakes and go to see Shiting.

159
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay.

160
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Buy more.

161
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Talk to Shiting.

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll leave first.

163
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay.

164
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Go.

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay.

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Talk to her.

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Your Highness,

168
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
we found the person on the portrait.

169
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Where is he?

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
He's waiting in the front yard.

171
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Brother.

172
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
