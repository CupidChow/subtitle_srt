00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,400
Look carefully.

4
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,600
The guard of defense is indeed handsome.

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,400
He's even prettier than a normal girl.

6
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,000
Your Highness.

7
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,800
I hate it when people say I'm a womanizer.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Your Excellency, the news from Dali Temple

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,800
that the people have reported the case.

10
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:57,980
The car that escorted the King of An to the

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Change your clothes and follow me to have a look.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I think the account book is still in the watchtower.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Guard Fang, you are following me to interrogate.

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's not like I'm asking you to go to the execution ground.

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's my first time to interrogate with you.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm a little nervous.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Learn from it.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Recently, there are people reporting the case.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The living ghosts have robbed the King.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Dali Temple has not received any news yet.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
These are all rumors of the world between the people.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But they can't be true.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Even if it's a story, it's also true and false.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
These news should be paid more attention.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You are indeed a prince.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
No wonder you became the Minister of Justice of Dali Temple at such a young age.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You are just a horse.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
In the future, I will listen to your words.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You are young and promising.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Minister of Justice, you are indeed the Minister of Justice of Dali Temple.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What's the matter?

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Tell me.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What's the situation?

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Replying to the minister,

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
we were ordered to be under the command of Prince An.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Unexpectedly, we were intercepted by that thief.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This person wore a fire-burning mask,

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
held a black iron dagger,

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and escaped with a light bow.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
How does this sound like a book?

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Isn't it the story of the living ghosts in the mouth of the bookmaker?

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Long San.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What did you lose in the car?

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I found it in time, so I didn't lose anything.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If there is nothing,

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I won't bother you.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Minister,

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
according to the investigation,

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
the escort car that escorted the wine and water is not suspicious.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's funny.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The robbers need a carriage to transport the dead birds.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm afraid you have something that you can't see.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Everyone searched.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Only he hasn't searched.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Tuo.

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Minister,

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I was intercepted.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Tuo.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What is this?

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Minister,

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
it's my escort account book.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Your Highness,

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
my stomach suddenly hurts.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Go, go, go.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Bring it up.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Minister,

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
you can't have this.

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Your Highness.

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Minister,

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
this is the guy who intercepted the escort.

72
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,740
His Lordship is not a believer.

73
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,660
Could he be sink into the swash with Water üz for now?

74
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,220
Is it Fire.

75
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:36,980
Should be Fire.

76
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,780
Do not shout from grandpa,

77
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,040
it is so unfamiliar.

78
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,960
What should we do now?

79
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,620
No地善 translates.

80
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,760
He knows the place where is the switched.

81
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,060
Tell me something,

82
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,960
horse,

83
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,480
or steed.

84
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,860
He knows where is the switched.

85
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,120
Will alcohol be fixed with such an width?

86
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,760
This is right.

87
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,360
It's a great achievement to escape.

88
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,360
The whole city is under fire.

89
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,360
We must capture the dead.

90
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,280
It's fake.

91
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,000
Guard Fang.

92
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,640
Guard Fang.

93
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,640
Why are you here, Your Highness?

94
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,920
After you left,

95
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,240
the fire ghost came to the scene.

96
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,280
I was afraid you had an accident.

97
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,760
So I came to see you.

98
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,840
I don't know martial arts.

99
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,440
So I came back first.

100
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,360
Your Highness, you won't blame me, right?

101
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,760
It's dangerous here today.

102
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,640
It's normal that you're afraid.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,760
The fire ghost's martial arts are really amazing.

104
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,440
But I...

105
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,200
I'll use my sword

106
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,480
to hurt his left arm.

107
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,240
Your Highness,

108
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,960
you can attack his lower body next time.

109
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,040
It's not easy to hurt his left arm.

110
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,080
I'll attack his lower...

111
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,440
Your Highness.

112
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,280
You're hurt.

113
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,760
I...

114
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
The fire ghost hurt you?

115
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,680
Fang Ziyu.

116
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,280
You're a good friend.

117
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,920
Why did you hide it from me?

118
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,240
I...

119
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,240
I'm just a little servant

120
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,480
who doesn't know martial arts.

121
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,840
I'm lucky to be the guard of the Crown Prince.

122
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,440
I'm afraid that other people

123
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,200
will know about it.

124
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,520
They'll be accused of being a traitor.

125
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,760
You're a good servant.

126
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,200
I didn't want you to be the real guard.

127
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,560
I just wanted you to get a extra month's salary

128
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,320
to repay your life.

129
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,880
Let me see.

130
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,280
I've already applied the medicine.

131
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,040
What if you apply it yourself?

132
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,840
I'll apply it for you.

133
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,040
I don't want anyone to touch me.

134
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,280
I can't even look at it.

135
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,080
We're brothers.

136
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,320
You're too much.

137
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,840
Forget it.

138
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
When you're done,

139
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,680
I'll teach you martial arts.

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,800
That's it.

141
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,840
Is there anything else?

142
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Sleep well.

143
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,440
Sleep well.

144
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,800
I'm leaving.

145
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,840
Your Highness.

146
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,960
I saw the people of the Escort

147
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,680
put the wine in Lord An's mansion.

148
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,640
Why did you investigate Si Yan for so many years?

149
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,600
It seems that Lord An is going to reveal himself.

150
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,800
Keep sending people to keep an eye on Lord An and the Escort.

151
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Don't act rashly.

152
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,880
In case of a alert.

153
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:51,880
Yes.

154
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,840
Your Highness.

155
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,000
What else?

156
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,000
Guard Fang is the mastermind of the Dali Temple.

157
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,280
You asked him to be your personal guard.

158
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,160
What's wrong?

159
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,160
Since you can't carry your hands or lift them,

160
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,400
and you're trying to protect yourself,

161
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,640
how can he protect you?

162
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,360
Only you and the guards of the Dali Temple

163
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,560
can protect me.

164
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,120
As for Guard Fang,

165
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,640
isn't it a way to repay your life?

166
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,400
Go.

167
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,240
Yes.

168
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,080
Grandma.

169
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,120
Take this and exchange it for some money.

170
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,960
It's fine.

171
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,480
Thank you.

172
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,920
Thank you.

173
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,880
Take it well.

174
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,040
Don't lose it again.

175
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,720
It's just the gift for your son.

176
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,640
Don't give it to others so easily.

177
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,360
But that grandma, she...

178
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,000
I've given her the money

179
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,520
and made her arrange everything well.

180
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,360
Thank you, my son.

181
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,720
Three, four, one.

182
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,800
The account that I empower will be from trumpeter's.

183
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,680
This account has been sent to King An.

184
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,400
to the study to steal the account book.

185
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
I and Li Moran will attend the birthday banquet of Lord An.

186
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,440
Thanks to the personal guard of Prince of Tuoning,

187
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,120
my action is much more convenient.

188
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,120
By then, I can also take care of Wuji.

189
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,480
Don't act rashly.

190
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,960
Be careful.

191
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Today, there is a dance of Wuji in Linglong Pavilion.

192
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,200
The dance of Wuji is the highlight of tonight's banquet.

193
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,640
I heard that it's a beautiful girl who is beautiful in every way.

194
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,440
Don't just think about this girl.

195
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,040
I brought you out to relax today.

196
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,160
You should follow closely.

197
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,480
After all, this is not our mansion.

198
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,120
Be careful.

199
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,560
Don't worry, Your Highness.

200
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,080
I will never lose face for you.

201
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,400
I heard that the goods last time were robbed.

202
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,720
It's the crime of stealing goods in the martial arts world.

203
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,280
It seems that they want to steal the account book.

204
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,040
I hope Lord An can be careful.

205
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,040
Once our matter is done,

206
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,200
all efforts will be put into vain.

207
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,640
The Court of Judicial Review has investigated the private case for so many years.

208
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,800
I'm afraid that they have doubts about us this time.

209
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
Of course I know the cause of the crime.

210
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,360
After the banquet,

211
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,080
we will meet in the secret room.

212
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,480
Si Yan.

213
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,000
The banquet is about to begin.

214
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,280
I wonder how the weapons are prepared.

215
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,960
Will there be any accident?

216
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,920
What's wrong?

217
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,400
Your Highness, my stomach hurts suddenly.

218
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,960
Do you want to see a doctor?

219
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,480
I'll be back soon.

220
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,880
Be careful.

221
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,440
The machine is missing. Can you stop it?

222
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,640
I'm a drum player. I don't know how to dance.

223
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,480
Why is it gone?

224
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,920
The show is about to begin.

225
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,840
I've been looking for it for a long time.

226
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,120
There is no news now.

227
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,960
You go find it again.

228
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,840
I'll figure it out.

229
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,640
Okay.

230
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,600
That's mine.

231
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,800
You...

232
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,880
Your Highness, you are so elegant.

233
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,840
Go to Linglong Pavilion to find it another day.

234
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,520
Did you see Miss Yaju?

235
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,760
She was here just now.

236
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,880
She didn't even change her clothes.

237
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,200
Sisters, the show is about to begin.

238
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,960
Hurry up.

239
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,120
Hurry up.

240
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,920
Let's go.

241
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,880
Wait for me.

242
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,680
Remember to find it.

243
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,320
Hurry up.

244
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,040
If there is no show,

245
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,320
I can't steal the door tonight.

246
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Greetings, Second Uncle.

247
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,040
The East Sea is as beautiful as the South Mountain.

248
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,320
Thank you, Ran.

249
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,360
Second Uncle,

250
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,360
the wine at the banquet

251
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,160
is really a high-quality wine.

252
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,640
No wonder even the living ghosts

253
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,840
want to drink it.

254
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,560
Thanks to the Crown Prince

255
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,200
working in Dali Temple,

256
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,480
I can enjoy the beauty of wine

257
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,760
at work.

258
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,200
Whether it's the court official

259
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,560
or the Crown Prince of Prince Ning,

260
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,760
protecting the people's safety

261
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,160
is my duty.

262
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,040
Minister Si Zheng is really young and brave.

263
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,320
It's hot enough today.

264
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,200
Yes.

265
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,840
Second Brother,

266
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
I heard that

267
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,640
you specially found the dance of Linglong Pavilion

268
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,120
to celebrate the dance for today.

269
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,320
Everyone here

270
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,680
is just a small gift

271
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,040
for my birthday.

272
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,720
Please dance and celebrate your birthday.

273
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,240
The dance is coming out.

274
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,080
Yes.

275
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,240
Where is he?

276
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,320
He's JEFFER ء

277
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,400
It's not out yet.

278
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,360
How come Jeffer is still here?

279
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,560
It's coming.

280
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,240
Look.

281
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,000
Coming.

282
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:48,920
move.

283
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,400
How does it feel

284
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,680
to see me somewhere?

285
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:55,240
I will follow the shooting star to the vast sky

286
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:03,560
I will follow the shooting star to the vast sky

287
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:11,000
I will follow the shooting star to the vast sky

288
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,680
I will follow the shooting star to the vast sky

289
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:25,680
I will follow the shooting star to the vast sky

290
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:33,680
I will follow the shooting star to the vast sky
