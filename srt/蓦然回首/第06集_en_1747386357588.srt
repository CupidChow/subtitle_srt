00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I want to go far away with you

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,600
I try to find you, but all I can find is you

4
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,000
I just want to enjoy the sweetness with you

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,800
I'm just going to stay by your side and watch the snow fall

6
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,400
I'm waiting for you at the end of the world

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:01:01,400
I'm waiting for you at the end of the world

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,400
This is the dance you found?

10
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,400
All kinds of dance

11
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
My lord

12
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Who are you?

13
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
You don't sing

14
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
I'm Yazu, right?

15
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
What?

16
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,400
You're Fu Jiping, aren't you?

17
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
Is it?

18
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,400
What's the meaning of this?

19
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
You're here pretending to be a girl

20
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
You're so shameless

21
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
You're making so much money

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Aren't they beautiful?

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Let's get down to business

24
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,400
My lord, we've been looking for the dancers for so many days

25
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,400
The people here are getting less reliable

26
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Let's just withdraw the snow

27
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Over there

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Miss, slow down

29
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
My lord

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
My lord

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
I'm sorry

32
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Miss, let's just forget it

33
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Hongdie, I want to stay alone for a while

34
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
You can go back first

35
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Yes

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,400
Where are you, the savior?

37
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,400
Today, I'll tell you what happened yesterday

38
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,400
The crown prince protected the crown and the crown

39
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
He made Lord Ma feel guilty

40
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,400
But he couldn't bear to hurt Lord Ma

41
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,400
In case the two brothers would have a fight

42
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
No way

43
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Li Moran is playing so hard now

44
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Su Zhiting

45
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Li Moran

46
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
You're doing great

47
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
I heard you're in love with her

48
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Are you really dating Wuji?

49
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
Bullshit

50
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
Say it

51
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
My lord

52
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
You're here

53
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Su Zhiting

54
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
It's you

55
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Do you know I've been looking for you all these days?

56
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,400
I didn't expect to meet you here

57
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
It's you, Miss

58
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
I'm glad you're fine

59
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Fang Hui, you know Shiting?

60
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Not only that

61
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,400
She saved me from the living ghost

62
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,400
She saved my life

63
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
What a coincidence

64
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Fang Hui saved my life too

65
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Now she's my personal guardian

66
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,400
No wonder you're so good at martial arts

67
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
You don't know how to save people

68
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
I just happened to be a strong man

69
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
So I brought her here to save you

70
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Move

71
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Fang Hui

72
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Since we're so fated

73
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Why don't you go shopping with me later?

74
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,400
I'll buy some gifts to thank you for saving my life

75
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Thank you for saving my life

76
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
You're so loud

77
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,400
I won't talk if you don't know how to talk

78
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
Besides

79
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
You're in a bad mood

80
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Why are you so eager to go shopping?

81
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
I'm glad to see you

82
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
I'm so happy now

83
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Miss Su, don't stand on ceremony

84
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
These are the snacks the crown prince bought for you

85
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Thank you, Fang Hui

86
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
I bought it

87
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
How do you know I like this?

88
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
I bought it

89
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Let's go

90
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
I didn't expect you're so good at martial arts

91
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
And you're so gentle

92
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Fang Hui, what do you like?

93
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
I bought it

94
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Sirs, we just got the new products

95
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Please choose

96
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
These are all new?

97
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
Yes

98
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
They're so beautiful

99
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
What's the difference between these rouge?

100
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
The difference is big

101
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Look

102
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
This is water ink

103
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,400
This is red

104
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
This is beautiful

105
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
This is...

106
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Aren't they all red?

107
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
We want all of them

108
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Take them back to the mansion

109
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
I don't understand

110
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Okay

111
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
But it's okay

112
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
You're a man anyway

113
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
Su Shiting

114
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
What?

115
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,400
You don't know how to choose, do you?

116
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Well...

117
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
It's okay

118
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
You're a man

119
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
It's normal to not know these

120
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
That's how a man should be

121
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,400
How about I teach you how to use the rouge?

122
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
Thank you for your advice

123
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
Then I'll teach you how to use the rouge

124
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Okay

125
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Look

126
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,400
You should put the rouge on your hand

127
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Then you can choose the rouge for the girl you like

128
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
I can't tell

129
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Fang Hui, try it

130
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Go to sleep

131
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,400
The rouge should be on your face

132
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Your Highness

133
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Don't move

134
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Your Highness

135
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
I've figured out the trick of the fake ghost

136
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,400
You can go at any time

137
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Me too

138
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
I'm good at medical skills

139
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Maybe I can help you

140
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Miss Su

141
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Your throat is also damaged

142
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Go

143
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Who's throat is damaged?

144
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Your Highness, your rouge

145
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Send it to the mansion

146
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Okay

147
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Siyu, what's your plan?

148
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
When we meet the fake ghost

149
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,400
we'll kneel and bend

150
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
Miss Su

151
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
We'll use the rouge

152
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Can you do it?

153
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Of course

154
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
I always use it

155
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
I'll start

156
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Who dropped the money?

157
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
So careless

158
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Do you have to do this?

159
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
It's useful

160
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,400
The fake ghost will cause the old man in the mansion to get sick

161
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
When the ghost comes

162
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
you should hide

163
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
Guard Fang, I'll protect you

164
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Don't worry

165
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Stop

166
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Don't move

167
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Black iron dagger burns the clouds

168
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
I'll protect you

169
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,400
I'll protect you

170
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Boss

171
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
We're in trouble

172
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Don't show it

173
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
What if it's in the box?

174
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Let's find it

175
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
When we kneel

176
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
it seems more sincere

177
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Your Highness

178
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
How can you kneel?

179
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
Kneel

180
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
We're in trouble

181
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Your box is for the beggars

182
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Why are they dead?

183
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Go

184
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Siyu, come back

185
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Go

186
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Don't move

187
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Or I'll kill him

188
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Boss, don't kill me

189
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
I'm the most ungrateful guard in the mansion

190
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
It's useless to tie me

191
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
I'll kill you

192
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Guard Fang

193
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
It's useless to tie me

194
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
