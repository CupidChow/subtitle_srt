Episode 16

4
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,520
From today on,

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,320
you will investigate the truth as a man.

6
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,760
You must not reveal your identity as a woman.

7
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,800
Otherwise,

8
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,400
you will be caught.

9
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,200
A month later,

10
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,840
you will be in charge of the escort

11
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,240
of the banquet of Lord An.

12
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,880
There may be a private account book.

13
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,920
This is a good opportunity

14
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,280
for you and your father to turn the case.

15
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,720
A life of Taoism,

16
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,040
Jianghu history,

17
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,880
and the filial piety of others will be taken away from the public.

18
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,000
Only for the bitter times of Hong Chen,

19
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,040
the cold wind will break the common man.

20
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,920
Today,

21
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,640
I will tell you about

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,080
the famous and famous

23
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,240
Jianghu swordsman,

24
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,480
Huo Gui.

25
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,960
I've heard of him.

26
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,160
He's from the same family as us.

27
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,680
It's said that this man is eight feet tall

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,120
and has extraordinary martial arts.

29
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,360
He has a scar on his face like a fire.

30
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,080
He looks like a murderer.

31
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,360
He's called Huo Gui.

32
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,560
Give me the account book.

33
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,080
Who is it?

34
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,800
How dare you steal the escort of Lord An?

35
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,640
Huo Gui is a man who is good at evil and mischievous.

36
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,600
He has a lot of money and is a man of no authority.

37
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,680
He stunt the strife of the poor.

38
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,320
How could it be empty?

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,800
He's the bodyguard of those who rob, pay and replace poverty.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,520
Bravo!

41
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:30,860
Wu Han

42
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,860
Come on.

43
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,860
Wang Ziyue, the crown prince is here.

44
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,860
Come on.

45
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,860
Ziyue.

46
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,860
Fang Ziyue.

47
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,860
Fang Ziyue.

48
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,860
Fang Ziyue.

49
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,860
Take your clothes and your clothes.

50
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,860
I just came to the mansion.

51
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,860
I can't tell the direction.

52
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,860
Enough.

53
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,860
The crown prince is in the pool.

54
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,860
It's about to explode.

55
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,860
And...

56
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,860
My name is Fang Ziyue.

57
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,860
I was a small drug lord who didn't know the name.

58
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,860
Coincidentally,

59
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,860
I was born into the family of the crown prince of the Ning family.

60
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,860
The world has to start from a few days ago.

61
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,860
They chase him and he escapes.

62
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,860
He is so bad that he can't fly.

63
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,860
The assassination begins.

64
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,860
Why are you...

65
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,860
Look over there.

66
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,860
Don't let him run away.

67
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,860
Sorry, bro.

68
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,860
I didn't know there was a hole here.

69
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,860
This is the trap I made to catch wild boars.

70
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,860
You fell down by yourself.

71
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,860
Besides, this trap saved you.

72
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,860
I'll go first if there's nothing else.

73
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,860
Bro, I'm late.

74
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,860
Can you go up and pull me?

75
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,860
OK, OK, OK.

76
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,860
You go up later.

77
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,860
Pull me.

78
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,860
OK.

79
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,860
Bro, where are you going?

80
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,860
Who is it?

81
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,860
Did you see a man?

82
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,860
Guys, I didn't see anything.

83
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,860
I have an old father and a younger brother and sister in my family.

84
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,860
I haven't gone to save my wife yet.

85
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,860
Please let me go.

86
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,860
Please.

87
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,860
You're lucky today.

88
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,860
If you have nothing to do, just come at me.

89
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,860
Don't hurt the innocent.

90
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,860
It's hidden here.

91
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,860
You're so stupid.

92
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,860
Don't waste it if you've dug the hole.

93
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,860
If you have nothing to do, just come at me.

94
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,860
Bro, what's going on?

95
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,860
Are you OK, little brother?

96
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,860
They're all dead.

97
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,860
All dead?

98
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,860
Yes.

99
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,860
A masked warrior just came.

100
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,860
He just kicked a few times and killed everyone.

101
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,860
Where is he?

102
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,860
He left after saving me.

103
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,860
Can you pull me up?

104
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,860
You look like a human.

105
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,860
Someone is after you.

106
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,860
It must be a young man from a noble family.

107
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,860
This is for you.

108
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,860
Help me.

109
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,860
A masked warrior?

110
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,860
Is your life worth this much?

111
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,860
Take this jade and wait for me to come back to the mansion.

112
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,860
I'll give you a reward.

113
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,860
Thank you.

114
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,860
One hundred taels.

115
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,860
OK.

116
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,860
Two hundred taels.

117
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,860
OK. Two hundred taels.

118
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,860
Thank you, little brother.

119
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,860
Dad, I'm back.

120
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,860
Come back.

121
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,860
Come here.

122
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,860
How many times have I told you to wait for the news?

123
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,860
You're a living ghost.

124
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,860
You're making trouble.

125
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,860
Wait.

126
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,860
When will it end?

127
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,860
You and I are the ones who are guilty.

128
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,860
Only by living can we turn the case.

129
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,860
Come here.

130
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,860
This is your new identity.

131
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,860
This is your new identity.

132
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,860
From tomorrow, you will go to the Dali Temple to do the chores.

133
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,860
Wang Ziyu, 20 years old, son of a farmer.

134
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,860
Dad, I only go to the Dali Temple to do the chores.

135
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,860
How can I get access to the files of that year?

136
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,860
You have a very bad relationship.

137
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,860
Your dad's ability now.

138
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,860
It's already done.

139
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,860
Dad, dad was killed by the crook in the investigation of the private case.

140
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,860
Fortunately, we two women were not dead.

141
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,860
This time, Tu Yan will help us secretly.

142
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,860
All your activities in Dali Temple must be done with great effort.

143
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,860
Protect yourself.

144
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,860
It's a tough relationship.

145
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,860
Someone is willing to help us in this situation.

146
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,860
Grandma, take this to exchange for some money.

147
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,860
You're a good person.

148
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,860
Thank you.

149
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,860
It's okay.

150
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,860
Thank you. You can live a long life.

151
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,860
It's okay.

152
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,860
Little brother, we meet again.

153
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,860
Why are you here?

154
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,860
I came here.

155
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,860
For the case of yesterday.

156
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,860
You don't forget who saved your life, right?

157
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,860
But I climbed up by myself yesterday.

158
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,860
Thank you, little brother.

159
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,860
Take your hands off.

160
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,860
You, look over there.

161
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,860
Yes, the one behind, follow me.

162
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,860
Brother, I'm sorry.

163
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,860
I don't want to cause trouble.

164
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,860
You let the people of the government come to save you.

165
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,860
See you again.

166
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,860
What's the situation, little brother?

167
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,860
If I hadn't delayed the time, you would have been on the road to the imperial palace.

168
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,860
Let me tell you.

169
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,860
Maybe from today on, you will be in charge of me.

170
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,860
I'm a Dalisi who is close to hard relationship.

171
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,860
Really?

172
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,860
Wang Ziyu, right?

173
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,860
From today on, you will be responsible for the room cleaning of the governor.

174
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,860
The governor usually has a final scene.

175
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,860
You have to clean it quickly.

176
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,860
You must be a good person on the case.

177
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,860
Sir, don't worry.

178
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,860
I will definitely clean it up.

179
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,860
I'm much cleaner than my face.

180
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,860
Your level of study is very high.

181
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,860
Don't be too particular when you see the governor.

182
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,860
Sir, what is the general's usual behavior?

183
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,860
Our general is great.

184
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,860
At the age of twenty, he is the position of the governor of Dalisi.

185
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,860
Not only is he talented, his martial arts are outstanding.

186
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,860
More importantly, the governor is the heir of the Ning family.

187
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,860
Heir?

188
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,860
It's my honor to be able to play tricks with the heir.

189
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,860
Don't worry.

190
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,860
I will definitely serve him well.

191
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,860
Serve him well.

192
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,860
Why are you here?

193
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,860
You should have told me earlier that you could find me.

194
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,860
You also found a relationship?

195
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,860
It's time for you to pay your gratitude.

196
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,860
Come on, help me with my work.

197
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,860
Our governor has a lot of things to do.

198
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,860
Hurry up.

199
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,860
Over there, over there.

200
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,860
Right here.

201
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,860
Right here.

202
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,860
Clean it up.

203
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,860
Clean it up.

204
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,860
Yes, up here.

205
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,860
Wait a minute, clean it up later.

206
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,860
Fang Ziyue.

207
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,860
Later, the leaves in the yard.

208
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,860
Fang Ziyue.

209
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,860
Greetings, Governor.

210
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,860
Governor.

211
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,860
This relationship is worth it.

212
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,860
I have something to do at home.

213
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,860
I'm leaving first.

214
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,860
Minister Ma.

215
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,860
If someone is willing to repay the court's official position,

216
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,860
what should the prince do?

217
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,860
According to the law of our country,

218
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,860
it's a crime of bad luck.

219
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,860
Prince.

220
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,860
Governor.

221
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,860
I beg you to be my only nephew as a citizen.

222
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,860
Minister Ma.

223
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,860
Yes, sir.

224
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,860
This Fang Ziyue saved my life last night.

225
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,860
He also made a living in Dali Temple.

226
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,860
Then stay by my side.

227
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,860
Be my personal guard.

228
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,860
Start from Ning Wang's mansion a month ago.

229
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,860
Yes, sir.

230
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,860
I don't know martial arts.

231
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,860
How can I be your personal guard?

232
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,860
You can live with one mouth.

233
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,860
You flatter me.

234
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,860
I'm grateful.

235
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,860
I let you get two months' salary.

236
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,860
I only do one part of the work.

237
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,860
Thank you, sir.

238
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,860
I appreciate it.

239
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,860
That's it.

240
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,860
I'm going to Dali Temple and Ning Wang's mansion

241
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,860
with this hard relationship.

242
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,860
Prince.

243
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,860
I'm coming.

244
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,860
Yes, Your Highness.

245
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,860
I'm going to 쌓殭矢

246
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,860
and to teach you martial arts.

247
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,460
I also activated it into Dragon Klein Seal and

248
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,860
you,happened to destroy it.

249
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,860
Hi, sir.

250
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,860
severely injured.

251
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,860
I...

252
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,020
You didn't bring any clothes. What am I wearing?

253
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,180
Look at it carefully.

254
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,660
The guard is indeed handsome.

255
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,340
He's even prettier than a normal girl.

256
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,180
Your Highness.

257
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,700
I hate it when people say I'm a scoundrel.

258
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,860
I'm not a scoundrel.

259
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,860
I'm a man.

260
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,860
