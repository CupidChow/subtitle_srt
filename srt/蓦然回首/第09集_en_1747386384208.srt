1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,760
I want to go far with you

2
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,600
I'm lonely, but you're the only one in my heart

3
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,000
I just want to enjoy the sweetness with you

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,760
I just want to stay by your side and guard the melody

5
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,240
I'm waiting for you at the blue mountain

6
00:00:52,240 --> 00:01:01,240
I'm waiting for you at the blue mountain

7
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
Don't go

8
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,240
Don't go

9
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,240
Okay, I won't go

10
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,040
I'll stay with you

11
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
Go to sleep

12
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,240
Don't go

13
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,240
Why do you dress up like a man?

14
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,240
Wipe

15
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,240
What did you do to me?

16
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Guard Fang

17
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,240
You were so tired last night

18
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,240
What tired?

19
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,240
Think about it

20
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,240
Why did I come down last night?

21
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,240
I remember we drank last night

22
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
And then

23
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,240
What can I do to you?

24
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,240
I can only stay by your side

25
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,240
I can only make up for it when I'm tired

26
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,240
The ground is cold, the wings are walking, it's easy to catch a cold

27
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,240
I

28
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,240
I should take care of myself

29
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
Greetings, father and mother

30
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,240
You know to visit your mother

31
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,240
I'm sorry for bothering you this morning

32
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
I apologize to you

33
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,240
I was going to take you to Su's mansion to talk about marriage

34
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,240
But the Su family replied that

35
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Miss Su changed her cold since she went back to our mansion

36
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,240
So it's not easy for now

37
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Why are you laughing?

38
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,240
By the way, Prime Minister Wang invited us to his mansion for dinner tomorrow

39
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
You should prepare for it

40
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Don't make any mistake tomorrow

41
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,240
It's been a long time since I saw Prime Minister Wang

42
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
I'll go prepare the gifts

43
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,240
Inform the guard to accompany me to see the king

44
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,240
The rest will stay here

45
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,240
Yes

46
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Ziyue

47
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Why do you always wear the wrong clothes?

48
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,240
Your highness, someone is watching

49
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,240
It's against the rules

50
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
It's okay, I don't care

51
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Don't take other people's opinions and opinions into consideration

52
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
I'm here

53
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
Let's go

54
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,240
Prince, you look a little strange today

55
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
What?

56
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
Nothing

57
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
Guard Fang, how about having lunch first?

58
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
It's okay, I'm not hungry

59
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
Let's get down to business

60
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
Boss, a bun for you

61
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Okay

62
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,240
Thank you

63
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,240
Buns

64
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Here comes the buns

65
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,240
Here, enjoy

66
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Prince

67
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Have you heard about the rumors about the mansion recently?

68
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,240
Plus, we were drunk last night

69
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,240
We went out together today

70
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Prince

71
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,240
Eat

72
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,240
The buns are sweet and delicious

73
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,240
They are not greasy at all

74
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,240
You can't have too much

75
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
It's not appropriate

76
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Ziyue

77
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Do you know why I don't let people find weapons on the flower box?

78
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
What do you mean?

79
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,240
I drew this last night

80
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
I'm curious too

81
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Why do you dress up as a man and enter the mansion?

82
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
Prince, don't joke

83
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
I'm a man

84
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,240
This is outside the mansion

85
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
If I really want to expose you

86
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,240
I'll find someone to check your identity in the mansion

87
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,240
Why wait until now?

88
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
I

89
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
My family is all men and women

90
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,240
My father doesn't like me to be a woman

91
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,240
So he treats me like a man since I was a child

92
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,240
My father has been sick recently

93
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,240
We don't have money to treat him

94
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,240
It's inconvenient for a woman to work in the city

95
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,240
So I dress up as a man

96
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
You said it

97
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
But who is it?

98
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
To be honest

99
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Ok

100
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
I believe you

101
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,240
This is your identity certificate

102
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
You are Yaonong's son

103
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
Because your father is sick

104
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
You are forced to work in the city

105
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
You can't expose your identity

106
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Otherwise

107
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
All the people who helped us will be implicated

108
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
Prince

109
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,240
Can you keep this secret for me?

110
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,240
If people know that I'm a woman

111
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
I'll be in trouble

112
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
And there are more rumors

113
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,240
If I spread it, it will damage the reputation

114
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
You are worried about this

115
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
I'll tell you the truth

116
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Don't be so careless

117
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
I won't

118
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Eat well

119
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
I can eat

120
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
As long as I'm here

121
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
I will take good care of you

122
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Eat

123
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
You eat

124
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
You eat

125
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Why are you all married to me?

126
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Prince

127
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
What are we here for?

128
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
I will visit Prime Minister with my father tomorrow

129
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
He is my mentor

130
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
Of course I need to find a new gift

131
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Prime Minister

132
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Wang Bangchang, the old man of the two dynasties

133
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,240
Yes

134
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
Prime Minister loves the people like his son

135
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
The people are far away

136
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
You really think so?

137
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Of course

138
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
He watched me grow up

139
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,240
I know Prime Minister well

140
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Then he didn't do anything wrong

141
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,240
People are not saints

142
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
It's not a mistake

143
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
But Prime Minister is more powerful than the old

144
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
I

145
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
Ziyu

146
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Father

147
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Doctor Zhao

148
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Doctor Zhao

149
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,240
Father

150
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
I'm here

151
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
I'm here

152
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
I'm here

153
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
I'm here

154
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,240
I'm here

155
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,240
I'm here

156
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
I'm here

157
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,240
I'm here

158
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
I'm here

159
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
I'm here

160
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
I'm here

161
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
I'm here

162
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
I'm here

163
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
I'm here

164
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
I'm here

165
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
I'm here

166
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
I'm here

167
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
I'm here

168
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,240
I'm here

169
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
I'm here

170
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
I'm here

171
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,240
I'm here

172
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,240
I'm here

173
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
I'm here

174
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
I'm here

175
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
I'm here

176
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
I'm here

177
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
I'm here

178
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
I'm here

179
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,240
I'm here

180
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
I'm here

181
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
I'm here

182
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
I'm here

183
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
I'm here

184
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
I'm here

185
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,240
I'm here

186
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
I'm here

187
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,240
I'm here

188
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
I'm here

189
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
I'm here

190
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,240
I'm here

191
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,240
I'm here

192
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
I'm here

193
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
