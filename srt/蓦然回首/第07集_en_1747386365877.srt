Episode 16

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You're a living ghost?

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's right. I am a living ghost.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What?

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Since you know I'm a living ghost,

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
tell me.

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Who made you pretend to be me?

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We're just ordinary bandits.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We always want to live a good life

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
with our own hands.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We always want to be rich and poor.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
If that's the case,

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
why didn't you use the way of the bandits to rob?

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Why did you pretend to be a living ghost?

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Still not telling the truth?

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It hurts.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Be careful.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's not convenient for you to see.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll take you to Ma Yi Chuan.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Your Highness! Your Highness!

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Lin Mo Ran!

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What's going on?

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What's going on?

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm fine.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I pretended to be a living ghost

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and delayed the time.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Fortunately, the Crown Prince arrived in time.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I can live longer.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Move aside.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's powder.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Fortunately, I closed my eyes in time.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I didn't get too much into my eyes.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Thanks to me,

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
you came to such a dangerous place.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Sir,

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
where is the fake ghost?

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It ran away.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Your sir is searching nearby.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll take the guard back first.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll send you back first.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let's go.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Boss,

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
how do we explain when we go back?

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Tell Prince An the truth.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Hong Die, hurry up.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Fang Hui's eyes are injured.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I have to take this opportunity

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
to take good care of her.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Maybe she can still treat me...

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Greetings to Your Highness and Princess Consort.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Miss Su,

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
why are you here?

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I...

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I came to see you.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I heard that she was catching the ghost recently.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So I brought some tonics and medicine to see her.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Good.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Shi Tian and Mo Ran

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
grew up together.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Of course, they are different in affection.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Go and see Ran.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Go.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Miss Su,

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Ran's room is over there.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The guard of the Crown Prince

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
was injured to protect the Crown Prince.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The Crown Prince is taking care of him in the guard room.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Miss Su,

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm going to take a look.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll go with you.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll take care of him in the guard room.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Don't move.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You don't want your eyes?

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
If you don't feel well, you won't be able to see.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Fang Hui!

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Wash them with water after an hour.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Go away.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Su Shi Tian,

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I've tolerated you for many times.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I tolerated you for many times.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Shut up.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Guard Fang,

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
you're getting better.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Thank you for your concern, Miss Su.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm fine now.

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's good.

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You must take good care of yourself.

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
How did you protect Guard Fang?

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
How did you hurt him?

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Miss Su,

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
he's my personal guard.

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
He should protect me.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But I don't want to get hurt by him.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Actually, I can protect him too.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Come on.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're just a little bit of a playboy.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Guard Fang,

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
this is red bean soup I made myself.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Try it.

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Hey!

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Why?

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's just a bowl of red bean soup.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll drink it first.

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I just want to tell you that

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
it's hot.

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's sweet.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
When I first came here,

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I met His Highness and Princess Consort.

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We talked about our marriage.

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Go out and talk.

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Guard Fang,

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I have something to do. I have to go now.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Tomorrow, I'll come to see you again.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let's go.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What do you want to eat? Tell me.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll be right back.

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Go.

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Shiyan,

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
my father and Lord Su have always been friends.

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Recently, they want to get together.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What should we do?

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I also want to discuss this with you.

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You know,

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I always treat you as my brother.

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I have no feelings for you.

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I also think so.

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You think so?

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yes, I think so too.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But we are the same.

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes.

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Then I'll ask you to get a person.

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It shouldn't be too much.

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Except for the guard, I can choose anyone.

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why?

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
When I first came here,

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I met the prince and the princess.

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We talked about our marriage.

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Why should I be sad?

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm not sad.

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm just happy.

145
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm not sad.

146
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm just happy.

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm not sad.

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm not sad.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm not sad.

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm not sad.

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm not sad.

152
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm not sad.

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Why should I be sad?

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm just a guard.

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Sleep well.

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Sleep well.

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm leaving.

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Walk slowly.

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Every time you touch your face, you can rub it on your face.

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Then look forward.

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Do you know?

162
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Your eyes are not convenient.

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'll take you to Ma Yi Chuan.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm not sad.

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm not sad.

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm not sad.

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm not sad.

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If I'm not a ghost,

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
if I don't need you to wear a men's costume,

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
if I'm not the guard next to him,

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
if I'm just a normal woman.

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Really?

173
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,400
I can't do it.

174
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,000
I won't let the guards go to the mansion.

175
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,400
Why? Why? Why?

176
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,480
You like to let the guards go?

177
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,000
You...

178
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let go of me.

179
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,680
Let go of me.

180
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,440
This is the royal family's duty.

181
00:08:59,440 --> 00:08:59,920
So what?

182
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,600
We're in the Dali Temple.

183
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,200
You're not allowed to go.

184
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
I said I won't let you go.

185
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,000
You're not allowed to go.

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,120
You're not allowed to go.

187
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,600
We're not allowed to go.

188
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,120
You're talking nonsense.

189
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,920
You're not allowed to go.

190
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,520
Look. Look. Look.

191
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,480
You have Lord Ma.

192
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,880
Why do you have to hold the guards and not let them go?

193
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
And you.

194
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,280
You don't work hard at all.

195
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,480
What's up?

196
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,480
My lord.

197
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,200
We couldn't find the fake fire ghost.

198
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,080
But the city's security team sent us the news.

199
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,880
There's a rumor on the market again.

200
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,680
Is there anything going on with Lord An?

201
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,680
Since the assassination of Lord An's mansion,

202
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,880
there's been no change.

203
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,280
He's been staying in the mansion.

204
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
But he'll let the security team escort him to the tavern.

205
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,680
Security team?

206
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,680
That's right.

207
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,280
There's been a rumor on the market again.

208
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
I've been investigating.

209
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
I found Lord An

210
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,680
is escorting the security team to the tavern.

211
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,080
Since you got the account book,

212
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,680
you'll stay with Li Moran for another day.

213
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,880
There's a risk of exposure.

214
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,080
Li Moran has been investigating the secret.

215
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,880
I'm still in his favor.

216
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,280
But I went to catch the fake fire ghost today.

217
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Before I knew the truth,

218
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,280
he ran away.

219
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,680
You stayed with the Crown Prince

220
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,680
to investigate

221
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,880
or

222
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,080
you couldn't bear to leave Li Moran?

223
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,280
I didn't.

224
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
Don't forget.

225
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,680
Back then, Li Moran's father,

226
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,080
Prince Ning, broke the private case.

227
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,080
He almost killed your father, Fang Qianwei.

228
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,480
You stayed with Li Moran

229
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,480
to get closer to the truth.

230
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,480
Not to work hard for him all day,

231
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,680
to control his emotions.

232
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,480
I won't forget my mission.

233
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
I'll go investigate the wine water

234
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,280
that the security team sent.

235
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,280
Your Highness,

236
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
according to the spy,

237
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,080
the security team will send the wine water to Lord An tonight.

238
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,280
Shall we take action

239
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
to seal the security team?

240
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,280
Go.

241
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:03,880
Yes.

242
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,080
Go.

243
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,280
Guard Fang,

244
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
why are you here?

245
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,080
Go.

246
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,680
Your eyes are fine.

247
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,280
Shouldn't the Crown Prince stay with Miss Su in the Prince's Mansion?

248
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,680
You have your own eyes and wounds.

249
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,480
You still want to think about her?

250
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
I don't care

251
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,280
who I think about.

252
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,080
You really want to work in Su's Mansion?

253
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,680
Protect Su Shiting?

254
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,480
What's wrong with Miss Su?

255
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,880
She is gentle

256
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,880
and beautiful.

257
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,880
Fang Ziyu.

258
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,880
You can stay with me as a guard

259
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,080
because you saved my life.

260
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Not because you have the ability to be a guard.

261
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,080
You went to Su's Mansion like this.

262
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,480
Protecting yourself is a waste of time.

263
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,680
You still want to protect Su Shiting?

264
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,680
Yes.

265
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,680
I don't have the ability to be a guard.

266
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,680
I'm just a servant of Dali Temple.

267
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,680
I never thought of staying with you.

268
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,880
Yes.

269
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
I don't have the ability.

270
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,080
I can't protect you.

271
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,680
I don't need your help.

272
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,680
If you don't like me,

273
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,280
I'll leave the Prince's Mansion today

274
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,080
so that you won't be in trouble.

275
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,880
You're fine in the mansion.

276
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,280
Why are you like this when you come out?

277
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Who made you angry?

278
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,080
Sir,

279
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,080
we...

280
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,880
Search!

281
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,480
Yes.

282
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,480
Nianni, come with me.

283
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,680
Yes.

284
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,680
So,

285
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,680
what are you doing here?

286
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,880
I don't need to report to you in real time.

287
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,680
Okay.

288
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,480
Okay.

289
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,080
I don't want you to stay here with me all the time.

290
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,080
Since you don't want to talk,

291
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,080
you can do what you want to do.

292
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,880
Sir,

293
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
have a taste.

294
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Good boy.

295
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,480
I just feel sorry for myself.

296
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,280
A guilt over the Irisings at Mr. An Mansion.

297
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,440
It was mixed with the rinse of salt and alcohol.

298
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,880
Take the one who made this marble quarry to Dali Temple

299
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
to deal with it in detail.

300
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:00,980
Yes.

301
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,080
If there's nothing else planned,

302
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,080
I will go now.

303
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
Fang Ziyun!

304
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,280
Tell me then.

305
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,480
It's your business.

306
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,560
Go find a new guard.

307
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,160
Do you want to find one?

308
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
Ma Yichun.

309
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,200
Do you know why you've been with me for so many years

310
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,560
and still a chess piece?

311
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,880
Think about it.

312
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,160
Wait for a move.

313
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,680
You are......

314
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,320
The rest of my life

315
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,200
is the risk I girth

316
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,120
myself

317
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,480
A faint look

318
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,280
I think I understand

319
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,080
The dream you said

320
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,480
The shadow is always empty

321
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:05,680
I am willing to be in a dream

322
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:12,680
Looking back, I will follow you to travel around the world

323
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,680
The dream you said

324
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,680
The shadow is always empty

325
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:28,680
I am willing to be in a dream

326
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,680
I am willing to be in a dream

327
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:42,680
Looking back, I will follow you to travel around the world

328
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
The dream you said

329
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,680
The shadow is always empty

330
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,680
I am willing to be in a dream
