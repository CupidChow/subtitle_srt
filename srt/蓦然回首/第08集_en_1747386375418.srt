Third Master,

7
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,640
in the past, people from Great Lisp

8
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,840
and the wine and wine wine are all sealed

9
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,760
Last night, Li Moran sent someone to investigate the Escort

10
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,160
and came to ask for wine today

11
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,800
It seems that the matter of Si Yan

12
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,760
can't be hidden

13
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,560
We underestimated Li Moran

14
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,920
but the people of the Escort will never betray us

15
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,560
Why don't you send Li Moran

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,520
to meet him so that Li Moran can blindness

17
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,400
What should we do

18
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,120
for the next matter?

19
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,000
That's okay

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,820
it is

31
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,920
he had

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,420
Love.

36
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,420
Sir.

37
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,420
Guard Fang.

38
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,420
The crown prince wants you to go in.

39
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,420
Isn't it clean?

40
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,420
You can go in and say a few words to him.

41
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,420
You call me in and go in.

42
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,420
Just because you are adults, I am a big gift.

43
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,420
You can just give me a free hand.

44
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,420
I didn't mean that.

45
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,420
The crown prince is also like that.

46
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,420
What did he say?

47
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,420
This is a wine cup.

48
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,420
As a personal guard of this city,

49
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,420
How dare you sneak in at the door and tell him to come in.

50
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,420
Sir, guard Fang let him in.

51
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,100
Guard Fang's job in Dali Temple is a

52
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,420
Let him in.

53
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,420
He said that.

54
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,420
You go and tell him.

55
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,420
If I do something in Dali Temple that makes him unsatisfied,

56
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,420
I will take the credit and pack it home.

57
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,420
Pack it home. Pack it home. Pack it home.

58
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,420
I'll pack it home.

59
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,420
This is a curse.

60
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,420
If I do something in Dali Temple that makes the crown prince unsatisfied,

61
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,420
I will take the credit and pack it home.

62
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,420
He really didn't say that.

63
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,420
Enough.

64
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,420
What kind of temper is he?

65
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,420
If he doesn't do it well, he will be fired, right?

66
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,420
There are so many jobs in Dali Temple.

67
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,420
One more, one less, one less.

68
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,420
Okay, let him come in right now.

69
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,420
Come back to the mansion to work with me.

70
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,420
What did he say?

71
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,420
It's too long. I didn't remember.

72
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,420
It means that

73
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,420
Dali Temple is the same as you.

74
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,420
Okay.

75
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,420
Mr. Ma, you tell him

76
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,420
that I can stop working in the mansion

77
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,420
and continue to stay in Dali Temple.

78
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,420
He said that I...

79
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,420
I'm not deaf.

80
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,420
Mr. Ma,

81
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,420
I'm working in Dali Temple

82
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,420
not to make people angry

83
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,420
and let them recruit another batch of men.

84
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,420
He probably means...

85
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,420
Shut up.

86
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,420
Fang Huwei took the wine to the mansion with me.

87
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,420
He didn't do it well.

88
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,420
Dali Temple and the mansion don't need to stay.

89
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,420
What is this?

90
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,420
Okay.

91
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,420
I'm not happy to do some work.

92
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,420
No.

93
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,420
Okay.

94
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,420
I'm not happy to do some work.

95
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,420
You tell me what Dali Temple...

96
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,420
Okay.

97
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,420
Okay.

98
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,420
I'm not happy to do some work.

99
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,420
You tell me what Dali Temple

100
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,420
has so many jobs.

101
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,420
One more, one less, one less.

102
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,420
Let him come in right now.

103
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,420
Come back to the mansion to work with me.

104
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,420
I remember.

105
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,420
Sir.

106
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,420
Sir.

107
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,420
Mr. Ma, hurry up.

108
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,420
Let's go.

109
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,420
Tell him that it's not tiring.

110
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,420
You...

111
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,420
Tell him that

112
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,420
I'm only responsible for work.

113
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,420
Tell him what he should do.

114
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,420
I'll decide.

115
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,420
You tell him.

116
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,420
Enough.

117
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,420
You two are so stupid.

118
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,420
You can say whatever you want.

119
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,420
Anyway, the Heir Apparent is the same.

120
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,420
I'll leave right now.

121
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,420
Wait.

122
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,420
Let go.

123
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,420
You can't get used to me.

124
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,420
I'm not capable.

125
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,420
I won't leave without asking.

126
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,420
Fang Ziyue.

127
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,420
Don't always say that you'll leave.

128
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,420
You know that I hate hearing this.

129
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,420
You still talk about it.

130
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,420
Sir.

131
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,420
Mr. Ma, you haven't left yet.

132
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,420
I'll go now.

133
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,420
I'll go first if there's nothing else.

134
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,420
Sorry.

135
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,420
What's your fault?

136
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,420
I'm not capable enough.

137
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,420
I don't deserve to stand by your side.

138
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,420
I have my own name.

139
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,420
Sir.

140
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,420
You can talk to me.

141
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,420
I was wrong last night.

142
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,420
I don't want you to leave the mansion.

143
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,420
That's why I said that.

144
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,420
I want you to stay.

145
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,420
But I don't know martial arts.

146
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,420
I can only stay and run around with you.

147
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,420
Ziyue.

148
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,420
I don't want you to do

149
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,420
what others can do.

150
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,420
You mean the world to me.

151
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,420
Don't say that.

152
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,420
It's good to hear.

153
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,420
It makes me happy.

154
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,420
You don't know martial arts.

155
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,420
But you're smart and smart.

156
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,420
You're kind and honest.

157
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
Take this to exchange for some money.

158
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,420
Thank you.

159
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,420
It's okay.

160
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,420
Thank you, sir.

161
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,420
People are angry with me.

162
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,420
It makes my life colorful.

163
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,420
I'm not as good as you said.

164
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,420
You are.

165
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,420
We've known each other for so long.

166
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,420
We haven't had a proper meal yet.

167
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,420
I asked people to prepare these

168
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,420
for you to apologize.

169
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,420
They're all your favorites.

170
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,420
Mr. Ma said that

171
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,420
there's sincerity in apologizing.

172
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,420
Eat. They're all yours.

173
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,420
You eat, too.

174
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,420
You eat. You eat.

175
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,420
Do you want to eat?

176
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,420
Eat.

177
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,420
The crown prince's illness

178
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,420
is getting worse day by day.

179
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,420
Siyu.

180
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,420
Listen.

181
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,420
I don't like Su Shitian at all.

182
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,420
But he's always pestering you.

183
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,420
Since that day,

184
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,420
he was saved by Wuji.

185
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,420
I always dream about you and him.

186
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,420
That's why I went to see a doctor.

187
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,420
But Su Shitian likes you.

188
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,420
He even wants to take you away.

189
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,420
That's his fault.

190
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,420
Because you are mine.

191
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,420
Your Highness, you must be drunk.

192
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,420
I'm your bodyguard.

193
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,420
Brother.

194
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,420
In this life,

195
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,420
we must make a contribution.

196
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,420
I...

197
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,420
My wish

198
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:04,420
is to investigate private cases like my father.

199
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,420
In the future, I want to protect the people

200
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,420
and let them live a good life.

201
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,420
Siyu.

202
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,420
Do you have any wishes?

203
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,420
My wish

204
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,420
is the same as yours.

205
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,420
Okay.

206
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,420
For our common wish,

207
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,420
let's drink this.

208
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,420
For our common wish.

209
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,420
Zi Lai.

210
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,420
Zi Lai.

211
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,420
Cheers.

212
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,420
Cheers.

213
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,420
Cheers.

214
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,420
I've been investigating private cases for many years.

215
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,420
Now I'm just a little bit missing.

216
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,420
I have a feeling

217
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,420
that this case

218
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,420
will be solved in the near future.

219
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,420
I...

220
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,420
Siyu.

221
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,420
You're really bad at drinking.

222
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,420
Don't touch me.

223
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,420
Be careful.

224
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,420
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,420
I'm sorry.

226
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,420
I'm sorry.

227
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,420
I'm sorry.

228
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,420
I'm sorry.

229
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,420
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,420
I'm sorry.

231
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,420
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,420
I'm sorry.

233
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,420
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,420
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,420
I'm sorry.

236
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,420
I'm sorry.

237
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,420
I'm sorry.

238
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,420
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,420
I'm sorry.

240
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,420
So,

241
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,420
you were always there by my side.

242
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,420
I want to be with you.

243
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,420
I want to be with you.

244
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,420
I want to be with you.

245
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,420
I want to be with you.

246
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,420
I want to be with you.

247
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,420
I want to be with you.

248
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,420
I want to be with you.

249
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,420
I want to be with you.

250
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,420
I want to be with you.

251
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,420
I want to be with you.

252
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,420
I want to be with you.

253
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,420
I want to be with you.

254
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,420
I want to be with you.

255
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,420
I want to be with you.

256
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,420
The dream you told me about

257
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:59,420
has now become a dream.

258
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:07,420
I'd rather be in a dream.

259
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:15,420
Looking back, I'll follow you through countless times.

260
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,420
The dream you told me about

261
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:23,420
has now become a dream.

262
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:31,420
I'd rather be in a dream.

263
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:39,420
Looking back, I'll follow you through countless times.

264
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:45,420
Looking back, I'll follow you through countless times.

265
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,420
The dream you told me about

266
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,420
has now become a dream.

267
00:16:53,420 --> 00:17:01,420
I'd rather be in a dream.
