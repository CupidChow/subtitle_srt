00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,449
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,208
Ma Ri, no!

3
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:29,258
Over there.

4
00:00:30,057 --> 00:00:31,073
What?

5
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:32,650
(Surgical center)

6
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,037
This can't be.

7
00:00:39,938 --> 00:00:43,778
Please, this can't be.

8
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,878
Please don't let him die.

9
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,518
Please save his life.

10
00:00:54,758 --> 00:00:56,357
Gosh, Ji Young.

11
00:00:57,487 --> 00:00:58,927
Ji Young!

12
00:00:59,457 --> 00:01:01,287
What happened to Pil Seung?

13
00:01:01,427 --> 00:01:03,757
How badly was he hurt?

14
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:05,827
I don't know.

15
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:08,437
He's in surgery at the moment.

16
00:01:08,898 --> 00:01:10,268
Surgery?

17
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,238
What...

18
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:15,637
Surgery? Was he that badly injured?

19
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:18,778
Ji Young, say something!

20
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,207
Honey, please.

21
00:01:20,207 --> 00:01:22,647
Nothing will happen to Pil Seung.
He'll be all right.

22
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:24,578
Come on, Ji Young.

23
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,688
Stop crying
and tell us what happened.

24
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:31,257
The fact that you called us...

25
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,774
means he was with you
when the accident occurred.

26
00:01:34,798 --> 00:01:37,733
How are you unscathed,

27
00:01:37,757 --> 00:01:40,197
and why was he the only one hurt?

28
00:01:40,328 --> 00:01:41,837
I...

29
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:44,968
I was on my way home after filming,

30
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:49,078
but then a loud thump
caught my attention.

31
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:53,677
Director Ko had been hit by a car.

32
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:56,578
No!

33
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,988
- No, it can't be.
- Honey.

34
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:04,334
Sun Young.

35
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:07,304
What happened to Pil Seung?

36
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:10,527
How badly was he hurt
to need surgery?

37
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:12,043
I don't know.

38
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:14,628
I don't know anything.

39
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:17,498
The accident occurred...

40
00:02:18,237 --> 00:02:19,868
while he was with Ma Ri.

41
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:23,037
She said a car came at them.

42
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:25,448
She's crying her eyes out in shock.

43
00:02:25,448 --> 00:02:28,517
She isn't injured though,
so why is he the only one...

44
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:31,017
No.

45
00:02:31,487 --> 00:02:34,588
Are you saying that Pil Seung...

46
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:37,588
got into this accident
while with Ma Ri?

47
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:41,697
He wasn't with our ex-tenant?

48
00:02:41,957 --> 00:02:44,257
My gosh.

49
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,797
Pil Seung and I...

50
00:02:49,138 --> 00:02:51,637
agreed to have pasta together
at a restaurant nearby,

51
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:54,667
so I went there to see him.

52
00:02:56,237 --> 00:02:59,077
He was across the street,

53
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:02,178
and I...

54
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:06,047
crossed it calling out his name.

55
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11,058
But then...

56
00:03:12,288 --> 00:03:15,498
a car came rushing toward me.

57
00:03:16,657 --> 00:03:18,028
I...

58
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:23,438
I stood there wondering
why the car was coming at me.

59
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:27,908
Pil Seung...

60
00:03:28,437 --> 00:03:30,707
called out for me...

61
00:03:30,707 --> 00:03:32,447
and pushed me out of the way.

62
00:03:35,478 --> 00:03:37,248
The car...

63
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:42,188
hit Pil Seung, and he went flying.

64
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:46,927
Honey.

65
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,827
Sun Young.

66
00:03:49,527 --> 00:03:50,857
Mom.

67
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:54,397
Dad. What do we do about Pil Seung?

68
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:56,397
He got hurt because of me.

69
00:03:56,397 --> 00:03:58,337
I shouldn't have wanted pasta.

70
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:00,137
I shouldn't have suggested it.

71
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:03,237
Dad, it's my fault he got hurt.

72
00:04:03,237 --> 00:04:05,047
It's my fault.

73
00:04:07,578 --> 00:04:09,447
Ma Ri, did he get hurt...

74
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:13,218
while trying to save you?

75
00:04:14,247 --> 00:04:15,558
Yes.

76
00:04:16,018 --> 00:04:18,827
Dad, what do we do?

77
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,457
What if Pil Seung dies?

78
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:23,257
Oh, no.

79
00:04:23,628 --> 00:04:26,828
My Pil Seung, no.

80
00:04:26,828 --> 00:04:29,738
Honey, it's all right.

81
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:32,038
Pil Seung will make it.

82
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:34,608
He'll be all right.

83
00:04:34,777 --> 00:04:37,078
Our son Pil Seung won't die,

84
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:40,847
so please don't say such things.

85
00:04:41,277 --> 00:04:44,748
My poor Pil Seung.

86
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:47,988
Goodness.

87
00:04:48,618 --> 00:04:51,757
Ji Young, have you had dinner?

88
00:04:52,388 --> 00:04:53,887
You have?

89
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,157
You'll be home late?

90
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:58,244
Okay.

91
00:04:58,268 --> 00:05:00,474
Don't you worry about me.

92
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:03,337
Dong Dong is here
and so is Geum Dong.

93
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:06,407
Okay. Bye.

94
00:05:07,368 --> 00:05:08,813
Ji Young can't come home tonight?

95
00:05:08,837 --> 00:05:12,707
No. Something important came up,
so she'll come home late.

96
00:05:13,248 --> 00:05:15,277
She told us to eat without her
and then go to bed.

97
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:19,548
Eat before the noodles
get cold and soggy.

98
00:05:21,558 --> 00:05:26,027
My sweet babies.

99
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,727
Mom, your kalguksu is the best.

100
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:33,167
And the geotjeori is exquisite.
It's incredible.

101
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,498
- Is it?
- Yes.

102
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,538
Eat all you want, Geum Dong.

103
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:43,313
So, Dong Dong, why don't you look...

104
00:05:43,337 --> 00:05:46,154
as pretty as you used to?

105
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:50,523
You're not even 30 yet,
so why do you look so haggard?

106
00:05:50,547 --> 00:05:53,017
You'll never get married
looking like that.

107
00:05:56,518 --> 00:05:57,918
Mom.

108
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:01,498
I won't get married.
I'm sick and tired of men.

109
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:03,957
I'll live here with you
for the rest of my life.

110
00:06:03,957 --> 00:06:07,097
I'm fine as long as I have you, Mom.

111
00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:09,697
What? Why?

112
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:11,967
Because you're ugly?

113
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:13,813
Don't worry about that.

114
00:06:13,837 --> 00:06:16,738
You can still marry
even if you're ugly.

115
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:21,378
Shouldn't you have kids
like almost everyone else?

116
00:06:21,777 --> 00:06:24,647
Mom, you might as well give up hope.

117
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:29,063
She's too old to have kids.

118
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:33,457
There's nothing wrong with her.
Why would you say that about her?

119
00:06:34,188 --> 00:06:37,027
Mom. I'll find someone...

120
00:06:37,457 --> 00:06:40,467
and have children too.

121
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,967
Don't worry and finish your meal.

122
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:47,068
Okay, I will.
Eat as much as you can, Dong Dong.

123
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:56,077
Yes.

124
00:06:56,618 --> 00:06:58,717
I understand.

125
00:06:58,888 --> 00:07:01,318
Call as soon as
you catch the culprit.

126
00:07:02,118 --> 00:07:03,418
Bye.

127
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:11,928
What did he say?

128
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:14,068
Did they catch
the hit-and-run driver?

129
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,544
Not yet.

130
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,174
They're getting witness statements.

131
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:19,544
We must find them.

132
00:07:19,568 --> 00:07:21,707
We must find them whatever it takes.

133
00:07:21,977 --> 00:07:24,883
We must catch
whoever did this to Pil Seung.

134
00:07:24,907 --> 00:07:27,108
Yes. He'll be caught.

135
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:33,647
Doctor. How is my son?

136
00:07:33,818 --> 00:07:37,918
The head injury wasn't bad,
and we sutured the laceration.

137
00:07:38,118 --> 00:07:42,657
His intestines were badly ruptured
which is why we took so long.

138
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:46,128
We must wait and see how he does.

139
00:07:46,428 --> 00:07:48,197
Tonight will be crucial.

140
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:52,637
You said the surgery went well.

141
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:54,914
Why would tonight be crucial?

142
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:58,678
Are you saying
something could go wrong?

143
00:07:59,008 --> 00:08:00,424
Please say that's not true.

144
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,623
Let's see how he does.

145
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:03,947
Oh, dear.

146
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:08,757
- Oh, no.
- Honey.

147
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,488
- Darling. Stay strong.
- Oh, dear.

148
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:15,228
Oh, my gosh.

149
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:31,847
What? Is that true?

150
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:33,447
You stink of alcohol.

151
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:35,924
When will you stop drinking?

152
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,818
Control yourself.

153
00:08:38,587 --> 00:08:41,148
Mom. Tell me all you know.

154
00:08:41,317 --> 00:08:44,663
What? Pil Seung might die?

155
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:46,058
Yes.

156
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:48,798
The doctor fixed
his ruptured intestines.

157
00:08:49,057 --> 00:08:51,503
They say the surgery went well,

158
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:55,197
but it all depends on tonight,
so I guess he's badly hurt.

159
00:08:55,397 --> 00:08:57,873
You can die of a ruptured intestine.

160
00:08:57,897 --> 00:09:00,308
Someone I know died of it.

161
00:09:00,937 --> 00:09:02,937
There's a good chance
he'll actually die.

162
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:04,377
Yes.

163
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:07,407
If the surgery went well,
that's all they had to say.

164
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:09,877
Why say tonight could be crucial?

165
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:13,018
Sun Young must be so worried.

166
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,777
(Hanguk University Hospital)

167
00:10:10,407 --> 00:10:11,808
Doctor.

168
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:13,847
Doctor.

169
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:17,523
How is Ko Pil Seung?

170
00:10:17,547 --> 00:10:19,788
The worst is over.

171
00:10:21,118 --> 00:10:22,487
Is it really?

172
00:10:22,858 --> 00:10:26,003
Then will my Pil Seung wake up?

173
00:10:26,027 --> 00:10:27,358
He'll be fine?

174
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:28,798
Yes, he will.

175
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:30,797
You don't have to worry anymore.

176
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,104
Oh, doctor. Thank you so much.

177
00:10:34,128 --> 00:10:35,467
Thank you.

178
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,477
- My gosh.
- What a relief.

179
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:50,618
Thank you.

180
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:52,964
He's young and has a strong will.

181
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:55,188
He's doing better than we expected.

182
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:58,234
But you can't visit him just yet.

183
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,663
You can relax and return home.

184
00:11:00,687 --> 00:11:02,903
Yes, doctor. Thank you.

185
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:05,898
Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

186
00:11:08,197 --> 00:11:09,938
Thank you.

187
00:11:10,238 --> 00:11:11,697
Thank you.

188
00:11:13,138 --> 00:11:14,714
Thank you.

189
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:16,138
Honey.

190
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,107
Thank you.

191
00:11:21,378 --> 00:11:23,217
Thank you.

192
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:27,987
Thank you.

193
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:37,798
That's so funny.

194
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:51,107
How much does the old woman have?

195
00:11:51,738 --> 00:11:53,277
She rented this place...

196
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:55,577
and gave Ji Young 300,000 dollars.

197
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:57,818
She must have a lot.

198
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,987
Oh, how pretty.

199
00:12:02,018 --> 00:12:05,434
My pretty darlings.

200
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,827
Gosh.

201
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:09,398
Mom.

202
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,327
I made you a cup
of sweet instant coffee.

203
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:14,527
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

204
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:16,438
I'm not doing anything.

205
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:20,238
- Let's see what you're doing.
- No, why would you do that?

206
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:21,878
Oh, my gosh.

207
00:12:21,878 --> 00:12:24,684
What's all this?
It's gold. Goodness.

208
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,084
Is this real gold, Mom?

209
00:12:26,108 --> 00:12:30,818
Of course, it's real gold.
Is there fake gold?

210
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,447
I'm going to...

211
00:12:32,787 --> 00:12:34,023
sell all this...

212
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:36,564
and give it to Ji Young
when she gets married. Give it back.

213
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:39,728
- Hand it over.
- Mom. I deserve one too.

214
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:43,658
No! It's all for Ji Young.

215
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:46,303
I gave you much more already.

216
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:50,337
Ji Young the poor thing
lost her parents when she was young.

217
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:53,714
You're her aunt,
her dad's own sister.

218
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:56,138
You should want to give her more...

219
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:59,247
instead of trying to take
what's hers.

220
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:02,324
I wonder
what your belly's filled with.

221
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,178
I bet it's something like greed.

222
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:17,298
Honey.

223
00:13:19,468 --> 00:13:20,898
Our Ma Ri.

224
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:25,168
What would've happened to her
if Pil Seung weren't there?

225
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:30,607
I get chills just thinking about it.

226
00:13:33,248 --> 00:13:34,877
So do I.

227
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:38,347
That's why...

228
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:43,658
I'm grateful for what he did,
but I feel guilty too.

229
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:49,528
If he hadn't been there,

230
00:13:50,657 --> 00:13:52,398
Ma Ri would've died.

231
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:56,038
If that had happened,

232
00:13:57,397 --> 00:13:59,508
neither of us would survive.

233
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,178
If we lived, we'd be empty shells.

234
00:14:06,777 --> 00:14:08,207
Pil Seung...

235
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,717
saved all three of us.

236
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:15,818
Yes.

237
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:20,487
We owe him way too much.

238
00:14:23,057 --> 00:14:25,197
We can never pay him back enough.

239
00:14:27,897 --> 00:14:29,237
Honey.

240
00:14:31,468 --> 00:14:33,908
I already feel as if Pil Seung...

241
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,077
is my son.

242
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:43,847
Honey...

243
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,398
Honey.

244
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,197
Thank you...

245
00:15:02,797 --> 00:15:06,237
for getting Ma Ri
such a nice brother.

246
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,977
Thank you for giving me...

247
00:15:11,838 --> 00:15:13,377
such a reliable son.

248
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:18,077
Don't say that.

249
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,388
I'm the one who should thank you.

250
00:15:24,218 --> 00:15:26,028
I'm sorry, honey.

251
00:15:28,388 --> 00:15:31,057
Sang Gu, why did you not answer
my calls yesterday and today?

252
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:32,528
I was worried.

253
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,568
Well... I was feeling unwell,
so I was getting some rest.

254
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:37,498
Why? Did something happen?

255
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:40,344
You won't believe this.
Our family was turned upside down.

256
00:15:40,368 --> 00:15:42,008
Ma Ri almost died, you see.

257
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:46,107
Did the chairman's daughter
almost die?

258
00:15:46,608 --> 00:15:47,708
Why? Was there an accident?

259
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,147
Ma Ri was in front of the office.

260
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:51,848
I'm not sure if the driver was drunk
or it was just a hit-and-run.

261
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:54,347
But anyway,
she almost got hit by the car.

262
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:56,917
But Ma Ri's half-brother saved her,

263
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:58,317
and he got hurt instead.

264
00:15:58,317 --> 00:16:00,327
So our family was
turned upside down.

265
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:01,627
Really?

266
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:05,697
What about the half-brother?

267
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:07,468
- Did he die?
- No.

268
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:10,138
His intestines were badly ruptured,
so it was serious.

269
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:11,268
But the surgery went well.

270
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:12,967
He will be moved to a general ward.

271
00:16:13,108 --> 00:16:14,438
I see.

272
00:16:14,868 --> 00:16:17,577
Ma Ri, that brat is so lucky.

273
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,848
She was in a terrible accident
when she was little, but she survived.

274
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:21,607
And she made it
through this one again.

275
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,947
She has had
several near-death experiences.

276
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:29,487
So is the hit-and-run driver
caught yet?

277
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:32,258
It's still under investigation,
but the driver isn't caught yet.

278
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,958
It's taking so long when there are
surveillance cameras everywhere.

279
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,727
I guess the driver is a heinous one.

280
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,104
How could one be so unscrupulous?

281
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:40,867
It's unbelievable.

282
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:47,138
Hello, Mr. Gu. Did you look into it?

283
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:49,908
Yes. I talked to the police.

284
00:16:50,037 --> 00:16:51,477
They say it was an unregistered car.

285
00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:53,247
What?

286
00:16:53,878 --> 00:16:56,118
I thought it was
just a hit-and-run accident...

287
00:16:56,118 --> 00:16:58,123
or drunk driving.

288
00:16:58,147 --> 00:16:59,218
An unregistered car?

289
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,918
So... I hate to tell you this,

290
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:05,788
but maybe it wasn't an accident.
It could be intentional.

291
00:17:06,228 --> 00:17:07,627
Intentional?

292
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:12,468
Ms. Gu, you should quietly
look into it further.

293
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:14,167
Okay.

294
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,177
Was someone...

295
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,278
trying to kill my Ma Ri?

296
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,347
Who would do that?

297
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:32,687
And why?

298
00:17:38,688 --> 00:17:40,758
(Hanguk University Hospital)

299
00:17:46,768 --> 00:17:48,398
("Seoul Lady")

300
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,337
Pil Seung.

301
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:56,407
It's me.

302
00:17:57,107 --> 00:17:58,877
It's Do Ra.

303
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,147
Oh, no.

304
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:04,048
Please help him.

305
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:07,847
Pil Seung, it's Do Ra.

306
00:18:08,148 --> 00:18:09,687
Pil Seung.

307
00:18:11,918 --> 00:18:13,558
What is this memory?

308
00:18:14,787 --> 00:18:17,627
I heard Ji Young was there
when the accident happened.

309
00:18:18,357 --> 00:18:19,827
Is that why?

310
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:23,268
Or is it because I hurt my head?

311
00:18:27,137 --> 00:18:28,568
Yes.

312
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:31,654
The man of miracles.

313
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,208
The luckiest man, Ko Pil Seung.

314
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,647
How lucky.

315
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,718
Stop it. Gosh, it hurts.

316
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:39,047
I heard
your body flew up into the air.

317
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:41,318
It's a miracle that you're alive.

318
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:43,518
That's because
he has led a life of virtue.

319
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:44,934
His ancestors watched over him.

320
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,027
He's right.

321
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:48,258
It's a miracle that you can
leave the hospital so soon.

322
00:18:48,258 --> 00:18:49,928
Those who were
at the scene of the accident...

323
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,674
thought you were dead.

324
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:53,468
It's a relief it wasn't worse.

325
00:18:53,668 --> 00:18:55,937
The filming has been postponed
because of me.

326
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,097
I'm sorry.

327
00:18:57,097 --> 00:18:58,297
Come on, Director Ko.

328
00:18:58,297 --> 00:19:00,867
How can you worry about the schedule
in the midst of all this?

329
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,107
We will resume the shoot
as soon as I get out.

330
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:04,637
So you should rearrange
the schedule.

331
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,548
Okay. I will.

332
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:09,478
Director Ko, you're a workaholic.

333
00:19:09,478 --> 00:19:11,548
Look how he's reading the script
in a hospital room.

334
00:19:11,748 --> 00:19:13,347
You should brace yourselves.

335
00:19:13,347 --> 00:19:15,117
Director Ko's eyes say...

336
00:19:15,117 --> 00:19:17,418
that he can't wait
to go back to work.

337
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:18,857
This is crazy.

338
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,048
Ji Young.
You didn't go that far yet, did you?

339
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:43,318
Can I see you for a moment?

340
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,387
I can't take a photo like this.

341
00:19:50,817 --> 00:19:52,157
Yes.

342
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:09,677
Why did you want to see me?

343
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:13,008
I have something to say...

344
00:20:13,508 --> 00:20:15,107
and a favor to ask of you.

345
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,347
Okay. Go ahead.

346
00:20:20,418 --> 00:20:24,218
I heard you were at the scene
of the accident.

347
00:20:27,488 --> 00:20:28,827
Yes.

348
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,998
I was just passing by.

349
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:34,768
You must've been shocked.

350
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,937
I'm sorry
that you had to see all that.

351
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:48,448
Don't be.

352
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:52,577
I'm just glad
that you recovered your health.

353
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:57,258
That day, did you cry...

354
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,587
and tell me to wake up?

355
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:02,458
I think you said...

356
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:04,897
you were Do Ra.

357
00:21:05,658 --> 00:21:08,768
I'm not sure
if it was a dream or a vision.

358
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,268
What?

359
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:17,337
I was very surprised
and embarrassed at the moment,

360
00:21:17,337 --> 00:21:20,177
so I don't remember what I said.

361
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:23,978
I see.

362
00:21:24,277 --> 00:21:26,718
I would've been the same
if I were you. It was so serious.

363
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:29,047
Anyway,

364
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:32,018
I heard you were the one
who called my family.

365
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,558
Thank you.

366
00:21:35,488 --> 00:21:37,897
It's no big deal.
I just did what I had to do.

367
00:21:39,468 --> 00:21:41,327
Now that I'm feeling better,

368
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:43,198
I want to buy you
a coffee or something.

369
00:21:43,198 --> 00:21:45,438
There's a coffee shop
on the basement floor.

370
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:46,807
There is also a bakery
and a restaurant.

371
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:47,968
Just tell me what you want.

372
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:49,753
No. It's okay.

373
00:21:49,777 --> 00:21:51,877
You're still recovering.

374
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,377
Don't worry about me.

375
00:21:56,518 --> 00:21:58,117
I should get going then.

376
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:00,917
Wait, Ji Young. Gosh.

377
00:22:02,518 --> 00:22:05,387
Director Ko, are you all right?

378
00:22:07,428 --> 00:22:08,728
What?

379
00:22:08,988 --> 00:22:10,327
Are you okay?

380
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,597
I think the wound ruptured.

381
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,998
What? My goodness.

382
00:22:15,198 --> 00:22:18,667
You're not supposed to get off
the bed so suddenly like this.

383
00:22:18,698 --> 00:22:21,107
Why are you being so heedless,
Pil Seung?

384
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,117
Did you just...

385
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,687
call me Pil Seung?

386
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,488
Well...

387
00:22:42,898 --> 00:22:44,698
Did I?

388
00:22:46,527 --> 00:22:48,167
Did I do that?

389
00:22:49,127 --> 00:22:50,437
Yes.

390
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:53,768
You just called me Pil Seung.

391
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:55,468
And you were talking casually.

392
00:22:56,337 --> 00:22:58,437
Well... That's...

393
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:02,547
You said the wound ruptured,

394
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,147
so I just said that in shock
before I knew it.

395
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,048
That's because...

396
00:23:08,418 --> 00:23:12,417
you kept saying
that you'd be my big brother.

397
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,627
I think that's why it just came out.

398
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,234
I'm sorry.

399
00:23:18,258 --> 00:23:21,167
No. You don't have to be sorry.

400
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,798
Now that you call me like that,

401
00:23:25,168 --> 00:23:28,337
I feel like
the wound is closed again.

402
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:30,607
What?

403
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:35,048
Were you...

404
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:38,077
Were you playing a joke on me?

405
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,647
Did you just lie?

406
00:23:41,148 --> 00:23:44,057
No, it's not like that.
It just hurt that bad.

407
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:47,127
I don't think it ruptured though.

408
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:48,887
It was just as bad.

409
00:23:51,698 --> 00:23:52,728
I'm leaving.

410
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:55,468
Ji Young, now that you're here,
please do me a favor.

411
00:23:55,827 --> 00:23:58,167
You're the only one
I can talk to now.

412
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:01,637
What is it?

413
00:24:05,468 --> 00:24:06,808
Gosh.

414
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:09,639
Who knew that fresh air
was sweet and precious?

415
00:24:12,978 --> 00:24:16,348
Ji Young, I'd like to walk.

416
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:18,318
Could you help me?

417
00:24:19,018 --> 00:24:20,294
Are you sure about this?

418
00:24:20,318 --> 00:24:21,788
I should get practicing.

419
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:30,798
Careful.

420
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:38,939
My gosh.

421
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,778
Director, are you all right?

422
00:24:57,958 --> 00:25:01,028
We should probably
get you back inside.

423
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:04,499
It doesn't seem like
you should be walking around.

424
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:06,399
No way.

425
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:09,999
I should exercise like so
in order to run around on set.

426
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:12,068
Help me walk.

427
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:17,239
Sure.

428
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:35,599
Why are you being so heedless,
Pil Seung?

429
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:38,629
Pil Seung, it's Do Ra.

430
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:41,199
She called me by my name.

431
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:45,169
Could she...

432
00:25:46,139 --> 00:25:48,068
have regained all her memories?

433
00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:51,479
No.

434
00:25:52,109 --> 00:25:53,679
If she had,

435
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:56,479
she would've come to me first.

436
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:16,639
My gosh.

437
00:26:17,968 --> 00:26:19,308
Director.

438
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:28,179
Should I just tell him
that I remember everything?

439
00:26:36,488 --> 00:26:37,788
No.

440
00:26:39,129 --> 00:26:40,629
I can't.

441
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:45,598
People could find out I'm Park Do Ra
at any time.

442
00:26:48,968 --> 00:26:50,739
Once I'm done filming this project,

443
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:53,169
I'll leave with Grandma...

444
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:56,909
without telling anyone
where I'm going.

445
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:02,118
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

446
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,249
Thank you.

447
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:10,018
Also, I apologize
for making you worry.

448
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:13,429
Filming had to be canceled,

449
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,499
and that caused a setback.

450
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:18,159
I appreciate
how you didn't complain...

451
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,328
and understood the situation.

452
00:27:21,028 --> 00:27:25,139
I'm good as new now,
so let's get back to work!

453
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,409
- Bravo. Ko Pil Seung.
- Ko Pil Seung!

454
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:29,978
- Ko Pil Seung.
- Ko Pil Seung.

455
00:27:29,978 --> 00:27:31,278
Let's get to work.

456
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:32,778
- Sure.
- Of course.

457
00:27:36,218 --> 00:27:37,578
Wait.

458
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:43,689
Director Ko,
this is jujube and ginger tea.

459
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,729
It's for you.

460
00:27:49,629 --> 00:27:51,699
It's been a while.

461
00:27:54,028 --> 00:27:57,474
Back when you were Do Ra,

462
00:27:57,498 --> 00:27:59,068
you made this for me.

463
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:01,508
I see.

464
00:28:03,008 --> 00:28:04,379
Is that so?

465
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,249
I'll enjoy it.

466
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:09,419
Ji Young.

467
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:14,489
Why are you suddenly
being so nice to me?

468
00:28:19,058 --> 00:28:21,659
You're the captain of this project,

469
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,958
and you need
to be back in full health...

470
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:26,729
for filming to proceed
without any hitches.

471
00:28:27,728 --> 00:28:30,739
Please drink that
and regain your energy.

472
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:40,848
She must pity me
because of the accident.

473
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:45,489
I guess it's better than her
giving me the cold shoulder.

474
00:28:51,988 --> 00:28:53,389
Yes, Chairman Gong.

475
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:56,798
Right. I'm back on set.

476
00:28:59,468 --> 00:29:00,798
Me?

477
00:29:01,968 --> 00:29:04,469
I'll come see you
after I'm done filming today.

478
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:05,939
Sure.

479
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:11,949
What's the important matter
he wishes to talk about?

480
00:29:18,449 --> 00:29:20,024
Ma Ri, are you sure
you're all better now?

481
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:21,788
Yes, that's what I said.

482
00:29:21,788 --> 00:29:23,588
See? I'm perfectly fine.

483
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:26,159
So today, we'll play a game.

484
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:28,974
Sure. The winner will buy patbingsu.

485
00:29:28,998 --> 00:29:31,845
You're on. But I bet I'll win again.

486
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:33,675
We'll see about that.

487
00:29:33,699 --> 00:29:35,315
I let you win that day.

488
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:38,184
As if. You hardly went easy on me.

489
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:40,109
Just you wait and see.

490
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:42,538
I'll make sure
you don't say that ever again.

491
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:44,538
Do Jun!

492
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:49,895
Who's the young lady?

493
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,048
Is she your girlfriend?

494
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:55,419
No, she's just a friend.

495
00:29:58,788 --> 00:30:02,558
Young lady, are you his friend
or his girlfriend?

496
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:06,399
I was his girlfriend
up until a second ago,

497
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,544
but Do Jun said I was only a friend.

498
00:30:09,568 --> 00:30:10,969
I guess that makes me just a friend.

499
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:12,514
I'm heading home first.

500
00:30:12,538 --> 00:30:14,038
Ma Ri, wait.

501
00:30:16,738 --> 00:30:18,879
Would it have killed you
to just walk past me?

502
00:30:19,508 --> 00:30:21,778
- I'll get going.
- Do Jun, wait.

503
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,278
Ma Ri!

504
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:25,749
She has a pretty face,

505
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:29,118
but there's something off about her.
She's cheeky too.

506
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:32,389
Why is Do Jun dating
a girl like her?

507
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:44,169
Come in.

508
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:46,868
CEO Ko.

509
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:48,709
Come on in.

510
00:30:50,738 --> 00:30:52,385
Why don't you have a seat?

511
00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:53,749
Sure.

512
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:01,118
How are you feeling?

513
00:31:01,548 --> 00:31:02,958
Why didn't you stay longer
at the hospital?

514
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:05,459
Are you sure
about coming back to work so soon?

515
00:31:07,258 --> 00:31:09,598
It was actually harder for me
to stay at the hospital.

516
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,258
I'd rather be working.

517
00:31:14,528 --> 00:31:15,999
You remind me...

518
00:31:16,699 --> 00:31:18,739
of how I was as a young man.

519
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:22,639
I spent my years
infatuated with my work as well.

520
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,249
Right, I see.

521
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:31,018
You must be wondering
why I asked to see you...

522
00:31:31,248 --> 00:31:35,118
when you just got back to work
after leaving the hospital.

523
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:40,788
I want to talk about something
that will affect my future,

524
00:31:42,258 --> 00:31:44,098
my family's,

525
00:31:45,498 --> 00:31:48,669
your family's, and also yours.

526
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:54,008
What is this about?

527
00:31:56,579 --> 00:31:58,338
I'll cut right to the chase.

528
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:02,149
I'd like you...

529
00:32:03,619 --> 00:32:05,249
to be...

530
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:09,419
a true brother to Ma Ri.

531
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:16,229
I already believe
I've taken on that role.

532
00:32:17,998 --> 00:32:21,499
That means you'll also be my son.

533
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:25,669
Sorry?

534
00:32:27,768 --> 00:32:29,108
I want you...

535
00:32:30,508 --> 00:32:33,348
to be my son.

536
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:40,719
Ma Ri's my sister,

537
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:44,358
so I think of you
as a father figure too.

538
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:47,959
Then,

539
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:51,328
if that's how you truly feel,

540
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:55,338
be my adopted son.

541
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,179
Sir.

542
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:06,048
What do you mean by that?

543
00:33:09,048 --> 00:33:10,348
I want you...

544
00:33:11,318 --> 00:33:14,348
to be my son.

545
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:17,389
The son acknowledged by law.

546
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:28,499
Pil Seung...

547
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:30,768
turned you down?

548
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:35,709
I must've caught him off guard
with the sudden offer.

549
00:33:36,778 --> 00:33:38,078
Of course.

550
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:41,949
You suggested something
that has never crossed his mind.

551
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,489
Why don't you meet with him
and try to convince him otherwise?

552
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,719
To move forward,

553
00:33:50,258 --> 00:33:52,434
Pil Seung has to agree on it first.

554
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:55,798
Only that way will I be able
to discuss the matter...

555
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:58,058
with his parents and proceed.

556
00:33:58,228 --> 00:33:59,528
Chairman Gong!

557
00:34:00,068 --> 00:34:01,899
I had my doubts,

558
00:34:01,899 --> 00:34:04,169
but how could you do this to us?

559
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:05,968
Chairman Gong, I mean Jin Taek.

560
00:34:05,968 --> 00:34:08,454
How can you accept Pil Seung
when he's not family...

561
00:34:08,478 --> 00:34:11,379
but kick my Jin Dan to the curb?

562
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:13,778
Let's say that Pil Seung
accepts your offer...

563
00:34:13,778 --> 00:34:15,778
and wants to become
your adopted son.

564
00:34:15,778 --> 00:34:18,278
Will you hand APP Group over to him?

565
00:34:18,278 --> 00:34:19,749
Is that it?

566
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:23,689
Who's giving who what?

567
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:25,889
What are you talking about?

568
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:28,528
Auntie, before,

569
00:34:28,528 --> 00:34:32,068
I thought
that he said it out of spite...

570
00:34:32,068 --> 00:34:34,774
because Jin Dan's fiancĂ©e
broke off the engagement.

571
00:34:34,798 --> 00:34:38,068
But Chairman Gong
met with Pil Seung...

572
00:34:38,068 --> 00:34:40,968
and asked him
to be his son on paper.

573
00:34:42,738 --> 00:34:45,339
Chairman Gong, is this true?

574
00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:48,509
Yes, it's true.

575
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:52,118
I will have Pil Seung
be my adopted son.

576
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:55,459
You're speaking nonsense.

577
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:59,158
That Pil Seung boy
is not related to you by blood.

578
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:02,829
Also, you don't own
everything this family has.

579
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:05,328
APP Group isn't solely yours.

580
00:35:05,398 --> 00:35:07,229
How dare you
make a unilateral decision?

581
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,269
That's right.
This family and APP Group...

582
00:35:11,269 --> 00:35:13,509
are mine to look after.

583
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:16,639
If you have any objections
to my decision,

584
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,854
you are welcome
to go back to the US.

585
00:35:18,878 --> 00:35:20,148
- What?
- Ae Kyo,

586
00:35:20,148 --> 00:35:21,678
the same applies to you.

587
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:24,519
If you're going to question
my decisions for this family,

588
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:26,049
leave this house.

589
00:35:33,028 --> 00:35:34,988
(Goban Restaurant)

590
00:35:35,798 --> 00:35:37,629
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

591
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:41,028
Kim Sun Young, we need to talk!

592
00:35:41,028 --> 00:35:43,274
Gosh, I apologize.

593
00:35:43,298 --> 00:35:44,868
Hey!

594
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:47,138
My gosh. Hong Ae Kyo.

595
00:35:47,508 --> 00:35:49,179
What do you think you're doing?

596
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:51,139
Why are you yelling
at our place of work?

597
00:35:51,139 --> 00:35:52,878
As if I can be calm right now.

598
00:35:52,878 --> 00:35:54,408
Be honest with me.

599
00:35:54,608 --> 00:35:56,179
I bet you talked Soo Yeon into this.

600
00:35:56,179 --> 00:35:58,418
You two have been conspiring...

601
00:35:58,418 --> 00:36:01,024
to take everything our family has
by using Pil Seung.

602
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:03,464
What on earth are you talking about?

603
00:36:03,488 --> 00:36:06,758
Ae Kyo, say it in a way
that I can understand.

604
00:36:06,758 --> 00:36:09,328
Look at you feigning ignorance.

605
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:13,499
You convinced Soo Yeon
to adopt Pil Seung with her husband.

606
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:17,268
What? Adopt him?

607
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:20,209
And why would you mention Pil Seung?

608
00:36:20,209 --> 00:36:22,878
Didn't you and Soo Yeon conspire...

609
00:36:22,878 --> 00:36:24,209
to have Chairman Gong adopt him?

610
00:36:24,209 --> 00:36:25,549
Look here.

611
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,048
Who would adopt Pil Seung...

612
00:36:28,048 --> 00:36:29,419
when he's my son?

613
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:33,018
Is that not the case, Sun Young?

614
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:39,158
Jang Soo Yeon.

615
00:36:40,528 --> 00:36:42,328
What on earth is going on?

616
00:36:43,628 --> 00:36:44,959
What do you mean...

617
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,669
you and your husband
want to adopt Pil Seung?

618
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:53,268
Did Pil Seung tell you?

619
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:56,839
What?

620
00:37:00,949 --> 00:37:02,419
Are you saying...

621
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:07,249
Pil Seung already knows about this?

622
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:09,658
What?

623
00:37:11,588 --> 00:37:12,928
Yes.

624
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:15,698
Did you just say...

625
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:17,729
"Yes?"

626
00:37:22,438 --> 00:37:23,968
Earlier,

627
00:37:24,968 --> 00:37:28,408
I didn't believe Ae Kyo
when she was yapping about it.

628
00:37:28,938 --> 00:37:30,939
How could you
make this decision alone...

629
00:37:31,608 --> 00:37:34,908
without discussing it with us first?

630
00:37:35,918 --> 00:37:37,749
Was this your plan all along?

631
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:40,464
Were you always after my Pil Seung?

632
00:37:40,488 --> 00:37:43,089
No, Sun Young.
That was never my intention.

633
00:37:43,188 --> 00:37:44,964
So please calm down...

634
00:37:44,988 --> 00:37:47,888
and hear me out. Please.

635
00:37:47,988 --> 00:37:50,029
Hear you out?

636
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:52,158
How can you do this to me?

637
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:57,638
You see,

638
00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:02,109
Ma Ri's father and I...

639
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,178
were recently in a car accident.

640
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,408
Fortunately, neither of us
was gravely injured,

641
00:38:08,918 --> 00:38:11,749
but the accident
had Jin Taek worried.

642
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:14,848
If we both die on the same day,

643
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:18,058
who will take care of Ma Ri?

644
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,959
Ma Ri will be all alone,

645
00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:24,198
so who will care for her?

646
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:28,399
Worrying about that
has been keeping him up at night...

647
00:38:29,168 --> 00:38:31,238
ever since the accident.

648
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:36,055
But recently, Pil Seung...

649
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,578
saved Ma Ri's life.

650
00:38:38,008 --> 00:38:39,779
That's why...

651
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:42,919
Jin Taek believes...

652
00:38:43,918 --> 00:38:46,388
that Ma Ri's brother Pil Seung
is the only one...

653
00:38:47,249 --> 00:38:49,858
who can protect Ma Ri
and the company.

654
00:38:49,858 --> 00:38:51,189
So?

655
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,128
Is that why he wants
Pil Seung for himself?

656
00:38:53,128 --> 00:38:54,988
To act as Ma Ri's guardian?

657
00:38:56,059 --> 00:38:57,359
I mean...

658
00:39:00,028 --> 00:39:01,399
I mean,

659
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,399
for saving Ma Ri's life,

660
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:06,609
he should be thanked.

661
00:39:06,968 --> 00:39:10,178
But instead, you want him
as your adopted son.

662
00:39:12,508 --> 00:39:14,908
I was against it at first...

663
00:39:15,548 --> 00:39:17,018
because...

664
00:39:17,249 --> 00:39:19,288
Pil Seung is your son.

665
00:39:20,249 --> 00:39:21,718
But Sun Young,

666
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:26,388
we're not adopting him
in the way that you think.

667
00:39:27,858 --> 00:39:29,999
He'll only be getting
the rights to the company...

668
00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:32,059
and guardianship over Ma Ri.

669
00:39:32,059 --> 00:39:34,069
Nothing else will change.

670
00:39:34,468 --> 00:39:38,238
He will always be your son
and will live with you.

671
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:42,678
So please don't think that we are
stealing him away from you.

672
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:45,138
Sun Young,

673
00:39:45,909 --> 00:39:47,249
this adoption...

674
00:39:47,608 --> 00:39:51,218
can't happen unless you
and your husband agree to it.

675
00:39:51,918 --> 00:39:53,388
It isn't allowed.

676
00:39:53,988 --> 00:39:56,419
I don't want to hear your nonsense.

677
00:39:57,258 --> 00:39:58,988
Let me be loud and clear.

678
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:01,658
Don't covet my son.

679
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:05,899
Pil Seung is my son.

680
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,009
What...

681
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,138
Has Sun Young lost her mind?

682
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:20,849
She was offered
a deal of a lifetime,

683
00:40:20,849 --> 00:40:22,518
so why did she turn it down?

684
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:27,218
Last night,

685
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,288
I was drenched in golden stool
in my dream.

686
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:32,629
Is this...

687
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:35,899
what the dream was implying?

688
00:40:42,098 --> 00:40:44,639
Hold on a second.

689
00:40:44,663 --> 00:40:48,633
They want to adopt Pil Seung
so that he can protect APP Group...

690
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:50,564
and Ma Ri?

691
00:40:51,233 --> 00:40:52,573
Yes.

692
00:40:52,634 --> 00:40:54,334
That means...

693
00:40:54,404 --> 00:40:56,103
he'll be their son
in the eyes of the law...

694
00:40:56,103 --> 00:40:58,514
so that they can legally
give their assets...

695
00:40:58,514 --> 00:41:01,713
and inheritance to Pil Seung.

696
00:41:02,483 --> 00:41:03,789
Why though?

697
00:41:03,813 --> 00:41:07,084
As if it isn't obvious.
They're worried about Ma Ri.

698
00:41:07,253 --> 00:41:08,983
They think that...

699
00:41:08,983 --> 00:41:11,293
only Pil Seung can protect Ma Ri...

700
00:41:11,293 --> 00:41:13,854
until the very end.

701
00:41:13,954 --> 00:41:16,224
To summarize, it's this.

702
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,163
He'll be their son on paper...

703
00:41:18,163 --> 00:41:21,503
and be entitled
to all their assets...

704
00:41:21,503 --> 00:41:23,634
if he protects Ma Ri and the company
until the very end.

705
00:41:23,634 --> 00:41:25,573
That's what it boils down to.

706
00:41:26,804 --> 00:41:28,104
Is that...

707
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,474
what she said?

708
00:41:31,974 --> 00:41:34,883
I was shocked
and upset by the idea...

709
00:41:34,944 --> 00:41:36,943
that I failed
to understand properly,

710
00:41:37,483 --> 00:41:39,653
but I think that's what she meant.

711
00:41:39,913 --> 00:41:43,554
Gosh, that's exactly how she put it.

712
00:41:43,554 --> 00:41:47,254
I heard it with my own two ears.

713
00:41:47,324 --> 00:41:49,194
Mom, are you saying...

714
00:41:49,194 --> 00:41:51,994
you followed her out
and eavesdropped on them?

715
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,663
Mom, you really are a piece of work.

716
00:41:54,663 --> 00:41:58,450
As if that's important right now.

717
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,204
Just stay put, will you?

718
00:42:01,244 --> 00:42:03,550
Hyun Chul, Sun Young.

719
00:42:03,574 --> 00:42:07,273
If Ma Ri hadn't hurt her head
all those years ago,

720
00:42:07,273 --> 00:42:10,820
we would've never allowed this.

721
00:42:10,844 --> 00:42:12,614
But with all things considered,

722
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,523
letting him be adopted
is the right choice...

723
00:42:14,523 --> 00:42:17,124
even though it means
you'll lose him to them.

724
00:42:17,253 --> 00:42:18,470
I guess.

725
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,494
If you only consider his future,

726
00:42:22,324 --> 00:42:25,294
it's best to let him be adopted.

727
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:27,603
Exactly!

728
00:42:27,603 --> 00:42:30,733
Besides, even if Pil Seung
gets adopted by them,

729
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:32,833
he wouldn't turn
his back on you two.

730
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:34,680
Is that the man he is?

731
00:42:34,704 --> 00:42:37,674
If you truly want
what's best for him,

732
00:42:37,674 --> 00:42:40,113
you should let him be adopted.

733
00:42:40,873 --> 00:42:41,884
I'm home.

734
00:42:41,884 --> 00:42:43,744
- Hey, you're home.
- Pil Seung.

735
00:42:43,744 --> 00:42:46,414
- Hey.
- Come and sit with us.

736
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:50,184
What? Why? Is something up?

737
00:42:51,224 --> 00:42:52,623
Hey, Pil Seung.

738
00:42:52,623 --> 00:42:55,170
Is it true that Chairman Gong...

739
00:42:55,194 --> 00:42:58,533
wants to adopt you?

740
00:42:59,733 --> 00:43:01,233
Well, yes.

741
00:43:01,764 --> 00:43:05,303
He asked to meet me at lunchtime
and told me.

742
00:43:06,304 --> 00:43:09,443
What did you say?

743
00:43:09,543 --> 00:43:11,044
You said yes, didn't you?

744
00:43:12,744 --> 00:43:14,073
No.

745
00:43:15,143 --> 00:43:17,414
That makes no sense...

746
00:43:17,813 --> 00:43:19,454
when I have a father and mother.

747
00:43:19,913 --> 00:43:23,383
I voiced my clear refusal
to the chairman,

748
00:43:23,424 --> 00:43:26,030
so don't worry about that matter.
I'm going upstairs.

749
00:43:26,054 --> 00:43:28,093
- My goodness.
- Okay.

750
00:43:28,324 --> 00:43:30,494
What's wrong with him?

751
00:43:30,523 --> 00:43:33,834
Why would he refuse a blessing
that came his way?

752
00:43:34,264 --> 00:43:35,764
Sun Young. Hyun Chul.

753
00:43:35,764 --> 00:43:39,004
Don't just sit there.
Go upstairs and talk to him.

754
00:43:39,773 --> 00:43:44,044
How could he refuse
an offer like this?

755
00:44:00,324 --> 00:44:01,693
Honey.

756
00:44:03,123 --> 00:44:04,494
I was...

757
00:44:05,034 --> 00:44:09,504
I was furious when I talked
to Soo Yeon about it earlier.

758
00:44:09,764 --> 00:44:13,504
It felt like they were taking him
because they were powerful.

759
00:44:15,574 --> 00:44:17,443
But now that I think about it,

760
00:44:18,643 --> 00:44:20,673
like Mother said,

761
00:44:21,183 --> 00:44:24,914
I think we should let him go
even if it means losing him.

762
00:44:27,614 --> 00:44:29,783
To be honest, Pil Seung...

763
00:44:30,424 --> 00:44:32,654
got to where he is now
with his own hard work.

764
00:44:32,654 --> 00:44:34,724
We didn't give him anything.

765
00:44:35,963 --> 00:44:38,134
If he were to get married now,

766
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:42,204
we have nothing
to even rent him a room.

767
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,774
But...

768
00:44:48,074 --> 00:44:50,774
if we were to let them adopt him,

769
00:44:51,674 --> 00:44:54,883
he'd become the heir to APP Group.

770
00:44:55,784 --> 00:44:57,943
He'll have a whole different future.

771
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,334
Pil Seung.

772
00:45:19,304 --> 00:45:22,374
Go and live with them.

773
00:45:25,543 --> 00:45:26,914
Father.

774
00:45:27,543 --> 00:45:29,943
What do you mean? Where would I go?

775
00:45:31,213 --> 00:45:35,023
We think you're capable
of assisting Chairman Gong...

776
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,153
to run APP Group well...

777
00:45:37,424 --> 00:45:39,824
and make a name for yourself.

778
00:45:39,824 --> 00:45:41,193
And...

779
00:45:41,393 --> 00:45:44,564
you can become
Ma Ri's brother and protect her.

780
00:45:48,463 --> 00:45:49,763
Pil Seung.

781
00:45:50,804 --> 00:45:53,133
Let the Gong family adopt you.

782
00:45:54,674 --> 00:45:57,343
Mom. Father.

783
00:45:58,014 --> 00:45:59,874
Even without them adopting me,

784
00:46:00,074 --> 00:46:03,343
I'm already Ma Ri's brother
and Ma Ri is my sister.

785
00:46:03,784 --> 00:46:05,153
Pil Seung.

786
00:46:05,913 --> 00:46:07,914
Think about it again carefully.

787
00:46:08,654 --> 00:46:10,854
Your future depends on it.

788
00:46:12,594 --> 00:46:13,954
Mom.

789
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:17,064
Being adopted...

790
00:46:17,224 --> 00:46:20,494
and taking over the household
and company are different issues.

791
00:46:21,663 --> 00:46:24,463
I couldn't run a company
as big as APP Group.

792
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:30,150
I'm happy and satisfied
with my life and job...

793
00:46:30,174 --> 00:46:31,774
as a drama director.

794
00:46:42,123 --> 00:46:43,423
What?

795
00:46:44,893 --> 00:46:48,994
Ae Kyo went to Mr. Ko's restaurant
and mentioned the adoption?

796
00:46:50,324 --> 00:46:51,664
Yes.

797
00:46:52,163 --> 00:46:54,193
Sun Young was in shock.

798
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,164
She would be.

799
00:46:57,663 --> 00:47:01,474
She could think
we were trying to steal her son.

800
00:47:02,804 --> 00:47:05,114
I'll meet Mr. Ko
and Sun Young tomorrow...

801
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:06,849
and talk to them.

802
00:47:06,873 --> 00:47:09,814
Don't worry too much about it.
Trust me.

803
00:47:11,614 --> 00:47:12,789
Okay.

804
00:47:12,813 --> 00:47:14,153
What?

805
00:47:14,514 --> 00:47:16,254
Jin Taek met with whom?

806
00:47:16,284 --> 00:47:18,293
Your brother met with Pil Seung...

807
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,454
and begged him to be
his adoptive son.

808
00:47:21,094 --> 00:47:23,164
My gosh. How could he...

809
00:47:23,623 --> 00:47:25,033
So what?

810
00:47:25,393 --> 00:47:27,994
What did Pil Seung say?
I bet he said yes.

811
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:30,803
No. He refused point blank.

812
00:47:31,804 --> 00:47:34,233
What? He refused?

813
00:47:35,043 --> 00:47:36,474
He said no?

814
00:47:37,373 --> 00:47:38,550
Are you sure, Mom?

815
00:47:38,574 --> 00:47:40,544
You naive fool.

816
00:47:40,574 --> 00:47:43,559
Who would refuse the right
to inherit APP Group?

817
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:46,513
They're putting on a show
to dupe everyone.

818
00:47:47,014 --> 00:47:49,624
Right? It's for show, isn't it?

819
00:47:49,753 --> 00:47:51,900
Was the car accident a ruse too?

820
00:47:51,924 --> 00:47:55,369
Maybe.
What will you do now, Jin Dan?

821
00:47:55,393 --> 00:47:57,293
Why did you ruin your own chances...

822
00:47:57,293 --> 00:47:59,133
when it was laid out for you?

823
00:48:00,864 --> 00:48:05,204
Mom, if Jin Taek
is serious about this,

824
00:48:05,233 --> 00:48:07,403
do you think I'd sit and do nothing?

825
00:48:07,974 --> 00:48:11,303
I'll call a board meeting
right away.

826
00:48:12,143 --> 00:48:14,414
What? Call a board meeting?

827
00:48:14,614 --> 00:48:15,914
Yes.

828
00:48:16,384 --> 00:48:18,784
If I were to say
Jin Taek wanted to adopt...

829
00:48:18,784 --> 00:48:20,754
the son Soo Yeon he kept hidden,

830
00:48:21,253 --> 00:48:23,159
how would the executives react?

831
00:48:23,183 --> 00:48:26,524
Plus, what does Pil Seung know
about running a company?

832
00:48:26,994 --> 00:48:30,070
Jin Taek wants to leave
the whole group to him?

833
00:48:30,094 --> 00:48:31,494
My gosh.

834
00:48:31,594 --> 00:48:35,633
Mom. Do you think
the executives would accept that?

835
00:48:35,864 --> 00:48:39,073
If things get really bad,
Jin Taek might have to resign.

836
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:41,344
Goodness. You're right.

837
00:48:41,344 --> 00:48:44,604
I am. So tell him to do as he wants.

838
00:48:44,773 --> 00:48:46,373
Pil Seung is from the Ko family,

839
00:48:46,373 --> 00:48:49,914
and I'm the younger son
of the company's founder.

840
00:48:50,043 --> 00:48:52,389
And Jin Taek wants to
hand over the company...

841
00:48:52,413 --> 00:48:55,323
to a complete stranger
from the Ko family?

842
00:48:56,523 --> 00:48:58,924
Mom, even a stray dog
would laugh at that.

843
00:48:58,924 --> 00:49:00,894
Don't you worry.

844
00:49:01,123 --> 00:49:02,700
You're right.

845
00:49:02,724 --> 00:49:05,663
You're the founder's younger son
and a Gong.

846
00:49:05,663 --> 00:49:07,334
Who could replace you?

847
00:49:27,114 --> 00:49:28,454
Welcome, Do Ra.

848
00:49:28,454 --> 00:49:30,284
No. I didn't have a sponsor.

849
00:49:30,284 --> 00:49:32,853
- Excuse me.
- Do you have a comment?

850
00:49:32,853 --> 00:49:35,194
- What happened?
- Explain this situation.

851
00:49:35,194 --> 00:49:37,563
- What's this?
- Any comments?

852
00:49:37,563 --> 00:49:39,494
- Do Ra.
- What were you doing here?

853
00:49:39,494 --> 00:49:41,233
- What did you do?
- Say something.

854
00:49:48,244 --> 00:49:49,604
No.

855
00:49:51,204 --> 00:49:52,774
I didn't do it.

856
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,013
I didn't.

857
00:49:55,183 --> 00:49:58,213
I didn't do that. I didn't.

858
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,224
Who on earth...

859
00:50:11,594 --> 00:50:14,863
Who on earth did that to me?

860
00:50:17,103 --> 00:50:18,874
Who was it?

861
00:50:52,404 --> 00:50:56,573
Even so. How could you
set me up for a sexual favor?

862
00:50:56,873 --> 00:51:00,374
Are you trying to
pawn me off to an old man now?

863
00:51:00,574 --> 00:51:03,814
You're my mom.
How could you do this to me?

864
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,684
What are you talking about, Do Ra?

865
00:51:11,054 --> 00:51:12,354
No.

866
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,593
It wasn't Mom.

867
00:51:15,594 --> 00:51:18,164
She only does things
that involve money.

868
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:22,033
Who was it, then?

869
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:25,434
The creditors?

870
00:51:27,503 --> 00:51:28,803
No.

871
00:51:28,904 --> 00:51:32,343
They can't get their money back
if I lose everything.

872
00:51:34,074 --> 00:51:35,513
It wasn't them either.

873
00:51:37,043 --> 00:51:38,914
My goodness.

874
00:51:39,413 --> 00:51:40,860
You startled me.

875
00:51:40,884 --> 00:51:43,653
Why didn't you make a sound?

876
00:51:44,424 --> 00:51:47,153
Ji Young, I made kimchi jjigae.
You love that.

877
00:51:50,324 --> 00:51:53,794
Ji Young. Where are you going?
You don't work today.

878
00:51:55,804 --> 00:51:57,133
Darn it.

879
00:51:57,733 --> 00:52:00,133
She's so darn frigid.

880
00:52:00,273 --> 00:52:01,974
She acts like I'm a stranger.

881
00:52:02,474 --> 00:52:04,774
How long will this last?

882
00:52:05,174 --> 00:52:07,044
When will her memories return?

883
00:52:09,983 --> 00:52:11,513
It's so upsetting.

884
00:52:14,884 --> 00:52:17,983
(Park Do Ra's sponsor incident)

885
00:52:18,154 --> 00:52:20,954
(Actor Park Do Ra Loses
Romcom Deity Status Overnight)

886
00:52:26,864 --> 00:52:28,304
(She's disgusting. How gross.)

887
00:52:28,304 --> 00:52:30,034
(The quiet one lost control.)

888
00:52:30,034 --> 00:52:31,304
(She's a gold-digger, not an actor.)

889
00:52:43,483 --> 00:52:45,083
(Her engagement to Gong Jin Dan
fell through and then this.)

890
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:46,683
(Was this why
the rich guy ditched her?)

891
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:49,983
Park Do Ra.

892
00:52:50,483 --> 00:52:53,454
You came to me
and asked me to save you.

893
00:52:53,454 --> 00:52:54,794
That's why...

894
00:52:55,893 --> 00:52:57,664
I accepted you
with no strings attached...

895
00:52:58,123 --> 00:53:00,164
when you had so many flaws.

896
00:53:00,733 --> 00:53:02,434
And you are humiliating me...

897
00:53:03,603 --> 00:53:05,903
after everything I've done for you?

898
00:53:08,404 --> 00:53:10,673
Do you think
you can get away with all this?

899
00:53:11,974 --> 00:53:13,974
I can completely destroy you.

900
00:53:14,543 --> 00:53:16,244
Are you sure you won't regret it?

901
00:53:19,313 --> 00:53:21,553
Was that CEO Gong Jin Dan?

902
00:53:27,523 --> 00:53:28,923
Right.

903
00:53:30,764 --> 00:53:33,994
He's the only one
who would do such a thing to me.

904
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:38,974
There's no one else.

905
00:54:08,534 --> 00:54:09,834
No.

906
00:54:10,804 --> 00:54:12,634
If I ask him with no evidence,

907
00:54:12,634 --> 00:54:14,934
I'm sure
he will just make some excuses.

908
00:54:15,674 --> 00:54:17,573
Then I won't get anything,

909
00:54:18,143 --> 00:54:20,374
and he will find out
that I'm Park Do Ra.

910
00:54:32,893 --> 00:54:35,224
I have to find the evidence.

911
00:54:37,123 --> 00:54:38,664
Evidence.

912
00:54:46,773 --> 00:54:48,603
In this matter,

913
00:54:48,603 --> 00:54:52,244
I believe what is important
is how Pil Seung feels.

914
00:54:52,813 --> 00:54:55,274
So I was going to meet him first...

915
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:59,013
and then discuss it with you two.

916
00:54:59,683 --> 00:55:03,224
I deeply hurt you with disrespect
yesterday though I didn't mean to.

917
00:55:03,523 --> 00:55:04,959
I'm so sorry.

918
00:55:04,983 --> 00:55:08,423
It's okay. Please don't say that.

919
00:55:10,324 --> 00:55:13,834
As you heard from my wife yesterday,

920
00:55:14,933 --> 00:55:16,403
I've had...

921
00:55:17,364 --> 00:55:20,204
Pil Seung in my heart...

922
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:24,104
and want to adopt him.

923
00:55:25,074 --> 00:55:28,613
But that doesn't mean
I'm trying to steal him from you.

924
00:55:29,344 --> 00:55:32,854
I just want the two families
to become one...

925
00:55:33,483 --> 00:55:35,624
through Pil Seung.

926
00:55:38,554 --> 00:55:40,923
You never know
what will happen in life.

927
00:55:41,054 --> 00:55:42,539
It's possible...

928
00:55:42,563 --> 00:55:46,064
that my wife and I might die
on the same day and time.

929
00:55:46,893 --> 00:55:48,263
If...

930
00:55:49,404 --> 00:55:51,564
Pil Seung was my adopted son,

931
00:55:52,873 --> 00:55:54,673
he would be able
to protect my Ma Ri...

932
00:55:56,244 --> 00:56:00,073
and take care of my company.

933
00:56:01,273 --> 00:56:02,843
I swear...

934
00:56:04,213 --> 00:56:06,483
that's all I want.

935
00:56:07,683 --> 00:56:09,184
Well, yes.

936
00:56:09,353 --> 00:56:12,554
I guess I had
some misunderstanding yesterday.

937
00:56:12,554 --> 00:56:15,539
So I was like,
"What is all this about?"

938
00:56:15,563 --> 00:56:17,394
I was quite upset.

939
00:56:17,523 --> 00:56:20,963
But now I understand what you mean.

940
00:56:21,264 --> 00:56:24,233
And I can feel your sincerity.

941
00:56:26,474 --> 00:56:28,233
But, you know,

942
00:56:29,503 --> 00:56:32,173
this isn't about our approval.

943
00:56:32,744 --> 00:56:35,544
Pil Seung is against the idea.

944
00:56:39,014 --> 00:56:40,553
Is that...

945
00:56:41,554 --> 00:56:43,254
what he told you?

946
00:56:44,183 --> 00:56:45,494
But...

947
00:56:45,793 --> 00:56:49,994
I'm sure Pil Seung is grateful
for your offer.

948
00:56:50,393 --> 00:56:52,794
And we're also thankful...

949
00:56:53,094 --> 00:56:56,133
that you think highly of our son.

950
00:56:58,933 --> 00:57:01,573
Since it involves
taking care of my company,

951
00:57:02,474 --> 00:57:06,013
I know it would put
a lot of pressure on Pil Seung.

952
00:57:07,074 --> 00:57:08,443
But I believe,

953
00:57:09,313 --> 00:57:11,713
if he starts getting ready now,

954
00:57:12,514 --> 00:57:15,314
he will be good enough
to handle the whole thing.

955
00:57:15,884 --> 00:57:17,254
Pil Seung has...

956
00:57:17,924 --> 00:57:19,894
the potential to pull it off.

957
00:57:21,623 --> 00:57:22,994
So...

958
00:57:23,724 --> 00:57:25,593
I'd like you...

959
00:57:26,563 --> 00:57:29,963
to try to talk him into it again.

960
00:57:47,913 --> 00:57:49,200
What?

961
00:57:49,224 --> 00:57:50,724
That's Mom.

962
00:57:52,994 --> 00:57:55,593
But why is she walking
arm in arm with that jerk?

963
00:57:56,724 --> 00:57:58,024
No way.

964
00:58:06,904 --> 00:58:08,533
Has she lost her mind?

965
00:58:09,273 --> 00:58:12,843
Why would she go out
with that gigolo of all people?

966
00:58:16,244 --> 00:58:17,943
Thank you, Ae Kyo.

967
00:58:18,284 --> 00:58:19,783
Sang Gu.

968
00:58:20,284 --> 00:58:22,983
When I told you to go
to the Philippines the other day,

969
00:58:22,983 --> 00:58:24,983
I gave you some money.

970
00:58:25,623 --> 00:58:28,394
It was a large sum of money,
but did you spend it all already?

971
00:58:29,224 --> 00:58:32,809
I spent it on things that I needed.

972
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:35,604
You did? Like what?

973
00:58:36,663 --> 00:58:38,434
Are you seeing someone else?

974
00:58:38,574 --> 00:58:40,304
What are you talking about?

975
00:58:40,304 --> 00:58:42,704
You're the only woman I'm with.

976
00:58:43,474 --> 00:58:45,104
It's fine if that's not it.

977
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:48,174
I'm sorry, Ae Kyo,
that I asked you for money.

978
00:58:48,174 --> 00:58:50,059
Don't say that.

979
00:58:50,083 --> 00:58:52,814
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

980
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:56,023
But, as you may know,

981
00:58:56,023 --> 00:58:57,924
I'm going through
a difficult time...

982
00:58:57,924 --> 00:59:00,193
because of the issues
about Jin Dan these days.

983
00:59:00,523 --> 00:59:02,863
So I'm thinking, Sang Gu,

984
00:59:03,063 --> 00:59:06,563
that we shouldn't be seeing
each other for the time being.

985
00:59:06,563 --> 00:59:09,033
If someone finds out about us
at a time like this,

986
00:59:09,134 --> 00:59:10,803
things can be really bad.

987
00:59:13,574 --> 00:59:14,874
Okay.

988
00:59:15,003 --> 00:59:16,843
I'll do as you say.

989
00:59:17,744 --> 00:59:18,913
Go ahead and put it in.

990
00:59:18,913 --> 00:59:20,614
(SH Bank)

991
00:59:24,384 --> 00:59:26,153
Hey, you darn gigolo!

992
00:59:28,884 --> 00:59:30,523
You fraud.

993
00:59:30,523 --> 00:59:33,194
How dare you wheedle money
out of my mom?

994
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:35,094
I'm going to kill you.

995
00:59:35,094 --> 00:59:36,594
You darn scumbag!

996
00:59:36,594 --> 00:59:38,224
No, Jin Dan.

997
00:59:39,094 --> 00:59:41,194
You're not supposed to punch him.

998
00:59:41,194 --> 00:59:43,033
You can't!

999
00:59:46,904 --> 00:59:49,004
I'm not supposed to punch him?

1000
00:59:49,744 --> 00:59:51,673
What's the deal with him?

1001
00:59:56,413 --> 00:59:59,153
Sir, I'll be there in ten minutes.

1002
00:59:59,284 --> 01:00:01,814
Yes. I'll wait in the lobby.

1003
01:00:07,224 --> 01:00:09,963
Can you please check the list
of the guests from two years ago?

1004
01:00:09,994 --> 01:00:11,240
I'm sorry.

1005
01:00:11,264 --> 01:00:13,869
We keep the information
for up to a year.

1006
01:00:13,893 --> 01:00:16,333
And even if we have the information,

1007
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:17,904
we're not supposed
to share it with you.

1008
01:00:17,904 --> 01:00:20,133
That is an important matter for me.

1009
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,880
Is there any way
I can get the information?

1010
01:00:22,904 --> 01:00:25,180
I'm sorry,
but it's against the hotel policy.

1011
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:27,244
I'm asking you a favor, please.

1012
01:00:27,244 --> 01:00:28,613
Ji Young?

1013
01:00:31,744 --> 01:00:33,754
What are you doing here?

1014
01:00:36,884 --> 01:00:38,283
Ji Young.

1015
01:00:41,253 --> 01:00:42,664
Wait, Ji Young.

1016
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:46,639
What's the matter?

1017
01:00:46,663 --> 01:00:48,193
It's nothing.

1018
01:00:48,864 --> 01:00:50,403
Why did you come here?

1019
01:00:51,663 --> 01:00:53,604
You're afraid of this hotel.

1020
01:00:54,174 --> 01:00:56,343
You have bad memories of this place.

1021
01:00:56,503 --> 01:00:58,403
You said you didn't want to come
ever again.

1022
01:01:05,183 --> 01:01:06,513
You're right.

1023
01:01:07,554 --> 01:01:09,454
But when I was Park Do Ra,

1024
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:11,654
the sponsor scandal started here,

1025
01:01:11,654 --> 01:01:13,454
and that's why I killed myself.

1026
01:01:14,753 --> 01:01:18,064
I don't remember it now,
but I'm sure...

1027
01:01:18,293 --> 01:01:20,733
that is the last thing
Park Do Ra would do.

1028
01:01:21,933 --> 01:01:23,834
I want to at least clear her name.

1029
01:01:25,233 --> 01:01:26,633
That's why I came here.

1030
01:01:29,404 --> 01:01:32,774
But they wouldn't give me
the list of guests from back then.

1031
01:01:36,944 --> 01:01:39,553
The guest who started
the sponsorship rumor.

1032
01:01:41,683 --> 01:01:43,053
I know who it is.

1033
01:01:44,954 --> 01:01:46,294
What?

1034
01:01:46,594 --> 01:01:48,854
You know who did it?

1035
01:01:49,663 --> 01:01:53,133
You've been having nightmares
and suffering because of it,

1036
01:01:53,634 --> 01:01:56,533
so I was going to tell you
after you regained your memories.

1037
01:01:57,503 --> 01:02:00,673
But since you want to find out now,
I'll tell you.

1038
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:02,774
It is...

1039
01:02:03,704 --> 01:02:05,673
a reenactment actor
named Hwang Jeong Sik.

1040
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:08,213
A reenactment actor?

1041
01:02:10,083 --> 01:02:11,459
He was an actor?

1042
01:02:11,483 --> 01:02:12,783
Yes.

1043
01:02:12,884 --> 01:02:15,354
So you went to see him at his place,

1044
01:02:16,054 --> 01:02:19,553
but he said
he had been paid to do that.

1045
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:21,494
What?

1046
01:02:23,264 --> 01:02:25,093
Where is he now?

1047
01:02:25,494 --> 01:02:28,033
He promised to reveal the truth,

1048
01:02:29,963 --> 01:02:31,803
but he fled to the Philippines.

1049
01:02:33,404 --> 01:02:35,673
We don't know where he is now,

1050
01:02:35,773 --> 01:02:39,374
but my friend who is a reporter
and I are still trying to find him.

1051
01:02:39,543 --> 01:02:41,673
I'm sure he will be caught.

1052
01:02:41,944 --> 01:02:43,644
So, Ji Young,

1053
01:02:44,983 --> 01:02:46,553
Put your mind at ease.

1054
01:02:48,284 --> 01:02:49,923
Director Ko.

1055
01:02:52,724 --> 01:02:55,794
You've been trying to find him
all this time?

1056
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:01,164
Yes.

1057
01:03:03,463 --> 01:03:05,363
Do Ra was framed.

1058
01:03:06,433 --> 01:03:08,673
She wouldn't have done such a thing.

1059
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:11,744
I trust her.

1060
01:03:17,114 --> 01:03:19,553
You should've trusted me
back then as well.

1061
01:03:24,224 --> 01:03:25,360
Ji Young?

1062
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,754
You should've trusted me, Pil Seung.

1063
01:03:30,663 --> 01:03:34,193
I begged for you
to believe what I was saying!

1064
01:03:41,003 --> 01:03:42,434
You're Do Ra.

1065
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:47,090
You're Do Ra, aren't you?

1066
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:49,943
I didn't do such a thing, Pil Seung.

1067
01:03:53,253 --> 01:03:56,153
I told you I didn't.

1068
01:03:57,554 --> 01:04:00,093
So why did you treat me that way?

1069
01:04:00,454 --> 01:04:03,894
You should've believed me
even though others didn't.

1070
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:07,340
You of all people
should've trusted me!

1071
01:04:07,364 --> 01:04:09,704
Why didn't you take my word for it?

1072
01:04:11,233 --> 01:04:13,504
Pil Seung...

1073
01:04:15,873 --> 01:04:19,004
I didn't do such a thing, Pil Seung.

1074
01:04:20,313 --> 01:04:21,974
I didn't.

1075
01:04:25,043 --> 01:04:26,383
Do Ra.

1076
01:04:26,614 --> 01:04:29,300
- Pil Seung, I didn't do it.
- I'm sorry.

1077
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:31,999
- Pil Seung, I didn't do it.
- I'm so sorry.

1078
01:04:32,023 --> 01:04:35,423
- Why did you let me die like that?
- Do Ra.

1079
01:04:36,023 --> 01:04:37,693
I'm to blame.

1080
01:04:39,063 --> 01:04:40,434
And I'm sorry.

1081
01:04:42,463 --> 01:04:43,863
I'm sorry.

1082
01:04:47,034 --> 01:04:48,374
I'm sorry.

1083

(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1084
01:05:25,873 --> 01:05:27,849
Hwang Jeong Sik, was it?

1085
01:05:27,873 --> 01:05:29,543
Why are you looking
for this actor though?

1086
01:05:29,543 --> 01:05:31,083
Ji Young was
visiting the Actors Guild?

1087
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:33,054
Why would Ms. Kim
be looking into him?

1088
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,789
Don't you know
how close-knit this industry is?

1089
01:05:34,813 --> 01:05:36,959
I'm looking into it
and will help you,

1090
01:05:36,983 --> 01:05:38,023
so stay put.

1091
01:05:38,023 --> 01:05:40,400
I'll handle it since it involves me.

1092
01:05:40,424 --> 01:05:42,424
What's going on?
Did something happen?

1093
01:05:42,424 --> 01:05:43,663
Haven't you seen this article?

1094
01:05:43,663 --> 01:05:45,764
How could something
like this happen?

1095
01:05:45,764 --> 01:05:49,079
If you stay by my side,
life will only get harder for you.

1096
01:05:49,103 --> 01:05:50,909
I'm not Park Do Ra.

1097
01:05:50,933 --> 01:05:52,849
I'm Kim Ji Young.

1098
01:05:52,873 --> 01:05:55,104
Park Do Ra died that day,

1099
01:05:55,204 --> 01:05:57,244
and what we had also ended.
