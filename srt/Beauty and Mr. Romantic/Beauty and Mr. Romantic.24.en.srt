00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:07,498
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:10,582
Ma Ri...

3
00:00:10,582 --> 00:00:11,701
(Episode 24)

4
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:16,342
Pil Seung...

5
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:19,781
is your brother.

6
00:00:21,632 --> 00:00:22,912
He's your biological brother.

7
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,482
My biological brother?

8
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:29,892
What do you mean by that?

9
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:32,462
What do you mean?

10
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:36,912
That means I gave birth to you...

11
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,131
but I also gave birth to Pil Seung.

12
00:00:39,912 --> 00:00:42,122
He's your biological brother...

13
00:00:42,122 --> 00:00:44,751
which means you are
biological siblings.

14
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:46,522
That's why you can't be together.

15
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:47,702
Do you understand...

16
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:50,371
what I'm saying?

17
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:56,682
You gave birth to me
but also Mr. Ko?

18
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:01,101
Mom, what are you talking about?

19
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:03,791
Ms. Kim is Mr. Ko's mom.

20
00:01:03,902 --> 00:01:06,272
Besides, if he was my brother,

21
00:01:06,272 --> 00:01:08,392
he would be living with us.

22
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:14,411
Are you that against me liking him?

23
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:16,281
Why are you making up
such a ridiculous lie?

24
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:18,342
Did you think
it would make me give up on him?

25
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:20,652
Why are you treating me
like an idiot?

26
00:01:20,652 --> 00:01:22,822
I'm not an idiot. I'm not stupid!

27
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:24,161
Ma Ri,

28
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:27,441
please calm down
and listen to what I'm saying.

29
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:31,152
You see, I...

30
00:01:32,102 --> 00:01:33,982
I gave birth to Pil Seung...

31
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:36,851
and then gave him...

32
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:39,422
to Sun Young.

33
00:01:39,572 --> 00:01:42,331
That's how he grew up
as Sun Young's son.

34
00:01:44,751 --> 00:01:48,431
You had a baby
but gave it to someone else?

35
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:51,601
How can you give someone your baby?

36
00:01:51,952 --> 00:01:54,542
Why do you keep saying
ridiculous things?

37
00:01:56,622 --> 00:01:57,741
You see...

38
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:01,181
The truth is,

39
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:03,782
I...

40
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:10,292
I...

41
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:12,961
I left Pil Seung...

42
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:15,592
at Sun Young's...

43
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:18,461
doorstep.

44
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:20,801
I...

45
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:24,702
You...

46
00:02:26,122 --> 00:02:29,112
abandoned Pil Seung?

47
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:32,642
Does Dad know?

48
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:35,681
Did you abandon him
without Dad's approval?

49
00:02:36,761 --> 00:02:37,882
Well...

50
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:40,051
Pil Seung's dad...

51
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:42,491
is someone else.

52
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:47,561
My dad isn't his dad?

53
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,961
Before I married your dad,

54
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:55,431
when I was studying in the US,

55
00:02:57,321 --> 00:02:58,871
I had a boyfriend.

56
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:01,472
But...

57
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,012
he...

58
00:03:06,661 --> 00:03:09,051
He went mountain climbing
and died in an accident.

59
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:13,982
I was so sad
and I couldn't stand being alone.

60
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:15,751
So I came back to Korea.

61
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:21,021
That's when I met your dad.

62
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:23,662
I didn't...

63
00:03:25,152 --> 00:03:26,961
want to marry anyone.

64
00:03:27,481 --> 00:03:29,672
I'd just lost the man I'd loved.

65
00:03:31,281 --> 00:03:32,371
Then...

66
00:03:33,351 --> 00:03:36,012
why did you marry Dad?

67
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:40,382
At the time...

68
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:43,181
My family was struggling.

69
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:47,651
Your grandpa had to
run for the National Assembly,

70
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:50,551
but he was almost bankrupt.

71
00:03:52,112 --> 00:03:53,192
I agreed...

72
00:03:54,342 --> 00:03:57,961
to marry your dad if his family
promised to help my dad get elected.

73
00:03:58,212 --> 00:04:00,931
That was when I realized...

74
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:04,271
I was pregnant.

75
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:08,072
Ma Ri.

76
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:11,681
There are details
I can't explain to you.

77
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:14,442
You won't get it.

78
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:15,852
I did what I did...

79
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:20,631
to help my family
and your grandpa...

80
00:04:20,631 --> 00:04:22,417
No. I don't get it.

81
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:25,491
I don't understand
a thing you're saying.

82
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:28,862
Ma Ri.

83
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:37,631
My poor baby.

84
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:39,672
I'm sorry, Ma Ri.

85
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:46,542
I'm sorry, Ma Ri.

86
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:50,082
I feel so sorry for you.

87
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:55,172
Why can't I give her a ride
when we live together?

88
00:04:55,172 --> 00:04:56,451
I asked her to ride with me.

89
00:04:57,441 --> 00:04:59,891
Did you tell Ji Young off
because of it?

90
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:01,857
Shouldn't we?

91
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:03,581
The whole neighborhood
talked about...

92
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:05,431
how you were always riding together.

93
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:08,451
An unwed man and woman...

94
00:05:08,451 --> 00:05:10,321
are always riding a car together.

95
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:12,571
Of course the neighbors
would find it weird.

96
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:16,122
That's why I pleaded with her...

97
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:18,732
with all my heart
that she be careful.

98
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:22,201
I apologize.
I won't carpool with him ever again.

99
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:23,352
Don't apologize.

100
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:25,422
Why should you apologize?

101
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:30,391
Mom and Grandma.
Don't be on Ji Young's case again.

102
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:32,472
If you keep complaining,

103
00:05:32,472 --> 00:05:34,621
she'll feel uncomfortable
riding with me.

104
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:38,131
I'm the one who likes her
and wants to be with her.

105
00:05:39,451 --> 00:05:41,402
What did you just say?

106
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:44,371
What are you talking about?

107
00:05:44,922 --> 00:05:47,071
Didn't you hear what he just said?

108
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:50,362
Pil Seung just said he likes her.

109
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:52,811
That's why he gives her a ride.

110
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:56,082
My goodness gracious.

111
00:05:56,562 --> 00:05:59,152
You're a cunning one, you are.

112
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:01,051
Miss.

113
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:04,172
When we asked if you were dating,

114
00:06:04,172 --> 00:06:06,491
you stared right back at us
and said you weren't.

115
00:06:06,571 --> 00:06:09,742
Did you sneak around
behind our backs...

116
00:06:09,742 --> 00:06:11,931
to ride his car and go out with him?

117
00:06:12,312 --> 00:06:14,482
No. We're not dating.

118
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:17,332
There's nothing between us,
so don't get the wrong idea.

119
00:06:18,722 --> 00:06:20,472
What are you on about, Grandma?

120
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:22,972
Mom and Grandma.

121
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:26,042
Did you tell Ji Young
not to like me?

122
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:33,551
Is that why you avoided me
and said you didn't like me?

123
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:36,321
Why didn't you say that was why?

124
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:38,441
Stop it, Director Ko.

125
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:40,422
How will I look
if you act like this?

126
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:44,592
I think I should go inside.

127
00:06:44,912 --> 00:06:48,832
Ms. So. Ms. Kim.
We're not dating, okay?

128
00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:52,241
Ji Young. Wait...

129
00:06:53,521 --> 00:06:57,042
Are you making all this fuss
because you like her?

130
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:07,082
Right now,
it's one-sided on my part.

131
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:10,121
Don't say anything to Ji Young.

132
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:12,621
What? "Right now?"

133
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:16,032
Are you saying...

134
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:19,431
you'll actually date her
or something?

135
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:24,102
If she accepts me,
I would like to date her.

136
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:27,371
Now that I know she avoided me...

137
00:07:27,821 --> 00:07:29,972
because of Mom and Grandma,

138
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,311
I'll talk to her somehow...

139
00:07:33,032 --> 00:07:34,482
and make her like me.

140
00:07:34,631 --> 00:07:36,712
That's all you need to know.

141
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:39,422
My goodness.

142
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:43,751
Honey. Mother.

143
00:07:44,802 --> 00:07:46,612
What did he just say?

144
00:07:46,612 --> 00:07:48,792
What did I just hear?

145
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:52,182
Why are you acting like
you didn't hear him?

146
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:55,871
He's saying he'll chase
that girl around until she gives in.

147
00:07:56,222 --> 00:07:58,972
Oh, my goodness.

148
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:01,222
You spoiled him rotten growing up.

149
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:04,741
"Our dear Dae Chung.
Our dear Pil Seung."

150
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:07,891
That's how you raised him
and look at what it did to you.

151
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:10,737
It looks like
you raised him for nothing.

152
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:11,881
Stop it, Mom.

153
00:08:16,742 --> 00:08:18,972
Ms. So and Ms. Kim...

154
00:08:18,972 --> 00:08:20,761
asked me to be careful.

155
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:24,332
But now, Director Ko
announced he liked me.

156
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:29,701
How am I to face his family now?

157
00:08:32,352 --> 00:08:33,972
Are you in?

158
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:36,071
Can we talk?

159
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:38,612
Oh, gosh. It's Ms. Kim.

160
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:42,482
I'm coming.

161
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:46,881
- Hi.
- Hello.

162
00:08:47,932 --> 00:08:49,592
Can we come in?

163
00:08:49,772 --> 00:08:50,852
Yes.

164
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:01,481
Would you like something to drink?

165
00:09:01,481 --> 00:09:02,901
No, thanks.

166
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:09,812
Miss.

167
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:12,781
You said earlier
that you and Pil Seung...

168
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:15,041
weren't dating.

169
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:18,212
Are you sure you aren't?

170
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:21,182
Yes. We aren't dating.

171
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:25,722
I wrongly thought
that you'd seduced Pil Seung.

172
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:29,161
I'm sorry I thought that about you.

173
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:31,131
I apologize.

174
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:38,271
It looks like...

175
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:41,741
my Pil Seung likes you.

176
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:46,511
I'm sorry to ask,
but please don't fall for Pil Seung.

177
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:48,802
Even if he asks you out,

178
00:09:48,802 --> 00:09:52,182
please say no. I'm begging you.

179
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:59,521
Pil Seung is my whole life.

180
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:03,462
I'm not saying this
because he's my son,

181
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:07,232
but he's kind, upright,
and did well in school.

182
00:10:07,412 --> 00:10:09,832
He has no flaws whatsoever...

183
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:12,342
Oh, dear.

184
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:15,342
I shouldn't
speak like that around you.

185
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:21,541
I understand what you're saying.

186
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:26,182
Director Ko and I aren't dating,
so don't worry.

187
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:28,722
Ji Young.

188
00:10:29,802 --> 00:10:31,751
I'm so relieved...

189
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,962
to hear you say that. Thank you.

190
00:10:36,711 --> 00:10:38,962
I heard the project
you were working on...

191
00:10:39,312 --> 00:10:41,531
with Pil Seung is coming to an end.

192
00:10:42,382 --> 00:10:43,932
With that coming to an end,

193
00:10:44,152 --> 00:10:46,522
it would be uncomfortable
and awkward...

194
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,302
to keep crossing paths.

195
00:10:48,491 --> 00:10:50,112
If you find a new place,

196
00:10:50,321 --> 00:10:52,881
tell us
and we'll return your deposit.

197
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:55,011
Okay?

198
00:10:57,601 --> 00:10:58,682
Okay.

199
00:11:17,752 --> 00:11:19,401
The number is unavailable.

200
00:11:34,331 --> 00:11:37,092
Ji Young. Are you not picking up
because you're angry?

201
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:39,891
Come outside.

202
00:11:40,512 --> 00:11:41,822
We have a lot to talk about.

203
00:11:42,642 --> 00:11:43,891
And things to explain.

204
00:11:44,981 --> 00:11:46,962
The wind is wafting gently.

205
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:48,261
It's nice and cool.

206
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:50,501
Let's take a walk.

207
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,342
Come outside.

208
00:11:57,662 --> 00:11:59,411
(Developer options,
Media transcoding settings)

209
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,031
I wonder...

210
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:24,432
where Do Jun is and what he's up to.

211
00:12:27,922 --> 00:12:29,011
Gosh.

212
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:31,011
I must become successful...

213
00:12:31,821 --> 00:12:33,881
and bring Do Jun back home.

214
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:38,052
Do Sik, come and sit down.

215
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:43,251
Do Sik. Did you...

216
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:45,412
break up with that old spinster?

217
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:46,741
Are you sure you two are broken up?

218
00:12:46,741 --> 00:12:48,782
That's what I told you. We broke up.

219
00:12:48,782 --> 00:12:50,412
How many times
do I have to tell you?

220
00:12:50,412 --> 00:12:52,682
Do Sik, stop fooling around...

221
00:12:52,682 --> 00:12:54,782
and try to look for Do Jun.

222
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:57,052
You're his older brother.
Aren't you worried about him?

223
00:12:57,052 --> 00:12:58,451
How can you even sleep at night?

224
00:12:58,451 --> 00:13:01,392
Mom, I stay in touch with Do Jun.
I even see him from time to time.

225
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:03,141
What kind of person do you think...

226
00:13:03,691 --> 00:13:04,812
Darn it.

227
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:06,241
What?

228
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:09,682
You see Do Jun from time to time?

229
00:13:10,731 --> 00:13:12,881
Why did you not tell me?

230
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:15,471
You should've told me the truth.

231
00:13:15,471 --> 00:13:17,272
You know how much I miss him.

232
00:13:17,272 --> 00:13:19,791
How could you do this to me?

233
00:13:21,142 --> 00:13:24,391
I was going to tell you later.

234
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:28,161
Still, you can't be like this.

235
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:31,581
Hey, you should call him
and tell him to come right away.

236
00:13:31,581 --> 00:13:33,202
Tell him to come over this instant!

237
00:13:33,552 --> 00:13:35,662
But Do Jun isn't...

238
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:37,871
ready to see you yet.

239
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:39,641
What?

240
00:13:40,662 --> 00:13:42,552
Did Do Jun say that?

241
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:45,452
That's why I didn't tell you.
I didn't want to upset you.

242
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:50,852
Then let me at least
talk to him on the phone.

243
00:13:51,471 --> 00:13:52,991
I want to hear his voice.

244
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:56,891
Fine.

245
00:14:06,091 --> 00:14:08,001
Do Jun, it's me.

246
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:10,762
Hey, Do Sik.
Why are you calling at this hour?

247
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:12,482
Do Jun! Do...

248
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:15,612
Actually,

249
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:18,062
Mom wants to talk to you.

250
00:14:18,062 --> 00:14:20,552
Can you try talking to her
this once for me?

251
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:21,722
Give me that.

252
00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:25,251
Do Jun, it's your mom.

253
00:14:26,871 --> 00:14:30,182
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

254
00:14:30,182 --> 00:14:31,631
So can you...

255
00:14:31,682 --> 00:14:34,552
please move back in with us?

256
00:14:34,552 --> 00:14:38,581
You know how much I miss you.

257
00:14:38,581 --> 00:14:40,602
Do Jun. What...

258
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:43,591
Do Jun? Don't hang up.

259
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,721
- Gosh.
- Do...

260
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:47,442
See? He doesn't want to talk to you.

261
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:49,731
You should talk to him later.

262
00:14:49,731 --> 00:14:51,251
You need to give him some time.

263
00:14:52,902 --> 00:14:55,921
Do Sik, how is he doing now?
What does he do for a living?

264
00:14:57,302 --> 00:15:00,512
Mom, Do Jun looks really healthy,

265
00:15:00,512 --> 00:15:03,631
and he looks just neat.
I'm sure he's doing well.

266
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,652
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

267
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:07,282
He says he's doing fine,

268
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,901
and he just wants us to keep well.

269
00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:17,171
Do Ra and Do Jun.

270
00:15:19,691 --> 00:15:22,712
One died, and I don't even know
how the other is doing.

271
00:15:25,502 --> 00:15:26,651
I will...

272
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:28,601
be sure to get back on my feet.

273
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:30,891
I'll succeed no matter what...

274
00:15:31,002 --> 00:15:33,421
and bring Do Jun back.

275
00:15:35,682 --> 00:15:38,111
- Gosh, Mom. Why are you crying?
- Seriously, I'll...

276
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:39,531
That's enough.

277
00:15:39,912 --> 00:15:41,131
My gosh.

278
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:54,641
Is it good?

279
00:15:55,032 --> 00:15:56,982
Yes. It's really delicious.

280
00:15:58,632 --> 00:16:01,651
But why aren't you having one?

281
00:16:02,071 --> 00:16:04,672
Well... I don't like ice cream.

282
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,812
It's too cold.

283
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:07,362
I see.

284
00:16:09,941 --> 00:16:10,991
Your legs hurt?

285
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:13,587
Do you want me to carry you
on my back?

286
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:14,862
Yes, I do.

287
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:16,131
Okay.

288
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:20,102
All right.

289
00:16:21,121 --> 00:16:23,812
Do Jun, you should study hard.

290
00:16:24,422 --> 00:16:27,881
I will make a lot of money
so you can study abroad.

291
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:31,381
- Understand?
- Okay, Do Ra.

292
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:33,582
- Do Jun!
- Do Ra!

293
00:16:36,272 --> 00:16:38,841
What happened to you?

294
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:40,912
You said you'd be
too busy with studies to come.

295
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:43,062
I said that to surprise you.

296
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:45,512
My baby brother.

297
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:47,562
- I missed you so much.
- My gosh.

298
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:53,802
Do Jun, you know
who I earn all this money for.

299
00:16:58,162 --> 00:16:59,212
Do Ra.

300
00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:01,612
I'm a fool.

301
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,921
I didn't even know
you liked ice cream...

302
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:08,251
until I grew up.

303
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:38,411
No, it shouldn't be happening.

304
00:17:39,131 --> 00:17:40,322
Pil Seung...

305
00:17:41,032 --> 00:17:43,191
The baby is crying in fear.

306
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:44,752
That's just not right.

307
00:17:46,312 --> 00:17:47,391
How could she do that?

308
00:17:48,472 --> 00:17:51,332
How...
How could she do such a thing?

309
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:17,322
What? Ma Ri.

310
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:19,391
What's wrong, Ma Ri?

311
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:24,461
I don't like you, Mom.

312
00:18:25,341 --> 00:18:27,661
I hate you, Mom.

313
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:32,002
I can never forgive you.

314
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:36,411
I will hate you until I die.

315
00:18:37,762 --> 00:18:40,381
I'm scared of you.

316
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:43,661
I really...

317
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:46,002
hate you, Mom!

318
00:18:46,002 --> 00:18:47,052
Ma Ri.

319
00:18:48,032 --> 00:18:50,772
My gosh. Ma Ri!

320
00:18:50,772 --> 00:18:52,571
- Ma Ri.
- Ma Ri.

321
00:18:52,571 --> 00:18:56,042
- Ma Ri!
- Ma Ri.

322
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:57,341
- Ma Ri.
- Ma Ri.

323
00:18:57,341 --> 00:18:58,681
- My gosh.
- Ma Ri.

324
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:00,181
- What do we do?
- What's wrong with her?

325
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,862
- Ma Ri.
- Ma Ri!

326
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:14,342
It looks like
she was in quite a shock.

327
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:18,711
I got her some tranquilizer,
so she will be fine.

328
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:22,151
We better keep an eye on her
for the time being.

329
00:19:23,302 --> 00:19:25,002
Thank you, Dr. Kim.

330
00:19:25,002 --> 00:19:26,522
Thank you. All right then.

331
00:19:57,671 --> 00:19:58,792
I'm sorry.

332
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:02,431
I feel really bad for you.

333
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:08,802
You know Ma Ri is different
from other girls.

334
00:20:09,821 --> 00:20:12,542
I understand she did something
she shouldn't be doing.

335
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:15,842
And she caused Sun Young's family
a lot of trouble.

336
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:19,612
But you were being too harsh on her.

337
00:20:20,591 --> 00:20:22,752
How could you slap her
in the face like that?

338
00:20:23,631 --> 00:20:25,411
You didn't have to be so emotional.

339
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:30,822
We've never hit Ma Ri
while raising her.

340
00:20:31,802 --> 00:20:33,492
And she got slapped in the face.

341
00:20:36,012 --> 00:20:37,931
I mean, by you of all people.

342
00:20:38,942 --> 00:20:40,302
I understand
why she's being like this.

343
00:20:46,952 --> 00:20:48,302
Still, I believe...

344
00:20:49,161 --> 00:20:51,742
Ma Ri will be fine. Don't worry.

345
00:20:52,861 --> 00:20:54,282
I'll come home after the meeting.

346
00:20:56,401 --> 00:20:59,782
If something's wrong with Ma Ri,
call me immediately.

347
00:21:02,272 --> 00:21:03,352
I'll see you later.

348
00:21:45,936 --> 00:21:47,726
Ma Ri, when did you get up?

349
00:21:48,977 --> 00:21:50,726
You should've called for me.

350
00:21:54,077 --> 00:21:55,226
Are you feeling better?

351
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:03,807
Ma Ri, I made beef porridge,
your favorite.

352
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:05,476
Please have some of it.

353
00:22:05,987 --> 00:22:07,347
You must be hungry.

354
00:22:08,797 --> 00:22:11,416
I searched online yesterday
and found out...

355
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:15,246
that a three-day-old baby...

356
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:18,656
is only...

357
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:21,327
this big.

358
00:22:22,777 --> 00:22:24,627
It's even smaller than Chi Chi.

359
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:30,127
How could you have abandoned
a baby that small?

360
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,307
Ma Ri...

361
00:22:35,116 --> 00:22:37,107
I couldn't even dare
to throw Chi Chi out.

362
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,456
I wouldn't be able to sleep...

363
00:22:40,456 --> 00:22:42,476
if by any chance I lost Ru Ru.

364
00:22:43,827 --> 00:22:47,117
So how could you have
thrown away your own baby...

365
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:50,117
when Pil Seung was so tiny?

366
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:53,926
What?

367
00:22:57,146 --> 00:22:58,196
Then,

368
00:22:58,807 --> 00:23:01,926
after abandoning your tiny baby,

369
00:23:02,846 --> 00:23:05,137
you lived a normal life...

370
00:23:05,946 --> 00:23:07,406
eating well,

371
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,367
wearing nice clothes,

372
00:23:10,626 --> 00:23:11,936
going on vacations,

373
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:16,146
and having a good time
with your friends.

374
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:17,847
How was it even possible?

375
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:22,716
Ma Ri, please.

376
00:23:23,337 --> 00:23:24,416
I...

377
00:23:25,106 --> 00:23:28,127
don't understand
anything you told me.

378
00:23:29,837 --> 00:23:31,357
You did it for Grandpa's sake?

379
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,196
It was to help your family
that was struggling financially?

380
00:23:37,346 --> 00:23:40,067
How can that be a reason
for abandoning your baby?

381
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:44,126
If things were that tough,
you should've abandoned the adult...

382
00:23:44,126 --> 00:23:45,476
and not the baby.

383
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:49,676
Grown-ups...

384
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:52,517
can walk on their own...

385
00:23:52,926 --> 00:23:54,813
and find food to eat.

386
00:23:54,837 --> 00:23:55,946
But babies...

387
00:23:57,267 --> 00:23:59,117
Unless they're cared for...

388
00:24:00,007 --> 00:24:02,686
They can't live unless they're fed.

389
00:24:04,146 --> 00:24:05,496
They'll die.

390
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,226
You're the worst, Mom.

391
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:12,696
Get out.

392
00:24:13,217 --> 00:24:15,966
Get out of my room, Mom.
I don't want to see you!

393
00:24:18,886 --> 00:24:20,077
What's going on?

394
00:24:20,757 --> 00:24:21,906
Ma Ri, what's wrong?

395
00:24:22,426 --> 00:24:24,246
Why are you yelling at your mom?

396
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:25,746
Gosh, Ma Ri.

397
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:27,587
Why are you this upset?

398
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:31,357
But being angry isn't an excuse
to treat your mom this way.

399
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,577
Everybody, leave. Now!

400
00:24:34,577 --> 00:24:36,486
I want to be alone.

401
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:39,396
Gosh, all right.

402
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,867
- Auntie, we should go.
- Goodness.

403
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:03,976
Ma Ri.

404
00:26:05,926 --> 00:26:07,887
I'm so sorry.

405
00:26:10,366 --> 00:26:13,787
It's true that I can't be forgiven
for what I did.

406
00:26:17,906 --> 00:26:18,996
Ma Ri?

407
00:26:21,817 --> 00:26:23,327
I'm sorry.

408
00:26:25,946 --> 00:26:27,607
It's all my fault.

409
00:26:30,057 --> 00:26:31,577
I did the unthinkable.

410
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:38,446
Mom.

411
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:42,347
The person you wronged is Pil Seung.

412
00:26:44,237 --> 00:26:46,737
You should be asking
for his forgiveness,

413
00:26:46,737 --> 00:26:48,186
so why are you apologizing to me?

414
00:26:49,206 --> 00:26:51,127
Say that to Pil Seung instead.

415
00:26:57,817 --> 00:26:58,966
I'm sorry.

416
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:03,107
I'm sorry.

417
00:27:03,886 --> 00:27:05,206
Ma Ri, I'm sorry.

418
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:11,117
I...

419
00:27:13,297 --> 00:27:15,486
love you so much...

420
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,956
that I want to understand you.

421
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:25,226
But I can't understand you
no matter how much...

422
00:27:25,876 --> 00:27:27,297
I think about it.

423
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,027
I see.

424
00:27:29,376 --> 00:27:31,067
I'm so upset...

425
00:27:31,587 --> 00:27:33,297
that I can't stop crying.

426
00:27:37,557 --> 00:27:38,607
I keep...

427
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:42,877
I keep thinking about the baby
crying in his basket.

428
00:27:45,467 --> 00:27:48,146
I feel bad for Pil Seung.

429
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:51,857
He...

430
00:27:52,606 --> 00:27:54,057
deserved better.

431
00:28:17,426 --> 00:28:18,467
Break a leg.

432
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:19,577
- Got it.
- Sure.

433
00:28:29,636 --> 00:28:31,857
Ji Young, why do you keep
avoiding me?

434
00:28:32,146 --> 00:28:34,817
I haven't been avoiding you at all.

435
00:28:34,817 --> 00:28:36,817
You didn't take my calls last night
or text me back.

436
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:38,446
I texted you suggesting...

437
00:28:38,446 --> 00:28:39,597
we carpool to work.

438
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,037
You came to work early
just to avoid me, didn't you?

439
00:28:42,386 --> 00:28:43,487
And once I got to the office,

440
00:28:43,487 --> 00:28:44,987
you stayed in the prop room.

441
00:28:44,987 --> 00:28:46,837
Why are you talking to Jae Dong
and not me?

442
00:28:47,027 --> 00:28:48,547
Who do you like? Me or him?

443
00:28:50,057 --> 00:28:51,547
What are you talking about?

444
00:28:52,327 --> 00:28:53,443
Unbelievable.

445
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:56,186
Never did I expect
this much nonsense.

446
00:29:00,007 --> 00:29:02,787
People will hear you
talking nonsense.

447
00:29:03,507 --> 00:29:04,557
Fine.

448
00:29:04,946 --> 00:29:07,426
We'll talk someplace quieter.

449
00:29:08,517 --> 00:29:09,726
Follow me quietly.

450
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,577
Why do you keep talking nonsense?

451
00:29:21,997 --> 00:29:23,277
I never did such a thing.

452
00:29:23,926 --> 00:29:25,672
More than ever,

453
00:29:25,696 --> 00:29:27,872
I'm talking
with the utmost sincerity.

454
00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:30,396
Are you saying
you were being sincere...

455
00:29:30,396 --> 00:29:32,617
when you told your mom and grandma
that you liked me?

456
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:36,027
That falls into
the category of nonsense.

457
00:29:36,577 --> 00:29:39,226
How would you telling them
about your feelings make me look?

458
00:29:39,706 --> 00:29:41,396
You being sincere alone
means nothing.

459
00:29:42,346 --> 00:29:43,426
Ji Young.

460
00:29:45,487 --> 00:29:47,067
You like me.

461
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:49,966
You also...

462
00:29:50,886 --> 00:29:52,206
have feelings for me.

463
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,307
So why do you keep pushing me away?

464
00:29:58,067 --> 00:30:00,176
If it's because of my mom
and the rest of my family,

465
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:02,216
don't worry about that.

466
00:30:03,037 --> 00:30:05,416
I'll handle them.

467
00:30:06,436 --> 00:30:07,837
So let's not waste time...

468
00:30:07,837 --> 00:30:09,956
being torn or hesitant...

469
00:30:10,777 --> 00:30:11,996
and start dating.

470
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,226
I truly...

471
00:30:16,946 --> 00:30:18,166
like you a lot.

472
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:27,777
Okay, fine.

473
00:30:29,696 --> 00:30:31,176
What you said is right.

474
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:33,617
I like you as well.

475
00:30:34,596 --> 00:30:38,117
But your elders
are right about this.

476
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:41,486
I'm not good enough for you.

477
00:30:42,636 --> 00:30:44,196
You are...

478
00:30:44,307 --> 00:30:46,277
your parents' whole life.

479
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:49,297
So you're wronging them
by having feelings for me.

480
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:53,297
Director Ko,

481
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,637
come to your senses...

482
00:30:56,156 --> 00:30:59,307
and find a cool woman
who is on your level.

483
00:31:05,267 --> 00:31:06,646
Ji Young, to me,

484
00:31:08,636 --> 00:31:10,317
you are the best.

485
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,416
I mean that.

486
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:22,466
Gosh. We can't do this
at our place of work.

487
00:31:23,376 --> 00:31:24,896
Someone might see us.

488
00:31:28,557 --> 00:31:29,867
Let them.

489
00:31:30,317 --> 00:31:31,837
There's nothing wrong about a hug...

490
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,736
between two people
who like each other.

491
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:35,906
We like each other, don't we?

492
00:31:38,727 --> 00:31:39,777
Ji Young.

493
00:31:41,537 --> 00:31:42,887
It wasn't easy...

494
00:31:43,696 --> 00:31:47,117
for us to finally
admit both our feelings.

495
00:31:48,777 --> 00:31:50,087
Don't think...

496
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:52,696
about anything else...

497
00:31:53,906 --> 00:31:56,567
and place your trust in me. Just me.

498
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,936
Can I really do that?

499
00:32:02,956 --> 00:32:04,107
Of course.

500
00:32:05,656 --> 00:32:09,506
All you have to do is be by my side.

501
00:32:11,926 --> 00:32:13,617
My feelings for you...

502
00:32:14,936 --> 00:32:16,317
won't change.

503
00:32:29,176 --> 00:32:30,267
Do you mean that?

504
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:35,567
Are you sure you won't
stab me in the back?

505
00:32:40,557 --> 00:32:42,006
Never will I let go...

506
00:32:43,257 --> 00:32:44,547
of your hands again.

507
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:46,877
Never.

508
00:32:48,396 --> 00:32:49,446
I'll always...

509
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:52,216
be there for you.

510
00:33:17,027 --> 00:33:18,246
Ma Ri.

511
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:21,986
You're keeping me
from going about my day.

512
00:33:22,396 --> 00:33:23,567
I came home today...

513
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:24,737
after only taking care
of urgent business...

514
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:26,456
because I was worried about you.

515
00:33:29,477 --> 00:33:30,787
So please...

516
00:33:32,376 --> 00:33:34,027
can you be less angry
with your mom...

517
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:37,736
for slapping you?

518
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:44,337
The stunt you pulled
at Pil Seung's house?

519
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:48,446
You were wrong to do such a thing.

520
00:33:49,356 --> 00:33:50,406
Right?

521
00:33:51,497 --> 00:33:52,577
Ma Ri.

522
00:33:55,837 --> 00:33:56,986
Dad.

523
00:34:01,537 --> 00:34:03,986
Why did you marry Mom?

524
00:34:07,777 --> 00:34:09,426
Why else?

525
00:34:10,317 --> 00:34:13,137
I married her
because I liked her a lot.

526
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:18,077
Do you...

527
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,546
still love her?

528
00:34:23,697 --> 00:34:25,417
Of course, I do.

529
00:34:26,896 --> 00:34:29,086
I love you and her...

530
00:34:29,266 --> 00:34:32,156
more than anything else
in this world.

531
00:34:34,936 --> 00:34:36,026
Ma Ri.

532
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:40,457
That's why...

533
00:34:42,646 --> 00:34:44,167
I want you and your mom...

534
00:34:45,847 --> 00:34:48,336
to be on good terms again.

535
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:51,257
Seeing the two people
I love the most...

536
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:52,776
upset with each other...

537
00:34:53,987 --> 00:34:56,077
breaks my heart.

538
00:35:00,427 --> 00:35:02,387
Mom's the worst.

539
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,856
I hate her.

540
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:12,796
Yes, I hear you.

541
00:35:14,817 --> 00:35:16,267
She's the worst!

542
00:35:17,076 --> 00:35:18,497
The worst.

543
00:35:18,947 --> 00:35:21,807
How could she upset you like this?

544
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,676
But that's enough.

545
00:35:31,027 --> 00:35:33,417
It's all right, Ma Ri.

546
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:51,867
Do...

547
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:54,836
Do you recognize me?

548
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,276
I've been waiting for you.

549
00:36:00,257 --> 00:36:02,207
I knew we would meet again...

550
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:05,876
like this.

551
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,057
Cut, okay!

552
00:36:20,547 --> 00:36:23,016
- Good job, everyone.
- Good job.

553
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:24,817
You all did a great job.

554
00:36:24,817 --> 00:36:27,117
Good job, everyone.

555
00:36:27,117 --> 00:36:28,157
I deeply appreciate...

556
00:36:28,157 --> 00:36:31,236
the hard work you put in
until the very end.

557
00:36:34,186 --> 00:36:35,726
- Good job.
- You did great.

558
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:36,927
- Good job.
- You too.

559
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:38,697
- You did great.
- You too.

560
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,517
I have some good news to share.

561
00:36:41,297 --> 00:36:44,507
"Don't Lie" will not only air
on our network...

562
00:36:44,507 --> 00:36:48,426
but will also air simultaneously
on the streaming service.

563
00:36:49,706 --> 00:36:50,936
Let's wish
for the premiere next week...

564
00:36:50,936 --> 00:36:52,177
to be a success!

565
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:54,196
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

566
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:56,777
- You all did great.
- Good job, everyone.

567
00:36:56,777 --> 00:36:58,897
- Good job, guys.
- Good job.

568
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:00,897
Good job.

569
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,307
Hold on.

570
00:37:10,558 --> 00:37:11,928
Ms. Baek, what on earth?

571
00:37:11,928 --> 00:37:13,067
That's a better look on you.

572
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:14,878
Why would you hide
your pretty shoulders?

573
00:37:15,297 --> 00:37:18,238
Know what makes you stand out
and use that to your advantage.

574
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:20,067
That's how it works
in this industry.

575
00:37:20,067 --> 00:37:23,858
Do Do, I'm sure you understand
just how much power...

576
00:37:23,977 --> 00:37:25,257
a casting director has.

577
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:27,358
Yes, I'm aware of it.

578
00:37:27,848 --> 00:37:29,728
I'm glad that you are.

579
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:31,147
In this industry,

580
00:37:31,147 --> 00:37:34,748
your work will have been for nothing
unless you can grab opportunities.

581
00:37:34,748 --> 00:37:37,488
You only have to do as I say.

582
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:38,637
Got it?

583
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,007
Sure.

584
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:45,347
I hope the meal is pleasing enough.

585
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,577
- Allow me to pour you a drink.
- Right.

586
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:51,117
Thank you.

587
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:55,688
Do Do, fill their glasses, will you?

588
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,557
What?

589
00:37:58,607 --> 00:37:59,858
Ms. Baek, my gosh.

590
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:02,348
No one asks actors
to pour drinks these days.

591
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:03,827
That isn't necessary.

592
00:38:04,078 --> 00:38:07,988
As if pouring a drink
would wear anyone out.

593
00:38:07,988 --> 00:38:10,367
Do Do, go ahead
and fill their glasses.

594
00:38:14,187 --> 00:38:17,307
Goodness. This is how shy she is.

595
00:38:17,998 --> 00:38:19,717
Let me fill your glasses instead.

596
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:22,468
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

597
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:23,468
Here.

598
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:24,698
Thank you.

599
00:38:24,698 --> 00:38:26,007
Director,

600
00:38:26,007 --> 00:38:28,567
please give me a call
if any roles open up.

601
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:29,628
Sure.

602
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,777
Do Do is not only pretty,

603
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,877
but she's a talented actress
and a decent singer.

604
00:38:34,877 --> 00:38:36,147
She's also quite witty.

605
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,197
I could go on and on
about her talents.

606
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:40,068
Are you also a good singer?

607
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:41,494
Of course.

608
00:38:41,518 --> 00:38:43,888
Would you like to hear her sing?

609
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,277
After dinner,
why don't we sing some karaoke?

610
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:49,677
Sure.

611
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:53,018
Do Do, wait.

612
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,538
You can't just leave.

613
00:38:55,538 --> 00:38:57,598
Not when things are in full swing.

614
00:38:57,598 --> 00:39:01,057
Ms. Baek, this isn't how
I want to be an actor.

615
00:39:02,138 --> 00:39:04,628
- What?
- I hate gatherings like this...

616
00:39:04,937 --> 00:39:06,607
and would rather
keep tackling auditions.

617
00:39:06,607 --> 00:39:10,547
Do Do, once again,
you didn't get a call-back.

618
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:13,348
When will you make it as an actor
only by auditioning?

619
00:39:13,348 --> 00:39:14,988
I'll try harder.

620
00:39:14,988 --> 00:39:16,687
That's what I'll do.

621
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,158
You'll try harder?

622
00:39:18,158 --> 00:39:20,237
Who in this industry
doesn't try hard?

623
00:39:20,857 --> 00:39:23,098
As if only trying hard
will make you a star.

624
00:39:23,098 --> 00:39:25,108
Everyone works their butts off.

625
00:39:25,357 --> 00:39:29,217
Getting noticed by the right people
is how you build a career.

626
00:39:29,297 --> 00:39:30,937
You can't be an A-list star
by doing nothing.

627
00:39:30,937 --> 00:39:32,268
Fame doesn't fall into your lap.

628
00:39:32,268 --> 00:39:35,138
My professor said
all I needed was my acting skills.

629
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:36,188
Hey.

630
00:39:36,738 --> 00:39:38,377
I'm doing this
because you aren't good enough.

631
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:39,607
You aren't a good actor.

632
00:39:39,607 --> 00:39:41,707
I'm not pushing you
just for my sake, you know.

633
00:39:41,707 --> 00:39:43,867
This still isn't how
I want to be an actor.

634
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:45,467
Do Do, wait!

635
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:47,248
You can't just walk away.

636
00:39:47,248 --> 00:39:49,367
Not when I spent so much
wining and dining them.

637
00:40:11,808 --> 00:40:12,898
Gosh.

638
00:40:19,248 --> 00:40:20,737
The air is nice and cool,

639
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,768
the ice cream is sweet,

640
00:40:26,328 --> 00:40:28,978
and the moon
shines in the sky for us.

641
00:40:31,527 --> 00:40:34,378
Isn't it nice to walk hand in hand?

642
00:40:36,538 --> 00:40:38,447
As if that needs to be answered.

643
00:40:44,908 --> 00:40:46,927
Since it has come to this,

644
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:50,898
tomorrow, the day after,
and the day after that,

645
00:40:52,018 --> 00:40:54,568
I'd like to walk with you
hand-in-hand.

646
00:40:56,817 --> 00:40:57,907
You bet we will.

647
00:40:59,158 --> 00:41:01,108
That's what we are.
A couple that walks hand-in-hand.

648
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:14,887
Oh, gosh.

649
00:41:16,277 --> 00:41:19,358
Why are you sitting here like this?

650
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:22,157
Are you waiting for Pil Seung?

651
00:41:22,518 --> 00:41:24,097
Give him a call.

652
00:41:24,578 --> 00:41:26,817
I can't do this anymore.
I'll call and ask...

653
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,018
where they are
and if they're together.

654
00:41:29,018 --> 00:41:31,038
Come on. Can you not?

655
00:41:31,788 --> 00:41:32,907
We're home.

656
00:41:33,428 --> 00:41:35,507
- Hey.
- Hey, you...

657
00:41:35,998 --> 00:41:37,577
Pil Seung. You...

658
00:41:38,058 --> 00:41:39,177
Ko Pil Seung.

659
00:41:40,328 --> 00:41:41,418
Ko Pil Seung.

660
00:41:42,468 --> 00:41:44,148
What are you doing?

661
00:41:44,397 --> 00:41:47,018
Why are you holding hands
in our presence?

662
00:41:47,207 --> 00:41:48,458
Is this a protest?

663
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,057
Ji Young!

664
00:41:50,238 --> 00:41:52,527
Why are you holding my son's hand?

665
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:53,998
Well...

666
00:41:58,547 --> 00:42:00,597
Mom. Father.

667
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,168
Grandma, Auntie.

668
00:42:02,658 --> 00:42:05,878
Ji Young and I agreed to date
starting today,

669
00:42:06,587 --> 00:42:08,277
so please respect her...

670
00:42:08,627 --> 00:42:11,248
as my girlfriend from here on out.

671
00:42:12,468 --> 00:42:14,478
What? As your girlfriend?

672
00:42:14,897 --> 00:42:16,818
Who says she can be your girlfriend?

673
00:42:18,337 --> 00:42:21,117
Ji Young.
What do you think you're doing?

674
00:42:21,768 --> 00:42:23,837
You said
you weren't dating Pil Seung.

675
00:42:23,837 --> 00:42:25,387
You told me not to worry.

676
00:42:25,678 --> 00:42:27,657
How could you stab me in the back?

677
00:42:36,158 --> 00:42:37,237
Ms. Kim.

678
00:42:38,687 --> 00:42:41,438
I'm really sorry
I couldn't keep my word.

679
00:42:42,058 --> 00:42:44,828
I tried really hard
not to fall for Director Ko,

680
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:46,248
but I failed.

681
00:42:46,998 --> 00:42:49,797
I'll be really good
to Director Ko...

682
00:42:49,797 --> 00:42:51,244
and to all of you too.

683
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:54,257
I'll try my best
to make you like me.

684
00:42:55,138 --> 00:42:57,777
And I'll live and work hard
to become a woman...

685
00:42:57,777 --> 00:42:59,257
who is on the director's level.

686
00:43:00,408 --> 00:43:02,998
Could you please accept me?

687
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:06,798
You want us to accept you?

688
00:43:07,187 --> 00:43:09,417
How are we to accept you?

689
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:13,608
You're one shameless lady,
aren't you?

690
00:43:13,727 --> 00:43:15,538
There's nothing more to say.

691
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:18,507
Ji Young.
I want you to move out immediately.

692
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:22,148
Move out right away.
I don't want to see you again.

693
00:43:22,437 --> 00:43:23,518
Mom.

694
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:25,688
You have no right to her room.

695
00:43:26,368 --> 00:43:27,744
As long as the contract stands,

696
00:43:27,768 --> 00:43:29,738
as the tenant,
Ji Young has the right to stay.

697
00:43:29,738 --> 00:43:30,788
What?

698
00:43:31,107 --> 00:43:33,257
Ji Young,
how long was the contract for?

699
00:43:33,707 --> 00:43:35,697
For two years.

700
00:43:36,018 --> 00:43:38,597
That means
you have priority for two years.

701
00:43:39,248 --> 00:43:40,467
So Ji Young.

702
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:43,338
Whatever my mom says,
you don't have to move out. Okay?

703
00:43:45,118 --> 00:43:47,888
How could you say that, Director Ko?

704
00:43:47,888 --> 00:43:49,447
You're upsetting her.

705
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,978
Hold back, okay? Don't go too far.

706
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:56,548
Okay. I won't do it
if you don't want me to.

707
00:44:03,337 --> 00:44:05,337
Ms. So. Ms. Kim,

708
00:44:05,337 --> 00:44:08,147
Mr. Ko, and Myung Dong.

709
00:44:08,147 --> 00:44:10,728
It's getting late.
I'll go to my room.

710
00:44:10,977 --> 00:44:13,268
I hope you show me some favor.

711
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:15,448
Please do.

712
00:44:15,448 --> 00:44:17,268
Sleep well, everyone.

713
00:44:17,618 --> 00:44:19,137
I'll walk you back.

714
00:44:19,288 --> 00:44:20,407
Okay.

715
00:44:21,488 --> 00:44:23,478
- Hey.
- Hey.

716
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:27,648
- Honey.
- Sun Young. Are you okay?

717
00:44:28,527 --> 00:44:31,198
Oh, dear. Darling.

718
00:44:31,198 --> 00:44:33,217
- My goodness...
- What...

719
00:44:38,437 --> 00:44:40,498
My heart's still racing...

720
00:44:41,207 --> 00:44:42,768
and my legs are shaking.

721
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:46,298
I feel horrible
about how Ms. Kim must feel.

722
00:44:46,988 --> 00:44:48,888
I think your grandmother...

723
00:44:48,888 --> 00:44:52,268
and parents are all shocked.
What should we do now?

724
00:44:53,087 --> 00:44:55,478
Ji Young. It's fine.

725
00:44:56,328 --> 00:44:57,648
You did great today.

726
00:44:57,928 --> 00:44:59,347
Keep it up.

727
00:44:59,968 --> 00:45:01,148
Trust me.

728
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:05,588
Okay.

729
00:45:06,308 --> 00:45:09,557
I'll trust in you
and keep going from now on.

730
00:45:12,437 --> 00:45:13,827
Good for you, Ji Young.

731
00:45:41,437 --> 00:45:42,557
Goodness.

732
00:45:47,948 --> 00:45:49,827
Ji Young. What is it?

733
00:45:50,718 --> 00:45:52,494
Something crazy good happened...

734
00:45:52,518 --> 00:45:55,798
and I wanted you
to be the first to know.

735
00:45:56,518 --> 00:46:00,108
Since you're my boyfriend now.

736
00:46:00,687 --> 00:46:01,807
That's right.

737
00:46:01,888 --> 00:46:05,077
If you get good news, your boyfriend
should be the first to know.

738
00:46:05,297 --> 00:46:06,347
What is it?

739
00:46:06,868 --> 00:46:09,818
I just got a call from CEO Jae Dong.

740
00:46:11,498 --> 00:46:13,617
Don't you be shocked.

741
00:46:15,167 --> 00:46:16,327
I'll be...

742
00:46:17,638 --> 00:46:21,298
the female lead
in a one-episode drama!

743
00:46:21,848 --> 00:46:23,768
- For real?
- Yes.

744
00:46:23,977 --> 00:46:25,938
Congratulations, Ji Young!

745
00:46:26,687 --> 00:46:28,668
I'm so proud of you.

746
00:46:31,618 --> 00:46:32,878
My goodness.

747
00:46:33,187 --> 00:46:35,328
Ji Young. I have to go to work.

748
00:46:35,328 --> 00:46:36,857
I'll call when I get off.

749
00:46:36,857 --> 00:46:39,108
- Let's celebrate over dinner.
- Okay.

750
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:43,048
What the...

751
00:46:49,337 --> 00:46:50,458
Gosh...

752
00:46:55,147 --> 00:46:57,248
My goodness.

753
00:46:57,248 --> 00:46:59,768
What did I just see?

754
00:46:59,848 --> 00:47:02,317
We're watching them
with eagle eyes...

755
00:47:02,317 --> 00:47:05,237
and they went and did that
in the garden?

756
00:47:12,158 --> 00:47:14,318
My brother Pil Seung.

757
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:19,387
Thank you for growing up
to be such a great guy.

758
00:47:20,368 --> 00:47:24,358
I'll be a good little sister
from now on.

759
00:47:25,437 --> 00:47:27,228
As of this moment,

760
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:30,668
whatever happens,
I'll be on your side.

761
00:47:34,118 --> 00:47:35,197
Ji Young.

762
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:38,867
I actually felt upset earlier.

763
00:47:39,687 --> 00:47:42,108
What? Why?

764
00:47:42,897 --> 00:47:44,507
How could you forget about me?

765
00:47:45,257 --> 00:47:47,148
Am I that easy to forget?

766
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:50,738
Oh. I'm sorry about that.

767
00:47:50,738 --> 00:47:52,987
A lot has been going on lately.

768
00:47:54,607 --> 00:47:55,887
The conclusion is...

769
00:47:56,477 --> 00:47:59,288
she forgot about me
because she was distracted?

770
00:48:01,647 --> 00:48:02,697
Ji Young.

771
00:48:03,277 --> 00:48:05,768
This is our last meal together.

772
00:48:06,848 --> 00:48:09,137
Did you make up your mind?

773
00:48:10,018 --> 00:48:12,208
About becoming my girlfriend.

774
00:48:12,317 --> 00:48:13,737
Mr. Gong.

775
00:48:14,488 --> 00:48:16,407
I'm so thankful.

776
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:19,257
You thought so highly of me,

777
00:48:19,257 --> 00:48:21,518
and let me pay for your suit
with just five meals.

778
00:48:21,667 --> 00:48:23,887
I'm grateful for a lot of things.

779
00:48:24,797 --> 00:48:28,088
But I must refuse the offer to be...

780
00:48:28,437 --> 00:48:29,757
your girlfriend.

781
00:48:30,437 --> 00:48:31,557
Sorry.

782
00:48:32,238 --> 00:48:33,298
Why?

783
00:48:34,007 --> 00:48:35,728
Do you have no feelings for me?

784
00:48:36,977 --> 00:48:39,637
Then why did you say
you'd think about it?

785
00:48:40,547 --> 00:48:41,687
That was because...

786
00:48:41,687 --> 00:48:44,687
you asked out of the blue
during the meal.

787
00:48:44,687 --> 00:48:46,488
I got flustered.

788
00:48:46,488 --> 00:48:48,978
And I'd agreed to treat you
instead of paying for your suit,

789
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:50,677
and if I rejected your offer then,

790
00:48:51,027 --> 00:48:54,227
it would make
the remaining meals awkward.

791
00:48:54,227 --> 00:48:55,577
I don't believe this.

792
00:48:56,738 --> 00:48:59,818
You strung me along, tested me,
and wasted my time.

793
00:49:00,908 --> 00:49:02,188
Is this a joke?

794
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:05,527
I should be the one to dislike you.

795
00:49:06,178 --> 00:49:07,858
How dare you reject me?

796
00:49:09,848 --> 00:49:10,967
Gosh.

797
00:49:12,888 --> 00:49:14,038
I apologize.

798
00:49:15,948 --> 00:49:18,038
Thank you for everything so far.

799
00:49:19,558 --> 00:49:21,478
If you'll excuse me...

800
00:49:39,908 --> 00:49:41,527
What just happened?

801
00:49:43,277 --> 00:49:44,398
What did she...

802
00:49:45,448 --> 00:49:47,237
do to me?

803
00:49:56,428 --> 00:49:57,777
Come in.

804
00:49:59,428 --> 00:50:00,677
Ms. Hong.

805
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:02,717
Kim Tae Hee sent you flowers.

806
00:50:03,098 --> 00:50:04,148
Goodness.

807
00:50:04,897 --> 00:50:06,117
- They're from Tae Hee?
- Yes.

808
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,458
- I'll put them here.
- Okay.

809
00:50:10,408 --> 00:50:11,487
My gosh.

810
00:50:12,848 --> 00:50:14,197
They smell lovely.

811
00:50:15,277 --> 00:50:17,427
Why did she suddenly send flowers?

812
00:50:21,788 --> 00:50:22,938
Tae Hee.

813
00:50:23,757 --> 00:50:26,777
I just got the flowers.
I was about to call you.

814
00:50:27,288 --> 00:50:28,737
What's the occasion?

815
00:50:28,788 --> 00:50:30,757
I was going to meet Jin Dan today,

816
00:50:30,757 --> 00:50:32,777
but he said you suddenly fell ill.

817
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:35,048
I hope the flowers cheer you up.

818
00:50:35,167 --> 00:50:37,818
Did Jin Dan take you
to see the doctor?

819
00:50:38,598 --> 00:50:40,617
What? The doctor?

820
00:50:41,207 --> 00:50:43,128
What is she talking about?

821
00:50:46,308 --> 00:50:48,358
Mother, is it serious?

822
00:50:48,647 --> 00:50:51,527
Not really. It's just a bad cold.

823
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:55,237
Tae Hee, thank you so much.
I'll call you later.

824
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:01,538
Jin Dan, that brat.
He told Tae Hee that I was sick.

825
00:51:01,587 --> 00:51:02,777
What's going on?

826
00:51:04,957 --> 00:51:06,007
My gosh.

827
00:51:06,227 --> 00:51:08,918
Is he seeing someone else?

828
00:51:18,178 --> 00:51:19,458
Mr. Cho, it's me.

829
00:51:21,007 --> 00:51:22,128
Kim Ji Young?

830
00:51:22,678 --> 00:51:26,597
So are you saying
Jin Dan is seeing this hillbilly?

831
00:51:27,187 --> 00:51:28,737
Well... Ms. Hong.

832
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:31,218
If Mr. Gong finds out
what I've done,

833
00:51:31,218 --> 00:51:33,227
I'll get fired right away.

834
00:51:33,227 --> 00:51:35,587
Mr. Cho, don't worry about that.

835
00:51:35,587 --> 00:51:37,777
I won't let it happen to you.

836
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:40,318
Thank you, Ms. Hong.

837
00:51:40,768 --> 00:51:43,347
Thank you, Mr. Cho.
You're now dismissed.

838
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,228
He's dating someone
with marriage in mind.

839
00:51:50,977 --> 00:51:53,427
Jin Dan, that brat, must be
out of his mind.

840
00:51:57,518 --> 00:51:59,898
My gosh.
Why does that girl live here?

841
00:52:00,018 --> 00:52:01,438
What is going on?

842
00:52:02,448 --> 00:52:05,668
Sun Young. Come on out now!

843
00:52:08,857 --> 00:52:09,978
My gosh.

844
00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:11,947
Ae Kyo.

845
00:52:13,727 --> 00:52:14,998
Ae Kyo, what brings you here?

846
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:17,567
What's wrong?
Why do you look so upset?

847
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:18,598
- Sun Young.
- Yes?

848
00:52:18,598 --> 00:52:20,138
Does a woman named Kim Ji Young
live in this house?

849
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:21,588
Do you know her?

850
00:52:21,707 --> 00:52:24,827
Kim Ji Young? She's a tenant
renting a room in our house.

851
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:27,707
Why are you looking for her?

852
00:52:27,707 --> 00:52:29,147
What? She's a tenant?

853
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:31,317
Are you saying
she's renting the room over there?

854
00:52:31,317 --> 00:52:32,427
Yes.

855
00:52:33,718 --> 00:52:36,367
Hey! Kim Ji Young! Come on out!

856
00:52:36,518 --> 00:52:38,608
Kim Ji Young, come out this instant!

857
00:52:38,857 --> 00:52:39,938
My gosh.

858
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:47,148
Who are you? I'm Kim Ji Young.

859
00:52:48,027 --> 00:52:50,018
- What? You...
- Yes?

860
00:52:55,837 --> 00:52:56,987
My goodness.

861
00:52:57,937 --> 00:53:00,027
It's you.

862
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:02,728
You're her.

863
00:53:03,618 --> 00:53:05,798
Hey, you brat!

864
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:09,147
You darn gold-digger!

865
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:11,757
How dare you try to seduce Jin Dan?

866
00:53:11,757 --> 00:53:13,527
What do you want from him?

867
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:15,158
You darn wench!

868
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:17,857
Why are you being like this?
My gosh.

869
00:53:17,857 --> 00:53:20,227
Who on earth are you?

870
00:53:20,227 --> 00:53:22,768
- Please let go of me.
- Ae Kyo, use your words.

871
00:53:22,768 --> 00:53:24,518
- Stop being like this.
- My gosh.

872
00:53:26,368 --> 00:53:27,768
You darn brat!

873
00:53:27,768 --> 00:53:31,088
Jin Dan is seeing someone
with marriage in mind.

874
00:53:31,578 --> 00:53:34,348
How dare you try to hit on him?

875
00:53:34,348 --> 00:53:37,848
Aren't you too young to sponge off
a man like a gold-digger?

876
00:53:37,848 --> 00:53:41,538
A gold-digger?
What do you mean I hit on him?

877
00:53:41,647 --> 00:53:43,467
I didn't do anything like that.

878
00:53:44,317 --> 00:53:46,627
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

879
00:53:46,627 --> 00:53:48,208
Hey! So this is what you want!

880
00:53:48,627 --> 00:53:50,757
You're following him around...

881
00:53:50,757 --> 00:53:52,857
hoping to get some money
from him like this, right?

882
00:53:52,857 --> 00:53:56,337
Fine. Take this money
and get out of my sight!

883
00:53:56,337 --> 00:53:59,808
But you better
not see Jin Dan ever again.

884
00:53:59,808 --> 00:54:01,707
If you do, I swear I'll kill you.

885
00:54:01,707 --> 00:54:03,257
- Do you understand?
- Ji Young.

886
00:54:07,607 --> 00:54:08,657
Ji Young.

887
00:54:12,218 --> 00:54:13,338
Ms. Hong.

888
00:54:14,147 --> 00:54:15,697
What do you think you're doing?

889
00:54:16,388 --> 00:54:17,857
Well... Pil Seung.

890
00:54:17,857 --> 00:54:20,208
Why are you trying to defend her?

891
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:21,708
This girl here...

892
00:54:22,388 --> 00:54:25,007
tried to seduce Jin Dan
when he had a girlfriend.

893
00:54:25,897 --> 00:54:28,577
I don't want to hear any of that nonsense!
I want you to leave now!

894
00:54:28,797 --> 00:54:30,018
Get out this instant!

895
00:54:30,498 --> 00:54:33,067
Ae Kyo, you should go.
Let's talk outside.

896
00:54:33,067 --> 00:54:34,257
Just go.

897
00:54:40,308 --> 00:54:41,358
Ji Young.

898
00:54:42,547 --> 00:54:43,898
It's all right, Ji Young.

899
00:54:44,777 --> 00:54:45,827
It's okay now.

900
00:54:52,357 --> 00:54:53,438
Ae Kyo.

901
00:54:53,788 --> 00:54:57,457
Is it true that tenant lady
tried to seduce your son?

902
00:54:57,457 --> 00:54:58,457
Are you sure?

903
00:54:58,457 --> 00:54:59,627
Yes.

904
00:54:59,627 --> 00:55:01,918
Otherwise, why would I have come
all the way here?

905
00:55:02,428 --> 00:55:05,038
By the way,
why is Pil Seung being like that?

906
00:55:05,038 --> 00:55:06,588
Why is he trying
to cover up for her?

907
00:55:06,738 --> 00:55:09,437
Is it because
she seduced Pil Seung too?

908
00:55:09,437 --> 00:55:12,277
Gosh, no. Why would you say that?

909
00:55:12,277 --> 00:55:15,257
Hey. You should
kick her out right away. Okay?

910
00:55:18,547 --> 00:55:19,967
What's all this?

911
00:55:20,748 --> 00:55:24,608
What is going on between
Ji Young and Ae Kyo's son?

912
00:55:27,727 --> 00:55:28,878
I can't believe this.

913
00:55:38,598 --> 00:55:41,257
Ji Young, have some warm water.

914
00:55:51,248 --> 00:55:52,697
Are you feeling better?

915
00:55:54,248 --> 00:55:55,637
Yes.

916
00:55:58,618 --> 00:56:00,038
What happened?

917
00:56:01,488 --> 00:56:03,307
Did you meet Gong Jin Dan?

918
00:56:06,428 --> 00:56:08,018
You know what it is.

919
00:56:08,328 --> 00:56:11,598
I ruined his suit,
so I promised to buy him...

920
00:56:11,598 --> 00:56:13,188
five meals.

921
00:56:13,908 --> 00:56:16,777
We had one meal left,

922
00:56:16,777 --> 00:56:20,128
so I ate with him
for the last time today.

923
00:56:21,308 --> 00:56:22,398
So...

924
00:56:23,848 --> 00:56:25,398
she did all that
because you ate with him?

925
00:56:26,118 --> 00:56:27,697
I don't know.

926
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,158
Mr. Gong asked me out,

927
00:56:30,158 --> 00:56:31,917
but I said no.

928
00:56:31,917 --> 00:56:33,627
So I didn't think...

929
00:56:33,627 --> 00:56:36,087
I would have anything to do
with him anymore.

930
00:56:36,087 --> 00:56:39,378
I had no idea
something like this would happen.

931
00:56:40,828 --> 00:56:41,918
Director Ko.

932
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:45,944
Nothing happened
between Mr. Gong and me.

933
00:56:45,968 --> 00:56:47,418
I'm serious.

934
00:56:49,437 --> 00:56:50,657
I know, Ji Young.

935
00:56:51,178 --> 00:56:54,027
I believe what you say.

936
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:56,257
Don't worry.

937
00:57:09,187 --> 00:57:12,397
My goodness. What is this all about?

938
00:57:12,397 --> 00:57:16,067
So are you saying
the tenant lady has been dating...

939
00:57:16,067 --> 00:57:19,117
both Pil Seung
and your friend's son?

940
00:57:19,167 --> 00:57:21,567
Oh, dear. Unbelievable.

941
00:57:21,567 --> 00:57:24,728
I'm at a loss for words.

942
00:57:24,837 --> 00:57:28,458
That can't be it. Maybe
there was some misunderstanding.

943
00:57:28,507 --> 00:57:30,618
Ji Young doesn't like someone
who would do such a thing.

944
00:57:30,618 --> 00:57:33,898
Hey! You can't judge a person
by the way she looks.

945
00:57:34,388 --> 00:57:37,838
She may seem so gentle and naive,

946
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:41,027
but she's sly enough
to seduce a rich man like him.

947
00:57:41,027 --> 00:57:43,237
That means she's really something.

948
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:46,257
Pil Seung is being like this...

949
00:57:46,257 --> 00:57:48,818
because he fell for
such a sneaky gold-digger.

950
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:53,368
Hey, Pil Seung.

951
00:57:53,368 --> 00:57:55,638
I can't let you date that girl.

952
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,308
I was trying to let you
get your own way,

953
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:01,298
but that brat is just horrible.

954
00:58:01,877 --> 00:58:05,027
Grandma,
how could you say such a thing?

955
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:09,338
There's nothing going on
between Ji Young and her son.

956
00:58:09,417 --> 00:58:11,687
So please don't get the wrong idea.

957
00:58:11,687 --> 00:58:13,857
What wrong idea?

958
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:16,237
Are you saying Ae Kyo came here
and made all the fuss for no reason?

959
00:58:16,897 --> 00:58:19,677
Something about her
is really unsettling.

960
00:58:21,067 --> 00:58:24,318
I'm not going to mince words.
You have to break up with her.

961
00:58:25,538 --> 00:58:28,557
Ji Young has nothing to do with him.

962
00:58:29,308 --> 00:58:31,078
They did meet a few times,

963
00:58:31,078 --> 00:58:33,027
but they just ate together
for some reason.

964
00:58:33,647 --> 00:58:37,367
You have to trust me.
And please don't get her wrong.

965
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:39,398
My gosh.

966
00:58:40,948 --> 00:58:43,608
So what's the reason?

967
00:58:44,018 --> 00:58:46,407
Why would she eat with a man
who has a girlfriend?

968
00:58:47,388 --> 00:58:49,957
Hey. I just don't understand...

969
00:58:49,957 --> 00:58:52,847
why we keep renting out
the room to gold diggers.

970
00:58:53,257 --> 00:58:55,328
Sun Young, we should never...

971
00:58:55,328 --> 00:58:58,418
let a woman move in there again.

972
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:10,268
Gong Jin Dan.

973
00:59:11,578 --> 00:59:14,298
Why did he want to eat with Ji Young
when he had a girlfriend?

974
00:59:15,248 --> 00:59:16,298
What?

975
00:59:16,988 --> 00:59:18,668
He asked her to be his girlfriend?

976
00:59:20,488 --> 00:59:21,907
Gong Jin Dan, that brat.

977
00:59:22,757 --> 00:59:25,007
What has he got in his head
to do such a thing?

978
00:59:26,928 --> 00:59:29,368
You crazy brat!
Have you lost your mind?

979
00:59:29,368 --> 00:59:32,987
Why did you lie to Tae Hee
just to go out with that hillbilly?

980
00:59:33,138 --> 00:59:34,837
She's such a country bumpkin.

981
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:36,808
How could you fall for
that country bumpkin?

982
00:59:36,808 --> 00:59:39,507
This is just humiliating!

983
00:59:39,507 --> 00:59:40,628
Mom!

984
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:43,078
Did you meet Ji Young?

985
00:59:43,078 --> 00:59:44,817
Yes, I did!

986
00:59:44,817 --> 00:59:47,298
I was really humiliated
in front of Sun Young.

987
00:59:47,518 --> 00:59:48,587
How could you be
dating a hillbilly...

988
00:59:48,587 --> 00:59:51,137
who's renting a room
in my friend's house?

989
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:55,237
Mom, what did you do to Ji Young?

990
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:57,757
I talked some sense into her! Why?

991
00:59:57,757 --> 01:00:00,397
I said I'd kill her
if she saw you ever again.

992
01:00:00,397 --> 01:00:02,227
- Mom!
- Listen.

993
01:00:02,227 --> 01:00:03,897
Even if that hillbilly seduced you,

994
01:00:03,897 --> 01:00:05,937
how could you
possibly fall for a girl like that?

995
01:00:05,937 --> 01:00:07,437
You stupid fool.

996
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,138
Just end things with her
before Tae Hee finds out.

997
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:10,527
Mom!

998
01:00:10,638 --> 01:00:11,788
Nineteen.

999
01:00:12,507 --> 01:00:15,707
Twenty.
So this is a thousand dollars.

1000
01:00:15,707 --> 01:00:18,647
Hyun Chul,
so how much is this in total?

1001
01:00:18,647 --> 01:00:20,637
Don't talk to me.
You're distracting me.

1002
01:00:21,018 --> 01:00:22,168
- Okay.
- Hang on.

1003
01:00:23,348 --> 01:00:24,407
This is...

1004
01:00:25,187 --> 01:00:27,577
50 dollars short of 1,000 dollars.

1005
01:00:28,227 --> 01:00:31,347
So it's 9,950 dollars in total.

1006
01:00:31,658 --> 01:00:32,708
What?

1007
01:00:32,857 --> 01:00:36,468
Oh, right. I guess
she was offering 10,000 dollars.

1008
01:00:36,468 --> 01:00:40,018
I don't think she brought
9,950 dollars on purpose.

1009
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:44,527
I guess we lost 50 dollars
in the front yard.

1010
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:47,298
But 10,000 dollars
from a rich family...

1011
01:00:47,547 --> 01:00:49,798
seems kind of cheap if you ask me.

1012
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:53,277
Anyway, what should we do...

1013
01:00:53,277 --> 01:00:55,224
with all this money?

1014
01:00:55,248 --> 01:00:57,708
What else? We should
give it back to its owner.

1015
01:00:57,957 --> 01:00:59,038
What?

1016
01:00:59,718 --> 01:01:02,137
But we were the ones
who took the time to pick it up.

1017
01:01:03,058 --> 01:01:04,248
What are you saying?

1018
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:06,177
Are you kidding me, Mom?

1019
01:01:13,607 --> 01:01:14,757
Here you go.

1020
01:01:15,468 --> 01:01:16,827
What is it?

1021
01:01:17,738 --> 01:01:19,337
It's the money...

1022
01:01:19,337 --> 01:01:20,958
Mr. Gong's mother threw at you.

1023
01:01:21,507 --> 01:01:22,757
I picked it up.

1024
01:01:23,248 --> 01:01:24,798
It's 9,950 dollars in total.

1025
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:27,748
She probably threw
10,000 at your face,

1026
01:01:27,748 --> 01:01:30,407
but I can't seem to find
one of the bills.

1027
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:33,237
I didn't keep it,
so don't get the wrong idea.

1028
01:01:33,928 --> 01:01:36,177
Search the yard
if you don't believe me.

1029
01:01:37,397 --> 01:01:38,978
Why aren't you taking it?

1030
01:01:39,897 --> 01:01:41,643
Why should I take it?

1031
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:43,277
I don't need this.

1032
01:01:43,738 --> 01:01:45,717
Should we throw money
in the trash, then?

1033
01:01:45,897 --> 01:01:47,288
Or should I keep it instead?

1034
01:01:48,567 --> 01:01:50,607
The money's yours,

1035
01:01:50,607 --> 01:01:52,927
so do whatever you want with it.

1036
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,498
Miss,

1037
01:01:56,377 --> 01:01:58,597
that is no way to live your life.

1038
01:01:59,448 --> 01:02:00,498
Unbelievable.

1039
01:02:01,848 --> 01:02:03,087
How dare you...

1040
01:02:03,087 --> 01:02:04,907
seduce a man who is already taken?

1041
01:02:13,998 --> 01:02:15,148
Ms. So,

1042
01:02:16,027 --> 01:02:18,688
I did no such thing.

1043
01:02:28,748 --> 01:02:30,767
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

1044
01:02:34,218 --> 01:02:35,298
Hello?

1045
01:02:35,948 --> 01:02:38,608
I'm outside your house.
We should meet.

1046
01:02:46,227 --> 01:02:47,347
Ji Young.

1047
01:02:48,527 --> 01:02:50,248
I heard you met my mom.

1048
01:02:50,998 --> 01:02:52,098
Did she act out of line...

1049
01:02:52,098 --> 01:02:54,788
or say mean things to you?

1050
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:56,977
If she did, let me apologize.

1051
01:02:56,977 --> 01:03:00,188
I don't want
to say anything to you...

1052
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:02,597
nor see your face again,

1053
01:03:03,578 --> 01:03:04,967
but I came here to return this.

1054
01:03:06,578 --> 01:03:07,637
Take it with you.

1055
01:03:09,187 --> 01:03:12,068
It's the money your mom threw at me.

1056
01:03:12,788 --> 01:03:14,788
Never in my life...

1057
01:03:14,788 --> 01:03:17,077
have I been slapped by money before.

1058
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:19,098
What did I do...

1059
01:03:19,098 --> 01:03:20,918
to deserve any of that?

1060
01:03:21,667 --> 01:03:22,727
You tell me.

1061
01:03:22,727 --> 01:03:25,217
There's nothing going on between us.

1062
01:03:25,738 --> 01:03:28,418
So make yourself clear
to your mother...

1063
01:03:28,837 --> 01:03:31,427
that there's nothing
going on between us.

1064
01:03:32,908 --> 01:03:33,998
Ji Young, wait.

1065
01:03:34,707 --> 01:03:36,657
What's your problem? Let go of me.

1066
01:03:36,948 --> 01:03:39,898
Ji Young, I like you.

1067
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:42,398
I can't have our relationship
end like this.

1068
01:03:43,547 --> 01:03:46,608
Please reconsider where we stand.

1069
01:03:49,288 --> 01:03:51,277
Are you in your right mind?

1070
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:54,148
You already agreed
to marry someone else,

1071
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:56,328
so why are you being this way?

1072
01:03:56,328 --> 01:03:57,847
If you reciprocate my feelings,

1073
01:03:59,067 --> 01:04:00,518
I will break up with her.

1074
01:04:01,067 --> 01:04:02,418
What is this nonsense?

1075
01:04:02,768 --> 01:04:05,228
You are the worst, you know that?

1076
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:10,057
I have no intention of dating you,

1077
01:04:10,578 --> 01:04:14,438
and I hate
how you can be this aggressive.

1078
01:04:15,388 --> 01:04:16,498
Kim Ji Young, you.

1079
01:04:17,457 --> 01:04:18,568
You...

1080
01:04:19,687 --> 01:04:21,507
still don't know
who you're dealing with.

1081
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:23,878
If you date me,

1082
01:04:24,198 --> 01:04:25,978
you can have everything you want.

1083
01:04:26,857 --> 01:04:29,947
You don't have to live
in that shabby house.

1084
01:04:30,797 --> 01:04:33,318
A house, a car, purses, and clothes.

1085
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,657
I will buy them all for you.

1086
01:04:40,348 --> 01:04:42,998
Hey. That's the kind of person I am.

1087
01:04:43,078 --> 01:04:45,168
But I don't need any of that.

1088
01:04:45,877 --> 01:04:47,948
Besides, I like someone else,

1089
01:04:47,948 --> 01:04:49,498
so don't come looking for me again.

1090
01:04:50,288 --> 01:04:51,288
Hey.

1091
01:04:51,288 --> 01:04:52,737
I said I liked you!

1092
01:04:52,988 --> 01:04:55,538
Let go of me!

1093
01:04:55,587 --> 01:04:56,838
So tell me.

1094
01:04:57,498 --> 01:04:59,248
Tell me that you like me too!

1095
01:05:00,627 --> 01:05:01,748
Gong Jin Dan!

1096
01:05:20,718 --> 01:05:23,668
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1097
01:05:55,817 --> 01:05:58,793
Mom, I want to share
what I have with Pil Seung.

1098
01:05:58,817 --> 01:06:01,627
How can we share
what we have with him?

1099
01:06:01,627 --> 01:06:04,357
What? You want to run
a drama production house?

1100
01:06:04,357 --> 01:06:06,428
It has been my dream for years now,

1101
01:06:06,428 --> 01:06:07,968
and I'm finally
devoting myself to it.

1102
01:06:07,968 --> 01:06:09,268
Can I ask for your support?

1103
01:06:09,268 --> 01:06:11,318
Never again
will I lose someone I cherish...

1104
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:13,717
just because I lack money and power.

1105
01:06:13,968 --> 01:06:15,018
Never again.

1106
01:06:16,167 --> 01:06:17,688
