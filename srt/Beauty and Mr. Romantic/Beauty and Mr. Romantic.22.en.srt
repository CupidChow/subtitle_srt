00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,494
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:08,068 --> 00:00:10,832
Bring my daughter back, you punk!

3
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:11,969
My goodness. Director Ko.

4
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:14,030
- I want my daughter back!
- What are you doing to him?

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,239
- You idiot.
- Let go of this first.

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,569
- How dare you...
- Please stop it.

7
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:19,239
- Ji Young. Don't do this.
- Bring her back.

8
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:21,409
Let go of it already!

9
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:22,909
- Stop it, Ji Young!
- My gosh.

10
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:30,450
Why you little...

11
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:34,349
Move!

12
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:35,360
You!

13
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,759
How dare you harm an elder?

14
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,990
You country bumpkin.
Don't you have parents of your own?

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,530
- How dare you?
- What do you think you're doing?

16
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,799
She pushed me, you punk.

17
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:47,469
Get out of my way, you punk.

18
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:48,769
- Stop it.
- You...

19
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:50,070
Hey!

20
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,369
- Director Ko.
- You!

21
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:54,439
How dare you treat my son this way?

22
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:57,280
Who do you think you are
taking him by the collar?

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,479
Get off my property this instant!

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,780
- Get lost.
- You sly gold-digger.

25
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,350
- Gosh.
- Get lost!

26
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,949
- I'll sue you.
- Get lost.

27
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,189
- Why you...
- This is assault!

28
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:08,390
- Shut it.
- Head inside.

29
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,960
- I'm being assaulted!
- Head inside.

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,119
- Gosh.
- Let go of me.

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,460
- Keep it down.
- You!

32
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,630
- What on earth is going on?
- I'll call the cops.

33
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,529
- Ji Young, stay back.
- Call the police.

34
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,430
- What?
- I'm being assaulted.

35
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,770
- They all assaulted me.
- Get lost!

36
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,300
Hey!

37
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,910
- How dare you cause a scene here?
- Unbelievable.

38
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,139
Why do you keep coming here...

39
00:01:26,139 --> 00:01:27,240
when there is
only bad blood between us?

40
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,609
By the looks of it,

41
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:32,050
you seem to have
a favor to ask my son.

42
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,050
I can't believe...

43
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,220
you have the audacity
to actually ask for one.

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,490
Have you forgotten
about the grief you caused us?

45
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:41,919
Never have I come across...

46
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:44,930
a woman this brazen
and shameless before.

47
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,930
No one could beat you at that game.

48
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,100
- Wait.
- How shameless can one be?

49
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,229
You're the reason her father died,

50
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:53,070
so how dare you come to this place?

51
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,800
Honey, don't interact with her.
She's not worth it.

52
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
- Let's head back inside.
- My gosh.

53
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,470
Mom, this is her purse
and the roll cake she got us.

54
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,139
Darn it. Take these with you.

55
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:05,050
Stuff your own face with it.

56
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:08,119
How dare you come
by our house again?

57
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,820
The audacity is unbearable.

58
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,990
Myung Dong, let's head back inside.

59
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,020
Darn you.

60
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,089
Go on.

61
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:39,709
Ko Pil Seung, you jerk!

62
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:41,750
How could you do this to me?

63
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:46,720
My late Do Ra
saw all of that from above!

64
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:48,859
How could you?

65
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:51,790
How could you of all people
do this to me?

66
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,900
What's with that woman?

67
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,429
She must not be right in her head.

68
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:00,229
Ji Young, you should head inside.

69
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:02,840
He's right. You should.

70
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,509
Thank you for helping Pil Seung out.

71
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:07,739
Don't mention it.

72
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,579
How could I not interfere...

73
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:11,280
when she was snapping at him?

74
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,419
By the way, what favor
did she want from you?

75
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,419
Is it because you won't book
the actress at her agency?

76
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,790
Yes. I told her
why she wasn't a good fit, but...

77
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,989
Anyway, I'll head back inside.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,660
- Sure.
- Go ahead.

79
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:33,400
Unbelievable.

80
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,540
That woman...

81
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:38,540
used to openly belittle Pil Seung,

82
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:42,509
so how could she come to him
after all these years for a favor?

83
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:46,280
I'd be too ashamed
to even come by this neighborhood.

84
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:47,979
Tell me about it.

85
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,449
That is one woman
I can't understand.

86
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:53,989
Here's another thing about her.

87
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:57,290
She's practically the reason
her daughter passed away,

88
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,389
but she's back in the business
once again.

89
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,959
Darn it.

90
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,359
My gosh.

91
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,829
That bull-headed cow.

92
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,370
Is that ignorant woman
the late Park Do Ra's mother?

93
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:13,310
She used
to openly belittle Pil Seung,

94
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,709
so how could she come to him
for a favor?

95
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,709
She's practically the reason
her daughter passed away,

96
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,410
but she's back in the business
once again.

97
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,549
Anyway,

98
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,689
did Director Ko
and Park Do Ra like each other,

99
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,790
and that ignorant woman disapproved?

100
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:42,299
He used to be an assistant director
no one cared about.

101
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:45,510
Now he's insulting me
because he's the director in charge?

102
00:04:46,309 --> 00:04:48,540
I bet Ko Pil Seung
said no on purpose...

103
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,280
to mess with me.

104
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,109
Because I was nasty to him
for dating Do Ra.

105
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,819
Why did you even go there?

106
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,049
What else could I do
when this was my only option?

107
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,749
Do you think you can
get anything done without bowing?

108
00:05:01,989 --> 00:05:04,890
Do Do's our only actress
and we need to...

109
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,530
find her work
to make a living ourselves.

110
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:11,999
The station director
and Director Hong said they'd help,

111
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:15,739
but that punk Ko Pil Seung said no.

112
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,340
I'll become successful somehow...

113
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,239
and crush that fool.

114
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:21,910
I'll crush him flat.

115
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,910
I can't believe that I...

116
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,049
Put this on your scrapes.

117
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,080
Who did that to your face?

118
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,650
- What?
- Put this on.

119
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,359
The country bumpkin did this!

120
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:37,020
What country bumpkin?

121
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,629
I think she lives in the room...

122
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:41,999
we used to rent years ago.

123
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,530
I grabbed Pil Seung by the collar...

124
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,830
and she ripped my hands off him.

125
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:50,470
She had such a strong grasp.

126
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,640
I think I scraped my face
when I fell to the ground after.

127
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,749
- Mom.
- What?

128
00:05:59,049 --> 00:06:00,910
I'm being dead serious
when I say this.

129
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:04,179
What you're doing
is insulting Do Ra's memory.

130
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,319
I know
you desperately want the role,

131
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,290
but why go there? That's just wrong.

132
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:15,499
How dare you harm an elder?

133
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:18,869
You country bumpkin.
Don't you have parents of your own?

134
00:06:18,869 --> 00:06:20,270
- How dare you?
- What do you think you're doing?

135
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,869
Mom and daughter
didn't recognize each other.

136
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,609
Should I tell Ji Young everything
even now?

137
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,479
The truth is...

138
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:39,319
I had such a hard time
because of my mom...

139
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,619
who only thought of me as an ATM.

140
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,890
The truth is I wanted to die today
because of my mom.

141
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,669
I can ignore and move on
from people I don't know,

142
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,770
but she's my mom.

143
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:58,410
She's my mom.

144
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,210
My mom.

145
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,479
Yes.

146
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,910
Ji Young is Ji Young.

147
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,650
Ji Young and Ms. Baek...

148
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,119
don't know each other.

149
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,330
Do Ra.

150
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,489
Live on as Kim Ji Young.

151
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,830
Don't ever recover your memory.

152
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,270
Go on...

153
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,400
not knowing a thing.

154
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,640
You're Kim Ji Young.

155
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,220
- Let go, woman!
- Darn you!

156
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,859
Who do you think you are
taking him by the collar?

157
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,989
Darn it. Take these with you.

158
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,929
Stuff your own face with it.

159
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:58,429
My gosh.

160
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:01,600
I can't accept
how the losers treated me.

161
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:05,939
They're worth less than the dirt
under my toenails. How dare they?

162
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:09,109
I'm furious.

163
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:13,679
Sun Young, what are you cooking?

164
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,020
Are you making yukgaejang?

165
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,290
Yes. Will you taste it for me?

166
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,290
Let's see.

167
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:30,160
I see you added lots of meat.

168
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,600
The broth is rich and it's spicy.
It's lovely.

169
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,900
I'm going to give some
to our tenant too.

170
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:40,140
Yes, that's a good idea.

171
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:44,480
She's a pretty decent person,
isn't she?

172
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:46,049
See what happened yesterday?

173
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:49,579
When that witch came over
to threaten Pil Seung,

174
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,650
she barged right in
and took her out.

175
00:08:52,189 --> 00:08:55,860
She put herself in harm's way
to protect her director.

176
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,260
She did.

177
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:59,429
I went to the store
a few days ago...

178
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:00,959
and asked the owner lady.

179
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:04,900
She doesn't hitch rides
with Pil Seung anymore.

180
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:07,270
I guess
there's nothing between them.

181
00:09:08,469 --> 00:09:12,740
I feel so guilty that I believed...

182
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,240
the store lady
and chewed her out last time.

183
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,309
What did you tell her?

184
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,150
I said a rich couple wants Pil Seung
to marry their daughter.

185
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,419
That she shouldn't care about him.

186
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,059
You didn't have to
put it so strongly.

187
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,390
You must be direct
if you want to put someone off.

188
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:36,030
Nothing good
will come from weird rumors.

189
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,900
- You have a point.
- I do.

190
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:41,630
Goodness.

191
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,439
Are you home?

192
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,380
It's the landlady.

193
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,179
I'm home.

194
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,079
Goodness.

195
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:00,689
- You haven't left for work yet.
- No.

196
00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:01,990
Eat this before work.

197
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,459
What's all that?

198
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,130
I was so grateful for what you did,

199
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,360
I made some yukgaejang for you.

200
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,530
I'll leave it here.

201
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,400
You don't have to thank me at all.

202
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:15,939
Thank you.

203
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:19,209
Ji Young.

204
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,780
I'm so sorry about
what my mother-in-law and I said...

205
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,880
when we came over last time.

206
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,120
What?

207
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:35,520
I felt terrible
after talking to you.

208
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:38,160
After our talk,

209
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,059
you stopped
letting Pil Seung drive you,

210
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:42,959
and I'm thankful for that.

211
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,140
Pil Seung is my pride and joy.

212
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:50,969
I hope you understand.

213
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,209
I do.

214
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,480
Don't worry.
I'll continue to be careful.

215
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,449
Thank you.

216
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,949
If you're ever out of kimchi,

217
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:08,660
instead of telling your grandmother,
tell me.

218
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,589
I can make you
all the kimchi you want.

219
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:16,030
If you feel uncomfortable
in any way, come to me then too.

220
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,099
Thank you.

221
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:21,299
I'll enjoy the food.

222
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,299
Thanks.

223
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:24,870
Have it for breakfast.

224
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,410
- I will.
- Bye.

225
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,020
Yes.

226
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,219
Director Ko and I can never be.

227
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,860
You darn losers.

228
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,360
You dare look down on Baek Mi Ja?

229
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,000
Here's some trash.

230
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,240
It's all for you.

231
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,040
Keep this.
It's just what you deserve.

232
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,740
Have you really lost your mind?

233
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,910
Lady. What are you doing
outside our gate?

234
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,280
Why do you keep showing up
and ruining what I'm doing?

235
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,380
What rotten luck.

236
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,349
Darn it.

237
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,549
Where do you think you're going?

238
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:16,589
- Let go.
- You can't leave trash here!

239
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,360
- Let me go!
- Ms. Kim! Ms. So!

240
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,660
- Come out here!
- Let go!

241
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,559
- Let go of me.
- You're not going anywhere.

242
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,599
- Who is it?
- You're so darn strong. Let go.

243
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,730
- Oh, my goodness.
- Gosh.

244
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,299
- Let go.
- What's all this?

245
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:31,169
- Goodness.
- Let go!

246
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:32,610
- Oh, my gosh.
- It was her.

247
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,880
This woman
turned this place into a landfill.

248
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,880
- She made a mess.
- Oh, my goodness.

249
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,480
Let go of me!

250
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,150
How dare you? You!

251
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,380
What do you think you're doing?

252
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,150
You ignorant fools.

253
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,120
You're worth
less than my toe dirt...

254
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,719
- and you belittle me?
- Gosh.

255
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:51,020
Pass on a message to Ko Pil Seung.

256
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:53,360
I won't ever go down.

257
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,299
He should remember his place, okay?

258
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:56,429
- What?
- My arm hurts.

259
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:58,429
- Why you...
- Hey!

260
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:00,199
Where are you going, gold-digger?

261
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:01,770
- Mother, don't.
- Darn you!

262
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:04,099
- Leave her alone.
- How dare she?

263
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:05,770
Why bother about someone like that?

264
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,870
What is all this?

265
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:10,740
- What is this?
- Ji Young.

266
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:12,380
Are you okay?

267
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,049
Yes. I'm fine.

268
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:15,719
Don't touch this.

269
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:17,579
Go to work. It's fine.

270
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,589
No. I'm not late yet.

271
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:20,589
It stinks.

272
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:24,760
I've never seen someone
as weird as her.

273
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:29,459
Yes.

274
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,429
Ko Pil Seung is
not the only director there is.

275
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:34,569
I'll make a comeback somehow.

276
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,240
I'll make our Do Do a huge star...

277
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:41,469
and crush Pil Seung one day.

278
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,079
Director.

279
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:48,410
Hello. I'm Baek Mi Ja.
Do you remember me?

280
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,380
Ms. Baek. It has been a while.

281
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,620
It has.
How come you haven't changed at all?

282
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,160
You're still just as handsome.

283
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,219
Not at all.

284
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:58,890
I should give you something.

285
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,290
I'm back in the business.

286
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,059
Here's my actress Do Do.
Isn't she pretty?

287
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,469
She's charming and young and sweet.

288
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,400
Will you give her a chance?

289
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,469
Sure.

290
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,010
If you don't have plans yet,
how about we grab lunch?

291
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,240
Sorry. I have an appointment.

292
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,579
Do you? Let's get lunch
some other time, then.

293
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,750
- Sure.
- All right.

294
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,819
That jerk.

295
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:26,620
He used to beat a path to my door...

296
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,990
hoping to cast Do Ra
in his new series.

297
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,390
And with Do Ra gone,
he's ignoring me now.

298
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,860
What a jerk.

299
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,270
You...

300
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:42,740
- The trash lady?
- What?

301
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,240
What brings you here?

302
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:46,339
"Trash lady?"

303
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,510
Hey, who do you think you are?

304
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,839
What's your deal?
Why are you following me around?

305
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,480
Are you here
to harass my Director Ko again?

306
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,650
Is that why you're here?

307
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,079
Unbelievable.

308
00:14:58,819 --> 00:14:59,819
What?

309
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:02,559
How does a hillbilly like you work
at a broadcasting station?

310
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:04,589
This is just ridiculous.

311
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,860
Stop messing with me
and move out of the way.

312
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:10,799
No. I will never let you go in.

313
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,329
How dare you try to block my way?
Will you move over already?

314
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,000
No, I won't.

315
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,240
Now that I'm here,

316
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
I will never let you
come near Director Ko.

317
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,270
Please leave.

318
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,240
- How dare you country bumpkin...
- Just go.

319
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,740
Do you want me
to teach you a lesson?

320
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,110
- Move over.
- You can't get in.

321
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,880
- Back off!
- Please leave.

322
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,579
- Will you stop that?
- Did you eat a whole cow or what?

323
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,250
- Move over!
- I can't let you go in.

324
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,919
Are you out of your mind?

325
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:35,620
Come on.
What do you think you're doing?

326
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:38,419
Mr. Jang and Director Hong.

327
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:41,490
You're the staff member
who works with Director Ko.

328
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:44,630
Why are you doing this to Mr. Baek?

329
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,699
Why are you yelling at her
in the lobby with everyone watching?

330
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,199
The thing is,

331
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:50,400
this lady went to Director Ko and...

332
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,500
Hey.

333
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,870
No. It's nothing.

334
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,809
Nothing.

335
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,809
It's no big deal.

336
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:04,819
Listen, Ms. Baek.

337
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,419
I never imagined you'd be like that.

338
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:11,919
How could you visit Director Ko's place
and do such a thing?

339
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,429
It would've been nice...

340
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,829
if Director Ko hired your actress.

341
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:23,339
That way, what we did for you...

342
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:24,599
would've meant something.

343
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:26,969
But it's Director Ko...

344
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:30,740
who has the final say.

345
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,250
I believe you are also...

346
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,679
well aware of that.

347
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,020
Ms. Baek Mi Ja.

348
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:42,049
You were...

349
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:45,260
well over the line this time.

350
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,089
It's not like that, Mr. Jang.

351
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:49,829
When Ko Pil Seung was
an assistant director,

352
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:51,599
he didn't dare to oppose me.

353
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:55,299
And now that he's a main director,
he's looking down on me.

354
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:56,799
Ms. Baek Mi Ja!

355
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,410
You can't address him like that.

356
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:03,240
He's Director Ko Pil Seung.

357
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,339
He's a director.

358
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:08,880
Yes. Sure.

359
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,859
I never thought she'd call me again.

360
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,700
I wonder why she wants to see me.

361
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,909
You're here.

362
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,909
What are you doing?
Did something happen?

363
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,990
Something good happened.

364
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,790
I won the screenwriting contest.

365
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:52,230
What does that mean?

366
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,530
I've finally become a screenwriter
after ten years of trying.

367
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:58,460
I've finally been recognized
as a writer.

368
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,869
I see. So you were
an aspiring screenwriter.

369
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Yes.

370
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,940
I'm a screenwriter now.

371
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,010
I'll make money
and become successful.

372
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:12,909
So let's start dating again.

373
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,250
I will take care of you.

374
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:19,349
- But...
- There was only one reason...

375
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:20,690
why we had to break up.

376
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,559
You were broke, and I was
an aspiring writer with no money.

377
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,889
We had to break up
because we had nothing.

378
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:31,230
But I'm a screenwriter now.

379
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,530
I will make money.

380
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,639
So we have no reason to break up.

381
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:36,700
Don't you think so?

382
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,040
Actually,

383
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,879
I thought about you a lot.

384
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:47,609
"I'll make a lot of money..."

385
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:49,420
"and call her again."

386
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,990
"And I will ask her out again."
This is what I thought.

387
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,619
Are you serious?

388
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,490
Did you really think that?

389
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:02,799
All right.

390
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,200
Let's give it a shot.

391
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:07,770
I'll work two or three jobs
if I have to.

392
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,540
Okay.

393
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,480
Then why don't we
introduce ourselves first?

394
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:18,809
My name is Ko Myung Dong.

395
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:20,349
And I'm 40.

396
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,480
Myung Dong.

397
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:23,780
My name is Park Do Sik.

398
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,920
I'm 33.

399
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,750
What did you say? You're 33?

400
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,220
What?

401
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,629
You're seven years younger than me.

402
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:39,299
That makes me
feel really bad for you.

403
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,200
It's your loss.

404
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:45,339
I'm too old for you.

405
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:47,409
What do you mean it's my loss?
This isn't a business deal.

406
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:48,639
What we will be doing...

407
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,809
is love.

408
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,549
Do Sik.

409
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:01,589
So you and I are
only seven years apart.

410
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:04,490
That means I should...

411
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,859
start calling you Ms. Myung Dong.

412
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,359
No.

413
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,700
I should call you Myung Dong.

414
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
Myung Dong.

415
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,240
Gosh, why would you say that?

416
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,280
Myung Dong.

417
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:26,379
Let's go.

418
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,390
My goodness. I can't believe this.

419
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:42,797
Oh, dear.

420
00:20:43,027 --> 00:20:45,696
My gosh. That crazy lady.

421
00:20:45,696 --> 00:20:47,767
I washed my hands
over and over again,

422
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:49,866
but they still smell like trash.

423
00:20:49,866 --> 00:20:51,267
Darn it.

424
00:20:52,237 --> 00:20:54,077
By the way,

425
00:20:54,077 --> 00:20:56,636
has she lost her mind or what?

426
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,307
It's us who should be upset...

427
00:20:59,307 --> 00:21:01,446
and bear a grudge against her.

428
00:21:01,446 --> 00:21:05,087
How could she
go on a rampage like that?

429
00:21:05,087 --> 00:21:08,357
My goodness. How ignorant she is.

430
00:21:08,357 --> 00:21:10,886
She's so vulgar and shallow.

431
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:14,597
What?

432
00:21:15,456 --> 00:21:16,456
My gosh.

433
00:21:16,456 --> 00:21:17,434
(Gong Ma Ri)

434
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,100
Hello, my friend Ma Ri.

435
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,400
What's the occasion?

436
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:27,071
Grandma, I just got a great idea.

437
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:28,741
Can you help me with that?

438
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,241
A great idea?

439
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,370
What would that be?

440
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,580
I think it's freshly fried.

441
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,751
I know. It's really good.

442
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:41,751
- Please enjoy it.
- Please enjoy it.

443
00:21:41,751 --> 00:21:43,951
- Please enjoy it.
- Please enjoy it.

444
00:21:43,951 --> 00:21:45,491
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

445
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,890
Grandma.

446
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,321
Hey, Pil Seung.

447
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:51,461
Ma Ri.

448
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,600
Pil Seung.

449
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,830
Hello, Mr. Ko.

450
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,801
Oh, right. Hello, everyone.

451
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:07,110
I'm Director Ko Pil Seung's
grandmother.

452
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,940
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

453
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,051
Please enjoy it.

454
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,180
Grandma, what's all this?

455
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:16,981
Ma Ri bought 100 fried chickens...

456
00:22:16,981 --> 00:22:19,251
for your staff members.

457
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,961
You're working hard,

458
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:24,160
so this is no big deal.

459
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,561
You don't have to thank me.

460
00:22:26,231 --> 00:22:29,201
Please have some chicken.
Thank you all for your hard work.

461
00:22:29,201 --> 00:22:30,561
Have some drinks too.

462
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:33,471
Sure. Please come over here
and have some chicken.

463
00:22:33,471 --> 00:22:34,541
Before it gets cold.

464
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:36,840
Hey. It's the tenant lady.

465
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,741
Come here
and have some fried chicken.

466
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:39,741
Come on.

467
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:41,011
Hello.

468
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,610
Hello.

469
00:22:44,451 --> 00:22:45,751
Hello.

470
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,150
By the way, what's the tenant lady?

471
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:52,491
She's a tenant
renting a room in our house.

472
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:57,021
And you work with Mr. Ko?

473
00:22:57,991 --> 00:22:58,991
Pardon?

474
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,400
Yes. I'm a staff member here.

475
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,011
Please enjoy it.

476
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,340
Thank you.

477
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,190
She lives with Mr. Ko...

478
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,561
and also works with him.

479
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,430
I'd love to be her.

480
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:37,001
The girl who got us
that fried chicken.

481
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:39,471
She had on designer clothes
and was quite pretty.

482
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,440
But didn't she seem off to you?

483
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:43,900
You don't know who she is.

484
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,370
She's the only daughter
of APP Group's chairman.

485
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,580
The accident she was in
at a young age...

486
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,610
caused her to grow up
while her brain underdeveloped.

487
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:53,211
Really?

488
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,850
But why was
the chairman's daughter here?

489
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,821
Didn't you see how she was?

490
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:01,791
She kept following
Director Ko around...

491
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:03,991
calling him "Mr. Ko."

492
00:24:03,991 --> 00:24:07,360
Was she here because
she has a crush on him?

493
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
Yes.

494
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,930
Earlier, I asked her
about her relationship...

495
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:13,670
with Director Ko,

496
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:16,041
and she said she liked him.

497
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,640
That's why she got us
100 boxes of fried chicken.

498
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,711
No way.

499
00:24:20,471 --> 00:24:22,781
She was with
Director Ko's grandmother...

500
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:24,380
which means the families
are already involved.

501
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,650
Goodness.

502
00:24:25,781 --> 00:24:27,211
Then is Director Ko...

503
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:29,350
going to be the son-in-law
of APP Group?

504
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:30,481
Yes.

505
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,221
We should get on his good side.

506
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,251
Tell me about it.

507
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,860
- I wonder what he likes.
- Who knows?

508
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,900
Ji Young.
There's a wealthy family...

509
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:44,731
that wants our Pil Seung
to be their son-in-law.

510
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:51,471
So she's from the rich family...

511
00:24:52,211 --> 00:24:53,741
that his grandmother talked about.

512
00:24:57,951 --> 00:25:00,251
Pil Seung,
I enjoyed the fried chicken.

513
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,221
Oh, right.

514
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,850
Gosh, wait.

515
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:06,390
I shouldn't call you
like that anymore.

516
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:07,920
Director Ko,

517
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,090
don't forget about me
after you marry into APP Group.

518
00:25:11,461 --> 00:25:12,630
I was extremely good to you...

519
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,231
back when you were
an assistant director.

520
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,761
Will you launch
your own broadcasting station...

521
00:25:15,761 --> 00:25:16,930
after marrying her?

522
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,731
What are you talking about?

523
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:20,971
She's the daughter
of my mom's friend.

524
00:25:20,971 --> 00:25:21,971
There's nothing between us.

525
00:25:21,971 --> 00:25:23,600
Look here, Director Ko.

526
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:25,511
The daughter of your mom's friend
wouldn't have come by...

527
00:25:25,511 --> 00:25:27,580
with 100 boxes of fried chicken
for no reason.

528
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,011
But that's how it is.

529
00:25:29,011 --> 00:25:30,741
She's like a sister to me.

530
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:33,150
It's classic to go
from friends to lovers.

531
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,451
Anyway, I hope you'll be
good to me as well.

532
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,190
Go, Pil Seung.

533
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,860
What's with everyone?

534
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,390
Stand by!

535
00:25:47,061 --> 00:25:49,031
In 1, 2. Cue.

536
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:50,100
Get lost!

537
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,031
Cut. Okay, that was great.

538
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,301
You were great.

539
00:25:55,301 --> 00:25:56,301
You too.

540
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,640
How long will it take?

541
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,110
He's so cool.

542
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:03,110
How can Mr. Ko look so good
doing his job?

543
00:26:05,951 --> 00:26:09,021
Chi Chi, that's what worries me.

544
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,090
There are a lot
of pretty actresses around him...

545
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,120
and don't get me started
on the female staff members.

546
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,261
What was that?

547
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:19,690
I shouldn't worry
since I'm prettier?

548
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:23,701
Right, I hear you.
That's why I call you my sister.

549
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,135
(My prince)

550
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:30,840
Oh, no. It's Pil Seung.

551
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,410
Pil Seung!

552
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,241
I mean, Mr. Ko.

553
00:26:40,251 --> 00:26:42,420
Really? Right this moment?

554
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,551
I hear things are going well...

555
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:46,221
between Jin Dan and
the daughter of Illyu Foods' CEO.

556
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,761
At first, they wanted
to discuss marriage...

557
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:51,390
after letting them date
for about a year.

558
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,890
But they must've taken
a liking to Jin Dan...

559
00:26:54,231 --> 00:26:56,330
seeing how they want to meet us.

560
00:26:57,771 --> 00:26:59,531
It'll also serve
as a pre-marriage family gathering.

561
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:03,301
Aren't you well acquainted
with the family...

562
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:05,241
that owns Illyu Foods?

563
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,940
Yes, I set the two up.

564
00:27:08,811 --> 00:27:10,741
Jin Dan should tie the knot,

565
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,981
settle down, and have children...

566
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:14,920
if I'm to sleep better at night.

567
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,150
I've been meaning...

568
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,390
to talk to you two
about his marriage anyway,

569
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,461
so this is good news.

570
00:27:24,761 --> 00:27:27,330
What's there to wait for
when it's Illyu Foods?

571
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:30,330
The families should meet
since that's what they want.

572
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,930
Yes, of course.

573
00:27:33,531 --> 00:27:35,340
Say that we'd love to meet them.

574
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,771
Yes, Auntie.

575
00:27:37,571 --> 00:27:39,311
This is great news. Congratulations.

576
00:27:39,511 --> 00:27:40,511
Thanks.

577
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,410
Gosh.

578
00:27:43,211 --> 00:27:45,981
Ma Ri, you'll hurt yourself.
Slow down.

579
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:47,481
What's so urgent?

580
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,451
Mom, how do I look?
Dad, what do you think?

581
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:51,751
Grandma, how do I look?

582
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,991
Ma Ri, you look incredible.

583
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:58,330
Anyway, are you going somewhere?
Are you off to see someone?

584
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,160
Yes, I'm off to see Mr. Ko.

585
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:02,600
Mr. Ko asked me to meet him.

586
00:28:03,261 --> 00:28:05,531
- I'll get going, then.
- Ma Ri.

587
00:28:05,531 --> 00:28:07,600
Do Jun, bring the car around. Hurry.

588
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:12,241
What... She's off to see Pil Seung?

589
00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:14,340
Were you aware of this?

590
00:28:14,811 --> 00:28:16,541
No, I wasn't.

591
00:28:17,811 --> 00:28:19,511
Why would he want to see her?

592
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:23,021
My gosh. If Pil Seung
asked her to meet him,

593
00:28:23,021 --> 00:28:24,890
it could mean he's showing interest.

594
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,090
Is that so?

595
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,521
I'd love for things
to go well between them.

596
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:34,031
What more could we want
if that was actually true?

597
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:36,330
Jin Dan will marry Tae Hee...

598
00:28:36,701 --> 00:28:38,801
and Ma Ri will marry Pil Seung.

599
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:42,801
I'd have nothing to worry about.

600
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:45,840
That's preposterous.

601
00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:53,551
Ma Ri.

602
00:28:53,811 --> 00:28:54,981
Yes, Mr. Ko.

603
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,951
I appreciate you coming by
with the fried chicken today.

604
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:02,221
I enjoyed it with the staff.

605
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:05,630
Really? Then I'll be back
with some more.

606
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,690
No, Ma Ri.

607
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,860
I wish you wouldn't do that.

608
00:29:10,531 --> 00:29:11,701
Please don't come by
my workplace again.

609
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,471
To be honest,
things were uncomfortable for me.

610
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,311
Why?

611
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,140
You said everyone
enjoyed the fried chicken.

612
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,580
Ma Ri.

613
00:29:25,511 --> 00:29:27,110
I told you before...

614
00:29:27,211 --> 00:29:28,481
that I liked someone else.

615
00:29:29,781 --> 00:29:31,920
But you came by my workplace...

616
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,251
and told people...

617
00:29:35,021 --> 00:29:36,461
that we were more than friends.

618
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:39,731
Well, that's...

619
00:29:40,061 --> 00:29:42,261
I didn't mean to say that,

620
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:46,170
but one of the staff members asked
how we knew each other...

621
00:29:46,531 --> 00:29:49,100
and what we were to one another.

622
00:29:51,811 --> 00:29:55,781
So I guess I told her...

623
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,741
that I liked you.

624
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:01,620
But I only told about three people.

625
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,021
That's why I asked to see you today.

626
00:30:04,221 --> 00:30:05,451
To put a stop to this.

627
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:08,291
If this is how it's going to be,

628
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,531
I won't be able to consider you
even as a sister.

629
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,830
My goodness. No, Mr. Ko.

630
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,630
I mean, Pil Seung.

631
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,771
I'll be more careful from now on.

632
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:20,531
I won't do anything like it again.

633
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:26,370
I'll put my trust in you
and get going.

634
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:28,610
It seems as though
your driver brought you here,

635
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,380
so get home safely.

636
00:31:05,481 --> 00:31:06,981
Ma Ri, what's wrong?

637
00:31:08,481 --> 00:31:11,590
Do Jun, Pil Seung...

638
00:31:11,951 --> 00:31:13,920
must hate me.

639
00:31:14,521 --> 00:31:16,291
Is that what he said?

640
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:20,130
No, he didn't
actually say those words,

641
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:22,761
but he lied
about having a girlfriend,

642
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:24,701
and told me
not to come by his workplace...

643
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:25,900
with fried chicken again.

644
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,400
He refused to see me if I did.

645
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,311
That's him telling me
that he hates me.

646
00:31:31,511 --> 00:31:33,610
Was it so wrong of me...

647
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,640
to go by his workplace
with fried chicken?

648
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:42,350
It's all right.

649
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:01,571
Why on earth did you go
by the broadcasting station?

650
00:32:01,701 --> 00:32:03,840
Why would you even go there?

651
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,640
Why won't you listen to me?

652
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,781
Did Do Jun tell you?

653
00:32:08,781 --> 00:32:10,610
Did Do Jun tell you where I was?

654
00:32:11,511 --> 00:32:12,981
Park Do Jun,
you have another thing coming.

655
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,021
Get up.

656
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:21,090
Why are you being a nuisance
to so many people?

657
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:23,590
Pil Seung isn't interested in you.

658
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,291
It's rude to pursue someone
when they don't want you to.

659
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:29,160
In some ways, it's a violent act.

660
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:32,630
Honey, why would you
put it like that?

661
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,971
A violent act?

662
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,600
How am I wrong?

663
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,640
By pursuing someone
who isn't interested,

664
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,711
you're inflicting grief
on that person.

665
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:43,241
Ma Ri should know
how things work in this world.

666
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,211
Gong Ma Ri.

667
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:50,481
What you're doing is bad.
Do you get that?

668
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,491
Honey.

669
00:33:07,471 --> 00:33:10,600
Ma Ri, what can you do?

670
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,311
As for me,

671
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,080
I would like for you
to stop liking him.

672
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,380
I don't want...

673
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,251
to see you brokenhearted.

674
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,430
Whatever. Just leave.

675
00:33:46,211 --> 00:33:48,811
What? Who could be knocking?

676
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,910
Sure. Come on in.

677
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,420
Grandma.

678
00:33:57,321 --> 00:34:00,920
Hey, Pil Seung. It's you.

679
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,761
Grandma.

680
00:34:06,791 --> 00:34:08,130
Why did you do that today?

681
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,430
You shouldn't have brought Ma Ri
to my workplace.

682
00:34:14,031 --> 00:34:16,241
You put me in a bad spot at work.

683
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:19,710
People think that I'll date Ma Ri...

684
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,340
and marry her.

685
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,110
Well...

686
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,911
Is that so?

687
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,851
But don't you think...

688
00:34:27,851 --> 00:34:29,480
that kind of a rumor
is beneficial to you?

689
00:34:30,221 --> 00:34:32,750
Not everyone gets to marry
into APP Group.

690
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,860
Even if you don't marry Ma Ri,

691
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,431
a rumor like that
will only feed your ego.

692
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:42,761
It will only make you look better.

693
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:46,531
Grandma,

694
00:34:47,331 --> 00:34:49,101
what on earth are you talking about?

695
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:51,400
I'm asking you.

696
00:34:52,141 --> 00:34:55,110
Please don't do anything
like this again.

697
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,741
What?

698
00:35:00,951 --> 00:35:02,121
Mother!

699
00:35:02,581 --> 00:35:05,520
Why would you take Ma Ri
to Pil Seung's workplace?

700
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,391
How would that make Pil Seung look?

701
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,630
Mother, how can you be
that inconsiderate?

702
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,690
Come on.

703
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:17,000
She served not 10,
but 100 boxes of fried chicken...

704
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,431
at Pil Seung's workplace
to make him look good,

705
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:21,540
but rather than thanking us...

706
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,670
I can't believe you both.

707
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,440
Why are you on my case about this?

708
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:27,670
Mother.

709
00:35:28,181 --> 00:35:31,210
Please don't take advantage
of Ma Ri anymore.

710
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,480
- You know she isn't well.
- What?

711
00:35:34,081 --> 00:35:36,020
Mother, this is wrong.

712
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,551
My goodness.

713
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,321
What on earth?

714
00:35:41,321 --> 00:35:44,621
What did she just say to me?

715
00:35:44,621 --> 00:35:48,360
Did she accuse me
of taking advantage of Ma Ri?

716
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:53,400
Sun Young! Ma Ri's my friend.

717
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:59,049
Why did you want to see me
at this late hour?

718
00:35:59,989 --> 00:36:02,319
Ji Young, have you had dinner?

719
00:36:02,888 --> 00:36:04,259
Of course.

720
00:36:04,728 --> 00:36:07,158
The fried chicken
your rich girlfriend got us.

721
00:36:07,158 --> 00:36:09,529
I brought some home
and had it for dinner.

722
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:12,199
Thanks to her, I saved money.

723
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:14,899
She isn't my girlfriend.
There's nothing between us.

724
00:36:14,899 --> 00:36:16,569
Please, Ji Young.
Don't get the wrong idea.

725
00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:19,208
Why would she come by
with 100 boxes of fried chicken...

726
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:21,708
when there's nothing
between you two?

727
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:23,009
How does that make sense?

728
00:36:24,408 --> 00:36:26,109
Ji Young, please listen to me.

729
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:29,018
My mom has a best friend
whose name is Ms. Jang.

730
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:31,649
Ma Ri's her daughter.

731
00:36:31,649 --> 00:36:33,288
She's the daughter
of my mom's friend.

732
00:36:34,118 --> 00:36:36,458
Ms. Jang has been good to me
since I was a kid...

733
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:38,888
which is why I was nice to Ma Ri.

734
00:36:40,529 --> 00:36:42,328
Anyway, what I mean is that...

735
00:36:42,328 --> 00:36:43,368
Director Ko.

736
00:36:43,998 --> 00:36:46,199
Why are you explaining this to me?

737
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:47,839
It's not like
there's anything between us.

738
00:36:48,469 --> 00:36:50,569
If you're only going
to talk nonsense,

739
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:51,969
I'd rather head home.

740
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:58,449
I wouldn't mind if my brother
married into a rich family.

741
00:36:59,919 --> 00:37:03,149
Ji Young, that's not the case.
You have to believe me.

742
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,618
Sure thing.

743
00:37:12,759 --> 00:37:14,759
What? You...

744
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:16,498
They say you meet your enemies
at the worst place and time.

745
00:37:16,498 --> 00:37:18,469
You country bumpkin.

746
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:21,299
I'm actually glad to see you.

747
00:37:21,299 --> 00:37:22,969
Lady, what's your problem?

748
00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:24,069
You...

749
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:26,538
Rather than minding
your own business,

750
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:27,808
you humiliated me.

751
00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:31,248
Because of you, I can't show my face
at broadcasting stations anymore.

752
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:33,179
- You!
- Let go of me.

753
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:34,819
Let go!

754
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:38,049
Are your bones made of steel?
Gosh, you're strong.

755
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:40,618
- Ms. Baek.
- How dare you come at me like this?

756
00:37:40,919 --> 00:37:43,658
Who are you
to grab my hair like that?

757
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,029
Touch me again...

758
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:48,629
and I'll make you pay.

759
00:37:48,828 --> 00:37:50,199
Watch it, lady.

760
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,598
- My gosh.
- Do you hear me?

761
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:54,938
That... You arrogant brat.

762
00:37:54,938 --> 00:37:56,239
Ms. Baek.

763
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,808
Who is she and what's her problem?

764
00:37:58,808 --> 00:38:00,078
My gosh.

765
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:03,109
Do Do, there's no need for you
to know about that stupid girl.

766
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:04,408
Don't interact with her.

767
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:06,478
If you get in a fight with her,

768
00:38:06,478 --> 00:38:09,518
you'll hurt your pretty face.

769
00:38:09,518 --> 00:38:11,348
Don't mind her at all.

770
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:14,219
That dimbo.

771
00:38:18,188 --> 00:38:19,288
Creator of mankind.

772
00:38:21,228 --> 00:38:23,569
Why did you save me?

773
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:26,569
What does this mean?

774
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,739
Please tell me what you meant.

775
00:38:38,908 --> 00:38:40,819
The creator saved my life.

776
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:45,788
I was the chosen one after all.

777
00:38:45,788 --> 00:38:46,919
I was the chosen one.

778
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:50,989
So I come before vermin like them.

779
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:53,359
I'm the priority.

780
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:55,458
I come first!

781
00:39:01,868 --> 00:39:03,469
The country bumpkin isn't too bad.

782
00:39:08,609 --> 00:39:11,609
Why do I feel like
I've seen her before?

783
00:39:14,578 --> 00:39:15,719
Where though?

784
00:39:17,018 --> 00:39:19,618
Jae Dong. I heard wrong, didn't I?

785
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:22,359
What did you just propose?

786
00:39:23,259 --> 00:39:24,328
Ji Young.

787
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:27,299
I started off with nothing
but survived ten years in this field...

788
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:29,799
all while going through
hell and high water.

789
00:39:30,228 --> 00:39:33,268
And now, I will do it right
by starting my own agency.

790
00:39:34,469 --> 00:39:36,569
My contract with Bi Bi
ends this week.

791
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:40,208
Will you be
the first actress at my agency?

792
00:39:42,908 --> 00:39:45,549
Jae Dong, please don't
crack jokes like that.

793
00:39:45,908 --> 00:39:49,018
I've only been studying theater
for two weeks now.

794
00:39:49,018 --> 00:39:50,848
I know nothing about acting.

795
00:39:51,248 --> 00:39:53,618
So how could I possibly
sign with an agency?

796
00:39:53,888 --> 00:39:56,589
Ji Young, I've seen many
at work in this field...

797
00:39:56,589 --> 00:39:59,558
from rookies to A-list actors.

798
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:02,399
When I say
someone's going to make it,

799
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:04,429
that person almost always makes it.

800
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,498
When I watched your acting,
I had this feeling.

801
00:40:08,368 --> 00:40:10,169
You are really talented.

802
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:12,239
So please sign with my agency.

803
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:14,339
I'll work hard
to support you in any way I can.

804
00:40:15,509 --> 00:40:17,509
You're being ridiculous.

805
00:40:19,348 --> 00:40:20,618
How about this, then?

806
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:24,248
We'll come up with a number
that'll reduce both our risks.

807
00:40:24,248 --> 00:40:25,518
What do you say to 50-50?

808
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,158
Did you say 50-50?

809
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:31,558
How could I accept that much?

810
00:40:32,259 --> 00:40:33,859
You take 90 percent.

811
00:40:33,859 --> 00:40:35,228
I'm good with just ten percent.

812
00:40:35,228 --> 00:40:37,029
Ji Young,
that'll get you in trouble!

813
00:40:37,299 --> 00:40:39,998
That kind of a deal
should never be made.

814
00:40:40,569 --> 00:40:42,839
Even if you don't work with me,

815
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:45,069
never accept a deal
that is one-sided.

816
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,938
Don't be like that
and sign with my agency instead.

817
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:51,348
But I know nothing about acting.

818
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:53,049
This is my first time
managing my own agency.

819
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:56,419
Together, we'll build from scratch.

820
00:40:59,149 --> 00:41:01,919
Sure. I got it.

821
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:04,529
We'll build from scratch.

822
00:41:05,828 --> 00:41:08,058
So you'll be the first actor
to sign with my agency?

823
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:09,799
Yes.

824
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,429
Okay!

825
00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:17,339
Jae Dong, it's an honor.

826
00:41:17,438 --> 00:41:19,138
Thank you so much.

827
00:41:19,138 --> 00:41:21,739
Thank you
for acknowledging my talent.

828
00:41:21,908 --> 00:41:25,009
Ji Young, I'm the one
who's grateful.

829
00:41:25,009 --> 00:41:26,618
Mr. Lee, Ms. Kim.

830
00:41:27,379 --> 00:41:29,888
This kind of behavior
is unacceptable at our station.

831
00:41:30,118 --> 00:41:31,388
Why are you two hugging?

832
00:41:31,549 --> 00:41:32,618
Director Ko!

833
00:41:33,688 --> 00:41:35,958
Director Ko, here you go.

834
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:40,498
Popcorn Entertainment?

835
00:41:40,558 --> 00:41:42,929
Yes, it's my talent agency.

836
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,828
Allow me to make
a formal introduction.

837
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:47,799
This is Kim Ji Young,

838
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:48,969
the first actor to sign
with Popcorn Entertainment.

839
00:41:49,098 --> 00:41:50,239
Please be fond of her.

840
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:54,078
Please be fond of me.

841
00:42:00,049 --> 00:42:01,549
Why would you start acting?

842
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,819
Do you want to be an actress?

843
00:42:04,848 --> 00:42:06,219
What's the matter with you?

844
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,688
I'm the one
who should be asking that.

845
00:42:09,558 --> 00:42:12,259
Whether I take up acting,
singing, or dancing...

846
00:42:12,259 --> 00:42:14,458
is none of your business.

847
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:15,799
Ji Young.

848
00:42:16,728 --> 00:42:19,969
Being in a few scenes
must've gone to your head.

849
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:22,938
Acting isn't a job for just anyone.

850
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,438
You should never
be an actress, okay?

851
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:27,779
What?

852
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,908
You look down on me, don't you?

853
00:42:32,078 --> 00:42:34,549
A girl from the country
with no degree wants to act,

854
00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:37,518
so you're putting me down in my face
because you think that little of me.

855
00:42:38,388 --> 00:42:40,589
No, Ji Young.
I don't look down on you.

856
00:42:42,118 --> 00:42:43,118
Ji Young.

857
00:42:44,158 --> 00:42:47,558
The path of an actor
is rough and dangerous.

858
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,728
I'm worried about you.

859
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:53,868
You can't even imagine
how stressful it is...

860
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:56,098
to be in the public eye.

861
00:42:57,609 --> 00:42:59,868
Nobody cares about
an ordinary person's mistake,

862
00:43:00,138 --> 00:43:01,839
but if an actress does the same,

863
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,078
the whole world
is ready to stone her.

864
00:43:04,408 --> 00:43:06,208
Why choose that tough life?

865
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:09,719
Study something else. I'll help you.

866
00:43:10,419 --> 00:43:11,489
Director Ko.

867
00:43:12,348 --> 00:43:14,719
I decide what to do with my life.

868
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:17,529
I love it so much when I'm acting.

869
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:20,899
I feel so happy I wonder
if I'm allowed to feel that way.

870
00:43:22,098 --> 00:43:25,098
So don't tell me what to do anymore.

871
00:43:25,498 --> 00:43:26,498
I just...

872
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,268
want you to lead...

873
00:43:32,908 --> 00:43:34,009
a happy life with no worries...

874
00:43:35,978 --> 00:43:37,879
like you do now.

875
00:43:42,379 --> 00:43:45,788
You know, I just found my path.

876
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:48,489
I don't think I can...

877
00:43:48,489 --> 00:43:51,188
lead a happy life if I don't act.

878
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:55,498
I can't lead a happy life
without pursuing acting now.

879
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:57,328
Do you understand?

880
00:43:59,998 --> 00:44:01,069
Fine, then.

881
00:44:03,509 --> 00:44:06,438
I'll explain in more detail
over dinner.

882
00:44:07,138 --> 00:44:08,339
Let's discuss this.

883
00:44:09,339 --> 00:44:12,879
You can have dinner
with your rich heiress girlfriend.

884
00:44:13,379 --> 00:44:14,618
I have plans.

885
00:44:15,618 --> 00:44:17,348
How many times must I explain that?

886
00:44:17,348 --> 00:44:18,848
We're not dating!

887
00:44:18,848 --> 00:44:19,848
What's he saying?

888
00:44:19,848 --> 00:44:21,319
(Script-reading Room)

889
00:44:22,288 --> 00:44:24,058
This is madness.

890
00:44:27,558 --> 00:44:30,629
Mr. Gong. We're having dinner today.

891
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:33,699
We're down to one meal, right?

892
00:44:34,498 --> 00:44:35,538
Ji Young.

893
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:39,308
Do you want to be
over and done with our dinners?

894
00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:42,609
Gosh. That hurts.

895
00:44:42,978 --> 00:44:46,078
Not at all. That's not what I meant.

896
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:50,089
I should pay you back
for your suit sooner than later.

897
00:44:50,248 --> 00:44:53,688
You can't really relax
until your debts are paid off.

898
00:44:55,058 --> 00:44:58,688
This is our second to last dinner.

899
00:44:59,558 --> 00:45:02,399
Are you still trying to decide
whether to date me?

900
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,569
I can't wait
until you're my girlfriend.

901
00:45:07,399 --> 00:45:08,969
Oh, that?

902
00:45:10,638 --> 00:45:12,509
Should I tell him right now...

903
00:45:12,969 --> 00:45:14,239
I can't be his girlfriend?

904
00:45:15,538 --> 00:45:16,779
No.

905
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:19,609
I have to see him once more.

906
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:22,379
How am I to face him then
if I reject him today?

907
00:45:23,118 --> 00:45:25,649
Yes. It would be best to tell him...

908
00:45:25,649 --> 00:45:27,058
at our last dinner.

909
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:28,919
On the last day.

910
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:32,228
Are you...

911
00:45:32,728 --> 00:45:34,359
still thinking?

912
00:45:35,098 --> 00:45:37,569
We have one more dinner to go.

913
00:45:37,799 --> 00:45:40,868
I'll think about it
and tell you then.

914
00:45:41,768 --> 00:45:43,509
Well, okay.

915
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:46,268
I promised not to push you.

916
00:45:47,009 --> 00:45:48,279
Hey, Ji Young.

917
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:51,308
Shall we go to Chuncheon tomorrow
for some air?

918
00:45:51,848 --> 00:45:52,978
And spicy stir-fried chicken.

919
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,518
My treat.

920
00:45:55,248 --> 00:45:56,279
Tomorrow?

921
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:59,049
I'm not free on weekends.

922
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:01,018
I take acting classes.

923
00:46:02,158 --> 00:46:05,158
You're taking acting classes?

924
00:46:05,288 --> 00:46:08,699
Yes. I happened to play
a minor role in the drama,

925
00:46:08,859 --> 00:46:11,328
and it was so much fun
I decided to learn.

926
00:46:12,268 --> 00:46:14,438
I want to be an actress later on.

927
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:18,268
I'm dreaming too big, aren't I?

928
00:46:18,768 --> 00:46:21,279
Why would you say
you're dreaming too big?

929
00:46:21,978 --> 00:46:24,879
We should do what we want in life...

930
00:46:24,879 --> 00:46:26,078
to be happy.

931
00:46:27,049 --> 00:46:29,549
Do you really think so?

932
00:46:30,049 --> 00:46:31,248
I do.

933
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:33,989
Ji Young. If you ever...

934
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:37,029
need help with acting lessons,
come to me.

935
00:46:37,759 --> 00:46:39,029
I'll do anything you want.

936
00:46:40,058 --> 00:46:43,629
Thanks so much for saying that
even if you don't mean it.

937
00:46:45,899 --> 00:46:48,438
Ji Young wants to be an actress
like Park Do Ra?

938
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:50,368
What a strange coincidence.

939
00:46:51,469 --> 00:46:54,538
Or is this a new shot at destiny?

940
00:47:14,058 --> 00:47:15,498
(Actress Park Do Ra
Sang at Nightclubs as a Minor)

941
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:22,799
I had such a hard time.

942
00:47:23,739 --> 00:47:25,638
Of course, it's for the money.

943
00:47:25,638 --> 00:47:27,638
What can love do for me?

944
00:47:27,638 --> 00:47:29,239
(Breaking news:
Actress Park Do Ra died)

945
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:31,049
(Park Do Ra
allegedly committed suicide)

946
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,219
Ji Young can't act.

947
00:47:42,018 --> 00:47:43,319
She can do anything...

948
00:47:45,228 --> 00:47:46,458
but become an actor.

949
00:47:59,969 --> 00:48:00,978
Ji Young.

950
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:05,478
What?

951
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:07,219
Ji Young.

952
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,618
I beg of you.

953
00:48:10,348 --> 00:48:11,419
Can you please not...

954
00:48:12,219 --> 00:48:13,449
get into acting?

955
00:48:15,989 --> 00:48:19,859
Were you waiting here for me
to say that?

956
00:48:23,629 --> 00:48:27,669
I don't want to be a huge star.

957
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:31,708
I just want to act
because I enjoy it.

958
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:35,438
Being an actress
isn't just about acting.

959
00:48:35,908 --> 00:48:37,779
There are so many things
you must bear with.

960
00:48:37,779 --> 00:48:40,449
I'm worried you'll end up
getting hurt if you act.

961
00:48:40,779 --> 00:48:42,419
I don't want you to suffer.

962
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,518
Don't say such silly things.

963
00:48:44,518 --> 00:48:46,149
Do as you're told and don't do it!

964
00:48:46,788 --> 00:48:48,688
Just how painful that career is...

965
00:48:48,919 --> 00:48:50,989
How much more must I explain?

966
00:49:00,469 --> 00:49:02,199
When you said you liked me,

967
00:49:03,638 --> 00:49:04,969
you lied, didn't you?

968
00:49:06,408 --> 00:49:07,478
What?

969
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:10,748
If you like someone,

970
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:13,348
you root for and support them...

971
00:49:13,779 --> 00:49:15,949
as they dream and make choices.

972
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:18,589
You don't just get in the way.

973
00:49:20,118 --> 00:49:22,558
I don't think you like me at all.

974
00:49:25,288 --> 00:49:27,598
So don't say stuff like this
to me anymore.

975
00:49:28,658 --> 00:49:32,268
I have nothing to do with you now.

976
00:49:46,649 --> 00:49:47,679
Mr. Jang.

977
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:49,679
What are you doing here?

978
00:49:49,919 --> 00:49:52,888
I came to introduce Do Do to you.

979
00:49:52,888 --> 00:49:54,618
Do Do, say hello.

980
00:49:54,819 --> 00:49:56,188
He heads drama production.

981
00:49:57,158 --> 00:49:59,158
- Hello.
- It's nice to meet you.

982
00:49:59,158 --> 00:50:01,259
Do Do, not anyone gets to meet him.

983
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:02,658
You should be honored.

984
00:50:02,658 --> 00:50:04,328
Ms. Baek, I have a meeting.

985
00:50:04,328 --> 00:50:06,069
- Next time.
- Mr. Jang.

986
00:50:07,169 --> 00:50:08,199
My goodness.

987
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,669
Fancy seeing you two directors here.

988
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:13,908
This is Do Do.
I gave you her resume.

989
00:50:13,908 --> 00:50:14,938
Say hello.

990
00:50:16,438 --> 00:50:18,779
Hello, I'm Do Do.
I hope we can work together.

991
00:50:18,779 --> 00:50:20,449
Oh... Hello.

992
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,879
I'm expecting a visitor.

993
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:26,649
- Director Hong.
- I have a meeting.

994
00:50:27,288 --> 00:50:28,919
Director Jung.

995
00:50:35,929 --> 00:50:38,268
What did Pil Seung say about me...

996
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:40,538
that everyone avoids me
like the plague?

997
00:50:40,969 --> 00:50:43,868
What should I do about that punk?

998
00:50:47,509 --> 00:50:49,609
Let's keep trying.

999
00:50:53,078 --> 00:50:55,149
Director, I have bad news.

1000
00:50:55,518 --> 00:50:57,848
Ms. Kim's furious...

1001
00:50:57,848 --> 00:50:59,788
you cut Ji Young's scene.

1002
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:02,688
She's on her way here to see you.

1003
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:03,888
What?

1004
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:07,558
I get it if she's angry,
but why come here over that...

1005
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09,998
when she has scripts to write?

1006
00:51:10,098 --> 00:51:12,328
I think you should hide.

1007
00:51:12,368 --> 00:51:13,768
Hurry.

1008
00:51:14,069 --> 00:51:15,199
Why should I hide?

1009
00:51:15,768 --> 00:51:16,969
I didn't do anything wrong.

1010
00:51:17,768 --> 00:51:19,038
Director Ko!

1011
00:51:19,669 --> 00:51:21,708
Where are you, Director Ko?

1012
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:23,578
Director Ko Pil Seung!

1013
00:51:24,279 --> 00:51:26,208
Ms. Kim. I'm right here.

1014
00:51:26,808 --> 00:51:28,779
You must be stressed out
with the scripts.

1015
00:51:28,779 --> 00:51:30,248
Why did you come all the way here?

1016
00:51:30,348 --> 00:51:32,089
You're asking me why I'm here?

1017
00:51:32,248 --> 00:51:33,819
Do you not know why I'm here...

1018
00:51:34,089 --> 00:51:36,018
when I can't afford
to waste a second?

1019
00:51:36,118 --> 00:51:37,489
How could you?

1020
00:51:37,589 --> 00:51:39,388
Let's not get too worked up.

1021
00:51:40,188 --> 00:51:41,699
The storyline made no sense.

1022
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:44,529
How could a market store owner
become the lead's sister?

1023
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,069
It's a drama.

1024
00:51:46,299 --> 00:51:48,638
Our viewers aren't stupid.

1025
00:51:49,268 --> 00:51:50,509
This won't work.

1026
00:51:52,308 --> 00:51:54,538
Fine, then. I get it.

1027
00:51:57,779 --> 00:52:00,978
If you want to do what you want
with the storyline,

1028
00:52:01,049 --> 00:52:03,018
you can write the last episode.

1029
00:52:03,319 --> 00:52:04,719
You be the scriptwriter too.

1030
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:07,489
I won't write another line.
It's up to you.

1031
00:52:09,018 --> 00:52:11,489
Ms. Kim!

1032
00:52:17,529 --> 00:52:19,799
Why is the writer so angry?

1033
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,199
This is all because of you,
Ji Young.

1034
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,538
What? Me?

1035
00:52:26,569 --> 00:52:28,978
Why? Did I do something wrong?

1036
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:30,949
It's not like that.

1037
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:34,319
Ms. Kim must've liked it a lot
when she watched your acting.

1038
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,419
She said she was inspired
by your acting.

1039
00:52:36,618 --> 00:52:37,649
So you turned...

1040
00:52:37,649 --> 00:52:39,788
into the lead's sister
in Episode 15.

1041
00:52:40,618 --> 00:52:41,788
Me?

1042
00:52:44,658 --> 00:52:47,359
But how could
a market store owner...

1043
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:48,958
become the lead's sister?

1044
00:52:49,728 --> 00:52:51,569
The lead suffers from amnesia.

1045
00:52:52,029 --> 00:52:53,629
So you will play a key role...

1046
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:56,969
where you reveal all the truth
about the female lead at the end.

1047
00:52:57,268 --> 00:52:59,239
And Director Ko
got rid of all your scenes...

1048
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:00,978
without talking to Ms. Kim.

1049
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:04,578
That's why Ms. Kim got upset
and came all the way here.

1050
00:53:06,879 --> 00:53:10,219
What if she really doesn't
write the last episode?

1051
00:53:10,219 --> 00:53:13,489
So are you saying Director Ko...

1052
00:53:14,018 --> 00:53:16,359
got rid of all my scenes...

1053
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,388
that Ms. Kim had put
a lot of effort into?

1054
00:53:29,138 --> 00:53:31,569
What's the matter, Ji Young?

1055
00:53:32,569 --> 00:53:35,509
Director Ko, is this about me?

1056
00:53:36,438 --> 00:53:38,908
How could you do such a thing
just because of me?

1057
00:53:38,908 --> 00:53:40,478
Even if you hate me,

1058
00:53:40,478 --> 00:53:42,518
you can't mix business
with your personal matters.

1059
00:53:43,078 --> 00:53:46,788
How could you change the script...

1060
00:53:46,788 --> 00:53:49,489
with her blood and sweat?

1061
00:53:49,989 --> 00:53:52,489
She must've had her reasons
to write all that.

1062
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:53,998
Ms. Kim Ji Young.

1063
00:53:55,058 --> 00:53:56,498
What are you talking about?

1064
00:53:57,498 --> 00:54:00,498
That's right.
I don't want you to be an actress.

1065
00:54:01,069 --> 00:54:04,268
But I would never do such a thing
because of you.

1066
00:54:04,768 --> 00:54:06,368
I just did it
because I didn't want the drama...

1067
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,239
to be ruined
with some stupid character.

1068
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:11,848
Our drama is about to be spoiled
because of the character now.

1069
00:54:16,949 --> 00:54:19,888
Is he saying that the drama is
about to be spoiled...

1070
00:54:19,888 --> 00:54:21,859
because of the character
I'm playing?

1071
00:54:23,618 --> 00:54:27,699
I don't think the writer wrote that
to spoil the drama.

1072
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:31,368
No. This is about me.

1073
00:54:31,429 --> 00:54:33,828
He's trying to stop me
from becoming an actress.

1074
00:54:35,569 --> 00:54:38,339
Yes, Ms. Kim.
Did you arrive home okay?

1075
00:54:38,868 --> 00:54:40,239
Wasn't the traffic bad?

1076
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:41,239
Director Ko.

1077
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:44,509
Are you calling
to ask me about the traffic?

1078
00:54:44,978 --> 00:54:46,109
No.

1079
00:54:46,109 --> 00:54:48,819
Ms. Kim,
I just read the script again.

1080
00:54:49,549 --> 00:54:51,919
I guess
I misunderstood your intention.

1081
00:54:52,949 --> 00:54:54,888
We will shoot the scenes right away.

1082
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:58,429
So could you please get us
the script for Episode 16 on time?

1083
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:02,699
Thank you, Ms. Kim.

1084
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:05,399
Please keep up the good work
until the end.

1085
00:55:05,399 --> 00:55:06,868
Okay. Bye.

1086
00:55:11,339 --> 00:55:14,339
Fine. Let's just do the scenes.

1087
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:16,879
I'll do it if I have to.

1088
00:55:26,419 --> 00:55:27,518
I'm...

1089
00:55:29,458 --> 00:55:30,958
I'm really sorry.

1090
00:55:33,328 --> 00:55:35,458
Had I known that you were my sister,

1091
00:55:36,929 --> 00:55:39,768
I wouldn't have revealed your lies.

1092
00:55:48,109 --> 00:55:49,239
It's all my fault.

1093
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,279
I'm so sorry.

1094
00:55:56,518 --> 00:55:58,518
Please wake up now.

1095
00:56:01,489 --> 00:56:03,188
Please wake up.

1096
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:08,129
Wake up.

1097
00:56:10,969 --> 00:56:14,239
- Aren't you going to cut it?
- Wake up.

1098
00:56:16,638 --> 00:56:17,638
Cut.

1099
00:56:18,268 --> 00:56:19,969
Wake up.

1100
00:56:24,179 --> 00:56:26,578
Stop crying.

1101
00:56:26,978 --> 00:56:29,348
Director Ko,
Ji Young is unbelievable.

1102
00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:31,949
I bet she was an actress
in her previous life.

1103
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:34,589
It made me cry too.

1104
00:56:34,819 --> 00:56:36,188
Stop crying.

1105
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:47,169
Ms. Baek Mi Ja!

1106
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:49,498
You can't address him like that.

1107
00:56:50,069 --> 00:56:53,339
He's Director Ko Pil Seung.

1108
00:56:53,339 --> 00:56:54,379
He's a director.

1109
00:56:54,379 --> 00:56:55,978
Ms. Baek, I have a meeting.

1110
00:56:55,978 --> 00:56:57,978
- Next time.
- Mr. Jang.

1111
00:56:58,078 --> 00:57:00,109
I'm expecting a visitor.

1112
00:57:02,348 --> 00:57:03,549
My gosh.

1113
00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:06,348
I didn't know Ko Pil Seung
could be so influential.

1114
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:09,419
What if no one
at the broadcasting station...

1115
00:57:09,419 --> 00:57:11,929
wants to hire Do Do because of him?

1116
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:15,799
They say,
if you want to eat the fruit,

1117
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,029
you must climb the tree.

1118
00:57:17,029 --> 00:57:20,029
This isn't a matter of pride now.

1119
00:57:22,399 --> 00:57:24,609
If I want to survive,
I have no choice.

1120
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,379
That's right. Fine.

1121
00:57:30,009 --> 00:57:32,078
Honey, we're almost there.

1122
00:57:32,078 --> 00:57:33,779
My place is over there.

1123
00:57:34,179 --> 00:57:35,179
Really?

1124
00:57:36,919 --> 00:57:39,118
This neighborhood
looks somewhat familiar.

1125
00:57:40,649 --> 00:57:42,288
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

1126
00:57:42,388 --> 00:57:45,158
You don't have to.
It's right over there.

1127
00:57:45,989 --> 00:57:48,399
Still, you should go in first.

1128
00:57:48,399 --> 00:57:49,958
I'll go home after you go in.

1129
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:52,828
No, you should go first.

1130
00:57:52,828 --> 00:57:54,399
I want to see you leave.

1131
00:57:55,169 --> 00:57:57,438
No, you go in ahead.

1132
00:58:05,279 --> 00:58:06,908
Gosh, I'm so shy.

1133
00:58:26,529 --> 00:58:28,899
Oh, dear. This is so embarrassing.

1134
00:58:31,368 --> 00:58:33,208
What? Isn't that Myung Dong?

1135
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:35,609
Hey, Myung Dong.

1136
00:58:35,609 --> 00:58:36,708
My goodness.

1137
00:58:37,379 --> 00:58:40,679
Hey, you... My gosh.
Maybe I shouldn't have called you.

1138
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:41,748
Mom.

1139
00:58:42,348 --> 00:58:43,779
- Gosh.
- Mom?

1140
00:58:46,989 --> 00:58:49,188
I should've brought some fruit.

1141
00:58:49,188 --> 00:58:51,759
Seriously, there's no need.

1142
00:58:51,759 --> 00:58:53,989
We don't need anything like that.

1143
00:58:54,188 --> 00:58:57,399
You can just come in for some tea.

1144
00:58:57,498 --> 00:59:00,029
How would I let you just leave
when you came all the way here?

1145
00:59:00,429 --> 00:59:03,739
You can drop the formalities
when you meet your girlfriend's family.

1146
00:59:03,938 --> 00:59:05,408
But still...

1147
00:59:06,868 --> 00:59:07,978
Just go in.

1148
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:09,978
No one can stop my mom.

1149
00:59:16,848 --> 00:59:17,989
Hang on.

1150
00:59:18,489 --> 00:59:20,518
I think this is the house
from back then.

1151
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,328
- What's happening?
- Oh, dear. Seriously.

1152
00:59:24,328 --> 00:59:27,058
I told you it was okay.

1153
00:59:27,058 --> 00:59:30,058
Just make yourself comfortable.

1154
00:59:30,058 --> 00:59:31,228
Once you become my son-in-law,

1155
00:59:31,228 --> 00:59:33,598
you'll come here all the time.

1156
00:59:33,598 --> 00:59:35,498
What makes you so uncomfortable?

1157
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:37,169
- Come on.
- Gosh.

1158
00:59:37,169 --> 00:59:38,938
Myung Dong, come on in.

1159
00:59:39,408 --> 00:59:40,438
Okay.

1160
00:59:46,609 --> 00:59:48,518
Is he Myung Dong's boyfriend?

1161
00:59:51,219 --> 00:59:53,589
Ms. So seems so pleased.

1162
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:57,359
- Yes.
- Come here.

1163
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:58,629
Hey, Sun Young.

1164
00:59:58,629 --> 01:00:00,888
Hurry and make some tea.

1165
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:02,399
I'll get some fruit.

1166
01:00:05,228 --> 01:00:06,498
Hurry.

1167
01:00:06,998 --> 01:00:08,239
You fools.

1168
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:12,009
Why is this all we have?

1169
01:00:12,069 --> 01:00:13,868
Do you want me to go buy some?

1170
01:00:13,868 --> 01:00:16,708
I should get some fancy fruit
like melons and apple mangoes.

1171
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:19,949
Hey, it will take too long.

1172
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:23,649
He kept refusing to come in,
so it was hard to get him in here.

1173
01:00:23,649 --> 01:00:24,819
We have no other choice.

1174
01:00:24,819 --> 01:00:26,848
You should wash the grapes.

1175
01:00:26,848 --> 01:00:28,058
I'll peel the apple.

1176
01:00:30,188 --> 01:00:31,688
- By the way, Mother,
- Yes.

1177
01:00:33,058 --> 01:00:34,598
how long have they been dating?

1178
01:00:35,029 --> 01:00:38,629
I think he's the guy
who got her a ring...

1179
01:00:38,629 --> 01:00:40,669
with the big diamond the other day.

1180
01:00:41,038 --> 01:00:42,638
- Really?
- Yes.

1181
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:46,038
But I've never seen her
wear the diamond ring.

1182
01:00:46,169 --> 01:00:49,038
The diamond is too big,

1183
01:00:49,038 --> 01:00:51,149
so he was going to have it reset.

1184
01:00:51,149 --> 01:00:53,379
Then they broke up for a while.

1185
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:54,618
Really?

1186
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:57,518
Why did they break up
while the ring was being reset?

1187
01:00:57,518 --> 01:00:59,748
- My point, exactly.
- My gosh.

1188
01:00:59,748 --> 01:01:01,288
By the way, hey,

1189
01:01:01,288 --> 01:01:04,359
if he can get her a ring
with such a big diamond,

1190
01:01:05,029 --> 01:01:07,158
that means he's really rich.

1191
01:01:07,658 --> 01:01:10,158
Mom, are you sure it's the same guy?

1192
01:01:10,158 --> 01:01:12,728
What? Yes, I think it's him.

1193
01:01:13,429 --> 01:01:16,699
Hey, things are going so well
for Myung Dong now.

1194
01:01:16,699 --> 01:01:17,839
She became a screenwriter,

1195
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,908
and now she's dating a decent guy.

1196
01:01:19,908 --> 01:01:20,908
I know.

1197
01:01:20,908 --> 01:01:23,408
You're right.
He must be the one for her.

1198
01:01:23,408 --> 01:01:25,179
- I know.
- I'm so happy for her.

1199
01:01:26,978 --> 01:01:29,219
Mom, but he looks...

1200
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:32,449
a lot younger
than Myung Dong, right?

1201
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:36,188
You're right. I guess
he's younger than her.

1202
01:01:37,018 --> 01:01:40,029
You know what?
Myung Dong actually looks...

1203
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,328
young for her age.

1204
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,759
My gosh.

1205
01:01:42,759 --> 01:01:46,629
I shouldn't have been so harsh
on Myung Dong before.

1206
01:01:46,699 --> 01:01:48,669
I didn't know she would find...

1207
01:01:48,669 --> 01:01:50,638
the right guy for her like this.

1208
01:01:50,638 --> 01:01:52,069
Please, Mother.

1209
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:54,879
That's how good she is.

1210
01:01:54,879 --> 01:01:55,938
I know.

1211
01:02:04,848 --> 01:02:06,919
Come on, lady.

1212
01:02:07,518 --> 01:02:10,719
How could you bring
a family with three kids?

1213
01:02:18,328 --> 01:02:20,569
Then is Myung Dong Dae Chung's aunt?

1214
01:02:21,469 --> 01:02:22,598
What now?

1215
01:02:23,268 --> 01:02:25,308
Am I supposed to tell them
that I'm Do Ra's brother?

1216
01:02:26,969 --> 01:02:28,009
Darn it.

1217
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:31,779
Honey, what's wrong?

1218
01:02:32,408 --> 01:02:33,578
Don't be nervous.

1219
01:02:33,808 --> 01:02:34,919
Well...

1220
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:38,118
- It's not that. I'm...
- Goodness.

1221
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:40,319
- Come on out.
- Sure.

1222
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:42,518
No, please stay seated.

1223
01:02:42,518 --> 01:02:44,658
- But...
- Make yourself at home.

1224
01:02:44,658 --> 01:02:46,089
- Right.
- All right.

1225
01:02:46,489 --> 01:02:48,328
- Here you go.
- Pass the fruit.

1226
01:02:48,658 --> 01:02:50,429
Give me those as well.

1227
01:02:51,029 --> 01:02:53,268
Gosh, we made you wait, didn't we?

1228
01:02:53,268 --> 01:02:54,739
Pass me those along with the forks.

1229
01:02:54,739 --> 01:02:55,768
All right.

1230
01:02:56,899 --> 01:02:59,538
Goodness.
We didn't have a lot to serve...

1231
01:02:59,538 --> 01:03:00,739
with this being all too sudden.

1232
01:03:00,739 --> 01:03:03,879
Have some fruit. Go ahead.

1233
01:03:04,808 --> 01:03:06,179
Thank you.

1234
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:07,609
Right.

1235
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:09,879
So how old are you?

1236
01:03:10,748 --> 01:03:12,649
Right. Do Sik...

1237
01:03:13,018 --> 01:03:14,989
is seven years younger than me.

1238
01:03:15,618 --> 01:03:17,188
- What?
- Seven years?

1239
01:03:18,929 --> 01:03:21,458
Gosh, that's nothing.

1240
01:03:21,529 --> 01:03:24,629
As if age is a problem these days.

1241
01:03:24,728 --> 01:03:26,498
I saw on the news recently...

1242
01:03:26,498 --> 01:03:28,038
that we live in a time...

1243
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:29,569
where age barriers
have been broken down.

1244
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:31,339
You're right.

1245
01:03:31,339 --> 01:03:33,408
What do you do for a living?

1246
01:03:33,408 --> 01:03:34,509
Well, I...

1247
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:37,578
I'm a freelancer.

1248
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:41,279
- I see.
- A freelancer?

1249
01:03:41,279 --> 01:03:43,779
What on earth is a freelancer?

1250
01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:46,089
Mom, it's a good thing.

1251
01:03:46,118 --> 01:03:48,118
I've always thought
that freelancers are cool.

1252
01:03:48,118 --> 01:03:49,118
I see.

1253
01:03:50,489 --> 01:03:51,828
- Myung Dong.
- Yes?

1254
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,388
Isn't he the guy...

1255
01:03:54,388 --> 01:03:56,498
who once gave you the diamond ring?

1256
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:58,469
What? Yes.

1257
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:00,299
Will you stop it?

1258
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:03,638
Goodness me.

1259
01:04:03,938 --> 01:04:07,408
I can't believe Myung Dong
snagged a rich boy.

1260
01:04:09,908 --> 01:04:11,478
Are you home?

1261
01:04:13,609 --> 01:04:14,779
Are you home?

1262
01:04:14,779 --> 01:04:17,179
Wait. Whose voice is that?

1263
01:04:17,449 --> 01:04:19,788
Isn't that the darn witch?

1264
01:04:19,788 --> 01:04:22,259
- Honey.
- Why is she here at this hour?

1265
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:23,618
- I'll head out there.
- My gosh.

1266
01:04:23,919 --> 01:04:25,658
- How dare she...
- Don't mind us.

1267
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,529
- What...
- Gosh, hello.

1268
01:04:28,529 --> 01:04:30,598
The door was open. Goodness me.

1269
01:04:31,029 --> 01:04:33,899
I came by to apologize.

1270
01:04:33,899 --> 01:04:36,839
The last time I was here,
I was too upset...

1271
01:04:36,938 --> 01:04:39,438
that I wronged you
in the worst way possible.

1272
01:04:39,808 --> 01:04:41,538
I'm terribly sorry.

1273
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:44,009
By the way,
is Director Ko home from work?

1274
01:04:46,078 --> 01:04:47,779
- Mom?
- What?

1275
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:52,489
Do Sik, why are you here?

1276
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:54,549
What?

1277
01:04:54,989 --> 01:04:57,158
Mom? Who's your mom?

1278
01:04:59,029 --> 01:05:01,259
Is she your mom?

1279
01:05:08,169 --> 01:05:10,868
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1280
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:45,969
But I really want to marry Mr. Ko.

1281
01:05:46,308 --> 01:05:47,908
Could there be a way?

1282
01:05:48,009 --> 01:05:49,308
Yes, that's it.

1283
01:05:49,308 --> 01:05:51,609
That way, I could marry him.

1284
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:54,179
I'm sorry to ask,
but is Ma Ri at your place?

1285
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:55,518
Ma Ri's gone missing?

1286
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:57,879
Here's a script.
Get practicing right away.

1287
01:05:57,879 --> 01:05:59,288
You have an audition tomorrow.

1288
01:05:59,449 --> 01:06:01,089
If I become an actor,

1289
01:06:01,089 --> 01:06:03,419
will that cause
a great deal of loss for you?

1290
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:04,788
Ji Young, you know.

1291
01:06:04,788 --> 01:06:06,188
You know how Park Do Ra died.

1292
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:08,328
Nothing will bring me down.

1293
01:06:08,328 --> 01:06:11,259
I'm Kim Ji Young, not Park Do Ra.

1294
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:14,839
