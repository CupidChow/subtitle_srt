00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:07,452
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:11,711
No one knows you better than I do.

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,541
Even if you did something wrong,

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,180
I'm sure it wasn't anything serious.

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,821
That's not who you are.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,651
That's who I am.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,961
I'm someone who would do
something terribly wrong.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,161
Do you have any idea what I did?

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,136
Do you even realize
how horrible I am?

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,961
Do you know what I did to you?

11
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:35,071
I deceived you!

12
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:39,040
(Episode 32)

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,711
Honey, what's wrong?

14
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,110
Are you all right?

15
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:48,381
Honey, are you sure...

16
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:50,381
you're all right?

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,190
Honey.

18
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,660
I want a divorce.

19
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,230
What?

20
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:08,400
What did you just say?

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,501
Did you just ask for a divorce?

22
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,410
Yes.

23
00:01:25,421 --> 00:01:27,320
I don't think...

24
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,720
I can live with you anymore.

25
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:32,690
Please agree to the divorce.

26
00:01:33,891 --> 00:01:35,160
But honey...

27
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:37,460
A divorce?

28
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,830
You can't live with me anymore?

29
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:42,801
Why would you say that...

30
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:44,371
when we were talking
about Sun Young?

31
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:48,641
Your friendship with her
was on the verge of being ruined,

32
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:51,440
so I went to see her to help you.

33
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,151
Did that make you angry enough...

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,110
to ask for a divorce?

35
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,220
This isn't something sudden.

36
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,820
I've been thinking...

37
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:08,630
about a divorce...

38
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,690
for quite some time.

39
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:12,901
What?

40
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:14,600
For quite some time?

41
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:17,301
Well,

42
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,440
living with you...

43
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:22,841
has been a nightmare.

44
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:25,440
Continuing our marriage this way...

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,651
isn't fair to you,
and I'm terribly sorry.

46
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,151
I'll move out with Ma Ri...

47
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:36,651
and find a place to live.

48
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:38,696
Please allow that.

49
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,991
Honey.

50
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,001
My gosh. What did I just hear?

51
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,811
A divorce?

52
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:58,010
- Honey.
- Gosh.

53
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,280
Goodness me.

54
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,181
Auntie!

55
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,181
Gosh.

56
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,891
What is it? What's going on?

57
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:12,261
Auntie, it's bad.

58
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:15,260
Soo Yeon asked Chairman Gong
for a divorce.

59
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:18,701
What kind of nonsense is that?

60
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:22,476
It's not nonsense.
That happened for real.

61
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,331
Soo Yeon just left the house,

62
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:26,670
and Chairman Gong chased after her.

63
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,211
What?

64
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,781
Honey!

65
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,410
Soo Yeon!

66
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,220
A divorce?

67
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:49,861
What on earth is going on?

68
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,331
Did you two argue?

69
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:56,446
No, and it's nothing.
Please don't be concerned.

70
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,040
Why would she ask for a divorce
when nothing's going on?

71
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:02,711
Throughout your marriage,
she never mentioned it once.

72
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,910
Did you upset her in any way?

73
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,611
Or have you done...

74
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:10,051
something bad behind her back?

75
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:11,280
Is that what she found out?

76
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,781
Something bad behind her back?
It's not like that.

77
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:18,361
Jin Taek isn't one to be unfaithful.

78
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,361
Unbelievable.

79
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,291
Where could your mind be
to make you think of that?

80
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:28,471
Well, Soo Yeon left the house
at this late hour.

81
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:31,030
This isn't normal.

82
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:34,771
She'll be back
after getting some fresh air.

83
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:37,570
I'll talk to her when she gets home,

84
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,041
so don't let this bother you.

85
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,481
Please don't be concerned.

86
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,791
It's not like we bully her
or treat her like a maid.

87
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,390
You've got to be kidding me.

88
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,991
Who is she to ask for a divorce?

89
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,031
That ungrateful thing.

90
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:58,760
Tell me about it.

91
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,811
Is something going on?

92
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:10,541
Why are you out in the living room?

93
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,041
Soo Yeon asked Jin Taek
for a divorce?

94
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,051
Yes. Shocking, isn't it?

95
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,880
Why did she ask for one
out of the blue?

96
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,921
That's the million-dollar question.

97
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,320
Since Ma Ri wasn't getting better,

98
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,320
your aunt said something
a while back.

99
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,966
To ensure Chairman Gong had an heir,

100
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,721
she suggested he hire a surrogate
or find a mistress,

101
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:29,190
and she never
mentioned divorce then.

102
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,231
I say there's only one reason.

103
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:34,260
Chairman Gong denied it,

104
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,070
but I say he had an affair.

105
00:05:36,271 --> 00:05:37,731
He saw someone else.

106
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,101
Jin Taek?

107
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,371
You're wrong.

108
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:44,340
Why else would Soo Yeon
ask for a divorce and then leave?

109
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,981
Jin Dan. Look into it, just in case.

110
00:05:48,111 --> 00:05:49,580
What if they get divorced...

111
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,556
and a young woman
moves in and has a son?

112
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,351
That will cause a huge headache.

113
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:56,320
- I guess?
- I'm right.

114
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,190
If it's the truth,
we must do something...

115
00:05:59,221 --> 00:06:00,661
to separate the two.

116
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:05,007
We can't let Soo Yeon get divorced.

117
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,260
It's better for us...

118
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,671
if she stays
since she can't have more babies.

119
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,622
(My darling Soo Yeon)

120
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:20,940
It's me. Where are you?

121
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:23,181
I'm at a hotel.

122
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,121
What? At a hotel?

123
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,421
Which hotel? I'll come and get you.

124
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:31,621
No.

125
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,991
I won't go back home.

126
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,931
I'll talk to Ma Ri.

127
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,070
Call when the divorce papers
are ready.

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,101
Why are you doing this
all of a sudden? Why do you want...

129
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:49,541
Honey. Hello?

130
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,481
What is up with her?

131
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,421
Why is she doing this?

132
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,020
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please...

133
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:16,200
Auntie.

134
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:19,001
Soo Yeon didn't come home
last night.

135
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:21,301
It looks really serious.

136
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:23,070
She must really want a divorce.

137
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,010
What do we do?
She won't take my calls.

138
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,241
What?

139
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,280
She spent the night elsewhere
when she lives with an elder?

140
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:35,051
What is she thinking,
ignoring your calls?

141
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:40,390
Chairman Gong. Ma Ri's mom
didn't come home last night?

142
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,431
Will you tell me what's going on?

143
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:49,130
Is Soo Yeon really trying to
get a divorce?

144
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:52,940
No one's getting divorced.
That won't happen.

145
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,911
I'll talk things out with Soo Yeon.

146
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:57,311
Don't worry too much.

147
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:59,181
I'm going out.

148
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:05,851
The arrogant brat.

149
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:09,590
She hasn't done us any good
since she married into our family.

150
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,491
I tried to put up with her
and accept her, but I can't anymore.

151
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,130
If she wants a divorce that badly,
she can get one.

152
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:19,200
The darn thing.

153
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,001
Oh, no. What if
they actually do get divorced?

154
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,200
What are they
suddenly fighting about?

155
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,541
I'm dead curious.

156
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,950
What was all that about?

157
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:48,536
Mom, did you leave home?

158
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,836
Did you really ask Dad
for a divorce?

159
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,300
Where are you?

160
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:55,670
You really asked Dad for a divorce?

161
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:58,971
- Yes.
- Why?

162
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,410
Because I felt so bad for him.

163
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,940
Hiding Pil Seung's
true identity from him...

164
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,550
was so hard, you know.

165
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,751
It's too hard on me
and unfair on your dad, so I...

166
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,796
Dad doesn't know anything.

167
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,661
I'll be more careful, Mom.

168
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:21,721
Please, don't get divorced.

169
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,430
No, Ma Ri.
Being careful won't work anymore.

170
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,800
Pil Seung's family knows,

171
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,501
and secrets always come out.

172
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,241
One day, your dad...

173
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:40,280
will learn the truth.

174
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:43,550
When he does,

175
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,650
he will hurt so much.

176
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,251
So Ma Ri,

177
00:09:52,661 --> 00:09:55,160
I need to go far away
before that happens.

178
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:58,160
You're grown up.

179
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,461
You understand, don't you?

180
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,640
Mom. Don't you think
about Dad or me?

181
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,371
Who will I live with
when you get divorced?

182
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:11,170
What about Dad?
You're all he cares about.

183
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:15,081
Ma Ri.

184
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,410
Shall we move far away together?

185
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,221
I don't want to.

186
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,220
Why should I leave?
Why should I live with just you?

187
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,950
I want to live with Dad too.

188
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,160
Why would you split us apart?

189
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,060
How would Dad look
if you were to do this now?

190
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,231
Why are you so mean?

191
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,071
Yes.

192
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:39,501
I'm mean. I'm a bad person
and that's why...

193
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:42,941
I don't deserve to be
with someone as nice as your dad.

194
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:46,410
- That's why, Ma Ri...
- So...

195
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:50,251
you must get your way
and get divorced?

196
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,550
Ma Ri.

197
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:58,091
Try to understand.

198
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,091
Okay.

199
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,930
You do whatever you want.

200
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,530
I'll live however I want as well,
so don't regret it later.

201
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,670
Ma Ri.

202
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:16,170
Gosh. How I missed the smell...

203
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:19,280
of my home country Korea.

204
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,020
Hello.

205
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,790
There's a vacancy?

206
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,760
Excuse me. You dropped your wallet.

207
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,861
I'll call you back later.

208
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,530
Goodness. Thanks so much.

209
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:41,601
- Thank you.
- Sure.

210
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:44,030
Thank you.

211
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:49,741
Koreans are so kind and gentle.

212
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,670
They even return wallets.

213
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,510
Gosh...

214
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:06,290
Sun Young. Your phone's ringing.

215
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,790
Okay.

216
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,800
Hello?

217
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,571
Oh, hi.

218
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,201
Our annex?

219
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,341
Right now?

220
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:21,971
Sure, come over.

221
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,981
Mother. Did you tell the realtor
we have a room for rent?

222
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,711
Yes, I did.

223
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,150
Why leave it empty?

224
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,150
Let's make all the money we can.

225
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:36,121
You're right.

226
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,091
I asked the realtor
to find us a male tenant.

227
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,260
Let's not rent to women ever again.

228
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,530
I think that room is cursed.

229
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,101
All the tenants were gold-diggers.

230
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,701
Come in.

231
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,270
Look around.

232
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:10,521
You won't find a cleaner
or cheaper place...

233
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:12,221
in the neighborhood.

234
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,390
I'll rent this place, then.

235
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,560
How big is your family?

236
00:13:19,531 --> 00:13:21,231
Is there anyone else?

237
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,900
No. I'll live alone.

238
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,941
I see.

239
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:27,571
Gosh.

240
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:32,640
Chairman Gong
really isn't seeing anyone?

241
00:13:32,781 --> 00:13:34,540
Did you check properly?

242
00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:38,150
Yes. I was thorough and he's clean.

243
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,081
- He's clean?
- Yes.

244
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:44,091
How can he work
and never even go to a bar?

245
00:13:44,421 --> 00:13:46,666
He plays golf for work,
but does nothing else.

246
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,867
He's too squeaky clean.

247
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:49,591
- For real?
- Yes.

248
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,461
Jin Taek's really admirable.

249
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,231
Why does he live like that, though?

250
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,801
I don't get it.

251
00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:59,871
Not everyone's like you, you know.

252
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:04,211
Why did Soo Yeon ask for a divorce
before leaving the home?

253
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,581
I thought it was
because your brother had an affair.

254
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,880
What could it be if not that?

255
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:12,351
It's not about Jin Taek.
It's about his wife.

256
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,180
Look into her.

257
00:14:14,281 --> 00:14:15,520
Soo Yeon?

258
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:18,121
What could it be about?

259
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:20,290
I'm so curious.

260
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,871
What are you doing here?

261
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,800
You brat.

262
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,871
Don't glare at me
because you fought Soo Yeon.

263
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:44,751
Gosh. The sikhye's nice and cool.

264
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,820
Say what you want and leave.

265
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,321
I have to cook dinner.

266
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:52,050
Do you have to be so cold?

267
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,691
Fine. I'll keep it short
and then go.

268
00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:59,461
I'm here because...

269
00:15:00,031 --> 00:15:02,331
Soo Yeon left home
demanding a divorce.

270
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,201
What?

271
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,371
What?

272
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:11,670
What did you say?
Ma Ri's mom will get divorced?

273
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,487
- Why?
- Mother.

274
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:15,751
What?

275
00:15:15,911 --> 00:15:17,980
Oh, sorry.

276
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,696
I got in the way
of two friends trying to talk.

277
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,451
- Sorry. I apologize.
- No, it's fine.

278
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,060
We all know each other.

279
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,991
- Please have a seat.
- What?

280
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,961
So...

281
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,300
are you sure...

282
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,900
Ma Ri's mom left home
saying she'd get divorced?

283
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,700
Why?

284
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,501
I'm here because I don't know that.

285
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:43,271
She asked Chairman Gong
for a divorce,

286
00:15:43,271 --> 00:15:45,170
but she wouldn't say why.

287
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,840
She just says
that's what she's been thinking of.

288
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,350
Chairman Gong is
having a meltdown in shock.

289
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,880
He's a respected man,
so he just can't show it.

290
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,551
So she's been thinking...

291
00:15:57,551 --> 00:15:59,791
about getting a divorce
for a long time?

292
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,590
Yes. I was surprised to hear that.

293
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,290
So I was wondering
if you knew anything, Sun Young.

294
00:16:05,761 --> 00:16:08,200
Did Soo Yeon ever mention divorce?

295
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,501
You should know.

296
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,971
I don't know.

297
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:12,970
I've never heard anything like that.

298
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,271
And I don't care
whether she gets divorced or not.

299
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:18,441
If that's what you're here for,
I want you to leave.

300
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:21,081
I know you two had a fight,

301
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:23,050
but this is a serious issue.

302
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,880
Just tell me
if there's anything you know.

303
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:27,951
Is it because...

304
00:16:28,891 --> 00:16:30,421
Soo Yeon is seeing someone else?

305
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:31,421
- Hey!
- My goodness.

306
00:16:31,421 --> 00:16:34,321
You startled me.
Why are you yelling at me?

307
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,130
You're just saying
whatever comes to your mind.

308
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:41,331
Do you mean
Soo Yeon is having an affair?

309
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,871
If that's not the case, I get it.
You don't have to yell.

310
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:48,470
Excuse me, Ms. Hong.

311
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,871
I think it was wrong of you
to say such a thing.

312
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,456
You know that's the last thing
she would do.

313
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,450
There's no reason for them
to get divorced,

314
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,581
so I was just asking.

315
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,991
What's wrong with asking that
at a time like this?

316
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:06,260
You're making me look bad.

317
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,566
Fine. Just get off
your high horse, will you?

318
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,890
I should get going.

319
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,030
Wait.

320
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,900
I just don't know
what's got in her head.

321
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,870
How could you say
such a horrible thing?

322
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,481
So she felt guilty
about Pil Seung...

323
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,981
and asked for a divorce.

324
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:37,427
Soo Yeon,
that brat with no scruples.

325
00:17:37,451 --> 00:17:40,090
Whether she gets divorced or not,
it has nothing to do with me.

326
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:47,701
That's not true.

327
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,070
It can have something to do
with her.

328
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,141
I feel bad for Ma Ri though.

329
00:17:56,971 --> 00:18:00,981
She has the body of a grown woman,
but her mind is 12 years old.

330
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:03,681
(Soju Boots)

331
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:05,251
Director Ko, what do you think
of this place?

332
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,080
It looks nice. Let's do it here.

333
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Okay.

334
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,420
Film the exterior of this place.

335
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,891
Okay.

336
00:18:15,731 --> 00:18:17,030
Isn't that Ma Ri?

337
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,060
No, that can't be her.

338
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,901
Why would Ma Ri go to a club
like that alone at this hour?

339
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:30,070
Director Ko, shall we go now?

340
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:31,510
Okay.

341
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,551
So Ma Ri's mom
wants to get a divorce.

342
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:41,820
I guess she has
the slightest bit of conscience.

343
00:18:42,491 --> 00:18:45,796
We found out that she abandoned
Pil Seung, so she had no choice.

344
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,590
There are no secrets in the world.

345
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:52,560
By the way,
I feel bad for Chairman Gong.

346
00:18:53,231 --> 00:18:55,160
I feel bad for him
that he's getting divorced,

347
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,770
but I'll still feel bad for him
even if he stays married.

348
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:00,340
And it's not like...

349
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,670
we can go and tell him...

350
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,870
that his wife is
Pil Seung's birth mother.

351
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,110
Mom.

352
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,241
What?

353
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,681
Anyway, if they get divorced,

354
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:13,381
what will they do about Ma Ri?

355
00:19:14,481 --> 00:19:17,551
Ma Ri isn't an ordinary girl,
so I'm really worried about her.

356
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:19,691
She's like a 12-year-old kid.

357
00:19:20,021 --> 00:19:21,620
How would they get divorced...

358
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,260
when they had
such an immature child?

359
00:19:26,301 --> 00:19:29,570
What are you talking about?
Who's getting divorced?

360
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,701
Ma Ri's mom...

361
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:35,241
asked Chairman Gong for a divorce.

362
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,471
I guess
she couldn't take it anymore...

363
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:41,110
after we found out...

364
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,251
that she was your birth mother.

365
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,880
However shameless she might be,

366
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,521
she can't just hide it forever.

367
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,050
Pil Seung, did you have dinner?

368
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,620
If you didn't,
come here and have a seat.

369
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,290
I'll get you some rice and soup.

370
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,860
I had dinner. Just finish your meal.

371
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,231
I'll be in my room.

372
00:19:56,231 --> 00:19:57,931
- Okay.
- All right.

373
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:01,461
Mom.

374
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:04,330
Stop saying things like that
to Pil Seung.

375
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,770
What did I do?

376
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:10,041
It's not like I meant to tell him.

377
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,971
He just overheard me
as he walked in.

378
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:13,540
What am I supposed to do?

379
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:16,050
Ma Ri, dinner is ready.

380
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,681
Where did she go? My goodness.

381
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,920
"I'm leaving home."

382
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,721
"I will live recklessly
as I please."

383
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:29,391
"Don't look for me."

384
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:32,600
What is this all about?

385
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,330
I can't believe this.

386
00:20:49,178 --> 00:20:50,919
What brings you here?

387
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:54,489
Did you honestly think
I didn't know you were here?

388
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:57,559
I'll have Lawyer Kang
take care of the divorce papers.

389
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,088
I said I'd see you after that.

390
00:21:01,729 --> 00:21:03,769
Why are you being like this?

391
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:06,068
You should at least tell me why.

392
00:21:06,729 --> 00:21:08,969
Does there have to be a reason?

393
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,939
I'm just sick and tired
of living with you.

394
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,179
I don't want to live
with you anymore.

395
00:21:16,848 --> 00:21:20,249
What? You don't want
to live with me anymore?

396
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,249
You're still young.

397
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:27,318
You will find someone nice...

398
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:29,419
for you.

399
00:21:30,729 --> 00:21:32,789
Are you listening
to what you're saying?

400
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,426
(Auntie)

401
00:21:37,366 --> 00:21:38,605
Hello?

402
00:21:40,276 --> 00:21:43,375
What? Ma Ri is missing?

403
00:22:00,655 --> 00:22:01,971
Director Ko.

404
00:22:01,995 --> 00:22:04,326
Did you hear from Ma Ri?

405
00:22:05,326 --> 00:22:07,135
Ma Ri is missing.

406
00:22:08,366 --> 00:22:10,466
She left a note
and ran away from home.

407
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:20,546
Ms. Jang, what do you mean
Ma Ri is missing?

408
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:22,145
She ran away from home?

409
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:28,685
Okay. I'll look into it
and get back to you.

410
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:34,869
(Ma Ri)

411
00:22:35,626 --> 00:22:39,425
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone,

412
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,095
and you will be charged
for the call.

413
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:43,135
Where did she go?

414
00:22:50,205 --> 00:22:51,476
That's right.

415
00:22:52,376 --> 00:22:53,816
It was Ma Ri.

416
00:22:54,475 --> 00:22:56,115
I wasn't mistaken.

417
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:01,685
Ms. Jang, I think I know
where Ma Ri is.

418
00:23:16,165 --> 00:23:18,066
Are you here alone?

419
00:23:18,635 --> 00:23:20,576
Are you alone?

420
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:22,675
- Yes.
- Do you want to join us?

421
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:28,645
No.

422
00:23:28,645 --> 00:23:30,516
Just join us
and hang out with my friends.

423
00:23:30,516 --> 00:23:32,616
- I don't want to.
- What's wrong with that?

424
00:23:32,616 --> 00:23:33,816
Hey!

425
00:23:34,685 --> 00:23:36,716
She said no.
What do you think you're doing?

426
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:38,062
Who are you?

427
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:40,425
She's my little sister. Get lost.

428
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,966
Pil Seung, how did you know
I was here?

429
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:48,195
Ma Ri, let's get out of here.

430
00:23:48,195 --> 00:23:49,466
Let's talk outside.

431
00:23:51,405 --> 00:23:53,105
Ma Ri!

432
00:23:54,276 --> 00:23:56,675
Pil Seung, did you tell Mom?

433
00:23:58,576 --> 00:24:00,715
What are you doing here?

434
00:24:00,715 --> 00:24:01,975
Your phone is turned off.

435
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:04,016
Do you even know
how worried I've been?

436
00:24:04,715 --> 00:24:06,185
Let's talk outside.

437
00:24:06,385 --> 00:24:07,532
Come with me.

438
00:24:07,556 --> 00:24:10,116
Okay. Gosh, it hurts.

439
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,326
My gosh.

440
00:24:13,026 --> 00:24:15,425
Ma Ri, look at yourself.

441
00:24:15,425 --> 00:24:17,026
What's with this outfit?

442
00:24:17,026 --> 00:24:18,925
Why are you being like this?

443
00:24:21,235 --> 00:24:22,796
Did you drink?

444
00:24:23,165 --> 00:24:24,905
Yes. I had a drink.

445
00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:26,635
Why? Can't I drink?

446
00:24:26,635 --> 00:24:28,475
I'm 28 and an adult.

447
00:24:28,475 --> 00:24:31,076
- I can drink if I want to.
- Why you...

448
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:32,675
Is a beating what you want?

449
00:24:32,675 --> 00:24:34,746
Says the one who deserves it more!

450
00:24:35,816 --> 00:24:37,516
You abandoned Pil Seung...

451
00:24:37,516 --> 00:24:39,915
and now me. You're choosing
to live as you please.

452
00:24:39,915 --> 00:24:41,155
I'm going to do the same.

453
00:24:41,155 --> 00:24:43,361
I'm going to do everything I want!

454
00:24:43,385 --> 00:24:44,685
Gong Ma Ri.

455
00:24:45,086 --> 00:24:46,925
You're in no position
to raise your voice.

456
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:49,395
You turned off your phone.

457
00:24:49,796 --> 00:24:51,966
Do you know how many people
were out looking for you?

458
00:24:52,096 --> 00:24:53,796
Yet, you're acting like
you did nothing wrong.

459
00:24:55,465 --> 00:24:57,066
I never said what I did was right.

460
00:24:58,006 --> 00:24:59,835
You just don't know how I feel.

461
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:05,276
The only people in this world
who can protect me are my parents.

462
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:09,915
So how am I supposed to manage
if they get a divorce?

463
00:25:11,086 --> 00:25:13,715
You're smart enough
to live by yourself,

464
00:25:13,715 --> 00:25:15,115
but I can't.

465
00:25:15,256 --> 00:25:18,885
I can't live in this world
without my parents.

466
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:31,905
Ms. Jang,

467
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:34,536
just look at us.

468
00:25:36,405 --> 00:25:38,175
I resent you...

469
00:25:39,175 --> 00:25:41,046
and so does Ma Ri.

470
00:25:42,116 --> 00:25:43,986
Is this what you wanted?

471
00:25:46,346 --> 00:25:48,486
You abandoned me
because life was tough,

472
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:50,586
and now you're abandoning Ma Ri...

473
00:25:50,586 --> 00:25:51,986
because the guilt
is too much to bear.

474
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,125
You'll never know...

475
00:25:56,356 --> 00:25:58,195
how miserable it is...

476
00:25:59,965 --> 00:26:02,036
to know that you were abandoned.

477
00:26:06,036 --> 00:26:07,776
Abandoning me should be enough.

478
00:26:09,036 --> 00:26:10,746
Don't do that to Ma Ri too.

479
00:26:11,306 --> 00:26:12,546
I won't let...

480
00:26:13,576 --> 00:26:15,445
Ma Ri get hurt.

481
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:19,585
I'm sorry.

482
00:26:21,086 --> 00:26:22,685
I'm sorry, Pil Seung.

483
00:26:24,155 --> 00:26:25,856
Pil Seung, don't.

484
00:26:25,856 --> 00:26:28,925
I'm sorry, so don't be mean to Mom.

485
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,165
She's crying.

486
00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:36,635
Ma Ri. Come here.

487
00:26:43,806 --> 00:26:45,246
I'm sorry, Ma Ri.

488
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:48,476
I'm sorry.

489
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:50,615
Don't apologize.

490
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:53,145
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

491
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:09,235
Goodness, Ma Ri.
I can't believe you ran away.

492
00:27:09,235 --> 00:27:11,266
Do you know how worried we all were?

493
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:14,036
Is Ma Ri all right?

494
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:19,105
Yes, we were able to find her
thanks to Pil Seung.

495
00:27:19,445 --> 00:27:20,816
What a relief.

496
00:27:21,645 --> 00:27:23,615
Ma Ri, go upstairs and rest.

497
00:27:23,846 --> 00:27:25,546
- Ms. Yeoju.
- Of course.

498
00:27:31,856 --> 00:27:33,486
Soo Yeon,
what is the meaning of this?

499
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:36,725
You demanded
a divorce out of nowhere...

500
00:27:36,725 --> 00:27:38,496
and caused this mess.

501
00:27:39,495 --> 00:27:41,266
Fine, divorce him.

502
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:43,566
It's for the best.

503
00:27:43,935 --> 00:27:46,306
Jin Taek, draw up
the papers tomorrow.

504
00:27:46,566 --> 00:27:48,935
How can you possibly live
with a woman like this?

505
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:51,506
She caused her own child
to run away from home...

506
00:27:51,506 --> 00:27:53,306
and turned this family upside down.

507
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:56,875
Don't you have any respect
for your elders?

508
00:27:57,415 --> 00:27:58,915
I'm sorry.

509
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:01,516
It was foolish of me.

510
00:28:03,185 --> 00:28:04,726
Honey, I'm sorry.

511
00:28:05,786 --> 00:28:07,956
I was wrong. Please forgive me.

512
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:12,996
See what I mean?
There she goes again.

513
00:28:13,266 --> 00:28:15,066
She demanded a divorce yesterday,

514
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:17,036
and now she's apologizing.

515
00:28:17,336 --> 00:28:19,266
What are you playing at?

516
00:28:22,306 --> 00:28:25,675
Fine. The divorce
is between you two anyway,

517
00:28:25,776 --> 00:28:27,615
but I'd like to know why.

518
00:28:28,475 --> 00:28:30,776
Why did you first ask for a divorce?

519
00:28:31,385 --> 00:28:33,286
What was the reason?

520
00:28:34,215 --> 00:28:35,956
I was wrong, Auntie.

521
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:42,695
Great Auntie, stop.

522
00:28:42,695 --> 00:28:44,495
My mom apologized.

523
00:28:44,495 --> 00:28:47,102
Why are you on her case
when she asked for forgiveness?

524
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:50,365
- Ma Ri, it's all right.
- Let's stop here.

525
00:28:51,036 --> 00:28:52,306
It's all right.

526
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:00,945
Chairman Gong, I think I know
why Soo Yeon's acting this way.

527
00:29:01,376 --> 00:29:03,016
It's depression
brought on by menopause.

528
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:06,391
Depression brought on by menopause?

529
00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:08,185
That's right.

530
00:29:08,185 --> 00:29:10,115
It's one of the symptoms
associated with menopause.

531
00:29:10,286 --> 00:29:12,286
You get hyper-sensitive, annoyed,

532
00:29:12,286 --> 00:29:14,756
and you can't be bothered
about anything.

533
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:17,302
Mood swings lead to women
demanding a divorce...

534
00:29:17,326 --> 00:29:19,496
and many couples end up getting one.

535
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,895
It's common these days,

536
00:29:22,336 --> 00:29:26,766
so take her to a doctor
for a consultation.

537
00:29:28,506 --> 00:29:30,806
The world sure is a better place
to live in these days.

538
00:29:31,576 --> 00:29:33,945
You suddenly get tired
of your life...

539
00:29:34,215 --> 00:29:36,076
and couples divorce because of it?

540
00:29:37,016 --> 00:29:38,746
Unbelievable.

541
00:29:39,046 --> 00:29:42,361
Chairman Gong,
how can you live with a woman...

542
00:29:42,385 --> 00:29:46,185
who might ask for a divorce
when she has another mood swing?

543
00:29:46,256 --> 00:29:48,756
Wouldn't it be better...

544
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:52,695
to grant her that wish
when she asks for one?

545
00:30:58,195 --> 00:31:01,742
Pil Seung, my parents
aren't getting a divorce,

546
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:03,536
and I owe it all to you.

547
00:31:03,836 --> 00:31:05,365
Thanks, Pil Seung.

548
00:31:05,705 --> 00:31:08,576
Also, I will not cause trouble
ever again.

549
00:31:08,635 --> 00:31:09,875
I promise.

550
00:31:16,298 --> 00:31:17,827
(Pil Seung, my parents
aren't getting a divorce.)

551
00:31:17,827 --> 00:31:19,527
(Kim Ji Young)

552
00:31:20,657 --> 00:31:21,986
Yes, Ji Young?

553
00:31:22,286 --> 00:31:23,526
Director?

554
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,857
Is this Director Ko Pil Seung?

555
00:31:26,524 --> 00:31:28,333
Gosh, yes.

556
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:31,264
You must be Ji Young's grandma.

557
00:31:31,734 --> 00:31:33,603
Yes, I am.

558
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:39,404
I was checking Ji Young's phone...

559
00:31:39,643 --> 00:31:42,490
when I saw that she had your number.

560
00:31:42,514 --> 00:31:45,214
That's why I called.

561
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:49,014
Did you have your breakfast?

562
00:31:50,214 --> 00:31:51,823
No, not yet.

563
00:31:52,024 --> 00:31:53,583
Have you had yours?

564
00:31:54,224 --> 00:31:56,194
Of course I have.

565
00:31:56,194 --> 00:31:59,093
You tend to wake up early
in old age.

566
00:31:59,623 --> 00:32:02,264
It must be because
I wake up too early,

567
00:32:02,663 --> 00:32:05,504
but the day seems too long.

568
00:32:06,304 --> 00:32:07,573
We have fine weather today,

569
00:32:07,573 --> 00:32:10,073
so maybe you should ask Ji Young
to take you somewhere nice.

570
00:32:10,944 --> 00:32:15,244
As if a country bumpkin
would know anything about the city.

571
00:32:15,974 --> 00:32:19,583
From the subway system to buses,

572
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:21,813
everything's so confusing in Seoul.

573
00:32:21,853 --> 00:32:25,783
We'll be lucky not to get lost.

574
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:28,099
What have you planned for the day?

575
00:32:28,123 --> 00:32:31,264
I thought Ji Young and I...

576
00:32:31,264 --> 00:32:35,063
could go for a walk
along the stream nearby.

577
00:32:35,964 --> 00:32:39,934
By the way,
what are your plans for the day?

578
00:32:43,274 --> 00:32:45,204
Mom, whose call
did you take inside...

579
00:32:45,204 --> 00:32:47,303
when you weren't finished
with your meal?

580
00:32:47,913 --> 00:32:49,644
It was Ma Ri.

581
00:32:49,744 --> 00:32:51,984
I texted her earlier.

582
00:32:55,153 --> 00:32:56,714
Ma Ri says...

583
00:32:57,254 --> 00:32:59,583
that her mother
isn't getting divorced.

584
00:33:00,724 --> 00:33:03,023
I have plans today
and am heading out.

585
00:33:03,093 --> 00:33:04,293
Sure thing.

586
00:33:05,064 --> 00:33:06,593
- Pil Seung...
- Be safe.

587
00:33:08,093 --> 00:33:09,533
My gosh.

588
00:33:11,204 --> 00:33:14,004
Mom, why would you mention that
in front of him?

589
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,974
He's barely been able
to eat these days.

590
00:33:17,073 --> 00:33:20,744
Besides, her divorce
has nothing to do with our family.

591
00:33:20,804 --> 00:33:23,313
Stop talking about
what goes on in that family.

592
00:33:24,143 --> 00:33:27,984
Hyun Chul, it's time
you faced reality.

593
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:32,083
Ms. Jang staying married
is better for Pil Seung.

594
00:33:32,754 --> 00:33:35,700
What are you talking about?
You're ruining my appetite.

595
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:38,464
Listen to me carefully.

596
00:33:39,024 --> 00:33:41,494
It's time for us to face reality.

597
00:33:41,764 --> 00:33:43,393
You may hate this,

598
00:33:43,393 --> 00:33:44,704
but we can't change the fact...

599
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,210
that Ms. Jang gave birth
to Pil Seung.

600
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,680
That can never change.

601
00:33:48,704 --> 00:33:49,974
Mom!

602
00:33:52,143 --> 00:33:55,573
Glare at me all you want.
I'll still speak my mind.

603
00:33:56,044 --> 00:33:59,559
Think about what is
truly better for him.

604
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:02,714
Call Pil Seung your son
all you want.

605
00:34:03,054 --> 00:34:06,184
That won't get him any money
or anything that'll benefit him.

606
00:34:06,823 --> 00:34:08,194
Unbelievable.

607
00:34:08,623 --> 00:34:12,394
If Ms. Jang divorces her husband,

608
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:16,694
Pil Seung will have
to care for Ma Ri.

609
00:34:17,064 --> 00:34:19,110
And that's not all.

610
00:34:19,134 --> 00:34:21,933
Right now, she's worried
about her husband finding out...

611
00:34:21,933 --> 00:34:23,973
which is why she's been
groveling at our feet...

612
00:34:23,973 --> 00:34:26,244
saying how sorry she is.

613
00:34:26,544 --> 00:34:27,774
But after she gets a divorce?

614
00:34:28,143 --> 00:34:30,814
She'll have nothing to lose.

615
00:34:30,814 --> 00:34:33,814
What are you going to do
if she tries to take Pil Seung...

616
00:34:33,814 --> 00:34:36,283
openly claiming him as her son?

617
00:34:39,853 --> 00:34:43,224
See what I mean? I'm right.

618
00:34:43,754 --> 00:34:46,893
That's why Ms. Jang
needs to stay married.

619
00:34:46,893 --> 00:34:50,934
Especially for Pil Seung's sake,
she must not get divorced.

620
00:34:51,763 --> 00:34:54,303
Let's be honest here.

621
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:56,134
Pil Seung's birth mother
finally showed up,

622
00:34:56,134 --> 00:34:57,303
and we should be glad...

623
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,073
she isn't some hobo
who needs him to take care of her.

624
00:34:59,203 --> 00:35:02,474
We're lucky she's married
to a chairman of a company.

625
00:35:03,314 --> 00:35:07,159
Isn't it a relief
that his birth mother is well-off?

626
00:35:07,183 --> 00:35:09,853
Can you mind your own business
when it comes to that family?

627
00:35:09,853 --> 00:35:12,823
You're ruining my appetite!

628
00:35:13,123 --> 00:35:14,423
Mother.

629
00:35:15,223 --> 00:35:17,454
Please stop.

630
00:35:20,163 --> 00:35:23,564
Why are they on my case?

631
00:35:25,404 --> 00:35:29,573
Myung Dong, was I wrong to say that?

632
00:35:30,904 --> 00:35:32,604
You're right this time around.

633
00:35:33,303 --> 00:35:34,974
Now that you mention it,

634
00:35:35,814 --> 00:35:38,183
our situation is much better...

635
00:35:38,183 --> 00:35:39,984
since his birth mother...

636
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:43,053
could've entered his life
asking for money or worse.

637
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:46,024
Right? Even you agree...

638
00:35:46,024 --> 00:35:49,454
that his birth mother being rich
is better in many ways.

639
00:35:49,924 --> 00:35:52,800
But Mom, you should stop.

640
00:35:52,824 --> 00:35:55,263
I'm worried you might
get kicked out at this rate.

641
00:35:55,263 --> 00:35:59,363
I'm going to speak my mind
even if they kick me out for it.

642
00:36:00,234 --> 00:36:01,474
But...

643
00:36:02,004 --> 00:36:03,374
But Myung Dong...

644
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:06,843
What if Chairman Gong passes away?

645
00:36:07,103 --> 00:36:10,520
Ma Ri will indeed
inherit everything,

646
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:13,744
but doesn't half of that
belong to Ms. Jang?

647
00:36:14,814 --> 00:36:16,613
What are you getting at?

648
00:36:17,053 --> 00:36:18,524
I'm saying...

649
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:21,393
that there's no need for us...

650
00:36:21,393 --> 00:36:24,693
to worsen the relationship
we have with her.

651
00:36:25,524 --> 00:36:28,133
I've been meaning to say this
for quite some time.

652
00:36:28,294 --> 00:36:31,834
You seem to be
the smartest person in this family.

653
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:33,833
I'm curious as to why
you never bothered...

654
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:35,633
to make a fortune
with that smart brain of yours.

655
00:36:36,174 --> 00:36:37,174
That's right.

656
00:36:37,174 --> 00:36:40,474
I've only just been realizing
that I'm a smart cookie.

657
00:36:42,174 --> 00:36:44,613
You have no idea how sly you are.

658
00:36:59,893 --> 00:37:01,434
Do Jun, are you mad?

659
00:37:02,464 --> 00:37:04,264
If you are, please don't be.

660
00:37:04,663 --> 00:37:05,964
I feel terrible...

661
00:37:05,964 --> 00:37:08,533
to see you angry,
and you're scaring me.

662
00:37:09,134 --> 00:37:11,204
I thought we were friends,

663
00:37:12,873 --> 00:37:15,014
but I'm starting to question that.

664
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:17,274
Of course we're friends.

665
00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:21,283
When you ran away from home,

666
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:24,013
I was worried to the point...

667
00:37:24,013 --> 00:37:27,084
that my heart almost burst from
thinking you could be in danger.

668
00:37:28,623 --> 00:37:30,854
Shouldn't you have called me
if I was your friend?

669
00:37:31,924 --> 00:37:34,163
You ran away from home
without saying a word to me.

670
00:37:34,163 --> 00:37:36,494
How could you have gone
to a club all by yourself?

671
00:37:37,663 --> 00:37:39,403
That must be why you're angry.

672
00:37:40,364 --> 00:37:41,373
I'm sorry.

673
00:37:41,373 --> 00:37:43,803
My mom said
she was divorcing my dad.

674
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,474
That scared me so much
that I couldn't think straight.

675
00:37:47,143 --> 00:37:49,974
Isn't a friend what you need
when you're scared?

676
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:53,244
Don't I come to mind
at times like that?

677
00:37:56,654 --> 00:37:58,083
Thanks, Do Jun.

678
00:37:58,083 --> 00:38:00,653
From now on,
I'll think of you first.

679
00:38:01,553 --> 00:38:03,253
So please don't be mad at me.

680
00:38:04,893 --> 00:38:06,164
Do you mean that?

681
00:38:06,194 --> 00:38:07,894
Yes, I do.

682
00:38:11,064 --> 00:38:13,533
Let's go.
I'll walk you to your class.

683
00:38:15,674 --> 00:38:16,903
By the way,

684
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:18,373
is it true
that your heart almost burst...

685
00:38:18,373 --> 00:38:20,003
because you were worried about me?

686
00:38:22,114 --> 00:38:23,314
Yes.

687
00:38:23,413 --> 00:38:26,314
All right. I'll make sure
your heart stays intact.

688
00:38:26,314 --> 00:38:27,514
I mean that.

689
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,686
Goodness, Director Jang.

690
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,910
What...

691
00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:47,779
I hear you'll soon be producing
a mini series called "Confession."

692
00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:50,279
Ms. Baek,
how did you know about that?

693
00:38:50,509 --> 00:38:53,349
You always know anything
and everything, don't you?

694
00:38:53,349 --> 00:38:54,849
I have to make a living
for myself, don't I?

695
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:56,719
Speed is key in this industry.

696
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:58,250
Of course.

697
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,290
Why else do you think
I'm fond of you?

698
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,965
What I mean is that...

699
00:39:02,989 --> 00:39:06,629
I mean that you're
an admirable woman.

700
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,699
I have someplace to be,
so I'll see you around.

701
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:11,329
- Director, please.
- Why?

702
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:12,969
Please take a look at this.

703
00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:14,770
This is Kim Ji Young,

704
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,610
a rookie actress
I've been working with.

705
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:19,610
You must know about
"The House of Roses"...

706
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,110
- that Director Ko is filming.
- And?

707
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:24,750
She was cast
as the secondary female lead.

708
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,750
Really?

709
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,880
- That's right.
- Director Ko...

710
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,690
and Writer Kim Oh Kyeong...

711
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,820
who are known to be picky
with who they cast loved her.

712
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,719
The entire casting crew...

713
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:36,630
voted for her to play that role.

714
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,759
Even Writer Kim?

715
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:38,829
That's right.

716
00:39:38,829 --> 00:39:42,699
That is why I urge you
to take a closer look...

717
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:44,876
at Actress Kim Ji Young.

718
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,270
Sure. I'll see you around.
I'll check out her profile.

719
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,739
- Director Jang, please do.
- Okay.

720
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:51,009
- Please do so.
- I will.

721
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,919
The weather's hot,
and I'm lacking energy.

722
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,390
This was easier
back when I was younger.

723
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,620
Goodness.

724
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,560
It sure is exhausting
to do this in old age.

725
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:15,070
They changed
how she looks completely,

726
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,829
so couldn't they have made her
prettier than the old Do Ra?

727
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:18,940
Just look at this.

728
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,139
When will I make
this country bumpkin into a star?

729
00:40:21,139 --> 00:40:23,709
When will she become a top celebrity
who scores ad campaigns?

730
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,940
Gosh, that face.

731
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,009
Our future is bleak.

732
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:36,419
Darn, it's hot.

733
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,490
Unbelievable.

734
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:42,029
Is everyone here?

735
00:40:42,029 --> 00:40:44,129
Are you kidding me?

736
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,640
My heart's racing.

737
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,885
They almost caught me.

738
00:40:55,909 --> 00:40:58,109
Oh, dear.

739
00:41:10,989 --> 00:41:12,459
Grandma, what are you doing?

740
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:18,029
I'm getting ready to meet someone.

741
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:20,459
To meet someone?

742
00:41:20,759 --> 00:41:24,399
How can you have plans
when you don't know anyone in Seoul?

743
00:41:25,029 --> 00:41:27,839
What do you mean
I don't know anyone?

744
00:41:28,509 --> 00:41:31,340
I agreed to go out on a date...

745
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,210
with Director Ko Pil Seung.

746
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,949
What? What was that?

747
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:38,479
Why would you meet with Director Ko?

748
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,520
Gosh, is he here already?

749
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,020
Grandma! Hold on.

750
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,660
Ms. Lee, please hop in.

751
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,359
- Director Ko, thank you.
- Grandma!

752
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,229
Grandma, please.

753
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,139
Director Ko,
what is the meaning of this?

754
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:03,770
Why did you make plans
with my grandma?

755
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,279
Why?

756
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:06,840
We agreed to be friends.

757
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,126
What? Friends?

758
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,880
How can you two be friends?

759
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,219
As if that makes sense.

760
00:42:13,219 --> 00:42:14,380
Ji Young.

761
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,389
In western countries,

762
00:42:15,389 --> 00:42:16,890
you can be friends
regardless of your age.

763
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:18,290
I was recently in Paris, remember?

764
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:21,490
I'm embracing the culture
and befriending your grandmother.

765
00:42:22,259 --> 00:42:24,560
Don't be ridiculous,

766
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,400
and cancel this friendship.

767
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,770
- I can't.
- What?

768
00:42:30,029 --> 00:42:31,730
I wasn't going to say anything,

769
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:33,569
but I think I should.

770
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,469
You say you love your grandma,

771
00:42:36,469 --> 00:42:39,540
so it was wrong of you
not to take her out to see the city.

772
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:44,879
That's why I agreed
to show my friend around Seoul.

773
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,520
So head back inside already.

774
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:51,296
No way. I'll do it myself.

775
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,690
I'll take her out to see Seoul,

776
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,190
so head back home yourself.

777
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:58,029
Gosh, no. Ji Young,

778
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,559
I'll go out with Director Ko,

779
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:02,905
so head back inside.

780
00:43:02,929 --> 00:43:04,099
What?

781
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:06,439
You heard her. Bye, then.

782
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:08,910
But...

783
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,540
Grandma, please.

784
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:13,379
How can I let you go with him
all by yourself?

785
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:15,709
Come with us too, then.

786
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,620
But...

787
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:29,836
I never got to wear
a school uniform.

788
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,730
It's so nice to dress up in one.

789
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,000
You look so good in it.

790
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,230
- Do I?
- Yes.

791
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:37,270
Then take a photo for me.

792
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,916
- Well...
- Let's take a photo.

793
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,209
One, two.

794
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:48,109
I'm filming you nicely.

795
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:49,680
Gosh...

796
00:43:50,279 --> 00:43:52,750
What is all this?

797
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,750
Goodness.

798
00:43:55,949 --> 00:44:00,059
<i>To the dear older sisters</i>

799
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:03,390
<i>Who just graduated</i>

800
00:44:03,759 --> 00:44:09,930
<i>I give you a big bouquet of flowers</i>

801
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:16,270
<i>We'll study hard</i>
<i>with the books you left us</i>

802
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:17,440
Ms. Lee, let's dance.

803
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,650
<i>Soon, we'll follow in your footsteps</i>

804
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:24,792
(Commerce school classroom
from 1970s)

805
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,700
Director Ko.

806
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,069
Thank you.

807
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,740
Seeing my grandma so happy...

808
00:44:46,969 --> 00:44:48,839
made me tear up.

809
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,410
You're much better than I am.

810
00:44:53,409 --> 00:44:55,479
Thank you so much.

811
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:00,250
Not at all.
I'd been feeling down recently,

812
00:45:00,619 --> 00:45:02,620
and it was a nice way to cheer up.

813
00:45:05,389 --> 00:45:07,819
Something bad...

814
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:10,890
must've happened recently.

815
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:19,799
Some things happened.

816
00:45:26,739 --> 00:45:28,879
I heard this from somewhere.

817
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:32,580
Every heartache
is meaningful in a way,

818
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:36,020
and people grow and mature
by overcoming their pain.

819
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:40,790
There's a famous saying too.
"This too shall pass."

820
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:45,005
I don't know what's been going on,

821
00:45:45,029 --> 00:45:47,700
but I hope
that you can shake it off...

822
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,669
and stay strong.

823
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:55,810
Thanks.

824
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,839
Hearing you say that
actually cheered me up.

825
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:03,950
That's really good to know.

826
00:46:04,949 --> 00:46:06,379
If you're grateful,

827
00:46:06,779 --> 00:46:09,450
show me around
the 63 Building next time.

828
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:11,465
Grandma.

829
00:46:11,489 --> 00:46:14,890
You can buy lunch when we're there.

830
00:46:15,389 --> 00:46:17,529
Director Ko
paid for everything today.

831
00:46:17,529 --> 00:46:19,575
You should return the favor.

832
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,669
Why would you even mention
a next time?

833
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:27,215
Director Ko. Be sure to leave
your wallet at home that day.

834
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:29,609
Ji Young will treat you then.

835
00:46:30,139 --> 00:46:31,686
I'll let you two talk.

836
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:33,340
There's a lot to see.

837
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,580
Grandma.

838
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:36,109
Did you hear that?

839
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:39,879
Did you plan this?

840
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,689
Is there a script?

841
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:44,790
No. Treat me next time.

842
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:52,330
- Oh, my gosh.
- Welcome home, Ji Young.

843
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:55,299
- Darn you.
- Grandma!

844
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,829
- How could you?
- What's wrong with you now?

845
00:46:57,829 --> 00:47:00,215
You evil woman!

846
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,239
You should cook a decent meal
for your young husband.

847
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:06,155
How could you cook him ramyeon?

848
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:11,110
I bet that's all
you cooked for Ji Young, isn't it?

849
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:12,796
Where's your conscience?

850
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:15,620
I don't believe this. My gosh.

851
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:20,496
Geum Dong, why did you pick
such a rotten one?

852
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,436
If you're going to live with
an older woman,

853
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,660
you should've at least
picked one that can cook.

854
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,845
Throw out that useless witch
right now...

855
00:47:30,869 --> 00:47:32,200
and marry someone else.

856
00:47:32,469 --> 00:47:35,000
- I've had enough of this.
- Mom.

857
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,809
- I won't allow...
- Mom.

858
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:40,439
- Who does she think she is?
- Mom!

859
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,109
- My gosh.
- Mom.

860
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:44,380
I didn't just eat ramyeon.

861
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,179
I said I wanted some,

862
00:47:46,179 --> 00:47:48,080
and I cooked this, okay?

863
00:47:48,219 --> 00:47:50,965
You stupid thing.

864
00:47:50,989 --> 00:47:54,396
Do you want to defend
that old hag right now?

865
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,029
- Do you?
- No.

866
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,529
She's busy working and making money.

867
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:01,659
She's a pretty good cook.

868
00:48:01,659 --> 00:48:04,675
It's not that she doesn't
or can't cook.

869
00:48:04,699 --> 00:48:06,770
Look at my face, Mom.

870
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,470
Does it look like I don't eat well?

871
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:14,680
Whatever! You useless thing.

872
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,095
You fell head over heels
for the old woman.

873
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,319
My gosh.
Where did you learn to do that?

874
00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:26,719
What did you do to seduce my son?

875
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:28,566
How did you trick him...

876
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:30,860
that my dear Geum Dong...

877
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,959
who only cared about me
only cares about you now?

878
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,929
Gosh. I can't take...

879
00:48:35,929 --> 00:48:40,546
Grandma, why are you
so full of energy today?

880
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:42,340
Let's go outside, Grandma.

881
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,570
- I'll buy you something nice.
- Where are we going?

882
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:46,309
- Let's go.
- You'll buy me what?

883
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:48,239
- Something tasty.
- What?

884
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:50,879
- Come along.
- My goodness...

885
00:48:51,409 --> 00:48:53,550
- Good grief.
- What the heck...

886
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:57,090
The future is so bleak.
How are we to survive this?

887
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:58,490
I feel so lost.

888
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:16,109
Thank you so much for today,
Director Ko.

889
00:49:16,509 --> 00:49:18,810
I like you, Director Ko.

890
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:20,779
I love you.

891
00:49:28,949 --> 00:49:30,396
Here, Grandma.

892
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,490
Thanks.

893
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:41,135
You wanted
strawberry ice cream that much?

894
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:42,459
Yes.

895
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,600
Whenever I feel angry,
if I have this,

896
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:52,009
the fire that burns up inside
just melts away and disappears.

897
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:56,750
Why do you hate Ms. Baek so much?

898
00:49:56,779 --> 00:49:58,209
I don't know.

899
00:49:58,449 --> 00:50:02,020
I just feel angry
whenever I see her.

900
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,720
Goodness.

901
00:50:10,389 --> 00:50:12,799
- Ji Young. I love you too.
- What?

902
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,776
What's this?

903
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,399
Why did Director Ko say,
"I love you?"

904
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,169
What? Director Ko said he loved you?

905
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:26,740
Yes. But I didn't text him anything.

906
00:50:27,809 --> 00:50:29,509
(Thank you so much for today,
Director. I like you. I love you.)

907
00:50:29,509 --> 00:50:31,680
My gosh. What's this?

908
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:34,950
Grandma! Did you send this?

909
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:39,119
You couldn't say it yourself,

910
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,790
so I said what I knew
you wanted to say.

911
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,700
The brave woman
wins the handsome man. Like me.

912
00:50:50,369 --> 00:50:52,516
Director Ko, that wasn't me.

913
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,969
It was my grandma's prank.

914
00:50:53,969 --> 00:50:55,440
Don't ever get the wrong idea.

915
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,547
(Director Ko Pil Seung)

916
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,680
I'll just get the wrong idea.

917
00:51:02,279 --> 00:51:03,609
Darn it.

918
00:51:05,349 --> 00:51:10,226
Ji Young.
I think Director Ko's really cute.

919
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,090
He's not just cute.

920
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:15,465
He's polite
and has a great character.

921
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:20,200
And more than anything,
he likes you a lot.

922
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:22,500
I like that most about him.

923
00:51:23,329 --> 00:51:24,600
Grandma.

924
00:51:24,869 --> 00:51:29,215
There's no way things can
work out for Director Ko and me.

925
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:31,715
I'm not supposed
to have feelings for Director Ko.

926
00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:34,180
That doesn't exist.

927
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,179
Saying you're not supposed to...

928
00:51:37,179 --> 00:51:40,356
have feelings for him
means you like him a lot.

929
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,920
If that's so, just go for it.

930
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,396
You only live once.

931
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:47,720
There's a reason I can't like him.

932
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,990
So don't get me worked up.

933
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:53,200
You stupid thing.

934
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:58,370
Do you think it's easy
to find someone you like?

935
00:51:58,529 --> 00:52:01,046
Grab hold of him
once you've found him.

936
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:03,770
Or you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

937
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,270
What?

938
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,109
My gosh.

939
00:52:10,809 --> 00:52:13,679
One extra mouth to feed
doubled the housework.

940
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:16,149
Oh, my gosh. My legs are killing me.

941
00:52:16,489 --> 00:52:18,350
Oh, goodness.

942
00:52:26,659 --> 00:52:29,529
Hang on. Those loan sharks.

943
00:52:29,929 --> 00:52:31,470
Were they looking for me?

944
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:36,209
No. They must think
I'm still in prison.

945
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:39,009
I'm sure they didn't see me.

946
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,640
My legs hurt so bad.

947
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,120
My gosh.

948
00:52:47,849 --> 00:52:50,290
This place is already too small
for us three...

949
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:52,220
and a senile granny too?

950
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:53,790
Good grief.

951
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,529
I managed to make Do Ra a star...

952
00:52:56,529 --> 00:52:59,130
because she had opportunities
since she was 12.

953
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:02,476
Ji Young's 29 right now
and will soon be 30.

954
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,470
When will I ever make her famous?

955
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:06,439
Oh, no.

956
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:09,339
I wish someone
would drop me a stack of bills.

957
00:53:09,909 --> 00:53:11,115
Poor me.

958
00:53:11,139 --> 00:53:13,839
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

959
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,664
(Tae Hee)

960
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,149
Hello, Tae Hee.

961
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:25,490
You know I have
a dress fitting today, right?

962
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:26,990
What?

963
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:31,229
Of course. I remember that.

964
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,729
By the way, Tae Hee,

965
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:37,600
the wedding is two months away.

966
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:39,229
But are we doing
the dress fitting already?

967
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,699
What do you mean already?

968
00:53:40,699 --> 00:53:43,009
It takes a long time
to make a wedding dress.

969
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:46,040
Okay. I get it.

970
00:53:46,509 --> 00:53:47,979
I'll see you at the shop.

971
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,709
Bye.

972
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,270
What do you think, Jin Dan?

973
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,149
It's nice. I love it.

974
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,950
You do?
Then I'll try on one more dress.

975
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,950
Okay. Sure.

976
00:54:43,699 --> 00:54:45,000
I don't get it.

977
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:49,810
How can the illusion of Do Ra
be still so vivid?

978
00:54:52,909 --> 00:54:55,080
What's wrong with me?

979
00:54:58,509 --> 00:54:59,919
Darn it.

980
00:55:29,849 --> 00:55:31,879
Mr. Gong?

981
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:34,150
What are you doing here?

982
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:36,450
Hey, Ms. Baek.

983
00:55:37,889 --> 00:55:40,160
I'm glad you're here.

984
00:55:41,659 --> 00:55:42,836
Ms. Baek.

985
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:46,259
I need to meet Ji Young,

986
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:48,629
but she's not answering my calls.

987
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,700
Ms. Baek,
will you call her out for me?

988
00:55:53,369 --> 00:55:55,400
Did you say Ji Young?

989
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,570
Are you here to see...

990
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:59,480
my Ji Young, not me?

991
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,279
How do you know her?

992
00:56:04,009 --> 00:56:05,379
Ms. Baek!

993
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:09,650
Ji Young belongs to your agency.

994
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:11,520
And she lives here with you.

995
00:56:11,849 --> 00:56:14,660
So go ahead and call her out for me.

996
00:56:14,889 --> 00:56:16,329
What's going on?

997
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:18,889
He even knows that
Do Ra and I are living together?

998
00:56:18,889 --> 00:56:21,436
Has he been doing
some background check on me?

999
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:22,830
Or Ji Young?

1000
00:56:23,469 --> 00:56:24,670
So...

1001
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:28,099
why do you want to see Ji Young
at this time of night?

1002
00:56:28,099 --> 00:56:30,339
Do you two know each other?

1003
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:33,816
Ms. Baek.

1004
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,309
After Park Do Ra died,

1005
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:39,720
I've had this deep resentment.

1006
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,850
I'm still not over her.

1007
00:56:43,989 --> 00:56:45,189
I...

1008
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:48,359
still miss Do Ra a lot.

1009
00:56:50,029 --> 00:56:51,459
And...

1010
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:53,560
when I'm with Ji Young,

1011
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:56,870
I feel like I'm with Do Ra.

1012
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,399
So I've seen...

1013
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,870
Ji Young several times.

1014
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,310
What?

1015
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:09,540
So, Ms. Baek,
please help me out here.

1016
00:57:09,849 --> 00:57:13,720
I really miss Do Ra today.

1017
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,850
So I should at least meet Ji Young.

1018
00:57:17,889 --> 00:57:19,590
Hang on a second.

1019
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:22,660
So are you saying
you want Ji Young instead of Do Ra?

1020
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,759
Like an alternative?

1021
00:57:24,759 --> 00:57:26,675
Because it's better than nothing?

1022
00:57:26,699 --> 00:57:27,930
Ms. Baek.

1023
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,070
Let's just be honest.

1024
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:33,270
Isn't that why
you are working with Ji Young?

1025
00:57:33,739 --> 00:57:37,069
Because she looks
and feels like Park Do Ra.

1026
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:39,879
I feel the same way.

1027
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,079
Every time I see Ji Young,

1028
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:45,379
I'm reminded of Do Ra.

1029
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:48,850
I'm even on medication now.

1030
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,689
Ms. Baek.

1031
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:54,390
Please help me out here, okay?

1032
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:58,859
Just let me meet Ji Young this once.

1033
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:00,500
Okay?

1034
00:58:13,409 --> 00:58:15,239
After Park Do Ra died,

1035
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:17,750
I've had this deep resentment.

1036
00:58:18,409 --> 00:58:20,879
I'm still not over her.

1037
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:23,189
I...

1038
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:26,120
still miss Do Ra a lot.

1039
00:58:28,989 --> 00:58:31,589
He's still not over Do Ra?

1040
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,329
So he wants to meet Ji Young?

1041
00:58:34,329 --> 00:58:37,500
That crazy brat.
He must be out of his mind.

1042
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:40,340
I should keep
a close eye on Ji Young now.

1043
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:44,009
If he finds out she's Do Ra,
we will be in big trouble.

1044
00:58:49,809 --> 00:58:51,879
Ji Young, I'm home.

1045
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:53,996
- My gosh.
- Hey, Do Jun.

1046
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,219
- Do Jun.
- What's all this?

1047
00:58:55,219 --> 00:58:56,790
This is a lot.

1048
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:59,520
- Hi, Do Jun.
- You're here.

1049
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:01,759
I bought some meat and fruit
on my way here.

1050
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,189
I got paid yesterday.

1051
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,690
It's not like
you're making a lot of money.

1052
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:08,936
Thank you anyway.
Aren't you just sweet, my son?

1053
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,969
What? "My son?"

1054
00:59:10,969 --> 00:59:12,969
Who's your son?

1055
00:59:12,969 --> 00:59:15,899
What? If he's her son...

1056
00:59:16,099 --> 00:59:18,739
That's right! Geum Dong,

1057
00:59:18,739 --> 00:59:22,580
does that mean you got a son?

1058
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:25,050
So he's my grandson!

1059
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:27,650
My goodness.

1060
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:29,320
You're so handsome.

1061
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,750
You look just like Geum Dong.

1062
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:34,020
I can't believe this.

1063
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:36,259
Do Sik, who is this lady?

1064
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,330
- She's my mom.
- Right.

1065
00:59:39,429 --> 00:59:41,500
What? What do you mean?

1066
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,599
Well... The thing is, Do Jun,

1067
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:48,046
she is my grandmother
who saved my life.

1068
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:49,470
She's that lady?

1069
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:54,779
Hello, ma'am. I'm Park Do Jun.

1070
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,809
Thank you so much.

1071
00:59:57,809 --> 01:00:01,250
All right. My goodness.

1072
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:05,520
Do Jun, what took you so long?

1073
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:09,790
Hey, Ms. Stepmother.

1074
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:11,630
What are you waiting for?

1075
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:15,329
Geum Dong, Ji Young,
and Do Jun are all here.

1076
01:00:15,329 --> 01:00:19,500
You should go and get them
something to eat.

1077
01:00:19,869 --> 01:00:23,470
Am I supposed to cook when I have
a young and spry daughter-in-law?

1078
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:25,910
Ma'am.

1079
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:28,540
I'm not your daughter-in-law.

1080
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:30,550
Mom, you should just let it slide.

1081
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:33,479
What do you mean
I should let it slide?

1082
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:36,619
Let's eat the meat
that Do Jun brought.

1083
01:00:36,619 --> 01:00:37,849
Mom, let's eat meat.

1084
01:00:37,849 --> 01:00:41,390
Okay, my son. It's a party.

1085
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:44,430
It's a barbecue party!

1086
01:00:54,369 --> 01:00:55,800
What?

1087
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,169
All right. Thanks.

1088
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:04,310
Chew it well and eat slowly.

1089
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,720
Ms. Baek.

1090
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:08,220
Me?

1091
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:10,189
My gosh.

1092
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,490
Thanks, Ji Young.

1093
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,900
That's right. Do Ra is alive here,

1094
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,969
Do Jun is back,

1095
01:01:26,969 --> 01:01:28,669
and Do Sik is being so reliable.

1096
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:31,339
If this isn't happiness,
I don't know what is.

1097
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:34,579
That's right. I can't ask for more.

1098
01:01:34,579 --> 01:01:38,250
I should just live happily
with my family like this.

1099
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:41,150
- It's good, right?
- Go ahead and eat.

1100
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:43,919
- Okay. Let's eat.
- Eat some more.

1101
01:01:43,989 --> 01:01:45,890
Let's eat a lot.

1102
01:01:46,989 --> 01:01:48,690
You're not eating a lot, Do Sik.

1103
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:50,259
- You're busy cooking the meat.
- That's not true.

1104
01:01:50,259 --> 01:01:52,330
- Grandma, have some more.
- Try this chili pepper.

1105
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,870
Hey, Baek Mi Ja.

1106
01:01:59,529 --> 01:02:01,770
Did you think we wouldn't find you?

1107
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:04,570
- I'm just...
- Where are you running off to?

1108
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:06,610
Hey, it's not like that.

1109
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:09,579
- Hey! Let go of me!
- All right. Escort her.

1110
01:02:09,579 --> 01:02:11,710
- Just come with us.
- What are you doing? Get off me!

1111
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:13,650
My goodness. Help me!

1112
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:16,120
Hey, this isn't just right.

1113
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:21,089
Where are the nail clippers?

1114
01:02:21,659 --> 01:02:24,529
I can't find the nail clippers
all the time.

1115
01:02:29,029 --> 01:02:32,300
Are they hiding
the nail clippers or what?

1116
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,300
Where are they?

1117
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:36,439
My gosh. What do I do?

1118
01:02:38,639 --> 01:02:39,816
What?

1119
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,509
What? A picture of a baby?

1120
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:43,950
Is this Ma Ri?

1121
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,509
I don't think so.

1122
01:02:47,949 --> 01:02:51,290
Who is this baby then?
Why did she hide this picture?

1123
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:54,259
Ma Ri's mom.

1124
01:02:54,259 --> 01:02:56,689
She had that man's child,

1125
01:02:56,889 --> 01:02:58,729
and they were even going to marry.

1126
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,569
Is this the child? My gosh.

1127
01:03:04,929 --> 01:03:07,169
But this baby looks
somewhat familiar.

1128
01:03:07,869 --> 01:03:09,200
Where did I see this baby?

1129
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,839
Guys.

1130
01:03:14,179 --> 01:03:16,040
Look closely at this picture.

1131
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:18,285
Doesn't this baby look familiar?

1132
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:20,250
Why all of a sudden?

1133
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,720
Whose baby is it? So adorable.

1134
01:03:24,449 --> 01:03:29,359
Gosh, this looks like a baby photo
of Sun Young's son Pil Seung.

1135
01:03:29,829 --> 01:03:31,529
Who? Pil Seung?

1136
01:03:31,529 --> 01:03:34,100
That's right. I see that too
now that you mention it.

1137
01:03:34,329 --> 01:03:37,370
Ae Kyo, why do you have
a photo of him?

1138
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:38,830
What?

1139
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:44,470
(Goban Restaurant)

1140
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:49,979
Sun Young!

1141
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:53,549
Ae Kyo.

1142
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:56,279
If this is about Soo Yeon,
just leave.

1143
01:03:56,449 --> 01:03:59,465
I'm busy and don't have the time
to idly chat with you.

1144
01:03:59,489 --> 01:04:01,520
Sun Young, that's not it.

1145
01:04:02,059 --> 01:04:03,560
Check this out.

1146
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:05,129
Do you remember this photo?

1147
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:10,000
Gosh, Ae Kyo.

1148
01:04:10,469 --> 01:04:14,040
Why do you have
a photo of my Pil Seung?

1149
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,540
Sun Young, is this really Pil Seung?

1150
01:04:26,228 --> 01:04:29,238
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1151
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:03,742
I'll be generous enough
to wait until tomorrow,

1152
01:05:03,742 --> 01:05:05,102
so get me my 500,000 dollars.

1153
01:05:05,102 --> 01:05:07,047
Don't even think
about running off again.

1154
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:10,218
Your sons Do Sik and Do Jun
won't live to see another day.

1155
01:05:10,242 --> 01:05:11,742
Who are we to each other anyway?

1156
01:05:11,742 --> 01:05:14,352
Who am I to you that you keep
coming to me for money?

1157
01:05:14,352 --> 01:05:17,651
Ji Young, don't ever forget
that I'm here to support you.

1158
01:05:17,651 --> 01:05:19,797
Call me if you ever need my help.

1159
01:05:19,821 --> 01:05:21,127
Are they back together?

1160
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:23,792
Darn it. What am I supposed to do?

1161
01:05:23,792 --> 01:05:27,368
If you don't have the money,
pay it back with your organs.

1162
01:05:27,392 --> 01:05:29,667
Just how much money do you need?

1163
01:05:29,691 --> 01:05:31,331
If I give you 500,000 dollars,

1164
01:05:31,662 --> 01:05:33,061
will you do anything I ask?

1165
