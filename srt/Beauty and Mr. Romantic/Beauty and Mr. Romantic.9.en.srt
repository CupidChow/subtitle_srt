00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:07,430
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,649
What are you doing?

3
00:00:45,349 --> 00:00:46,649
Why are you...

4
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,690
staring at me like that?

5
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:56,037
Why did you hit me?
What was that for?

6
00:00:57,707 --> 00:00:59,436
There was a mosquito.

7
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:01,576
A mosquito
was trying to get your blood,

8
00:01:01,677 --> 00:01:03,677
so I had to kill it for you.

9
00:01:04,277 --> 00:01:06,217
A mosquito? Where?

10
00:01:08,146 --> 00:01:09,717
Over there.

11
00:01:09,717 --> 00:01:11,357
- Where?
- My gosh.

12
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:13,587
The weather today is amazing.

13
00:01:13,587 --> 00:01:14,786
Look at the sky.

14
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:16,786
It's nothing like yesterday.
It's not raining today.

15
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:18,956
What a refreshing breeze.

16
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:20,697
I should go and enjoy it.

17
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:23,527
Where's the darn mosquito?

18
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,566
Are they breeding already?

19
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:27,236
That really hurt.

20
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,706
Do Ra has a really painful slap.

21
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:34,747
What's wrong?

22
00:01:35,147 --> 00:01:37,247
Do Ra!

23
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:38,617
(Episode 9)

24
00:01:38,647 --> 00:01:40,417
What is it, Do Ra?

25
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:41,887
Look over there.

26
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:43,647
There's a rainbow.

27
00:01:45,486 --> 00:01:47,857
Gosh. You're right.

28
00:01:48,557 --> 00:01:51,826
Red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo, violet. Gosh.

29
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:54,397
I've never seen
a rainbow this clear.

30
00:01:54,596 --> 00:01:56,066
Isn't it beautiful?

31
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,197
Pil Seung.
What do you think this means?

32
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:01,936
Is our drama going to be a hit?

33
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:04,777
When you screamed,

34
00:02:04,777 --> 00:02:06,936
I got scared and wondered
if something was wrong.

35
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:08,607
My gosh.

36
00:02:08,676 --> 00:02:10,447
I even got to see a rainbow.

37
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:13,717
It feels like I'm on a different planet.

38
00:02:14,247 --> 00:02:16,446
I love it here. It's great.

39
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:20,487
There are no restaurants or cafes,

40
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:22,027
and no other people and you like it?

41
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:23,756
Yes. That's why I like it.

42
00:02:25,226 --> 00:02:26,827
You won't know how I feel.

43
00:02:27,196 --> 00:02:29,967
I felt like a caged monkey at a zoo.

44
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:33,237
Wherever I went,
people whispered and stared.

45
00:02:34,136 --> 00:02:35,807
Whenever I ate, yawned,

46
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:37,436
or dozed off while waiting to shoot,

47
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:39,476
they'd take photos
without permission.

48
00:02:40,136 --> 00:02:42,547
Then they'd say
I didn't look pretty in real life,

49
00:02:42,547 --> 00:02:45,517
or had plastic surgery
or some kind of procedure.

50
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,247
If I felt tired
and tried to get away,

51
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:50,816
they'd say
I was being rude and mean.

52
00:02:53,856 --> 00:02:56,827
But here,
there's no one to stare at me,

53
00:02:57,656 --> 00:02:59,457
or take photos in secret.

54
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:04,367
Such perfect freedom.

55
00:03:05,536 --> 00:03:08,267
I haven't felt this in so long.

56
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:13,677
This freedom.

57
00:03:17,976 --> 00:03:19,316
I feel alive.

58
00:03:26,117 --> 00:03:27,217
Pil Seung.

59
00:03:28,027 --> 00:03:29,756
How much
does an island like this cost?

60
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:31,427
Why?

61
00:03:32,126 --> 00:03:33,897
I should buy this island...

62
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:36,626
and build a vacation home
to live in after I retire.

63
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:40,337
You'll have to make
lots of money, then.

64
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:41,467
Right?

65
00:03:41,707 --> 00:03:43,337
I'll work even harder,

66
00:03:43,337 --> 00:03:45,976
make even more money,
buy this island,

67
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,936
and create my own Do Ra's world.

68
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:49,677
Even if I wore a bikini...

69
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:52,376
and walked all the way to the sea
and back, no one would see.

70
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:54,816
You're so excited.

71
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,786
Just the idea makes me happy.

72
00:04:01,256 --> 00:04:03,386
If you want to visit...

73
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:07,196
You can.

74
00:04:08,027 --> 00:04:09,066
No, thanks.

75
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:11,066
You slapped me to catch a mosquito.

76
00:04:11,696 --> 00:04:13,337
What else would you do to me here?

77
00:04:16,536 --> 00:04:18,106
Hey, a boat.

78
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:20,807
A boat's coming. We're saved!

79
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:24,207
We're over here!

80
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:26,246
Over here!

81
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:29,846
Why did the boat get here so soon?

82
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,187
They could've taken longer.

83
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:40,056
The bride by Chairman Gong's side...

84
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:42,796
was the girlfriend who was
going to marry the Korean student...

85
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:44,996
because she'd gotten pregnant.

86
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:46,137
What?

87
00:04:47,397 --> 00:04:50,406
That woman was Jin Taek's wife?

88
00:04:51,377 --> 00:04:53,806
You mean that was Ma Ri's mom?

89
00:04:55,877 --> 00:04:57,046
Goodness.

90
00:04:57,647 --> 00:05:01,746
What on earth?
She deceived the whole family.

91
00:05:02,147 --> 00:05:04,116
She should've at least been
a good wife.

92
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:08,017
She ruined our family
by failing to care for one child.

93
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:10,827
The darn thing.

94
00:05:11,757 --> 00:05:13,226
The evil thing.

95
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:17,596
What should I do about this?

96
00:05:17,827 --> 00:05:19,467
What should I do?

97
00:05:25,937 --> 00:05:27,207
Hello, Auntie.

98
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:32,717
Auntie.

99
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:36,486
I made abalone porridge,
your favorite.

100
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:38,656
It came out nicely.

101
00:05:40,517 --> 00:05:41,527
Here you go.

102
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:44,587
Have some and get well soon.

103
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:49,827
How dare you bring this
when I'm ill because of you?

104
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:52,296
Auntie.

105
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:56,236
I won't eat the porridge you made.
It's dirty and disgusting.

106
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,067
You shameless thing.

107
00:05:58,606 --> 00:05:59,877
You have no conscience.

108
00:06:00,437 --> 00:06:01,577
It's dirty?

109
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:04,207
Auntie.
Why are you venting at her again?

110
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:07,277
If you want to vent,
talk to me instead, not her.

111
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:08,387
Goodness.

112
00:06:10,147 --> 00:06:12,056
Honey.

113
00:06:12,587 --> 00:06:14,317
You're not in the right!

114
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:15,786
- Honey.
- You have no conscience!

115
00:06:15,786 --> 00:06:17,656
Darling. Wait.

116
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:23,197
I'll apologize instead. I'm sorry.

117
00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:28,036
I can't take it anymore.

118
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:31,877
I did what I could to appease her,

119
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:33,536
but I've done enough.

120
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:34,676
Calm down.

121
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:38,647
I'll talk to her
so she never does this again.

122
00:06:39,017 --> 00:06:42,217
She got upset when Ma Ri
talked back at her a few days ago,

123
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,187
and she's even more sensitive now
because she's not well.

124
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:48,156
I know it's hard on you,

125
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:51,056
but can you try to understand
just this once?

126
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:52,996
Why is it just this once?

127
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:56,166
How can you say that
after seeing how she treated me?

128
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:58,536
What else am I supposed to do?

129
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:02,036
I understand you even less now.

130
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:06,577
Fine.

131
00:07:07,306 --> 00:07:09,507
Ma Ri and I will move out.

132
00:07:09,947 --> 00:07:13,317
Do as your aunt wants
and find another wife.

133
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:16,587
Get her to give you an heir
or hire a surrogate. Do as you want.

134
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:17,947
Honey.

135
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:20,317
How could you say that?

136
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:22,957
What am I to do
if you react like this too?

137
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:01,627
What did she do so wrong
that you're making such a fuss?

138
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:09,967
I wanted and hoped to live with you
for a long time.

139
00:08:12,676 --> 00:08:16,346
I think you should go to the US.

140
00:08:18,377 --> 00:08:20,947
In return, I'll visit you often...

141
00:08:21,746 --> 00:08:23,087
in the US.

142
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:25,687
- Jin Taek.
- Let's do that.

143
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:28,017
You keep acting the way you do,

144
00:08:29,286 --> 00:08:31,127
and you're leaving me
with no choice.

145
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:34,856
Jin Taek.
There's something I must tell you.

146
00:08:37,796 --> 00:08:39,496
Okay. Go ahead.

147
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:42,366
Your wife. Ma Ri's mom.

148
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,266
She...

149
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:45,937
No.

150
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:48,707
He wants me to go to the US
because I upset a bowl of porridge.

151
00:08:49,077 --> 00:08:50,547
If I relay the story with no proof,

152
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:52,547
he's bound to say
he'll never see me again.

153
00:08:53,146 --> 00:08:56,087
Jin Taek's the type to do that
if he decides to.

154
00:08:56,386 --> 00:08:57,717
What about Ma Ri's mom?

155
00:08:58,217 --> 00:09:00,287
- What were you going to say?
- No.

156
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:04,557
It's nothing.

157
00:09:05,596 --> 00:09:07,927
I guess I'm getting old and frail,

158
00:09:08,096 --> 00:09:11,266
and I get sensitive about nothing.

159
00:09:12,236 --> 00:09:15,236
I thought about our clan
and reputation too much,

160
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:16,837
and I gave you a hard time.

161
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:20,376
Auntie.

162
00:09:20,537 --> 00:09:22,006
I'm sorry, Jin Taek.

163
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,407
I won't do it again.

164
00:09:24,746 --> 00:09:27,616
I'll apologize to Soo Yeon
for going too far.

165
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,787
You could've said that sooner.

166
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:39,896
You know...

167
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:43,766
I consider you
a mother figure, don't you?

168
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:46,197
I know that.

169
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:49,937
I won't give you
a hard time anymore.

170
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:53,006
You can get back to work.

171
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,077
Will you be okay on your own?

172
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,146
Don't you be silly. I'm not a child.

173
00:10:01,687 --> 00:10:03,516
Don't mind me and return to work.

174
00:10:07,057 --> 00:10:09,986
Okay. I'll go, then.

175
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:27,106
Hello, Madam Cho. Where are you now?

176
00:10:28,077 --> 00:10:29,577
I'm on Jeju Island now.

177
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:32,447
I'm on vacation with my family.

178
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:34,077
You are?

179
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,947
When are you coming back to Seoul?

180
00:10:36,947 --> 00:10:38,587
I'm coming back
the day after tomorrow.

181
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:40,457
Why do you ask, Madam Gong?

182
00:10:41,657 --> 00:10:44,287
Madam Cho,
I have a favor to ask of you.

183
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:47,657
About the thing you told me
the other day.

184
00:10:47,657 --> 00:10:50,396
Can you meet up with Chairman Gong
and tell him that?

185
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:54,437
You want me to tell him about it?
I'm afraid I can't.

186
00:10:54,797 --> 00:10:57,136
Put yourself in my shoes.

187
00:10:57,437 --> 00:10:59,907
Would you let it slide
if this was about your son?

188
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:02,177
I know what you mean, but...

189
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:04,976
You saw it yourself, so he will
believe it if you tell him that.

190
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:08,116
So, Madam Cho, please go
to Chairman Gong with me...

191
00:11:08,116 --> 00:11:10,317
and tell him about it.

192
00:11:10,787 --> 00:11:11,856
I'm begging you.

193
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:14,016
I'm not sure if I should do that.

194
00:11:14,016 --> 00:11:16,356
I'll take responsibility
for what happens afterward.

195
00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:20,126
I promise there won't be anything
that makes you uncomfortable.

196
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:23,126
Fine. Then I'll give you a call
when I'm back.

197
00:11:23,126 --> 00:11:26,236
Okay. Thank you, Madam Cho.

198
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:29,467
Give me a call
as soon as you come back.

199
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:34,577
All right.

200
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:37,976
Jin Taek should hear it
from Madan Cho...

201
00:11:37,976 --> 00:11:40,276
and find evidence himself.

202
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:43,187
Otherwise, he won't understand
what's going on.

203
00:11:45,217 --> 00:11:47,657
Mom, things are
so peaceful and nice in the house...

204
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:49,356
without Great Auntie around.

205
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:52,957
I wish she would go
straight back to the US.

206
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:54,927
Ma Ri.

207
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:55,996
Why?

208
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:58,026
After Great Auntie came here,

209
00:11:58,026 --> 00:12:00,197
things have been a mess here.

210
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:01,907
And you frown all the time.

211
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:06,837
Your face has gotten ugly
because of Great Auntie.

212
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:12,417
So why don't we tell Great Auntie
to go back to the US?

213
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:15,346
Ma Ri, you shouldn't say
things like that.

214
00:12:15,346 --> 00:12:18,317
Why not? We have to put up with her
just because she's the elder?

215
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:22,287
That's...
I think that's unreasonable.

216
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:25,957
Auntie Dae Sook,
when did you come back?

217
00:12:26,457 --> 00:12:27,797
I just got here.

218
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,537
If I knew you'd come today,

219
00:12:32,537 --> 00:12:33,967
I would've gone to pick you up.

220
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,037
There's no need.

221
00:12:36,437 --> 00:12:38,606
I just went to get some rest
on an IV.

222
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:42,447
Soo Yeon.

223
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:47,217
Now that I think of it,
I was being too harsh on you.

224
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:49,787
I'm sorry for the trouble
I have caused.

225
00:12:50,746 --> 00:12:52,187
I apologize.

226
00:12:53,486 --> 00:12:56,957
I'm old,
so I guess I have too many worries.

227
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:58,856
I hope you can understand me.

228
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:01,797
I talked to Chairman Gong too.

229
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:04,927
I'll be more careful.

230
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:08,606
Well... It's all right.

231
00:13:09,437 --> 00:13:10,707
I'm home.

232
00:13:12,077 --> 00:13:14,707
What? Why is the light off?

233
00:13:18,646 --> 00:13:20,047
Where's everyone?

234
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,947
Mom. Dad.

235
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:25,817
Grandma.

236
00:13:27,986 --> 00:13:29,256
Even Grandma isn't home.

237
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:32,396
Where did everyone go
at this time of night?

238
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:37,126
Gosh, Pil Seung. You're home.

239
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:38,226
I just got here.

240
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:40,366
Where have you been?

241
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:42,467
- Gosh.
- Dad.

242
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:43,467
What?

243
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:44,937
Why do you have a band-aid
on your forehead?

244
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:46,506
Don't get me started.

245
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:50,276
Your dad went to work
at a construction site,

246
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:51,846
and he almost died.

247
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:54,776
We've just come from the hospital.

248
00:13:54,776 --> 00:13:55,947
What?

249
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:58,917
Dad, did you work
at a construction site?

250
00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:02,626
I got fired from my job.

251
00:14:03,657 --> 00:14:05,756
So I was going to find some money...

252
00:14:05,756 --> 00:14:09,126
so I could start some fancy business
dressed in a suit.

253
00:14:10,827 --> 00:14:12,197
But it was the wrong choice.

254
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:16,937
From now on, whether it is
at a warehouse or at a construction site,

255
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:20,337
I want to work
doing everything on my own.

256
00:14:20,437 --> 00:14:21,636
So don't try to stop me.

257
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:22,846
Mom, you can't stop me.

258
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:26,846
I can't idle away my time
at home anymore.

259
00:14:27,846 --> 00:14:30,217
I understand how you're feeling,

260
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:33,557
but you're too old to work
at a warehouse or a construction site.

261
00:14:33,557 --> 00:14:34,687
She's right, honey.

262
00:14:34,687 --> 00:14:37,486
You should do
something less challenging.

263
00:14:37,486 --> 00:14:39,626
What if you get injured again?

264
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:44,197
My heart sank when I got the call
from the hospital.

265
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:47,236
So, honey, take your time...

266
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:49,006
and find a job you can do.

267
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:52,506
It's not like an easy and nice job
is waiting for me to find it.

268
00:14:52,506 --> 00:14:55,707
In this day and age, I should
be grateful that I can work.

269
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,917
And I hurt myself
by mistake today...

270
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:01,717
because I was being such a bungler.

271
00:15:01,717 --> 00:15:03,787
It won't happen again.

272
00:15:03,787 --> 00:15:05,856
You guys should stop that now.

273
00:15:07,016 --> 00:15:08,927
Oh, dear.

274
00:15:08,927 --> 00:15:11,327
Sun Young,
the whole thing happened...

275
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,856
because of your constant nagging
for more money.

276
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:17,526
You've been so haughty
just because you own this house.

277
00:15:17,526 --> 00:15:19,596
Mom, that's not true.

278
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,337
Why do you keep blaming her?

279
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:24,766
Do you not know
why I'm being like this?

280
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:33,917
Anyway, I don't want you guys
to get on my case anymore.

281
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:36,947
I know what I'm doing. Gosh.

282
00:15:58,337 --> 00:15:59,807
Pil Seung.

283
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:01,476
Do Ra.

284
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:06,217
Do Ra, you always
pretend to be strong,

285
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:07,317
but you're a coward.

286
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:13,057
Why can't I stop
thinking about Pil Seung?

287
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:14,787
What's wrong with me?

288
00:16:17,587 --> 00:16:18,726
No way.

289
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:23,697
No, that can't be true.

290
00:16:23,697 --> 00:16:25,366
Park Do Ra,
what are you thinking about?

291
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,396
That's right.

292
00:16:27,396 --> 00:16:29,837
Pil Seung was
my first love after all.

293
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:31,136
I met him again after 15 years,

294
00:16:31,136 --> 00:16:33,907
so I was reminded of the old days
and got a little confused.

295
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:37,876
Park Do Ra, you're not supposed
to date a guy at work.

296
00:16:38,346 --> 00:16:39,817
Pull yourself together!

297
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:44,846
This is driving me crazy.

298
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:54,896
I wonder what he's doing now.

299
00:17:06,307 --> 00:17:09,006
(Curly-haired Assistant Director)

("Straightforward Romance")

301
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:15,217
What?

302
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:18,746
How can he be so cute?

303
00:17:19,486 --> 00:17:21,857
He was cute back in high school,
but he's even cuter now.

304
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:26,157
Some guys get ugly as they grow,

305
00:17:26,157 --> 00:17:28,296
but Pil Seung is getting
more handsome over time.

306
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:30,897
My gosh.

307
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:32,637
Gosh.

308
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:36,637
Gosh, what am I doing now?

309
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:38,736
Why am I looking at his photos?

310
00:17:38,836 --> 00:17:41,137
Whether he's cute or not,
it has nothing to do with me.

311
00:17:42,546 --> 00:17:44,907
Do Ra, just go to sleep.

312
00:17:45,076 --> 00:17:47,877
Go to sleep this instant.

313
00:17:48,746 --> 00:17:50,086
Sleep, Do Ra.

314
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:08,167
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

315
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,907
She called you a romantic.

316
00:18:10,907 --> 00:18:12,236
She also said you were adorable.

317
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:16,377
Women don't say
that just about anyone is adorable.

318
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:23,986
Is it finally time
to give her this necklace?

319
00:18:26,717 --> 00:18:28,086
Once Do Ra receives this,

320
00:18:29,157 --> 00:18:31,687
she will totally fall for me.

321
00:18:33,927 --> 00:18:36,097
This is from CEO Gong Jin Dan.

322
00:18:36,097 --> 00:18:37,826
- CEO Gong Jin Dan?
- Yes.

323
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:40,937
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

324
00:18:44,836 --> 00:18:46,177
Gosh, this is gorgeous.

325
00:18:47,137 --> 00:18:49,246
Look at the size of the necklace.

326
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,877
It's brilliant.

327
00:18:51,707 --> 00:18:55,316
I must say Mr. Gong is
in a different league from us.

328
00:18:58,086 --> 00:19:00,486
Do Ra.

329
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,056
It's so pretty.

330
00:19:02,056 --> 00:19:04,157
It looks great on you.

331
00:19:04,157 --> 00:19:05,756
Do you like it?

332
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:08,397
Yes. It's beautiful.

333
00:19:08,627 --> 00:19:09,697
My gosh.

334
00:19:09,697 --> 00:19:11,496
Do Ra, turn around.

335
00:19:11,496 --> 00:19:12,637
- What?
- Now.

336
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:16,407
Hang on a second.

337
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:21,607
Look. This is totally your style.

338
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:22,746
Right.

339
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:25,947
By the way, Mom,
did you buy this yourself?

340
00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:27,717
We have a necklace
that looks just like this.

341
00:19:28,316 --> 00:19:30,387
Why would I pay money to buy this?

342
00:19:30,387 --> 00:19:33,516
Mr. Gong just sent this to you
with some flowers.

343
00:19:33,516 --> 00:19:35,887
What? Mr. Gong Jin Dan?

344
00:19:36,457 --> 00:19:39,457
Why would he send me
something so expensive?

345
00:19:39,796 --> 00:19:42,157
And why did you accept it?

346
00:19:42,157 --> 00:19:43,697
Give it back right away.

347
00:19:43,697 --> 00:19:45,467
You can't receive a gift like this.

348
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:46,697
Why would we give it back?

349
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:49,667
Mr. Gong sent it
because he was interested in you.

350
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:52,677
Hey, Do Ra, don't be like that.

351
00:19:52,677 --> 00:19:55,207
Why don't you try
going out with Mr. Gong?

352
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:57,147
I'm not saying this
because of the necklace.

353
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:59,647
I think he's a really nice guy.

354
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:02,516
Mom. I said I wasn't
interested in Mr. Gong.

355
00:20:03,046 --> 00:20:06,756
Do Ra, I don't want to give up
on a son-in-law like this.

356
00:20:06,756 --> 00:20:09,586
Why do you say no
even before going on a date?

357
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:11,887
Wait. Is it because...

358
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:13,927
you're seeing someone
without telling me?

359
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:15,157
Is that why?

360
00:20:15,357 --> 00:20:17,697
I'm not seeing anyone.
That's not why.

361
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:19,967
I can't go out with a man
whom I'm not interested in.

362
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:22,467
I'm not in need of money.
Why would I take this?

363
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:24,867
Give it back right away.

364
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,437
I'm off to work.

365
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:29,746
But... Do Ra, come on.

366
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:33,546
Why isn't she interested
in Mr. Gong...

367
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:35,647
when she isn't seeing anyone
in particular?

368
00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:39,016
Not anyone can send over
a necklace like this.

369
00:20:39,016 --> 00:20:40,016
Is it easy to find a man in Korea...

370
00:20:40,016 --> 00:20:42,786
who can send a necklace
of this quality as a gift?

371
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:44,486
Unbelievable.

372
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:50,566
Did you receive the gift I sent?

373
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:52,667
I hope Do Ra liked it.

374
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:55,066
What am I going to do?

375
00:20:55,066 --> 00:20:56,667
Oh, dear.

376
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:05,147
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

377
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,286
Do Ra was thrilled
to have received this gift from you.

378
00:21:13,086 --> 00:21:14,457
Of course.

379
00:21:22,026 --> 00:21:23,066
What?

380
00:21:23,066 --> 00:21:25,197
(Ms. Baek Mi Ja)

381
00:21:29,207 --> 00:21:32,336
How can she be this pretty?

382
00:21:34,637 --> 00:21:36,246
Her eyes...

383
00:21:37,107 --> 00:21:38,576
sparkle brighter than diamonds.

384
00:21:47,496 --> 00:21:49,466
What? It's Do Jun.

385
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,310
Do Jun!

386
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,750
Do Jun, my boy. Have you been well?

387
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,121
Please tell me
you've been studying hard.

388
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,990
Are you healthy
and have been eating well?

389
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,490
You always ask me...

390
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,891
if I've been studying hard
or eating well.

391
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:05,961
I'm not a kid, you know.

392
00:22:06,121 --> 00:22:07,931
You'll forever be a kid in my eyes.

393
00:22:08,391 --> 00:22:12,101
Do Jun, you know
who I earn all this money for.

394
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,830
I know it all too well.

395
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:16,931
That's why I've been studying
my butt off like any other day.

396
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,240
Gosh, my boy.

397
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:23,171
Do Jun, aren't you going to visit
during spring break?

398
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:24,911
I miss you like crazy.

399
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,250
I can't make it this year.
I have a lot to catch up on.

400
00:22:28,711 --> 00:22:30,750
That's too bad, I guess.

401
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:34,290
Instead, once I wrap up
this project,

402
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,421
I'll fly over to the States. Got it?

403
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,760
Right, but don't overexert yourself.

404
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,161
Sure thing, Do Jun.

405
00:22:43,461 --> 00:22:45,931
Do Jun, they're calling me
for my next scene.

406
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,500
I'll talk to you later.

407
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,300
Bye.

408
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:56,810
Jae Dong, tell me.
How do I look today?

409
00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:58,941
I've been meaning to mention it.

410
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,451
I bet you didn't get
much sleep last night.

411
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,451
Were you still shocked
from being left behind?

412
00:23:02,451 --> 00:23:04,050
The bags under your eyes
are down to your jaw.

413
00:23:04,381 --> 00:23:05,381
What?

414
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,750
Like this.

415
00:23:09,851 --> 00:23:11,421
Do Ra, I need to take this call
from Ms. Baek.

416
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:14,760
- The bags under my eyes can't show.
- Yes?

417
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:17,944
(Park Do Ra)

418
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,401
- Assistant Director Ko...
- Gosh.

419
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:23,530
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm good.

420
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:25,401
Here. Let me carry that for you.

421
00:23:25,441 --> 00:23:27,340
- But it's fine.
- It's no big deal.

422
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,611
Sook Ja, are you kidding me?

423
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,550
Who is she to grab onto him?

424
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,820
How dare she flirt with him on set?

425
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:44,490
I bet that was on purpose.

426
00:23:45,421 --> 00:23:48,030
This is a tough scene
and injuries may easily occur,

427
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,361
so please be thorough
with their line of action.

428
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,391
- Sure.
- Of course.

429
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:53,661
Park Do Ra walks from here fuming,

430
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:56,401
- and Bong Soo grabs her shoulder.
- Grabbing.

431
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:59,641
Do Ra shakes him off
but loses her balance.

432
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,141
Bong Soo breaks her fall
but they end up rolling down.

433
00:24:02,411 --> 00:24:04,980
Their eyes lock...

434
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:06,441
and then kiss.

435
00:24:08,611 --> 00:24:10,111
Director!

436
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,320
I'd like to rehearse this
in person...

437
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,290
with Assistant Director Ko.

438
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:20,530
We're only checking
the flow of movement,

439
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,790
so you can sit this out.

440
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,000
You'll be going over it later
with Bong Soo.

441
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,030
Rehearsals or whatnot,

442
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:30,070
I'd like to go over the scene myself
since it can be tricky.

443
00:24:30,431 --> 00:24:33,371
Won't I be filming the scene
instead of my double?

444
00:24:34,111 --> 00:24:37,280
Gosh, this passion and drive!

445
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:39,711
Talk about being a professional.

446
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:42,780
Our show is going to be a hit!

447
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,351
Honey, wait. Hear me out.

448
00:24:49,351 --> 00:24:50,560
- Let go of me.
- You shake him off...

449
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,861
and he breaks your fall
as you stumble.

450
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:53,260
Cut. Okay.

451
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:55,260
All right, lay out the blanket.

452
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,530
We'll rehearse them rolling down.

453
00:24:58,201 --> 00:25:01,101
Ms. Park, are you sure
about doing this yourself?

454
00:25:01,931 --> 00:25:02,931
Yes.

455
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:04,471
Don't roll down so much, then.

456
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,971
Okay, here we go.

457
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:08,010
Be careful.

458
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,881
Pil Seung...

459
00:25:21,421 --> 00:25:24,060
Pil Seung, please wake up.

460
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,020
Director Hong!

461
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,990
Director Hong! Jae Dong!

462
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,601
Someone call an ambulance.

463
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,030
Pil Seung, please wake up.

464
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,810
Pil Seung, don't die.

465
00:25:41,711 --> 00:25:44,111
Please open your eyes.

466
00:25:48,151 --> 00:25:49,411
Pil Seung!

467
00:25:51,681 --> 00:25:53,181
Ms. Park.

468
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:55,520
Please stop wailing.

469
00:25:56,351 --> 00:25:58,090
You're numbing my ears.

470
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:10,641
I guess I was too invested
in my character just now...

471
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:12,471
and believed that this was real.

472
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,310
Well,

473
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,141
I mistook my situation
and believed...

474
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,211
I was working the scene
with Bong Soo.

475
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,750
Can we take a short break?

476
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,750
I was so lost in character
that the emotions hit hard.

477
00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:32,320
I expected nothing less
from an actress of her level.

478
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,320
My gosh.

479
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,590
Of course.

480
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,800
Have I lost my mind?

481
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,270
What did I do
in front of all those people?

482
00:26:43,671 --> 00:26:44,840
This is humiliating.

483
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,941
Do Ra, you...

484
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:50,111
What is it?
Are they snickering at me?

485
00:26:50,411 --> 00:26:53,411
Could you and Bong Soo
be in a situationship?

486
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:55,480
Don't tell me
you have a crush on him.

487
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,851
What kind of nonsense is that?

488
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,050
Don't you get started
with me as well...

489
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,760
and get me a freezie
to help me cool down.

490
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:06,361
Got it. A freezie.

491
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,461
Me and Cha Bong Soo?

492
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,201
You've got to be kidding me.

493
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,901
Hold on. That's actually better.

494
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,570
At least they don't think
I have a crush on Pil Seung.

495
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,411
Besides,

496
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:26,911
actors can get caught up
in the moment...

497
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,111
when acting out a scene...

498
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:30,951
and let the emotions
get the best of them.

499
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:37,191
I hope no one saw through me though.

500
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,191
Darn, I must have lost my mind.
What is wrong with me?

501
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,701
Mom, what kind of nonsense
are you spewing?

502
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:50,770
Tell me about it.

503
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:54,611
Your brother wants his son-in-law
to be his successor,

504
00:27:54,911 --> 00:27:56,510
and your aunt wants him
to father another child...

505
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,641
through a mistress or a surrogate.

506
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,580
They were at each other's throats,

507
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,111
but for some odd reason,

508
00:28:02,351 --> 00:28:03,980
your aunt retracted her claws.

509
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:06,121
She must be cooking something up.

510
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:09,391
Gosh, Mom.
Mind your own business, will you?

511
00:28:09,391 --> 00:28:10,990
How can I not be bothered by it?

512
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,721
It's frustrating
and my ego is bruised.

513
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,191
Why are they fighting over this matter
when they have you?

514
00:28:16,691 --> 00:28:18,401
You're part of this family too.

515
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:21,000
Mom, I told you not to worry.

516
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,000
Jin Taek isn't one
to have a child out of wedlock.

517
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,570
Besides,
even if that were to happen,

518
00:28:27,971 --> 00:28:30,740
it would take forever
to raise that child.

519
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:33,381
And a son-in-law, did you say?

520
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:35,381
Mom,

521
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,020
nobody decent will think
of marrying Ma Ri.

522
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,151
Tell me about it.

523
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:43,520
In the end, APP Group
will fall into my hands.

524
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,121
There's no need for us
to be anxious.

525
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,730
Only I can succeed Jin Taek.

526
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,461
I'm the only eligible member
of the Gong family.

527
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,830
That's true.

528
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,471
By the way, who is the woman
you've been seeing?

529
00:28:57,701 --> 00:28:59,500
The curiosity is killing me.

530
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,671
Gosh, Mom. I told you to be patient.

531
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,310
I almost have her.

532
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,810
That's why I want you to tell me.

533
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,881
Or I'll have to hire someone
to look into it.

534
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:10,651
Which family is she from?

535
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:13,020
Mom.

536
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:15,990
You know Park Do Ra, right?

537
00:29:16,691 --> 00:29:17,760
Park Do Ra?

538
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,490
Which family is she from?

539
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,590
Come on.

540
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,560
I'm talking about
the actress Park Do Ra.

541
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,961
Didn't you watch "Windy Gang Poong?"

542
00:29:26,661 --> 00:29:28,201
She played the female lead.

543
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:30,101
We watched it together, remember?

544
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,471
What? That Park Do Ra?

545
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:35,471
Seriously. Have you been dating
some lowly actress?

546
00:29:35,471 --> 00:29:37,810
Have you lost your mind?
This isn't happening.

547
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,211
Just wait until your brother
or aunt finds out.

548
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:41,651
They already look down on you.

549
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:42,681
You can forget APP Group...

550
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:44,381
and even Angel Investment Corp.
for that matter.

551
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:46,250
No way. This can never happen.

552
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,851
End it before others find out.

553
00:29:47,851 --> 00:29:49,951
Mom, don't talk about her like that.

554
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:54,260
I haven't met a woman
like Park Do Ra before.

555
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:57,260
So this time around,
you'll turn a blind eye to it.

556
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,330
I won't marry anyone that isn't her.

557
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:07,770
You film in the afternoon tomorrow,
so I'll pick you up then.

558
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,871
Sure. You did great today.
Drive home safely.

559
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,810
Bye.

560
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,320
Who's calling me?
I don't recognize the number.

561
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:34,830
Hello?

562
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,971
Is this Actress Park Do Ra?

563
00:30:37,941 --> 00:30:41,611
Yes, this is she.
May I ask who's calling?

564
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,181
This is CEO Gong's mother.

565
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,340
Pardon?

566
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:49,611
I'll cut right to the chase.

567
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,151
Break it off with Jin Dan.

568
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,621
This relationship
will never be approved.

569
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:58,020
Sorry?
I don't get what you're saying.

570
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,290
Gosh.

571
00:30:59,661 --> 00:31:01,961
Why can't a Korean
understand her native language?

572
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,901
You are to let my Jin Dan go.

573
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,770
Our family will never approve
of him dating some lowly actress.

574
00:31:11,201 --> 00:31:13,740
I think you are mistaken.

575
00:31:14,611 --> 00:31:17,310
There's nothing going on
between me and Mr. Gong.

576
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:21,480
If this is about us
watching the musical together,

577
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,080
you truly have the wrong idea.

578
00:31:23,451 --> 00:31:26,250
Mr. Gong invited me
to see the musical together,

579
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,750
and I went with him...

580
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,721
to thank him for investing
in the show I'm filming.

581
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,161
That's all there is to it.

582
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:34,290
Is that true?

583
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,661
Is there nothing more to it?

584
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:37,730
No.

585
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,570
I'm afraid I'm not interested in him
in a romantic way.

586
00:31:42,131 --> 00:31:43,230
Not at all?

587
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,701
Not at all.

588
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,740
Do you mean that?

589
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,070
Yes.

590
00:31:48,441 --> 00:31:50,871
Nothing's going on
that requires us to break up.

591
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:54,381
Honestly,

592
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,921
I don't know why I should
be taking this from you.

593
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,651
I'll get going, then.

594
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,661
Wait.

595
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:10,961
By the way,

596
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,060
I believe it's wrong to look down...

597
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,230
on someone's profession
by calling it lowly.

598
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:24,381
What the... That cheeky girl.

599
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,681
What now, Mom? I'm busy.

600
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,951
Are you kidding me?

601
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:34,050
Park Do Ra
isn't interested in you at all.

602
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,121
She only went to see
the musical with you...

603
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:36,621
because you invited her.

604
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,921
You idiot.

605
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:39,520
I can't believe
you've been chasing her skirt...

606
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,161
when she isn't
even interested in you.

607
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,691
Mom, did you meet with Park Do Ra?

608
00:32:43,691 --> 00:32:45,901
That's right.
And I told her to let you go.

609
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:47,260
I told her to break up with you,

610
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,871
but she said
you weren't even dating.

611
00:32:48,871 --> 00:32:50,371
Why would you do that?

612
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,641
Who are you to meet with her?

613
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:55,010
- Darn it.
- What?

614
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,371
Where are you going?

615
00:32:56,371 --> 00:32:58,040
Are you off to see that minx?

616
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,510
She isn't interested in you!

617
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:05,681
Ms. Park, I heard you met my mom.

618
00:33:06,881 --> 00:33:08,290
I'm sorry about this.

619
00:33:08,691 --> 00:33:10,550
She must've caught you off guard.

620
00:33:12,461 --> 00:33:13,490
She did.

621
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,560
She had the wrong idea
that we were dating.

622
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,901
But that's not the case with us.

623
00:33:21,431 --> 00:33:22,971
I told her...

624
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:25,401
that I wasn't
romantically interested in you.

625
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,401
What are you saying?

626
00:33:28,911 --> 00:33:30,441
Weren't we just starting to go out?

627
00:33:31,681 --> 00:33:32,711
Sorry?

628
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:36,980
Mr. Gong, I don't think I follow.

629
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,721
When did we...

630
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,750
I never thought about it that way.

631
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,131
Call me flustered.

632
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,861
Then,

633
00:33:55,171 --> 00:33:56,931
why did you watch
the musical with me...

634
00:33:57,901 --> 00:33:59,570
and accept the necklace I gave you?

635
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,471
You told your mother...

636
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:04,810
that I seemed like a decent guy.

637
00:34:05,681 --> 00:34:08,010
I thought you were also
interested in me.

638
00:34:11,921 --> 00:34:13,020
It's true...

639
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,221
that I see you as someone decent.

640
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,391
But there is nothing romantic
about it.

641
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:21,630
I'm fond of you as the sponsor
who invested in the drama series.

642
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,260
As for the musical...

643
00:34:28,871 --> 00:34:31,170
My mom suddenly
came down with a stomachache,

644
00:34:31,871 --> 00:34:34,510
and I ended up seeing
the musical with you alone.

645
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,311
Never did I consider it as a date.

646
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,041
Also, I told my mom
to return the necklace,

647
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:41,880
and I thought she had returned it.

648
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:46,121
I'll check again
if you didn't get it back.

649
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,590
I apologize if my actions
involuntarily led to you...

650
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,831
having the wrong idea about us.

651
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,661
Are you saying...

652
00:34:59,101 --> 00:35:01,501
that I've been fantasizing
our relationship all on my own?

653
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,800
I'll be more careful on my end,

654
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,240
so I hope nothing like this
happens again.

655
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,311
I'll get going, then.

656
00:35:20,581 --> 00:35:23,320
Why does she want me
to return something this pretty?

657
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,621
I'll make sure
that Do Ra and Mr. Gong...

658
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,431
end up together no matter what.

659
00:35:29,891 --> 00:35:31,900
Only then will I be able to survive.

660
00:35:32,661 --> 00:35:33,661
Gosh.

661
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:45,081
Yes, it's me.

662
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,911
What?

663
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,510
Everyone is gathered?

664
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,960
Please place your bets.

665
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,900
Three.

666
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:14,070
- Call.
- Three, call.

667
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,911
Please reveal your cards.

668
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,681
It's a straight.

669
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,280
There.

670
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,050
Beaten by a flush.

671
00:36:38,201 --> 00:36:39,201
Here.

672
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:47,101
Pal, when have I ever
gone around wearing a fake?

673
00:36:47,201 --> 00:36:49,641
Stop fidgeting with that
and give me my money.

674
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:51,210
Sure. I'll get it to you right away.

675
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:01,251
My gosh!

676
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,621
Seriously?

677
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,431
Baek Mi Ja, you.

678
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:13,431
And you call yourself a human being?

679
00:37:14,931 --> 00:37:15,971
Why...

680
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,940
Why did you come here...

681
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,070
after losing all that money you had?

682
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,110
My gosh.

683
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:27,041
Should I just cut off my wrist?

684
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:29,251
What can I do about you?

685
00:37:30,411 --> 00:37:32,650
I gambled away Do Ra's payment
I received in advance.

686
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,090
How am I going to pay
the interest next month?

687
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,820
What am I going to do?

688
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,940
Hey, Do Ra. What's up?

689
00:37:52,141 --> 00:37:53,740
Mom, where are you?

690
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,740
Me?

691
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,871
I went out to see a friend.

692
00:37:57,871 --> 00:37:58,880
Why?

693
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,141
Didn't you return the necklace
Mr. Gong gave me?

694
00:38:01,569 --> 00:38:05,932
Oh, that? I still have it.

695
00:38:05,956 --> 00:38:08,087
Why? I've been busy, you see.

696
00:38:08,087 --> 00:38:10,096
I told you
to give it back right away.

697
00:38:10,096 --> 00:38:12,197
How could you have kept it?

698
00:38:12,197 --> 00:38:14,427
Not returning it
led to a weird misunderstanding,

699
00:38:14,427 --> 00:38:16,536
and Mr. Gong's mother
came to see me.

700
00:38:16,536 --> 00:38:17,536
What?

701
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,306
Mr. Gong's mother came to see you?

702
00:38:21,306 --> 00:38:22,306
Why?

703
00:38:22,306 --> 00:38:25,677
She thought I was dating her son
and told me to break up with him.

704
00:38:25,777 --> 00:38:26,976
She wanted me gone.

705
00:38:27,507 --> 00:38:30,976
Why should I hear such things
from Mr. Gong's mother?

706
00:38:31,516 --> 00:38:34,846
Hey, Do Ra. So what did you say?

707
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:36,357
What else would I say?

708
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:38,717
I told her
I was not interested in her son,

709
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:40,927
and made it clear
nothing was going on between us.

710
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:45,027
So return that necklace
to him soon, okay?

711
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:46,797
Hey, Do...

712
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:53,337
What should I do? What do I do now?

713
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,476
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

714
00:38:56,476 --> 00:38:57,507
It's him.

715
00:38:58,206 --> 00:39:00,377
Oh, my gosh.

716
00:39:01,246 --> 00:39:03,416
What should I do?

717
00:39:07,286 --> 00:39:08,447
Ms. Baek.

718
00:39:09,587 --> 00:39:11,116
What's going on?

719
00:39:11,757 --> 00:39:14,657
He's calling me "Ms. Baek" now,
not "Mother."

720
00:39:14,726 --> 00:39:16,556
He must be really angry.

721
00:39:16,556 --> 00:39:17,996
This isn't good.

722
00:39:18,427 --> 00:39:21,166
No, Baek Mi Ja.
Keep your wits about you.

723
00:39:21,496 --> 00:39:24,596
Even if you're in a tiger's den,
if you stay alert, you can get out.

724
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:27,067
Mr. Gong. What's happening is...

725
00:39:27,067 --> 00:39:28,507
You said...

726
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,377
Do Ra was interested in me too.

727
00:39:31,206 --> 00:39:32,576
But she said no.

728
00:39:33,377 --> 00:39:35,177
That she's not
interested in me at all.

729
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:39,646
She even said she'd told you
to return the necklace.

730
00:39:39,817 --> 00:39:42,686
Why did you let your mother...

731
00:39:42,686 --> 00:39:46,257
visit Do Ra and talk to her
about you in person?

732
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:48,726
What?

733
00:39:48,857 --> 00:39:51,226
Do Ra was never once
embroiled in a scandal.

734
00:39:51,826 --> 00:39:55,467
As you know, she's a prideful girl
who is very exact,

735
00:39:55,467 --> 00:39:58,866
and she doesn't open up
or give her heart easily.

736
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:01,107
But that girl went with you...

737
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,976
to a musical without anyone else.

738
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:05,277
I think...

739
00:40:05,877 --> 00:40:08,746
my Do Ra was interested in you.

740
00:40:09,377 --> 00:40:12,587
If your mother hadn't shown up
and made such a fuss,

741
00:40:12,587 --> 00:40:14,087
I can confidently say...

742
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:17,916
Do Ra would've
opened up to you even more.

743
00:40:20,326 --> 00:40:23,396
Are you saying
it's my mother's fault?

744
00:40:23,396 --> 00:40:27,826
My Do Ra's one of
the top actresses in the country.

745
00:40:27,896 --> 00:40:29,837
Put yourself in her shoes.

746
00:40:30,396 --> 00:40:33,907
She's so full of pride
and it took a bad hit.

747
00:40:33,907 --> 00:40:35,806
How miserable must she feel?

748
00:40:35,877 --> 00:40:39,547
If I'm this upset with you,
how do you think she feels?

749
00:40:41,746 --> 00:40:44,777
I apologize.
I didn't think that far.

750
00:40:45,887 --> 00:40:47,387
Mother, could you tell Do Ra...

751
00:40:49,956 --> 00:40:51,217
What should I do now?

752
00:40:55,357 --> 00:40:58,996
Right now, apologizing
will only make things worse.

753
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:04,266
I think you should wait for a while.

754
00:41:04,366 --> 00:41:08,306
I'll do my best to console Do Ra.

755
00:41:09,036 --> 00:41:10,407
Will you really do that?

756
00:41:11,107 --> 00:41:12,306
Thank you, Mother.

757
00:41:12,777 --> 00:41:14,507
I'm in your debt yet again.

758
00:41:16,177 --> 00:41:18,947
And the necklace.

759
00:41:19,846 --> 00:41:23,157
Can you say for now...

760
00:41:24,016 --> 00:41:26,627
that you got it back?

761
00:41:26,627 --> 00:41:28,487
When Do Ra feels a little better,

762
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,627
I'll pass it to you in secret.

763
00:41:32,927 --> 00:41:34,166
Yes, okay.

764
00:41:34,967 --> 00:41:38,366
My mother will never visit again.

765
00:41:39,107 --> 00:41:40,737
Please don't be angry, Mother.

766
00:41:41,337 --> 00:41:42,877
Will you forgive me?

767
00:41:43,677 --> 00:41:44,976
Please, Mother.

768
00:41:45,507 --> 00:41:47,377
I'm so darn upset.

769
00:41:48,007 --> 00:41:50,846
You have no idea how hurt I am.

770
00:41:53,487 --> 00:41:56,116
That was so close.

771
00:42:02,496 --> 00:42:05,496
Do Ra. Drink this before you go.

772
00:42:06,396 --> 00:42:07,496
What is it?

773
00:42:08,027 --> 00:42:09,666
Boiled pear, jujube,

774
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:12,266
and balloon flower root with honey.

775
00:42:15,137 --> 00:42:16,177
Oh, right.

776
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:18,907
Did you return the necklace
Mr. Gong gave you?

777
00:42:19,377 --> 00:42:22,476
Yes, I did. You told me to.

778
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:30,016
Do Ra. Here's some motherly advice.

779
00:42:30,286 --> 00:42:33,456
Give Mr. Gong some serious thought.

780
00:42:33,587 --> 00:42:35,286
Not just because he's rich.

781
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:36,996
I think he's a really nice guy.

782
00:42:36,996 --> 00:42:39,326
He likes you a lot.

783
00:42:39,567 --> 00:42:41,697
I think he'll cherish you forever.

784
00:42:41,697 --> 00:42:44,567
Give him a chance. Just this once.

785
00:42:44,837 --> 00:42:47,107
Mom. I'll date a guy...

786
00:42:47,407 --> 00:42:49,907
my heart gravitates toward.

787
00:42:50,576 --> 00:42:54,146
So don't mention
Mr. Gong again, okay?

788
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:56,576
See you.

789
00:42:59,016 --> 00:43:00,487
You brat.

790
00:43:02,317 --> 00:43:06,427
She'll date the guy
her heart gravitates toward?

791
00:43:07,456 --> 00:43:10,096
Is she seeing someone?

792
00:43:10,556 --> 00:43:13,326
Is it Cha Bong Soo?

793
00:43:14,366 --> 00:43:15,567
Do Ra.

794
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:18,197
Is she seeing someone?

795
00:43:18,967 --> 00:43:21,266
Do Ra has a boyfriend?
No, I don't think so.

796
00:43:22,237 --> 00:43:23,337
Really?

797
00:43:23,536 --> 00:43:26,407
Then how are things
with Cha Bong Soo?

798
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:28,607
Actors fall in love with each other
while working on projects.

799
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:30,447
Did you notice anything
between them?

800
00:43:30,447 --> 00:43:32,547
They've gotten more amicable now,

801
00:43:32,547 --> 00:43:34,387
but they were at
each other's throats at first.

802
00:43:34,387 --> 00:43:35,916
It won't be Cha Bong Soo.

803
00:43:36,387 --> 00:43:38,387
I think it's impossible.

804
00:43:38,857 --> 00:43:40,027
Really?

805
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,857
Ms. Baek. I have to get back
before Do Ra's shoot ends.

806
00:43:43,857 --> 00:43:46,127
- Oh, yes. You should go.
- Okay.

807
00:43:46,127 --> 00:43:47,326
Hey, Jae Dong.

808
00:43:47,527 --> 00:43:51,067
- Keep a close eye on Do Ra.
- Okay.

809
00:43:51,067 --> 00:43:52,637
- See you.
- Bye.

810
00:43:53,436 --> 00:43:54,766
- Take care.
- Thanks.

811
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,706
(CEO Baek Mi Ja)

812
00:43:56,706 --> 00:43:57,777
Mom.

813
00:43:58,306 --> 00:44:00,706
You were fine for a while.
What's up now?

814
00:44:01,076 --> 00:44:03,217
Do Ra's a grown-up. Leave her alone.

815
00:44:03,346 --> 00:44:04,717
Why can't she date?

816
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:09,956
We're so close to becoming in-laws
with APP Group's chairman,

817
00:44:09,956 --> 00:44:11,686
which is a massive blessing,

818
00:44:11,686 --> 00:44:13,127
and you want me to let it go?

819
00:44:13,127 --> 00:44:15,757
Do you think we'll get
another shot like this?

820
00:44:15,757 --> 00:44:17,496
Are you saying that...

821
00:44:17,556 --> 00:44:19,927
CEO Gong Jin Dan likes Do Ra?

822
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:21,366
Hello.

823
00:44:30,436 --> 00:44:33,447
How did Pil Seung grow up so nicely?

824
00:44:34,677 --> 00:44:36,116
Why is he so handsome?

825
00:44:39,786 --> 00:44:41,686
My gosh. What's up with me again?

826
00:44:41,817 --> 00:44:42,987
I said I wouldn't do this.

827
00:44:43,616 --> 00:44:44,857
Get a grip, Park Do Ra.

828
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:52,127
Yes. I was so scared
on the deserted island...

829
00:44:52,297 --> 00:44:55,096
that I relied a bit too much
on Pil Seung, that's why.

830
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,436
I should blame the memories
of naive 12-year-old Do Ra.

831
00:44:59,737 --> 00:45:03,137
Do Ra. Open your eyes wide
and get a good look.

832
00:45:03,337 --> 00:45:05,076
How is that
curly-haired guy handsome?

833
00:45:05,076 --> 00:45:06,177
Darn it.

834
00:45:06,576 --> 00:45:09,076
- Oh, dear.
- Are you okay?

835
00:45:09,377 --> 00:45:11,076
It's fine. It's just a small cut.

836
00:45:11,076 --> 00:45:13,447
Hang on.
I have ointment and a band-aid.

837
00:45:13,487 --> 00:45:15,587
- I can manage.
- No, your hands are dirty.

838
00:45:30,837 --> 00:45:32,036
Mr. Ko!

839
00:45:35,407 --> 00:45:38,277
Assistant Director Ko.

840
00:45:39,007 --> 00:45:40,177
Who, me?

841
00:45:40,346 --> 00:45:43,047
I have something to say.

842
00:45:43,047 --> 00:45:44,476
Can I have a word?

843
00:45:46,516 --> 00:45:47,587
Okay.

844
00:45:47,587 --> 00:45:48,616
Thanks.

845
00:45:53,587 --> 00:45:55,357
What is it? Is there a problem?

846
00:45:56,826 --> 00:45:58,027
Well...

847
00:45:59,027 --> 00:46:00,297
You know...

848
00:46:01,027 --> 00:46:02,266
So...

849
00:46:02,567 --> 00:46:04,697
I miss the tteokbokki
from last time,

850
00:46:04,697 --> 00:46:06,467
and it kept me up last night.

851
00:46:06,936 --> 00:46:09,806
Could you come with me again today?

852
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:12,177
You know I can't go on my own.

853
00:46:15,277 --> 00:46:17,877
You yelled at me that loudly
to say that?

854
00:46:18,116 --> 00:46:21,286
Was my voice that loud?

855
00:46:21,286 --> 00:46:24,317
Yes. It was so loud
I thought something was wrong.

856
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,157
Sorry.

857
00:46:27,157 --> 00:46:29,556
I didn't notice
because I had my earphones in.

858
00:46:30,697 --> 00:46:33,996
Anyway, I end early today,
so you'll come with me, right?

859
00:46:34,197 --> 00:46:35,226
Okay.

860
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:43,837
Park Do Ra. Why the heck
did you mention tteokbokki?

861
00:46:44,007 --> 00:46:46,507
Why do you care
if Pil Seung puts ointment...

862
00:46:46,507 --> 00:46:47,947
and a band-aid on his finger or not?

863
00:46:48,377 --> 00:46:52,516
Why did you yell for him so loudly?

864
00:46:58,757 --> 00:47:00,257
I'll just have some tteokbokki,

865
00:47:00,927 --> 00:47:02,857
and forget how I relied on him
on the island.

866
00:47:04,357 --> 00:47:06,197
Little 12-year-old Do Ra's feelings.

867
00:47:07,396 --> 00:47:08,666
I'll ditch them for good.

868
00:47:09,596 --> 00:47:11,297
- You have lunch...
- That's right.

869
00:47:11,297 --> 00:47:12,297
with Chairman Kim at noon.

870
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:13,337
Okay.

871
00:47:17,206 --> 00:47:18,607
- Let me help.
- You go ahead.

872
00:47:18,607 --> 00:47:19,646
Yes, sir.

873
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:21,476
Pil Seung.

874
00:47:22,177 --> 00:47:25,177
- Sir. How are you?
- Hi.

875
00:47:25,877 --> 00:47:28,887
I heard someone would be
shooting out here today.

876
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,487
It's your team?

877
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:33,226
Yes. We're done and are packing up.

878
00:47:33,387 --> 00:47:34,487
Are you?

879
00:47:35,087 --> 00:47:37,726
How about you join me for some tea?

880
00:47:37,726 --> 00:47:38,797
Are you free?

881
00:47:40,226 --> 00:47:41,567
Yes, I am.

882
00:47:41,797 --> 00:47:44,137
When your grandfather
suddenly passed,

883
00:47:44,137 --> 00:47:46,467
you were in high school, right?

884
00:47:47,206 --> 00:47:48,266
Yes.

885
00:47:48,536 --> 00:47:51,476
Thank you so much
for coming to pay your respects.

886
00:47:53,576 --> 00:47:56,007
That high-school student grew up...

887
00:47:56,677 --> 00:47:58,416
into a nice young man.

888
00:47:59,346 --> 00:48:01,746
I was surprised
to see you last time.

889
00:48:02,217 --> 00:48:04,056
My wife told me who you were.

890
00:48:04,186 --> 00:48:06,226
I didn't recognize you at all.

891
00:48:06,627 --> 00:48:09,127
I did do quite a lot of growing.

892
00:48:09,657 --> 00:48:10,726
You did.

893
00:48:10,757 --> 00:48:12,967
How did you become so tall?

894
00:48:13,797 --> 00:48:16,467
My mother cooked me meat every day.

895
00:48:16,496 --> 00:48:17,996
She said I should eat well...

896
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:19,607
to gain energy and study hard.

897
00:48:19,837 --> 00:48:22,877
Every day I ate meat,
fruit, and milk.

898
00:48:22,877 --> 00:48:24,337
And one day,

899
00:48:24,337 --> 00:48:26,377
I started to feel that
the ground was becoming distant.

900
00:48:26,377 --> 00:48:29,377
What? The ground was
becoming distant?

901
00:48:29,377 --> 00:48:30,777
Yes. So I told Mom.

902
00:48:30,777 --> 00:48:33,087
"Mom, the ground
appears to be so far away."

903
00:48:33,087 --> 00:48:34,646
Mom laughed a lot
when she heard that.

904
00:48:36,157 --> 00:48:37,286
You're funny.

905
00:48:38,987 --> 00:48:40,487
- Let's drink.
- Thank you.

906
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:51,436
We never know when we will
run into each other in life.

907
00:48:51,436 --> 00:48:52,697
I can't avoid her every time.

908
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:55,266
No. So we should clear things up...

909
00:48:55,806 --> 00:48:57,277
and let nature take its course.

910
00:49:00,246 --> 00:49:03,377
All right. No woman says no
to a designer bag.

911
00:49:06,447 --> 00:49:08,686
A woman holding grudges against me
might ruin my whole life.

912
00:49:15,326 --> 00:49:16,596
Welcome.

913
00:49:16,596 --> 00:49:17,896
Welcome.

914
00:49:21,697 --> 00:49:23,496
It happened before,
and it's happening again.

915
00:49:23,496 --> 00:49:25,396
Why do her eyes look so pretty?

916
00:49:26,666 --> 00:49:27,907
What's going on?

917
00:49:28,407 --> 00:49:29,976
Is my vision getting bad?

918
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:35,947
Excuse me.

919
00:49:36,947 --> 00:49:39,416
Can I talk to you for a moment?

920
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:42,286
Why would I? Do you know me?

921
00:49:43,257 --> 00:49:45,087
Please don't be like that.
It won't take long.

922
00:49:45,087 --> 00:49:46,286
Listen.

923
00:49:46,286 --> 00:49:48,157
Don't you see that I'm working here?

924
00:49:48,927 --> 00:49:50,596
If you aren't going
to order something, please leave.

925
00:49:55,366 --> 00:49:56,967
One cappuccino, please.

926
00:50:00,337 --> 00:50:01,436
(Naphant)

927
00:50:06,976 --> 00:50:08,476
Bye. I'll see you tomorrow.

928
00:50:08,476 --> 00:50:10,016
Are you leaving
without doing the writing work?

929
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,516
We have
an unwelcome guest here today,

930
00:50:15,116 --> 00:50:16,817
and I don't want him
to ruin my writing.

931
00:50:18,587 --> 00:50:20,326
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

932
00:50:21,956 --> 00:50:23,797
Wait. Hang on a second.

933
00:50:23,797 --> 00:50:25,697
Please give me a minute.

934
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:29,027
Why? What is it you want to say?

935
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:31,496
Why are you doing this to me?

936
00:50:33,007 --> 00:50:34,366
Well... Here.

937
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:37,277
What's this?

938
00:50:38,107 --> 00:50:40,277
You know this brand, right?

939
00:50:43,547 --> 00:50:46,616
I think I hurt your feelings deeply.

940
00:50:47,516 --> 00:50:50,456
I'd like us to end things well.

941
00:50:51,487 --> 00:50:54,956
Let's say this is a band-aid
for your wounded heart.

942
00:50:55,087 --> 00:50:56,087
Here.

943
00:50:59,697 --> 00:51:01,697
You're a real jerk.

944
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,396
Don't ever show your face
to me again.

945
00:51:05,967 --> 00:51:07,467
Do you understand, you scumbag?

946
00:51:08,407 --> 00:51:10,107
Hey. Wait.

947
00:51:11,637 --> 00:51:13,177
It's not like that.

948
00:51:14,146 --> 00:51:15,246
You know what?

949
00:51:15,677 --> 00:51:18,516
I'd rather be dumped
or abandoned by someone.

950
00:51:18,516 --> 00:51:20,786
But I've never made a woman cry
in my whole life.

951
00:51:21,186 --> 00:51:24,786
And I think I hurt you so deeply.

952
00:51:24,786 --> 00:51:27,186
I feel really bad about that.

953
00:51:27,186 --> 00:51:29,587
Can't you just accept my apology?

954
00:51:29,697 --> 00:51:31,757
- What is the scumbag talking about?
- Well...

955
00:51:34,567 --> 00:51:35,866
What...

956
00:51:37,567 --> 00:51:38,766
It hurts.

957
00:51:54,047 --> 00:51:55,587
- I got you some tea.
- Okay.

958
00:51:56,456 --> 00:51:57,616
Thanks.

959
00:52:03,456 --> 00:52:05,726
I like the color of the tea.

960
00:52:05,726 --> 00:52:07,067
And it's so aromatic.

961
00:52:10,567 --> 00:52:12,436
Thank you for everything, honey.

962
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:15,637
And for putting up with Auntie.

963
00:52:17,476 --> 00:52:20,507
I know she's like a mother to you.
I have no choice.

964
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:22,907
If I don't put up with her,
you'll cry.

965
00:52:23,916 --> 00:52:26,387
Why would I cry? I'm not a child.

966
00:52:28,947 --> 00:52:30,157
Auntie said...

967
00:52:30,717 --> 00:52:33,087
she wouldn't give you
a hard time ever again.

968
00:52:34,456 --> 00:52:36,056
She promised me.

969
00:52:39,697 --> 00:52:41,826
Okay. Don't push yourself too hard.

970
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:42,826
Oh, right.

971
00:52:44,737 --> 00:52:47,806
I met Pil Seung earlier today.

972
00:52:49,407 --> 00:52:51,706
What? Why did you meet him?

973
00:52:52,677 --> 00:52:55,947
Why is that so surprising?

974
00:52:55,947 --> 00:52:57,817
Am I not supposed to see him?

975
00:52:59,277 --> 00:53:02,416
Well... It's not like that.

976
00:53:03,416 --> 00:53:05,987
But why would you meet Pil Seung?

977
00:53:05,987 --> 00:53:07,757
How did you meet him?

978
00:53:07,757 --> 00:53:09,527
Did you call him?

979
00:53:09,527 --> 00:53:12,527
How would I call him
when I didn't even have his number?

980
00:53:14,297 --> 00:53:16,096
I just ran into him.

981
00:53:16,666 --> 00:53:19,036
He was filming a drama
in front of my office today.

982
00:53:19,137 --> 00:53:21,337
So we had some tea together.
I was glad to see him.

983
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,306
I see.

984
00:53:25,837 --> 00:53:29,677
By the way,
he seems like a nice guy.

985
00:53:30,576 --> 00:53:32,447
The more I see him,
the more I like him.

986
00:53:34,817 --> 00:53:36,047
You do?

987
00:53:37,616 --> 00:53:40,357
So I was thinking, honey...

988
00:53:42,286 --> 00:53:45,956
What do you think of Pil Seung
as Ma Ri's spouse?

989
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:51,467
What?

990
00:54:21,067 --> 00:54:23,067
Is he a celebrity or what?

991
00:54:24,237 --> 00:54:26,907
He's just walking on the street,
but how can he look so handsome?

992
00:54:28,866 --> 00:54:31,907
And when did he grow to be so tall?

993
00:54:32,407 --> 00:54:34,146
Is he really the Dae Chung
I used to know?

994
00:54:35,206 --> 00:54:37,677
He looks even nicer than a model.

995
00:54:42,416 --> 00:54:45,887
Park Do Ra, you're here
to eat some tteokbokki.

996
00:54:45,987 --> 00:54:48,826
Don't forget that you're not
the 12-year-old Park Do Ra anymore.

997
00:54:49,556 --> 00:54:51,197
Just think of tteokbokki.

998
00:54:51,996 --> 00:54:53,467
Think only about fish cake.

999
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:57,266
Let's go.

1000
00:55:00,137 --> 00:55:01,166
Okay.

1001
00:55:08,277 --> 00:55:11,016
What? It's closed.

1002
00:55:11,076 --> 00:55:12,777
I should've called.

1003
00:55:13,246 --> 00:55:14,516
You came here for nothing.

1004
00:55:15,317 --> 00:55:17,887
Do Ra, I'll buy some
when we film a scene in the afternoon.

1005
00:55:18,257 --> 00:55:19,686
I'm afraid we have to go.

1006
00:55:20,157 --> 00:55:21,726
Pil Seung, I don't want to go back
without doing nothing...

1007
00:55:21,726 --> 00:55:23,326
after coming this far.

1008
00:55:24,056 --> 00:55:25,956
Let's eat some fish cake
somewhere else.

1009
00:55:26,226 --> 00:55:27,226
I'm hungry.

1010
00:55:27,226 --> 00:55:28,366
Okay. Let's do that.

1011
00:55:37,877 --> 00:55:40,007
Gosh, the soup is amazing.

1012
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:41,306
- Gosh.
- It's so refreshing.

1013
00:55:41,447 --> 00:55:42,507
It really is.

1014
00:55:44,146 --> 00:55:46,377
Pil Seung, do you want some soju?

1015
00:55:48,016 --> 00:55:49,047
Is it okay to drink?

1016
00:55:49,047 --> 00:55:50,817
I'm not working tomorrow.

1017
00:55:50,956 --> 00:55:52,186
It's okay to have a few shots.

1018
00:55:52,757 --> 00:55:54,987
And I don't get many chances...

1019
00:55:54,987 --> 00:55:56,896
to have fish cake with soju
at a food stall like this.

1020
00:55:57,596 --> 00:55:59,496
I haven't been to a place like this
for a long time...

1021
00:55:59,496 --> 00:56:01,027
unless it was for a shoot.

1022
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:05,837
There aren't many people here.

1023
00:56:06,706 --> 00:56:09,137
Okay. Let's just have one bottle.

1024
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:14,547
Excuse me. We'll have soju,
hagfish, and pork belly cartilage.

1025
00:56:14,846 --> 00:56:15,976
Okay.

1026
00:56:16,407 --> 00:56:17,777
Hagfish and pork belly cartilage?

1027
00:56:18,616 --> 00:56:20,016
That sounds great.

1028
00:56:20,817 --> 00:56:22,146
I have butterflies.

1029
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:25,487
- What? Butterflies?
- Yes.

1030
00:56:25,487 --> 00:56:28,326
What kind of woman gets butterflies
because of hagfish and cartilage?

1031
00:56:39,297 --> 00:56:41,366
Let me fill your glass.

1032
00:56:41,366 --> 00:56:43,206
Thank you.

1033
00:56:44,806 --> 00:56:45,907
And fill yours.

1034
00:56:50,076 --> 00:56:51,076
Cheers.

1035
00:57:03,826 --> 00:57:04,896
Pil Seung.

1036
00:57:05,427 --> 00:57:07,666
I'm feeling great now.

1037
00:57:08,127 --> 00:57:10,536
This reminds me of the old days.

1038
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,837
I'm so happy.

1039
00:57:14,467 --> 00:57:16,936
I love this place.

1040
00:57:17,706 --> 00:57:19,536
Are you happy drinking soju
with some hagfish...

1041
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:21,246
at a shabby food stall like this?

1042
00:57:22,246 --> 00:57:24,717
You must've been
to so many nice places.

1043
00:57:24,717 --> 00:57:26,146
Some nice and fancy restaurants.

1044
00:57:26,146 --> 00:57:30,317
No. It's hard to explain,

1045
00:57:31,717 --> 00:57:34,956
but this feels somewhat liberating.

1046
00:57:38,427 --> 00:57:39,627
Thank you, Pil Seung.

1047
00:57:40,427 --> 00:57:42,427
For drinking soju with me here.

1048
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:47,837
I guess I've been feeling
quite frustrated.

1049
00:57:51,206 --> 00:57:52,277
Gosh.

1050
00:57:53,107 --> 00:57:54,846
I knew it.

1051
00:57:55,646 --> 00:57:58,217
Soju tastes good when you drink it
at a food stall like this.

1052
00:57:58,217 --> 00:57:59,746
It's so sweet.

1053
00:58:00,516 --> 00:58:02,246
Pil Seung, one more bottle?

1054
00:58:02,387 --> 00:58:04,717
No. We've had enough.

1055
00:58:04,987 --> 00:58:08,527
No, it's okay. I'm not drunk at all.

1056
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,157
Are you drunk?

1057
00:58:12,226 --> 00:58:13,297
No.

1058
00:58:14,226 --> 00:58:15,697
I'm not drunk either.

1059
00:58:16,697 --> 00:58:19,067
Ma'am, we will have
another bottle of soju.

1060
00:58:19,766 --> 00:58:20,967
One more bottle, please.

1061
00:58:21,366 --> 00:58:23,067
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1062
00:58:37,956 --> 00:58:39,016
Pil Seung...

1063
00:58:40,427 --> 00:58:43,556
Don't you have a girlfriend?

1064
00:58:45,027 --> 00:58:47,826
This is what I got
from watching you.

1065
00:58:48,127 --> 00:58:53,396
You work on set on weekdays
and go to the broadcasting station.

1066
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:56,306
Even on your day off,
you're at the broadcasting station.

1067
00:58:58,677 --> 00:59:01,277
Your girlfriend would hate that.

1068
00:59:03,076 --> 00:59:06,346
Hey, as if I have one to begin with.

1069
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:08,246
I don't have the time for one.

1070
00:59:08,786 --> 00:59:10,786
Things are hectic enough
with just my work.

1071
00:59:11,357 --> 00:59:14,186
I need to get things ready on set
and run errands.

1072
00:59:14,857 --> 00:59:16,427
I then have to keep you
in a good mood,

1073
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:18,127
and the same goes for Bong Soo.

1074
00:59:18,726 --> 00:59:20,027
On top of that,
I have things to research.

1075
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:23,567
I go to work as soon as I wake up.

1076
00:59:23,797 --> 00:59:25,237
When I get home, it's already 10 p.m.

1077
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:29,366
Of course. How can
he have a girlfriend...

1078
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:31,076
when he works day and night?

1079
00:59:34,576 --> 00:59:35,576
You.

1080
00:59:37,076 --> 00:59:38,646
Do you know what my dream is?

1081
00:59:40,686 --> 00:59:42,246
It's to direct my own project...

1082
00:59:43,286 --> 00:59:45,987
and create a TV series
loved by the entire nation.

1083
00:59:46,987 --> 00:59:49,587
That's why "Straightforward Romance"
must be a huge hit.

1084
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:51,197
Only then will I get
to debut as a director.

1085
00:59:51,357 --> 00:59:53,567
So stop asking me useless things.

1086
00:59:53,726 --> 00:59:54,866
All I care about...

1087
00:59:54,866 --> 00:59:58,137
is "Straightforward Romance"
having the best ratings.

1088
00:59:58,137 --> 00:59:59,697
Nice.

1089
01:00:01,237 --> 01:00:04,306
This passion you have
for our series.

1090
01:00:04,306 --> 01:00:05,476
The passion!

1091
01:00:05,637 --> 01:00:07,777
And for that,

1092
01:00:07,777 --> 01:00:10,447
I'll let you drink
the rest of this soju.

1093
01:00:10,846 --> 01:00:13,277
- Here.
- Here.

1094
01:00:13,746 --> 01:00:18,616
Pil Seung, only be interested
in your work, okay?

1095
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:20,887
Got it.

1096
01:00:20,987 --> 01:00:22,326
Be a workaholic.

1097
01:00:29,067 --> 01:00:30,197
Jung Mi!

1098
01:00:30,567 --> 01:00:32,396
Don't forget what I said.

1099
01:00:35,407 --> 01:00:36,666
It'll be one year.

1100
01:00:36,936 --> 01:00:39,107
In a year's time, we'll meet again.

1101
01:00:39,536 --> 01:00:40,907
Jung Mi!

1102
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:49,047
Pil Seung, on my way here,

1103
01:00:50,317 --> 01:00:52,516
I saw that Sol Hair Salon
was still in business.

1104
01:00:54,027 --> 01:00:56,157
How did things go with Jung Mi?

1105
01:00:57,527 --> 01:01:00,056
Did you ever get to meet her again?

1106
01:01:03,766 --> 01:01:05,166
Jung Mi,

1107
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:08,206
did you say?

1108
01:01:17,646 --> 01:01:19,217
- There.
- It kicked.

1109
01:01:19,817 --> 01:01:22,186
Our babies must be strong.

1110
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,087
We'll soon meet.

1111
01:01:37,067 --> 01:01:38,137
What the...

1112
01:01:43,976 --> 01:01:45,476
That's his college acceptance form
and ID card.

1113
01:01:46,607 --> 01:01:48,047
What a weirdo.

1114
01:01:48,047 --> 01:01:49,677
(College Acceptance)

1115
01:02:08,496 --> 01:02:12,536
(College Acceptance)

1116
01:02:29,087 --> 01:02:30,487
Pil Seung, are you crying?

1117
01:02:34,186 --> 01:02:38,496
Are you still heartbroken
about how things ended with Jung Mi?

1118
01:02:39,127 --> 01:02:40,967
How could I not cry?

1119
01:02:41,197 --> 01:02:42,197
What the...

1120
01:02:43,266 --> 01:02:46,467
We promised to get back together
once I got into college...

1121
01:02:47,366 --> 01:02:49,507
and came of age.

1122
01:02:51,907 --> 01:02:53,846
But she walked by me...

1123
01:02:55,377 --> 01:02:57,677
on the street pregnant with twins.

1124
01:02:59,346 --> 01:03:01,447
Wouldn't you cry
if you were in my shoes?

1125
01:03:03,547 --> 01:03:05,056
When I think of that day,

1126
01:03:06,587 --> 01:03:08,027
my heart...

1127
01:03:09,027 --> 01:03:10,826
gets torn into pieces again.

1128
01:03:12,357 --> 01:03:13,826
Into several tiny pieces.

1129
01:03:15,797 --> 01:03:17,737
My youth...

1130
01:03:19,266 --> 01:03:21,436
ended right there and then.

1131
01:03:24,677 --> 01:03:25,907
What a joke.

1132
01:03:26,877 --> 01:03:27,907
What?

1133
01:03:29,007 --> 01:03:31,047
Your youth
ended right there and then?

1134
01:03:31,246 --> 01:03:33,317
Your heart was torn into pieces?

1135
01:03:34,146 --> 01:03:36,047
Are you writing lyrics to a song?

1136
01:03:36,047 --> 01:03:38,987
Hey. As if you know anything
about love.

1137
01:03:40,357 --> 01:03:42,786
As if you know how it feels
to have your heart crushed...

1138
01:03:43,427 --> 01:03:45,297
by love.

1139
01:03:50,166 --> 01:03:51,266
You know,

1140
01:03:52,337 --> 01:03:55,536
when a man and a woman
have feelings for one another,

1141
01:03:56,206 --> 01:03:58,507
age doesn't matter.

1142
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:01,306
It doesn't matter.

1143
01:04:07,116 --> 01:04:10,317
<i>Hong Do</i>

1144
01:04:11,587 --> 01:04:14,757
<i>Don't cry</i>

1145
01:04:15,257 --> 01:04:16,387
Hey, lady!

1146
01:04:18,956 --> 01:04:20,896
Why are you smiling at me?

1147
01:04:22,096 --> 01:04:23,666
Am I that handsome?

1148
01:04:24,996 --> 01:04:27,337
Wait. Is that so?

1149
01:04:28,567 --> 01:04:30,036
I guess I can't deny it.

1150
01:04:31,137 --> 01:04:33,846
My mom always tells me
how pretty I am...

1151
01:04:34,007 --> 01:04:35,947
and smiles at my handsome face.

1152
01:04:38,516 --> 01:04:43,516
<i>Your darling is here for you</i>

1153
01:04:43,516 --> 01:04:44,817
(I am a complete moron.)

1154
01:04:44,817 --> 01:04:46,056
Hey, lady!

1155
01:04:50,127 --> 01:04:52,927
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1156
01:05:25,257 --> 01:05:26,826
When should we meet tomorrow?

1157
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:29,967
Once Jin Taek hears about
that vixen's promiscuous past...

1158
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:31,737
from Madam Cho,

1159
01:05:31,737 --> 01:05:33,567
he will not let it slide.

1160
01:05:33,567 --> 01:05:36,036
He'll be too appalled by her
to keep her in his life.

1161
01:05:36,036 --> 01:05:39,007
It didn't just say "fool."
I was called a complete moron.

1162
01:05:39,076 --> 01:05:40,107
And I strolled around
the neighborhood...

1163
01:05:40,107 --> 01:05:41,346
with this stuck to my back.

1164
01:05:41,346 --> 01:05:43,576
I'll find whoever wrote this.

1165
01:05:43,576 --> 01:05:46,246
Did you see
who stuck this on my back?

1166
01:05:46,246 --> 01:05:48,686
I've been signaling you
time and time again...

1167
01:05:48,686 --> 01:05:50,487
regarding my feelings for you.

1168
01:05:50,487 --> 01:05:51,717
Only a complete moron...

1169
01:05:51,717 --> 01:05:53,186
would be daft enough
not to notice it,

1170
01:05:53,186 --> 01:05:54,357
you complete moron!

1171
01:05:54,427 --> 01:05:56,056
This isn't a joke,
so hear me loud and clear.

1172
01:05:56,056 --> 01:05:57,197
I have feelings for you.

1173
01:05:58,896 --> 01:06:00,766
