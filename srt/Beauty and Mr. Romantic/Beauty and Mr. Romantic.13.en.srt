1
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:11,639
My gosh. That assistant director...

2
00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:13,609
Oh, my.

3
00:00:14,508 --> 00:00:15,578
Isn't that guy...

4
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:17,949
Ko Dae Chung?

5
00:00:19,749 --> 00:00:22,589
Hey!

6
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:25,789
You.

7
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:27,059
What...

8
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:29,589
You're him, aren't you?

9
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:31,798
You're Ko Dae Chung.

10
00:00:33,928 --> 00:00:34,928
Hello.

11
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:38,098
- Wait. - What are you doing with this punk?

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,568
- What? - Why are you with him?

13
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:43,009
Mom, let me explain. Let's head inside.

14
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,538
- Let go of me! - We'll talk inside.

15
00:00:44,538 --> 00:00:46,309
You tell me.

16
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:48,309
Why are you with my Do Ra? What are you playing at?

17
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:51,019
What did you do to coax my daughter?

18
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,079
I bet you approached her on purpose.

19
00:00:53,278 --> 00:00:54,689
I won't let you get away with this.

20
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:56,519
You have another thing coming today.

21
00:00:56,519 --> 00:00:59,119
Mom, don't be like that to Pil Seung.

22
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,829
And we're outdoors. People will see us.

23
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,259
Let go of him and come with me.

24
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:03,928
- You! - You can talk to me about it.

25
00:01:03,928 --> 00:01:05,229
- We'll talk, Mom. - Let go!

26
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:07,369
- How dare you? - Sorry about this.

27
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:09,668
- You punk! - Let's talk inside.

28
00:01:09,668 --> 00:01:11,369
How dare you?

29
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:15,869
- Let go of me! - Mom, please.

30
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,908
I won't let him get away with this.

31
00:01:17,908 --> 00:01:20,748
- Let go of me. - Mom, please!

32
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,048
Hey!

33
00:01:22,408 --> 00:01:25,018
You... Do you know who that guy is?

34
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:28,018
He's Ko Dae Chung, not Ko Pil Seung.

35
00:01:28,018 --> 00:01:30,358
That foundling raised by our old landlady.

36
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:33,528
So why were you kissing him and on the street of all places?

37
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:35,128
Do you want to kiss your career goodbye?

38
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:38,759
Mom, I know that Pil Seung is also Dae Chung,

39
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,028
and we're dating.

40
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:42,498
So don't you dare mistreat him.

41
00:01:42,498 --> 00:01:44,869
Pil Seung's my boyfriend.

42
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:47,869
What did you just say? Your boyfriend?

43
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,578
You've lost your mind. You've completely lost it.

44
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:54,548
Why would someone like you date a man like that?

45
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:57,449
How could you let that punk win you over?

46
00:01:57,449 --> 00:01:59,378
Break up with him this second.

47
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:00,589
Lead the way.

48
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:02,619
Mom, stop it!

49
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:05,819
I'm not a child you can boss around.

50
00:02:06,089 --> 00:02:08,859
Do I still seem like a young girl who follows your command?

51
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:10,728
What?

52
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,568
We got together because I liked him first.

53
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:16,228
Who I meet and date...

54
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:18,598
is none of your business. It's my life!

55
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:24,878
Did she just flare up in anger at her own mother?

56
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:28,278
She has lost it. She isn't in her right mind.

57
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,848
What do I do about this?

58
00:02:32,248 --> 00:02:33,278
She...

59
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:35,218
What do I do about her?

60
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:37,359
My gosh.

61
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:39,559
Darn it.

62
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:41,728
Mom's killing me.

63
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,429
What is the matter with her?

64
00:02:58,709 --> 00:02:59,778
Hey, Do Ra.

65
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:04,318
Pil Seung, I know my mom startled you.

66
00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:05,978
I'm sorry about that.

67
00:03:06,948 --> 00:03:09,489
I'm fine. But what about you?

68
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,718
Your mother seemed furious.

69
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,959
She was in the dark,

70
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:16,658
so the surprise must've shocked her.

71
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:18,698
But don't worry.

72
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,829
I'll make sure you don't have to worry about my mom.

73
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:24,698
Sure. I got it.

74
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:27,139
Pil Seung.

75
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:31,609
Please forget everything my mom said earlier.

76
00:03:32,508 --> 00:03:33,579
Got it?

77
00:03:34,478 --> 00:03:36,748
I hear you. Don't worry about me.

78
00:03:36,748 --> 00:03:38,348
You must be exhausted, so get some rest.

79
00:03:39,278 --> 00:03:42,419
Pil Seung, I'll call you tomorrow once I'm done for the day.

80
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:43,718
Sure.

81
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,538
What are you doing here when we should be in bed?

82
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:06,709
Auntie,

83
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:09,679
curiosity is killing me.

84
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:15,489
Will finding Soo Yeon's former boyfriend...

85
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,119
change the fate of this family?

86
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:21,789
Why do you want to know about her former boyfriend?

87
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:26,029
Can't you lay out all the information for me?

88
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:29,429
Are you worried she might still...

89
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:32,338
be seeing that guy?

90
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:34,369
It's not that.

91
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:36,309
What is it, then?

92
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:38,679
I need to know if I'm to help you.

93
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:41,309
If our family's future is at stake,

94
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:42,549
I should know too.

95
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,219
Right, Auntie?

96
00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:50,789
Listen.

97
00:04:51,818 --> 00:04:54,258
It's a secret you must take to the grave.

98
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:58,299
I will. I promised to live my life for you.

99
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:02,229
Ma Ri's mom.

100
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:05,169
She had that man's child,

101
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:07,309
and they were even going to marry.

102
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:09,438
What?

103
00:05:10,438 --> 00:05:11,679
She had a child?

104
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,809
Is that true?

105
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,208
Madam Cho who told me that ended up dying,

106
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:18,018
so I had no proof.

107
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:21,719
You found the man Soo Yeon used to date,

108
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:24,088
so I think it's true.

109
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:26,518
If we find that Kim Sung Soo,

110
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:28,688
we can find out if she had the baby,

111
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:30,958
and if she did, what she did with it.

112
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,729
And if she were still in touch,

113
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:35,328
would Jin Taek accept that?

114
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:37,799
Of course not. I bet he'd kick her out.

115
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:39,239
That's why I'm looking for him.

116
00:05:39,768 --> 00:05:41,539
Jin Taek needs a new wife...

117
00:05:41,938 --> 00:05:44,578
so he can have a child to succeed him.

118
00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:47,878
Goodness. I can't believe all this, Auntie.

119
00:05:59,388 --> 00:06:01,258
If what Auntie said is true,

120
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,188
Soo Yeon's a vixen.

121
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:05,059
How could she...

122
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:07,529
be so shameless with a past like that?

123
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:10,128
She acts so innocent and dignified,

124
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:11,539
like she's better than others.

125
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,498
What a sly brat.

126
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:23,208
You should go and get...

127
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,049
some twisted donuts that Sun Young likes...

128
00:06:26,248 --> 00:06:27,789
and try to placate her.

129
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,588
She must feel hungry right now.

130
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:32,659
I got her some yesterday and she didn't even look.

131
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,659
She doesn't want to eat even the donuts I got her.

132
00:06:36,489 --> 00:06:39,799
When will she get over it?

133
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,198
I feel so antsy.

134
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,898
Hey. Why are you so slow?

135
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:48,969
You'll never finish all this tonight.

136
00:06:49,268 --> 00:06:51,179
Were you always this fast?

137
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:52,508
Goodness.

138
00:06:53,109 --> 00:06:56,208
Darn you! Look at what you've done.

139
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:59,018
You should stick the eyes in the right spot.

140
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,619
This is defective.

141
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:03,719
It's your fault. You rushed me.

142
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:05,219
Are you fighting again?

143
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:06,919
You come and help.

144
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:09,088
- No. You can do all that. - Ko Dae Chung!

145
00:07:09,188 --> 00:07:11,458
- Ko Dae Chung! You fool! - Who's this?

146
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,758
Where is he?

147
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:14,869
Where's this scumbag?

148
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:16,469
- What's this noise? - Show yourself!

149
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:18,938
- Where's Dae Chung? - You crazy woman.

150
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,938
- Where is he? - Are you out of your mind?

151
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:23,109
How dare you barge in late at night...

152
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,508
and scream at the top of your voice?

153
00:07:24,508 --> 00:07:25,938
What do you think you're doing?

154
00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:27,078
You don't know?

155
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,409
You should be glad I found out when I did.

156
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:32,318
What do you think you're doing, using your son for no good?

157
00:07:32,748 --> 00:07:34,688
Is this why you gave me back my 50,000 dollars?

158
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:38,419
How dare you even think of going for my Do Ra?

159
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:41,159
You got your son to hit on my daughter.

160
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,888
You're all in on it!

161
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:46,229
Do you think I don't know?

162
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:49,828
You must have no conscience at all.

163
00:07:50,328 --> 00:07:53,469
How dare you cause this ruckus in the middle of the night?

164
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:54,669
Did you put him up to it?

165
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:56,109
Was it his grandma?

166
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,138
Who told Dae Chung to hit on Do Ra?

167
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,739
My gosh.

168
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:02,309
You've all forgotten your place.

169
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:05,318
Do you think I'll put up with this now that I know what's going on?

170
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,719
- What are you on about? - My gosh.

171
00:08:08,049 --> 00:08:09,419
My son's not crazy!

172
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,318
Why would he date your daughter?

173
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,989
- Get out of here! Go, now! - No!

174
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:15,828
- Leave. - Let go. Ko Dae Chung!

175
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,398
- Pil Seung. - You.

176
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:19,029
I'm glad you're here.

177
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,729
This woman's making a fuss...

178
00:08:20,998 --> 00:08:23,969
that you're dating her daughter Do Ra.

179
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,498
Pil Seung. You're not.

180
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:29,768
Ko Dae Chung!

181
00:08:30,438 --> 00:08:31,609
Be honest.

182
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,948
Why did you approach Do Ra?

183
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,618
Who told you to? You did it on purpose, didn't you?

184
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:41,419
I saw you with my own two eyes!

185
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,948
Will you deny it?

186
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:48,488
Pil Seung. It's not true, is it?

187
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,659
She's talking nonsense.

188
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,269
Why won't you say she's wrong?

189
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:03,108
I'm sorry, Mom.

190
00:09:04,438 --> 00:09:06,438
I am seeing Do Ra.

191
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:09,149
What?

192
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:13,618
You're what?

193
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,588
You're seeing whom?

194
00:09:19,218 --> 00:09:20,289
Pil Seung.

195
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,728
That is Do Ra's mom.

196
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:25,598
You know what she's like.

197
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,468
And you're dating her daughter?

198
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:33,198
Yes.

199
00:09:35,338 --> 00:09:36,338
My goodness.

200
00:09:36,568 --> 00:09:38,879
Ko Dae Chung. Listen carefully.

201
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,779
If you see Do Ra once more,

202
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:45,249
I won't let you off, okay?

203
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,848
I'll turn this house upside-down. Do you get that?

204
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:50,549
We got it, so get out.

205
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,188
Do you think we like your daughter?

206
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:56,358
You should keep a tight rein on your son!

207
00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:57,799
Okay?

208
00:09:58,429 --> 00:09:59,458
Darn you all.

209
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,938
My goodness.

210
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:10,068
What on earth is happening?

211
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:11,179
- Gosh. - Mom.

212
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:12,879
Pil Seung.

213
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,978
Why would you...

214
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:18,718
date her daughter of all people?

215
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,818
Why does it have to be her daughter?

216
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,988
How could you date her daughter when you know what she's like?

217
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:30,088
How could you...

218
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:37,169
I'm sorry, Mom.

219
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,108
Pil Seung.

220
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,909
Honey. Are you all right?

221
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:49,249
Honey.

222
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:17,039
Sun Young, here's some water.

223
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,909
Yes. Drink this.

224
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:22,009
Our Pil Seung...

225
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,948
How could he...

226
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:28,718
He wouldn't do such a thing.

227
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:31,458
How come...

228
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:33,889
They say...

229
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:36,728
you shouldn't take in strangers.

230
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,098
Look at what happened.

231
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:40,328
If Pil Seung were your son,

232
00:11:40,328 --> 00:11:41,929
would he have dated Do Ra?

233
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:43,529
He's not of our blood.

234
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:46,068
That's why he dated the daughter of a gold-digger...

235
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:48,968
who caused his grandfather's death.

236
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,708
Gosh.

237
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:53,009
It's so obvious he was a foundling.

238
00:11:53,238 --> 00:11:55,179
What's wrong with you? Are you insane?

239
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:56,208
Mother.

240
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:59,448
I begged you not to say that.

241
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:01,749
Why do you say that all the time?

242
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,259
If you say that once more, Mother,

243
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,088
I won't be able to live with you.

244
00:12:07,088 --> 00:12:08,889
You what?

245
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:12,328
How could you say something so out of line?

246
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:15,728
You won't live with her just because she made one comment?

247
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,068
Who's being out of line?

248
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,539
Pil Seung is my son.

249
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,608
I had him and he's mine.

250
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,478
Why do you keep calling him a foundling?

251
00:12:25,938 --> 00:12:29,348
How can I live with someone who says that?

252
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:31,948
I can't put up with this anymore.

253
00:12:31,978 --> 00:12:33,519
You're always telling us to leave,

254
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,188
or saying you can't live with us.

255
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:37,789
Must you brag so much about owning the house?

256
00:12:37,988 --> 00:12:40,419
Yes. Get that in your heads.

257
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:44,198
If I hear anyone talk like that about Pil Seung,

258
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,659
I'll really call it quits!

259
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:49,598
- Sun Young. - Darn it.

260
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:52,639
Fine. Let's call it quits.

261
00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:54,368
Let's split up!

262
00:12:54,368 --> 00:12:56,968
No, don't say that. I'll move out.

263
00:12:56,968 --> 00:12:59,539
I'll leave. That will solve everything.

264
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,608
What is wrong with everyone?

265
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,679
Doesn't anyone care about Sun Young?

266
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:08,948
She's already crazy upset about Pil Seung.

267
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,759
You're my son.

268
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:20,899
I birthed you...

269
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,098
with my heart.

270
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:26,269
No. My father's not dead!

271
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:28,208
He's not dead!

272
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:31,078
Bring him back, you witch!

273
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:33,279
- Bring him back! - Stop it!

274
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:03,539
Pil Seung, it's lovely here. And there's no one else.

275
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:06,409
Did you find this place while searching for spots to film?

276
00:14:06,838 --> 00:14:07,909
It's so nice.

277
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,478
Pil Seung.

278
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:12,919
What will we do on today's date?

279
00:14:13,848 --> 00:14:15,049
Walk through a forest?

280
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:20,858
Do Ra.

281
00:14:24,088 --> 00:14:25,159
What is it?

282
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,499
Why did you say my name so solemnly?

283
00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:29,769
What are you going to say?

284
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:33,338
Is this about my mom?

285
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:37,509
I told you not to worry about it.

286
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,978
I was so happy while I was dating you.

287
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:46,379
But I think this is the end for us.

288
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:49,919
Let's...

289
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,488
break up now.

290
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:56,789
Pil Seung.

291
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,458
What are you talking about?

292
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:02,769
Why would we break up?

293
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:06,299
I mean, we just started dating.

294
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:09,208
How can you even bring up something like that so easily?

295
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:11,478
Pil Seung.

296
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,009
It was just a slip of the tongue, right?

297
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:15,779
It's not easy for me to say this.

298
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:18,149
I've given it a lot of thought.

299
00:15:19,948 --> 00:15:21,088
Fine.

300
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:24,149
I understand my mom was too harsh on you the other day.

301
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:26,519
But we can't break up like this because of that.

302
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:28,929
Pil Seung.

303
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:32,598
I'll make sure it won't happen again.

304
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,899
Did you meet my mom again after that day?

305
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,669
Did she say anything?

306
00:15:44,108 --> 00:15:46,309
I came to my senses after meeting your mom.

307
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:49,379
We shouldn't be together.

308
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,948
Actually, I didn't say this before,

309
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:57,759
but dating you made me quite self-conscious.

310
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,659
It was embarrassing and uncomfortable.

311
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:04,188
I don't want to be in a relationship that makes me uncomfortable.

312
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:06,999
Pil Seung.

313
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,598
I should've stayed strong and kept my distance.

314
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:13,299
I was being rash.

315
00:16:15,568 --> 00:16:16,708
I'm sorry, Do Ra.

316
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:22,809
But we have feelings for each other.

317
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:25,379
That's what matters,

318
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:28,149
so we can get over the difficulties with that in mind.

319
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:29,289
No.

320
00:16:30,618 --> 00:16:32,019
I want to end things here.

321
00:16:35,088 --> 00:16:36,328
Thank you for everything.

322
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:38,399
I should get going.

323
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:48,269
Pil Seung.

324
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:50,309
Pil Seung.

325
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:52,708
Wait, Pil Seung.

326
00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:56,208
Wait. We need to talk.

327
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:57,379
Pil Seung.

328
00:17:02,818 --> 00:17:04,219
Still, this isn't just right.

329
00:17:05,418 --> 00:17:06,689
Why is he being like that?

330
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:27,809
Mom.

331
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:29,908
I'm home.

332
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:36,118
Where did you sleep last night?

333
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:37,749
You didn't come home.

334
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,259
I was in the night-duty room.

335
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:47,459
Did you eat breakfast?

336
00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:52,739
Mom.

337
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:56,439
I broke up with Do Ra.

338
00:18:01,878 --> 00:18:04,249
Pil Seung, but...

339
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:08,088
why did you do that?

340
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:12,418
I still can't believe...

341
00:18:14,158 --> 00:18:16,428
that you did such a thing.

342
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:23,328
I didn't mean to do it at first.

343
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:26,838
But I fell for Do Ra before I knew it.

344
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:29,009
I know I shouldn't have.

345
00:18:30,338 --> 00:18:32,878
I know she's the last person I should go out with.

346
00:18:34,338 --> 00:18:36,709
It was my mistake. It was my fault.

347
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:40,378
Mom.

348
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:43,088
I was wrong.

349
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,559
I really didn't want to hurt your feelings.

350
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:53,358
I'm sorry for hurting...

351
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:56,299
your feelings.

352
00:18:58,098 --> 00:18:59,299
I'm really sorry, Mom.

353
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:07,408
Thanks for saying that.

354
00:19:08,908 --> 00:19:09,908
Mom.

355
00:19:10,378 --> 00:19:12,618
I've got some work to do, so I should go out.

356
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,449
I'll see you later.

357
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:39,479
Gosh.

358
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:43,678
I gave him a piece of my mind, so I hope he understood my point.

359
00:19:43,678 --> 00:19:44,749
That jerk.

360
00:19:44,979 --> 00:19:47,719
I will make him regret it if he hits on her again.

361
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:49,388
Mom.

362
00:19:51,118 --> 00:19:52,858
Mom, did you meet Pil Seung?

363
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:58,229
What are you talking about? Why would I meet him?

364
00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:00,699
Why? Did he say that we met?

365
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:02,928
That's ridiculous.

366
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,568
Mom, tell me the truth.

367
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:07,739
Why would he break up with me when you didn't do anything?

368
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:11,138
He broke up with you?

369
00:20:11,638 --> 00:20:14,078
It looks like someone finally knows his place.

370
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:17,009
I'm glad to hear that. You should end things with him.

371
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:18,019
Mom...

372
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:21,449
Are you sure you didn't meet Pil Seung?

373
00:20:21,449 --> 00:20:23,189
I said I didn't!

374
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:25,088
My gosh.

375
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:26,459
It's a good thing...

376
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,428
he knew his place and broke up with you.

377
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,358
What if people find out you are dating a guy like him?

378
00:20:30,358 --> 00:20:32,299
It will do you no good.

379
00:20:32,729 --> 00:20:35,499
You should be grateful that it ended like that.

380
00:20:35,628 --> 00:20:38,168
Hey, they say you need to strike...

381
00:20:38,168 --> 00:20:41,608
while the iron is hot. Okay?

382
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:42,969
Just focus on your work for the time being.

383
00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:44,838
Don't care about that jerk.

384
00:20:44,838 --> 00:20:47,209
This is a good thing. I'm so glad.

385
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:49,848
I can't believe you dated that stupid jerk.

386
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:52,549
If this wasn't about my mom,

387
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:54,118
why else would he...

388
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,289
There must be another reason.

389
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,898
The person you have reached is unavailable.

390
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:15,368
Please try again later.

391
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,908
Pil Seung blocked my number.

392
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:22,378
Does he really want to break up with me?

393
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,686
She was shocked by the 50,000 dollars,

394
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:30,886
and she was devastated by Pil Seung again.

395
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,225
Sun Young is like the pillar that supports our family.

396
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:37,896
I hope this will help her feel better.

397
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:40,396
She loves oriental melons.

398
00:21:41,096 --> 00:21:42,596
It smells so good.

399
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:48,636
Look who's here.

400
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,106
Isn't she the gold digger's daughter?

401
00:21:53,106 --> 00:21:54,106
Hey.

402
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:56,475
Hello.

403
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,186
Why do you and your mom keep coming to see us?

404
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,785
Hey, I'm not doing well because of you and your mom.

405
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:07,156
And how dare you show your face here?

406
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:09,896
Wasn't making a scene last night enough for you?

407
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:11,825
Was my mom here last night?

408
00:22:11,825 --> 00:22:13,596
Yes, she barged into my house...

409
00:22:13,596 --> 00:22:15,436
with her shoes on in the middle of the night.

410
00:22:15,436 --> 00:22:16,896
And she made a scene...

411
00:22:16,896 --> 00:22:18,866
because Pil Seung was dating you.

412
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,636
And now you're here?

413
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:24,176
Do you and your mom have no shame at all?

414
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,075
Hey, get out of my sight. Go away!

415
00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:28,446
I'm sorry.

416
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:31,745
Is Pil Seung home?

417
00:22:31,815 --> 00:22:33,085
I can't reach him.

418
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:37,386
Why would you look for Pil Seung here?

419
00:22:37,515 --> 00:22:40,126
Do you want your mom to barge into my house again?

420
00:22:40,686 --> 00:22:43,126
And even if you die and come back to life,

421
00:22:43,126 --> 00:22:44,795
you can't date Pil Seung.

422
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:48,565
Pil Seung's grandfather passed away because of your mom.

423
00:22:48,896 --> 00:22:50,596
Do you still think you and Pil Seung can be together?

424
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:52,966
Don't even think about it.

425
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:56,735
How would we possibly take in our enemy's daughter?

426
00:22:56,805 --> 00:22:59,646
There's no way we can take you in.

427
00:23:00,206 --> 00:23:02,846
What do you mean by that?

428
00:23:05,315 --> 00:23:07,585
His grandfather passed away because of my mom?

429
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:15,856
Mom!

430
00:23:16,325 --> 00:23:17,356
You startled me.

431
00:23:17,795 --> 00:23:20,366
Why are you yelling at me like that?

432
00:23:21,795 --> 00:23:24,596
Is it true that Pil Seung's grandfather died because of you?

433
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:27,866
He collapsed because of you...

434
00:23:28,636 --> 00:23:30,106
and passed away?

435
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:33,706
What?

436
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:37,245
Mom, I've been wondering all this time...

437
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:39,146
why we left in the middle of the night.

438
00:23:40,146 --> 00:23:41,146
Was it because...

439
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,856
you were the reason he passed away?

440
00:23:46,156 --> 00:23:47,325
Mom, did you...

441
00:23:48,696 --> 00:23:51,225
Did you really seduce him for his money?

442
00:23:54,126 --> 00:23:55,335
Who said that?

443
00:23:56,466 --> 00:23:59,166
That's all a lie.

444
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,265
Mom, I heard it all!

445
00:24:02,176 --> 00:24:03,676
Did you do that or not?

446
00:24:04,846 --> 00:24:07,775
How can you only believe what others tell you...

447
00:24:07,775 --> 00:24:09,745
and accuse me of such a thing?

448
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,386
Are you guilty or not, Mom?

449
00:24:12,386 --> 00:24:13,646
Tell me!

450
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:19,356
Fine.

451
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,795
I'm guilty as charged.

452
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,196
It was to put food on the table.

453
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:28,866
Should I have ended my life and that of my three children?

454
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:30,495
After your father died,

455
00:24:30,495 --> 00:24:32,666
I spent my waking hours dodging creditors.

456
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:35,505
If I hadn't done what I did, you kids wouldn't have survived.

457
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:37,406
We would've all died.

458
00:24:37,406 --> 00:24:40,275
You wouldn't have made it this far.

459
00:24:40,406 --> 00:24:43,045
So how could you of all people do this to me?

460
00:24:43,176 --> 00:24:46,285
Others can point fingers at me, but not you.

461
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:48,416
After all I did to raise you three?

462
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:49,785
How dare you yell at me...

463
00:24:49,785 --> 00:24:51,626
when I had to do everything I could to keep you alive?

464
00:24:52,386 --> 00:24:53,626
Still...

465
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:58,126
How could you take advantage of a man's affection?

466
00:24:59,725 --> 00:25:01,025
Killing him wasn't my intention.

467
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:03,535
He just ended up dying.

468
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,305
I didn't know that would happen,

469
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,166
but I did everything I could.

470
00:25:08,505 --> 00:25:11,136
I paid back the money plus the interest.

471
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:14,745
But what am I supposed to do when they don't want my money?

472
00:25:15,216 --> 00:25:16,716
Mom, even now...

473
00:25:18,176 --> 00:25:21,686
Don't you get how you wronged his grandfather?

474
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,386
You darn brat!

475
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:27,456
How could you of all people do this to me?

476
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,596
Don't you know why I lived the way I did?

477
00:25:49,045 --> 00:25:50,575
Park Do Ra. Get up now.

478
00:25:50,575 --> 00:25:52,146
- What's going on? - Mom...

479
00:25:52,146 --> 00:25:53,346
Pack your things right now.

480
00:25:53,815 --> 00:25:55,315
We must leave immediately.

481
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,485
Move it, Do Ra! Pack your stuff!

482
00:25:57,485 --> 00:25:59,386
How dare you come here?

483
00:25:59,386 --> 00:26:00,785
I can't stand the sight of your family.

484
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:02,225
I don't even want to hear your voice.

485
00:26:02,225 --> 00:26:03,626
So don't ever come near here again.

486
00:26:03,626 --> 00:26:05,696
I deeply loathe your family.

487
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,765
Go away. Leave. Don't ever come here again.

488
00:26:44,696 --> 00:26:45,706
Hello?

489
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,936
Is anyone home?

490
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,186
Hello.

491
00:27:10,856 --> 00:27:12,166
What are you doing here?

492
00:27:13,795 --> 00:27:15,466
I heard you and Pil Seung broke up.

493
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:18,406
There's no reason for you to see each other.

494
00:27:20,136 --> 00:27:21,235
Leave already.

495
00:27:21,565 --> 00:27:23,106
Also, don't ever come back here.

496
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:30,975
What the...

497
00:27:31,575 --> 00:27:34,315
What do you think you're doing?

498
00:27:36,216 --> 00:27:37,255
I'm sorry.

499
00:27:39,985 --> 00:27:42,596
I only just found out that my mom...

500
00:27:42,596 --> 00:27:43,956
caused your father's death.

501
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:47,265
I'm truly sorry.

502
00:27:50,096 --> 00:27:52,265
I would've come by sooner had I known,

503
00:27:52,265 --> 00:27:53,535
but I wasn't aware of it.

504
00:27:55,275 --> 00:27:56,636
I'm really sorry.

505
00:27:59,106 --> 00:28:01,946
Please let me apologize on my mom's behalf.

506
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,716
What she did was wrong.

507
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:09,255
I'm really sorry.

508
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:11,585
I'm so sorry.

509
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:17,995
I'm sorry.

510
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:31,876
What she did was wrong.

511
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:37,846
I'm truly sorry.

512
00:28:54,295 --> 00:28:55,366
Do Ra.

513
00:28:57,995 --> 00:28:59,565
What are you doing here?

514
00:29:00,966 --> 00:29:02,636
Pil Seung, I finally know everything.

515
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:08,376
I know why you rejected me at first...

516
00:29:10,446 --> 00:29:12,285
and why you broke up with me.

517
00:29:14,245 --> 00:29:16,055
Why didn't you tell me?

518
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:18,656
Why...

519
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:21,856
Why did you suffer on your own?

520
00:29:27,926 --> 00:29:29,495
As if you're to blame.

521
00:29:29,495 --> 00:29:31,065
This is all my mom's fault.

522
00:29:33,535 --> 00:29:34,866
Pil Seung, I'm sorry.

523
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:37,535
My mom...

524
00:29:38,706 --> 00:29:41,646
hurt your family in the worst way possible.

525
00:29:43,775 --> 00:29:45,346
My apology...

526
00:29:46,315 --> 00:29:48,585
won't wash any of the pain away,

527
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:52,085
but I'm still sorry.

528
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,325
I'm also sorry that all I can do...

529
00:29:58,896 --> 00:30:00,295
is apologize.

530
00:30:24,386 --> 00:30:26,585
Didn't we put an end to it the last time we met?

531
00:30:27,686 --> 00:30:29,196
We agreed not to see each other again.

532
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:32,596
I'm not here for coffee...

533
00:30:33,225 --> 00:30:34,896
and I'll keep my word and stay away.

534
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:37,966
Then why...

535
00:30:40,735 --> 00:30:41,835
This purse...

536
00:30:42,206 --> 00:30:43,775
Well, I bought it for you.

537
00:30:45,035 --> 00:30:47,575
I couldn't throw it away, keep it,

538
00:30:47,575 --> 00:30:49,015
or give it to another woman.

539
00:30:49,575 --> 00:30:50,745
What I mean...

540
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:53,846
is that it's yours, so do whatever you want with it.

541
00:30:53,846 --> 00:30:56,116
Throw it away or burn it for all I care. Here.

542
00:30:58,485 --> 00:30:59,585
Then,

543
00:31:01,785 --> 00:31:02,896
I wish you happiness.

544
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:31,585
Fine.

545
00:31:32,926 --> 00:31:34,856
I'll make good use of this purse.

546
00:31:38,156 --> 00:31:40,896
Take care, you piece of trash.

547
00:31:43,196 --> 00:31:46,335
Let's not see each other again.

548
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:02,815
Let's have you holding another device.

549
00:32:08,085 --> 00:32:09,096
Mr. Gong,

550
00:32:09,525 --> 00:32:10,696
it's about Park Do Ra.

551
00:32:11,126 --> 00:32:12,795
We had no choice this time around...

552
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,466
since we signed the deal while she filmed the series.

553
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,866
But when her contract expires, don't bother renewing it. Got it?

554
00:32:18,765 --> 00:32:21,065
Mom, this is work.

555
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:22,975
How can you say that...

556
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:24,035
when you know our sales skyrocketed...

557
00:32:24,035 --> 00:32:25,136
after she became the brand ambassador?

558
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:27,106
You know that since you run a store.

559
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,075
That's true, but...

560
00:32:29,775 --> 00:32:31,716
Fine, I admit to that.

561
00:32:32,485 --> 00:32:35,045
But I don't like her, so don't renew her contract.

562
00:32:35,785 --> 00:32:37,356
Sign someone trendier instead.

563
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:39,485
Mom, I should make work-related decisions...

564
00:32:39,485 --> 00:32:40,825
since I'm the CEO.

565
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:46,696
And who got you that title?

566
00:32:46,725 --> 00:32:48,196
- Hi. - Hi.

567
00:32:48,936 --> 00:32:50,666
I'm a huge fan.

568
00:32:51,765 --> 00:32:52,805
Thanks.

569
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,466
Thank you.

570
00:32:54,466 --> 00:32:55,735
Thank you so much.

571
00:32:57,005 --> 00:32:58,235
Do Ra!

572
00:32:58,275 --> 00:32:59,446
(To Chae Won, Park Do Ra)

573
00:32:59,575 --> 00:33:00,946
- I'll be sure to read it. - Thank you.

574
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:02,075
- Thanks. - I'll see you around.

575
00:33:02,075 --> 00:33:03,146
Take care.

576
00:33:08,145 --> 00:33:09,585
Do Ra, I'm back.

577
00:33:09,786 --> 00:33:10,886
It's me again.

578
00:33:11,386 --> 00:33:13,685
- We'll see you around. - Sure. Until next time.

579
00:33:14,656 --> 00:33:16,096
It was a long day today.

580
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:17,926
Thanks to you, PR has been a blessing.

581
00:33:19,295 --> 00:33:20,426
Thank you.

582
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,565
I'll get going, then.

583
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:24,966
I'm sorry about how I acted...

584
00:33:26,036 --> 00:33:27,335
at the wrap party.

585
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:30,435
I inconvenienced you which wasn't my intention.

586
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:33,045
I deeply apologize for my actions.

587
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:36,775
Well, it's all in the past.

588
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:38,576
Have a good day.

589
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:48,926
(CEO Baek Mi Ja)

590
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,025
You have one month to change Do Ra's mind...

591
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:52,466
and have her come to me.

592
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:56,795
If you don't,

593
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:59,466
I'll make sure your daughter is done for good...

594
00:33:59,935 --> 00:34:01,366
as a celebrity.

595
00:34:02,176 --> 00:34:03,335
What do I do?

596
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:06,176
Mr. Gong's deadline is approaching.

597
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:09,045
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

598
00:34:09,045 --> 00:34:11,275
Why is he calling me again? My heart almost stopped.

599
00:34:14,545 --> 00:34:16,156
Hello, Mr. Gong.

600
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,985
I didn't see you at Ms. Park's autograph signing event today...

601
00:34:20,786 --> 00:34:22,156
even though it was an important one.

602
00:34:22,556 --> 00:34:24,625
Gosh, I hope there weren't any hitches.

603
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:26,766
I didn't miss the event on purpose.

604
00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:29,335
It's just that I had something important to do.

605
00:34:29,636 --> 00:34:31,565
The event went smoothly and was a huge success.

606
00:34:31,565 --> 00:34:33,235
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

607
00:34:33,235 --> 00:34:35,636
Anyway, I wanted to know how things were coming along.

608
00:34:36,705 --> 00:34:38,136
The deadline is approaching.

609
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:41,076
However,

610
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:45,145
her attitude toward me seemed strictly business.

611
00:34:46,645 --> 00:34:48,346
I called since I didn't see any progress.

612
00:34:50,185 --> 00:34:51,585
Please give me some time.

613
00:34:51,585 --> 00:34:54,826
She's busy with ad campaigns and auditions at the moment.

614
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:58,696
I'll soon set something up for you and her.

615
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:01,466
I'll make sure she changes her mind about you,

616
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:02,795
so don't you worry.

617
00:35:03,565 --> 00:35:05,165
I'll trust you once more.

618
00:35:05,165 --> 00:35:07,005
And that you should.

619
00:35:07,366 --> 00:35:09,036
But I must say this.

620
00:35:10,036 --> 00:35:13,005
I only say what I mean.

621
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,145
Remember that.

622
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:17,846
I'll leave you to it, then.

623
00:35:23,315 --> 00:35:24,786
He's the Grim Reaper.

624
00:35:24,786 --> 00:35:26,926
Only one could mentally torment another.

625
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:30,826
So how can I persuade Do Ra?

626
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:33,565
She broke up with Dae Chung,

627
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:35,065
so maybe she'll be open to dating someone else.

628
00:35:48,705 --> 00:35:49,846
Why aren't you eating?

629
00:35:50,746 --> 00:35:51,946
Should I wrap this up for you?

630
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:54,045
That's all right.

631
00:36:22,176 --> 00:36:25,886
(Young Mi Snacks)

632
00:36:25,886 --> 00:36:30,016
(Young Mi Snacks)

633
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,366
Were you here alone?

634
00:36:44,596 --> 00:36:45,605
What?

635
00:36:46,966 --> 00:36:47,966
Yes.

636
00:36:49,176 --> 00:36:51,136
I was suddenly craving tteokbokki.

637
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,176
See you, then.

638
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:15,366
Pil Seung, that's a lie.

639
00:37:20,665 --> 00:37:23,036
I came here because I missed you.

640
00:37:26,605 --> 00:37:29,176
I thought I could at least catch you...

641
00:37:29,176 --> 00:37:30,946
walking by.

642
00:37:34,915 --> 00:37:36,116
That's why I came.

643
00:37:52,366 --> 00:37:53,565
I'm sorry.

644
00:37:54,966 --> 00:37:56,435
I know I shouldn't be this way.

645
00:37:58,775 --> 00:37:59,946
I'll get going.

646
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,306
Pil Seung,

647
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:30,806
do you want some soju?

648
00:39:05,745 --> 00:39:06,915
Gosh, my boy.

649
00:39:08,315 --> 00:39:11,225
Why are you home so late?

650
00:39:12,355 --> 00:39:13,395
Mom!

651
00:39:13,995 --> 00:39:15,895
Did you wait up for me?

652
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:18,295
It was getting late,

653
00:39:18,295 --> 00:39:19,734
and I was worried that you weren't home.

654
00:39:20,534 --> 00:39:22,935
Why would you wait up for me when I'm not a kid?

655
00:39:22,935 --> 00:39:24,964
I can make it home just fine.

656
00:39:26,275 --> 00:39:28,574
I see you drank a lot.

657
00:39:29,944 --> 00:39:32,105
Why did you drink so much?

658
00:39:33,114 --> 00:39:35,015
The whole team went out for drinks.

659
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,415
"Straightforward Romance" is such a huge hit...

660
00:39:37,415 --> 00:39:39,315
that everyone has been congratulating us.

661
00:39:39,315 --> 00:39:42,415
The station director let us have the corporate credit card,

662
00:39:42,855 --> 00:39:44,455
so I drank with joy.

663
00:39:45,554 --> 00:39:48,754
Mom, I'm feeling great today.

664
00:39:50,025 --> 00:39:52,694
Mom, I'll head to my room and go to bed.

665
00:39:53,234 --> 00:39:54,694
Good night, Mom.

666
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:56,835
Pil Seung, wait.

667
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:15,415
Pil Seung, I brought you...

668
00:40:17,824 --> 00:40:18,884
Pil Seung?

669
00:40:21,694 --> 00:40:22,795
Were you crying?

670
00:40:23,924 --> 00:40:24,995
Of course not.

671
00:40:24,995 --> 00:40:26,795
Why would I be crying? Don't be silly.

672
00:40:29,705 --> 00:40:30,705
Pil Seung.

673
00:40:33,304 --> 00:40:34,304
Mom.

674
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:36,705
This...

675
00:40:37,844 --> 00:40:40,275
This is sweat, not tears.

676
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:42,475
Oddly enough,

677
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:45,145
my eyes start sweating when I'm drunk.

678
00:40:46,714 --> 00:40:49,284
You're silly to think that I've been crying.

679
00:40:51,554 --> 00:40:54,094
Can't you tell sweat and tears apart?

680
00:40:56,525 --> 00:40:59,225
Mom, I'd like to sleep now,

681
00:41:00,065 --> 00:41:02,134
so turn in for the night as well.

682
00:41:58,585 --> 00:42:00,395
Sun Young, you came to see me.

683
00:42:03,795 --> 00:42:05,625
Dad, it's been a while.

684
00:42:07,165 --> 00:42:08,964
I haven't been by recently, have I?

685
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:12,605
Who cares if you haven't?

686
00:42:13,734 --> 00:42:15,775
Nothing changes the fact that I'm always with you.

687
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:21,045
I'm sure you know...

688
00:42:22,944 --> 00:42:25,085
why I came by to see you today.

689
00:42:30,585 --> 00:42:31,585
Dad.

690
00:42:34,654 --> 00:42:37,824
I still hate that woman enough to want to kill her.

691
00:42:40,495 --> 00:42:41,935
I can't forgive her.

692
00:42:42,665 --> 00:42:43,765
Sun Young.

693
00:42:44,705 --> 00:42:46,975
Why do you still feel like that? You should've let it go.

694
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:49,605
I told you it was fine.

695
00:42:51,605 --> 00:42:52,645
My darling.

696
00:42:54,145 --> 00:42:56,185
Don't live with hatred in your heart.

697
00:43:00,415 --> 00:43:01,585
But Dad.

698
00:43:03,085 --> 00:43:04,125
What...

699
00:43:06,054 --> 00:43:07,725
What do I do about Pil Seung?

700
00:43:12,094 --> 00:43:14,734
I don't want to see him suffer.

701
00:43:17,265 --> 00:43:18,935
It's hard to take.

702
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:23,145
That's how I felt.

703
00:43:25,174 --> 00:43:28,114
When you hurt, I hurt even more.

704
00:43:32,085 --> 00:43:33,254
I'm sorry, Dad.

705
00:43:35,214 --> 00:43:36,455
I'm sorry.

706
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:42,964
I'm sorry.

707
00:43:49,705 --> 00:43:51,964
You saw our Ma Ri?

708
00:43:52,804 --> 00:43:53,835
Yes.

709
00:43:54,475 --> 00:43:56,174
Last year, with my father,

710
00:43:56,705 --> 00:43:59,245
I attended your company's anniversary event.

711
00:43:59,915 --> 00:44:00,975
I saw her there.

712
00:44:02,275 --> 00:44:04,344
- Did you? - Yes.

713
00:44:05,444 --> 00:44:07,254
Though it was very short,

714
00:44:07,515 --> 00:44:09,415
we even had a conversation.

715
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,525
You mean with Ma Ri?

716
00:44:11,924 --> 00:44:12,924
Yes.

717
00:44:13,094 --> 00:44:16,395
We happened to talk about seasons.

718
00:44:17,194 --> 00:44:18,625
It was fun and enjoyable.

719
00:44:19,225 --> 00:44:21,295
I'm not sure she remembers, though.

720
00:44:24,065 --> 00:44:25,435
Our daughter Ma Ri.

721
00:44:26,935 --> 00:44:29,234
You know she's different from most women, right?

722
00:44:31,145 --> 00:44:33,674
And yet you have fond memories of her...

723
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:35,045
and want to see her.

724
00:44:36,784 --> 00:44:37,784
Thank you.

725
00:44:37,944 --> 00:44:39,145
Not at all.

726
00:44:40,784 --> 00:44:44,424
To me, Ma Ri seemed more innocent,

727
00:44:45,025 --> 00:44:47,554
honest, and pretty...

728
00:44:48,594 --> 00:44:49,765
than any woman.

729
00:44:51,395 --> 00:44:54,134
Both my father and I...

730
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,134
respect you, Chairman Gong.

731
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,435
If I were to be a member of your family,

732
00:45:01,234 --> 00:45:02,804
it would be an honor.

733
00:45:09,275 --> 00:45:10,284
A blind date?

734
00:45:10,614 --> 00:45:12,284
Sure. What's he like?

735
00:45:13,154 --> 00:45:15,784
There's this CEO who's a good friend of mine,

736
00:45:15,884 --> 00:45:17,025
and it's his son.

737
00:45:18,725 --> 00:45:19,955
Okay, I'm in.

738
00:45:19,955 --> 00:45:21,694
I'd wanted to have a boyfriend.

739
00:45:22,895 --> 00:45:24,395
But Ma Ri.

740
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:26,534
He's a bit older than you.

741
00:45:27,565 --> 00:45:28,665
How old is he?

742
00:45:29,134 --> 00:45:31,804
He's on the older side, but so what?

743
00:45:32,335 --> 00:45:34,105
You're an only child.

744
00:45:34,105 --> 00:45:36,645
Wouldn't an older brother figure be better than someone your age?

745
00:45:37,645 --> 00:45:38,904
I guess?

746
00:45:39,975 --> 00:45:41,614
I like older brother figures.

747
00:45:43,415 --> 00:45:44,884
Over here, Pil Seung.

748
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,554
What are you doing at the TV station?

749
00:45:48,654 --> 00:45:50,955
Do you want to take your son out on a date?

750
00:45:52,924 --> 00:45:55,424
Sorry. I have a meeting later.

751
00:46:00,435 --> 00:46:02,464
What is it, Mom? Is something wrong?

752
00:46:03,205 --> 00:46:04,634
Nothing's wrong.

753
00:46:06,275 --> 00:46:09,705
I just got back from your grandpa's grave.

754
00:46:11,545 --> 00:46:12,674
Grandpa's grave?

755
00:46:13,515 --> 00:46:14,614
You went on your own?

756
00:46:15,545 --> 00:46:16,545
Yes.

757
00:46:18,344 --> 00:46:19,384
Pil Seung.

758
00:46:20,714 --> 00:46:22,015
You can date Do Ra.

759
00:46:22,984 --> 00:46:24,585
You have my permission.

760
00:46:26,025 --> 00:46:28,824
Your dad will give in if you say I approved.

761
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,464
Stop it, Mom.

762
00:46:35,165 --> 00:46:36,665
We broke up.

763
00:46:39,935 --> 00:46:41,975
I was so wrong.

764
00:46:43,174 --> 00:46:46,174
I thought only of myself and not of how you'd suffer.

765
00:46:48,645 --> 00:46:51,444
I don't want to force you to break up...

766
00:46:51,444 --> 00:46:53,415
with someone you like.

767
00:46:54,515 --> 00:46:56,455
I don't like seeing you in pain.

768
00:46:58,725 --> 00:47:01,324
No, Mom. I'm fine.

769
00:47:01,924 --> 00:47:03,065
I really am.

770
00:47:04,225 --> 00:47:06,094
You like Do Ra a lot.

771
00:47:06,594 --> 00:47:08,594
And she likes you too.

772
00:47:13,174 --> 00:47:14,275
Pil Seung.

773
00:47:15,404 --> 00:47:17,705
Do Ra didn't do anything to wrong us.

774
00:47:18,245 --> 00:47:20,245
She didn't do anything wrong.

775
00:47:22,545 --> 00:47:24,745
I told your grandpa about it.

776
00:47:26,245 --> 00:47:27,784
I'm sure he'll be pleased.

777
00:47:30,424 --> 00:47:31,455
Mom.

778
00:47:33,025 --> 00:47:34,625
I ended it with her.

779
00:47:35,594 --> 00:47:36,765
Don't talk about that again.

780
00:47:37,594 --> 00:47:40,364
And Mom. I really am fine.

781
00:47:40,634 --> 00:47:42,795
I'm over her already.

782
00:47:44,065 --> 00:47:45,964
I have to get to the meeting.

783
00:47:46,034 --> 00:47:47,105
See you at home.

784
00:48:10,094 --> 00:48:12,864
Please let me apologize on my mom's behalf.

785
00:48:13,895 --> 00:48:15,094
I'll get going.

786
00:48:18,835 --> 00:48:21,475
Why would I be crying? Don't be silly.

787
00:48:40,194 --> 00:48:43,225
(Young Mi Snacks)

788
00:48:56,904 --> 00:48:59,174
Ms. Kim. I'm here.

789
00:48:59,705 --> 00:49:03,384
Do Ra. Pil Seung will be there soon.

790
00:49:03,844 --> 00:49:04,844
What?

791
00:49:06,114 --> 00:49:07,714
What do you mean?

792
00:49:08,714 --> 00:49:12,554
I decided to let you two date.

793
00:49:12,984 --> 00:49:14,395
Get back together.

794
00:49:17,464 --> 00:49:18,565
Ms. Kim.

795
00:49:19,964 --> 00:49:22,364
That's that. Enjoy your date.

796
00:49:33,344 --> 00:49:35,515
Where are you, Mom? I'm here.

797
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:38,645
Do Ra will meet you there.

798
00:49:40,415 --> 00:49:41,484
What...

799
00:49:43,554 --> 00:49:46,554
Eat something nice and enjoy your date.

800
00:49:46,924 --> 00:49:48,125
Good luck, son.

801
00:49:56,134 --> 00:49:57,165
Do Ra.

802
00:50:37,004 --> 00:50:38,004
Goodness.

803
00:50:45,844 --> 00:50:47,415
I'll trust you once more.

804
00:50:47,815 --> 00:50:49,415
But I must say this.

805
00:50:50,254 --> 00:50:52,284
I only say what I mean.

806
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:53,725
Remember that.

807
00:50:55,455 --> 00:50:57,424
I need to convince Do Ra somehow.

808
00:50:58,324 --> 00:50:59,765
I can't even swallow a pill now.

809
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:02,935
Oh, dear.

810
00:51:03,765 --> 00:51:04,904
My head's splitting apart.

811
00:51:06,835 --> 00:51:09,134
- I'm home. - Do Ra.

812
00:51:09,335 --> 00:51:10,574
Let's talk.

813
00:51:11,775 --> 00:51:13,344
Later, Mom.

814
00:51:13,344 --> 00:51:14,745
Let's discuss work tomorrow.

815
00:51:15,174 --> 00:51:16,984
Do Ra, listen.

816
00:51:17,214 --> 00:51:19,955
Mr. Gong. Can't you give him a chance?

817
00:51:19,955 --> 00:51:21,955
It's my only wish, okay?

818
00:51:22,754 --> 00:51:25,355
Mom. Not him again.

819
00:51:25,525 --> 00:51:28,654
He does have a fiery temper.

820
00:51:28,654 --> 00:51:31,395
But if you think about it, it was because he liked you.

821
00:51:31,565 --> 00:51:33,534
- So Do Ra... - Mom.

822
00:51:33,864 --> 00:51:35,594
I got back with Pil Seung.

823
00:51:36,435 --> 00:51:37,605
So stop this.

824
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:40,935
What? What did you just say?

825
00:51:41,475 --> 00:51:43,705
From now on, don't mention...

826
00:51:43,705 --> 00:51:45,475
Mr. Gong around me.

827
00:51:45,745 --> 00:51:47,875
I don't like him. I really hate him.

828
00:51:48,015 --> 00:51:50,344
You brat. You're out of your mind.

829
00:51:50,545 --> 00:51:52,515
You have a screw loose!

830
00:51:53,185 --> 00:51:55,855
You broke up with him.

831
00:51:55,955 --> 00:51:58,025
What kind of nonsense is this?

832
00:51:58,025 --> 00:52:00,654
You don't even like someone like Mr. Gong,

833
00:52:00,654 --> 00:52:03,395
so why would you go for a loser like him?

834
00:52:03,424 --> 00:52:05,665
I've had enough of that darn family.

835
00:52:05,665 --> 00:52:08,094
I'll teach that punk a lesson!

836
00:52:08,094 --> 00:52:09,964
Yes. You do that.

837
00:52:10,134 --> 00:52:11,404
Do whatever you want.

838
00:52:11,935 --> 00:52:14,574
But if you act out, I'll retire.

839
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,335
I'll quit acting...

840
00:52:16,335 --> 00:52:17,944
and move to the US with Pil Seung.

841
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:21,315
And you'll never see me again, okay?

842
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:24,384
What did you say? You'll retire?

843
00:52:28,884 --> 00:52:30,525
My gosh. That little...

844
00:52:30,525 --> 00:52:31,855
I don't think she's bluffing.

845
00:52:32,355 --> 00:52:34,054
Once she loses her temper,

846
00:52:34,054 --> 00:52:35,694
she will probably retire and move to the US.

847
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,694
That's what she would do.

848
00:52:40,864 --> 00:52:42,335
Do Ra.

849
00:52:46,435 --> 00:52:47,534
Do Ra.

850
00:52:48,475 --> 00:52:51,344
All right. Do whatever you want, Do Ra.

851
00:52:51,475 --> 00:52:53,745
But just make sure...

852
00:52:53,745 --> 00:52:56,915
that people don't find out about you and that Ko Pil Seung or something.

853
00:52:57,484 --> 00:52:59,515
If they find out you two are dating,

854
00:52:59,515 --> 00:53:02,284
it's just a matter of time before your popularity falls, okay?

855
00:53:06,455 --> 00:53:07,855
What should I say to Mr. Gong?

856
00:53:08,194 --> 00:53:09,295
What do I do?

857
00:53:09,654 --> 00:53:10,765
What's wrong with my life?

858
00:53:12,795 --> 00:53:13,795
What should I do?

859
00:53:21,275 --> 00:53:23,844
Well... Here.

860
00:53:25,944 --> 00:53:26,944
What is this?

861
00:53:27,745 --> 00:53:30,944
This is the 500,000 dollars I borrowed.

862
00:53:34,054 --> 00:53:37,384
I'm really sorry, Mr. Gong.

863
00:53:39,025 --> 00:53:40,094
You're...

864
00:53:41,324 --> 00:53:42,324
sorry?

865
00:53:42,795 --> 00:53:43,924
Mr. Gong.

866
00:53:44,194 --> 00:53:46,995
You know I like you a lot, right?

867
00:53:47,795 --> 00:53:50,634
That's why I wanted you to be with my daughter.

868
00:53:51,364 --> 00:53:53,734
And I still do.

869
00:53:54,074 --> 00:53:56,844
But things don't go my way...

870
00:53:56,844 --> 00:53:59,875
when it's about my child.

871
00:54:00,315 --> 00:54:03,484
Mr. Gong, you'll find someone better.

872
00:54:03,484 --> 00:54:06,284
I really want you to be with my daughter,

873
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,284
but there's nothing I can do.

874
00:54:07,284 --> 00:54:09,585
Do Ra says she's not interested in dating now.

875
00:54:09,585 --> 00:54:11,725
She just wants to focus on work.

876
00:54:13,355 --> 00:54:15,324
All right.

877
00:54:16,254 --> 00:54:17,364
I see.

878
00:54:18,424 --> 00:54:19,594
I understand what you mean.

879
00:54:21,034 --> 00:54:24,504
I'm so sorry, Mr. Gong.

880
00:54:29,074 --> 00:54:31,545
Phone number 6245.

881
00:54:31,545 --> 00:54:32,775
Yes. Over here.

882
00:54:34,114 --> 00:54:35,944
- Thank you. - Thank you.

883
00:54:38,884 --> 00:54:41,085
Knock, knock. Your chicken is here.

884
00:54:44,254 --> 00:54:45,254
What?

885
00:54:45,855 --> 00:54:47,125
It's really here.

886
00:54:49,154 --> 00:54:51,265
I can't believe I'm eating fried chicken at the Han River.

887
00:54:51,964 --> 00:54:53,534
I have butterflies now.

888
00:54:54,395 --> 00:54:55,964
You get butterflies for strange reasons.

889
00:54:56,295 --> 00:54:58,705
You got butterflies before when we had hagfish.

890
00:54:58,705 --> 00:55:00,034
And this time, it's fried chicken.

891
00:55:00,475 --> 00:55:01,975
I've only done it in dramas.

892
00:55:01,975 --> 00:55:05,004
This is my first time eating fried chicken at a place like this.

893
00:55:07,714 --> 00:55:09,214
Let's hurry and eat, Pil Seung.

894
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:11,045
We have a lot of things to do today.

895
00:55:11,045 --> 00:55:12,344
We have a tight schedule.

896
00:55:12,984 --> 00:55:14,054
What are we doing?

897
00:55:14,654 --> 00:55:16,415
Come on, Pil Seung. Today,

898
00:55:16,884 --> 00:55:19,424
just do what I tell you to do.

899
00:55:22,025 --> 00:55:23,964
You always do things your own way.

900
00:55:23,964 --> 00:55:25,364
But I'll let it slide because you're pretty.

901
00:55:26,225 --> 00:55:27,594
What will happen if you don't let it slide?

902
00:55:29,665 --> 00:55:31,205
Let's hurry and eat.

903
00:55:35,074 --> 00:55:37,174
What? How can it be so good?

904
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:39,605
It's so delicious that I feel like crying.

905
00:55:43,685 --> 00:55:45,745
It's really crispy.

906
00:55:45,745 --> 00:55:47,284
- Is it crispy? - Yes.

907
00:55:47,815 --> 00:55:50,455
(Refuss)

908
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:56,495
How does it feel?

909
00:55:56,824 --> 00:55:58,295
Isn't this nice?

910
00:55:58,495 --> 00:55:59,495
Yes.

911
00:55:59,895 --> 00:56:01,895
My feet feel so soft and nice now.

912
00:56:04,864 --> 00:56:06,265
I've never done this before.

913
00:56:16,245 --> 00:56:18,444
Pil Seung, we should do things like this often.

914
00:56:18,784 --> 00:56:21,984
You must be tired from running around at the filming location.

915
00:56:22,614 --> 00:56:24,324
I should take good care of you.

916
00:56:24,955 --> 00:56:26,484
I'm so lucky to have you.

917
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:27,995
I get to do a lot of things thanks to you.

918
00:56:28,795 --> 00:56:30,594
And this isn't the end of it.

919
00:56:30,594 --> 00:56:32,464
There will be a special event.

920
00:56:33,094 --> 00:56:34,134
Is there something else?

921
00:56:34,134 --> 00:56:37,404
Pil Seung, I told you to let me take care of everything.

922
00:56:37,935 --> 00:56:39,004
Just do...

923
00:56:39,004 --> 00:56:40,574
Okay. Fine.

924
00:56:41,234 --> 00:56:42,975
Do whatever you want.

925
00:56:45,174 --> 00:56:46,404
Where are we going?

926
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:50,245
We're almost there. Wait a little more.

927
00:56:54,415 --> 00:56:55,415
All right.

928
00:56:59,685 --> 00:57:02,625
- Pil Seung. - Where on earth are we going?

929
00:57:02,625 --> 00:57:03,765
Just wait.

930
00:57:04,525 --> 00:57:07,694
Pil Seung, I want to ask you something.

931
00:57:08,034 --> 00:57:09,034
What?

932
00:57:15,205 --> 00:57:18,245
Pil Seung, I really love you.

933
00:57:19,444 --> 00:57:20,444
What about you?

934
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:23,745
Why do you ask? Of course, I do.

935
00:57:23,844 --> 00:57:26,915
But you know what? They say everything changes.

936
00:57:27,784 --> 00:57:29,015
And love changes too.

937
00:57:30,054 --> 00:57:33,995
But I don't want our love to change.

938
00:57:34,895 --> 00:57:36,025
I won't change.

939
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:37,765
Are you sure?

940
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:39,125
Yes.

941
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:43,364
Then Pil Seung, I want to have...

942
00:57:45,565 --> 00:57:47,475
proof of our love.

943
00:57:48,435 --> 00:57:50,504
Whatever problems we might be facing,

944
00:57:50,504 --> 00:57:52,745
we can use it to overcome the difficulties.

945
00:57:52,745 --> 00:57:54,375
And even when we have a fight,

946
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:56,074
we can make up by looking at it.

947
00:57:57,844 --> 00:57:58,884
Okay?

948
00:57:59,415 --> 00:58:00,685
Proof of our love?

949
00:58:01,455 --> 00:58:02,654
What would it be?

950
00:58:07,554 --> 00:58:08,824
(Young Tattoos and Henna)

951
00:58:10,565 --> 00:58:12,094
Do you want to get a tattoo?

952
00:58:13,864 --> 00:58:15,165
This is really pretty.

953
00:58:17,105 --> 00:58:20,004
Pil Seung, it looks great, right?

954
00:58:20,435 --> 00:58:21,435
Yes.

955
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:23,634
You are my star,

956
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:25,205
and I'm your moon.

957
00:58:26,404 --> 00:58:28,315
Stop saying things like that.

958
00:58:28,315 --> 00:58:30,685
It is so cheesy that it makes me cringe.

959
00:58:30,685 --> 00:58:32,714
Why? What's wrong with saying that?

960
00:58:34,614 --> 00:58:35,815
This is so pretty.

961
00:58:36,685 --> 00:58:38,455
Pil Seung. Now,

962
00:58:38,455 --> 00:58:41,455
we're inseparable just like the moon and the stars in the sky.

963
00:58:41,455 --> 00:58:43,765
So don't try to run away from me.

964
00:58:45,094 --> 00:58:47,895
I guess it was a mistake that I let you do things your way today.

965
00:58:48,694 --> 00:58:51,065
What? Are you regretting it already?

966
00:58:51,734 --> 00:58:53,975
No. I'm just joking.

967
00:58:58,475 --> 00:58:59,545
Pil Seung.

968
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:03,574
We will be facing a lot of difficulties.

969
00:59:05,515 --> 00:59:08,855
It wouldn't be a big deal if you were dating someone ordinary,

970
00:59:09,355 --> 00:59:12,025
but you will probably go through things...

971
00:59:12,025 --> 00:59:14,395
that are uncomfortable and difficult because of me.

972
00:59:20,094 --> 00:59:22,065
We already got through the worst difficulty.

973
00:59:23,034 --> 00:59:25,034
What else would be more difficult than that?

974
00:59:27,034 --> 00:59:28,105
Still,

975
00:59:29,174 --> 00:59:30,475
we never know.

976
00:59:32,105 --> 00:59:34,944
Even if we face another difficulty,

977
00:59:35,745 --> 00:59:38,284
I want us to believe and count on each other.

978
00:59:38,984 --> 00:59:41,154
We should protect each other like the moon and star here.

979
00:59:42,455 --> 00:59:44,284
You should never let go of this hand, okay?

980
00:59:47,295 --> 00:59:49,554
All right. I'll never let go of it.

981
01:00:23,554 --> 01:00:26,165
We're supposed to sign a contract for a cosmetics commercial today.

982
01:00:26,324 --> 01:00:27,795
Why haven't we heard from them yet?

983
01:00:32,304 --> 01:00:33,634
Ms. Baek, we have a problem.

984
01:00:34,734 --> 01:00:36,674
What's the problem?

985
01:00:37,645 --> 01:00:38,904
The thing is...

986
01:00:39,705 --> 01:00:42,674
All the clients suddenly want to cancel our commercial contracts.

987
01:00:43,214 --> 01:00:46,585
The cosmetics commercial suddenly got canceled too.

988
01:00:46,745 --> 01:00:48,455
And the furniture company we were going to meet in two days...

989
01:00:48,455 --> 01:00:50,355
called us and said they'd go with another model.

990
01:00:50,884 --> 01:00:52,625
The beverage commercial for which we were going to renew our contract...

991
01:00:52,625 --> 01:00:53,895
went to Cho Bi Bi.

992
01:00:55,355 --> 01:00:58,895
That's ridiculous, Ms. Song. This isn't a joke.

993
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:03,464
Ms. Baek, I think the rumor is true.

994
01:01:04,105 --> 01:01:05,665
What rumor are you talking about?

995
01:01:05,665 --> 01:01:07,205
I heard something...

996
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:10,234
from my friend who works at an advertising firm this morning.

997
01:01:10,504 --> 01:01:12,504
You know CEO Gong Jin Dan of Angel Investment Corp.

998
01:01:12,504 --> 01:01:14,015
He told all the advertising agencies...

999
01:01:14,015 --> 01:01:16,145
that he would stop investing in them...

1000
01:01:16,145 --> 01:01:18,384
if they hired Park Do Ra for their commercials.

1001
01:01:20,815 --> 01:01:21,815
What did you just say?

1002
01:01:21,815 --> 01:01:24,784
CEO Gong Jin Dan of Angel Investment Corp. said that?

1003
01:01:24,784 --> 01:01:27,895
Yes. I don't know why he'd say such a thing.

1004
01:01:28,725 --> 01:01:30,964
But what if it's true?

1005
01:01:33,725 --> 01:01:34,995
(Dong Ho's mom)

1006
01:01:36,295 --> 01:01:37,734
Okay, Ms. Song. You may leave now.

1007
01:01:38,435 --> 01:01:39,435
Yes, ma'am.

1008
01:01:43,904 --> 01:01:46,045
Hello. Baek Mi Ja speaking.

1009
01:01:46,145 --> 01:01:47,645
Listen, Ms. Baek.

1010
01:01:47,645 --> 01:01:50,045
You keep saying that you'd pay me back tomorrow.

1011
01:01:50,045 --> 01:01:52,444
When can I get my money back?

1012
01:01:52,444 --> 01:01:54,315
If you don't take care of it within this week,

1013
01:01:54,315 --> 01:01:56,455
I'll sue you for fraud.

1014
01:01:59,984 --> 01:02:01,125
What do I do?

1015
01:02:04,194 --> 01:02:06,824
Mr. Choi, what brings you here?

1016
01:02:07,464 --> 01:02:10,734
Mi Ja, why did you make me come all the way here?

1017
01:02:11,504 --> 01:02:12,964
What do you think you're doing now?

1018
01:02:13,265 --> 01:02:15,105
Why aren't you sending me the money?

1019
01:02:15,105 --> 01:02:18,105
But, Mr. Choi, you're not supposed to be here.

1020
01:02:18,105 --> 01:02:20,674
You want me to wait and do nothing when you don't pay the interest?

1021
01:02:21,045 --> 01:02:24,384
That's not what I can do. Call Park Do Ra right away.

1022
01:02:24,984 --> 01:02:26,545
She seems to be popular now.

1023
01:02:26,545 --> 01:02:29,685
I'll get the money from her instead of you, okay?

1024
01:02:29,884 --> 01:02:31,085
Where's Park Do Ra?

1025
01:02:31,484 --> 01:02:32,625
Where is she?

1026
01:02:33,025 --> 01:02:35,355
Fine! I'll pay the interest.

1027
01:02:35,355 --> 01:02:37,125
Let go of me, darn it.

1028
01:02:38,924 --> 01:02:41,094
No, you can't come in here.

1029
01:02:41,165 --> 01:02:43,065
Let go of me!

1030
01:02:43,395 --> 01:02:44,765
Mr. Gong, I'm sorry.

1031
01:02:44,765 --> 01:02:47,534
It's me...

1032
01:02:47,574 --> 01:02:48,605
Mr. Cho,

1033
01:02:50,004 --> 01:02:51,045
you're dismissed.

1034
01:02:51,045 --> 01:02:52,205
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

1035
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:08,924
Mr. Gong.

1036
01:03:09,924 --> 01:03:11,295
Was it you?

1037
01:03:12,295 --> 01:03:13,995
Was it you...

1038
01:03:14,364 --> 01:03:17,765
who had the companies drop Do Ra as brand ambassador?

1039
01:03:19,165 --> 01:03:20,565
I told you...

1040
01:03:21,634 --> 01:03:23,134
that I would tank...

1041
01:03:24,545 --> 01:03:25,844
Park Do Ra's career.

1042
01:03:26,904 --> 01:03:28,475
I'll have her forgotten as a celebrity.

1043
01:03:32,185 --> 01:03:33,714
How could you...

1044
01:03:34,415 --> 01:03:37,214
How could you do this when I did nothing wrong?

1045
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:39,085
Do Ra did nothing wrong.

1046
01:03:39,085 --> 01:03:40,824
This isn't right.

1047
01:03:40,824 --> 01:03:43,395
How could you do something like this?

1048
01:03:45,065 --> 01:03:46,765
You made me out to be a moron...

1049
01:03:48,165 --> 01:03:50,364
and took advantage of me!

1050
01:03:51,634 --> 01:03:53,004
Did you think...

1051
01:03:54,134 --> 01:03:56,105
there wouldn't be any consequences?

1052
01:04:06,344 --> 01:04:08,654
Mr. Gong, please.

1053
01:04:09,915 --> 01:04:11,484
Please forgive me this once.

1054
01:04:12,054 --> 01:04:13,455
Please let it go this once.

1055
01:04:13,525 --> 01:04:15,154
If you do,

1056
01:04:15,754 --> 01:04:17,054
I'll do anything.

1057
01:04:17,054 --> 01:04:19,725
I'll do anything you want.

1058
01:04:20,265 --> 01:04:21,665
Please let it go...

1059
01:04:22,665 --> 01:04:23,694
this once.

1060
01:04:26,165 --> 01:04:27,165
Mr. Gong, please.

1061
01:04:29,674 --> 01:04:32,444
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1062
01:05:04,674 --> 01:05:06,944
I finally met the man I'm destined for.

1063
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:08,375
My heart is pounding in my chest.

1064
01:05:08,574 --> 01:05:10,114
What if I'm not able to lock eyes with him?

1065
01:05:10,214 --> 01:05:12,884
I'm on my way to Ganghwa Island with my mom for a photo shoot.

1066
01:05:12,915 --> 01:05:14,455
Didn't you say you were free today?

1067
01:05:15,214 --> 01:05:16,554
Mr. Gong, how are you here?

1068
01:05:17,154 --> 01:05:18,355
Didn't you see this?

1069
01:05:18,455 --> 01:05:20,054
They're saying Park Do Ra's mom hasn't paid back her debt.

1070
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:23,324
This is my way of giving you a chance.

1071
01:05:23,355 --> 01:05:25,725
Do Ra, please... Just for tonight.

1072
01:05:26,065 --> 01:05:27,295
Our lives depend on you.

1073
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:29,534
No matter what happens to me,

1074
01:05:29,534 --> 01:05:31,565
will you be by my side?

1075
01:05:31,565 --> 01:05:32,565
Of course.

1076
01:05:32,904 --> 01:05:35,304
I will always be by your side.

1077
01:05:35,404 --> 01:05:36,574
I'm not going anywhere.
