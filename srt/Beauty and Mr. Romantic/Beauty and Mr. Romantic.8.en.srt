1
00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,406
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:08,314 --> 00:00:10,243
And how dare you call me Do Ra?

3
00:00:10,873 --> 00:00:12,983
- Director Hong...
- Do Ra, it's me. I'm Dae Chung.

4
00:00:15,054 --> 00:00:16,054
Dae Chung.

5
00:00:17,313 --> 00:00:18,323
Ko Dae Chung.

6
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:23,454
What did you say?

7
00:00:24,194 --> 00:00:25,194
Who?

8
00:00:26,124 --> 00:00:27,124
Dae Chung?

9
00:00:27,224 --> 00:00:28,363
That's right.

10
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:31,334
I'm Dae Chung
who used to give you bike rides.

11
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:33,503
That being said,

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,733
please cut me some slack this once.

13
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:38,143
Unbelievable.

14
00:00:40,103 --> 00:00:41,773
Who do you think
you're impersonating?

15
00:00:41,773 --> 00:00:43,614
What do you mean? I'm being serious.

16
00:00:44,343 --> 00:00:45,644
A lot of years have passed,

17
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:47,444
and I don't look like I once did,

18
00:00:47,444 --> 00:00:49,353
but I'm Dae Chung.

19
00:00:49,713 --> 00:00:51,353
We went
to an amusement park together,

20
00:00:51,783 --> 00:00:53,684
I gave you bike rides, and also...

21
00:00:53,684 --> 00:00:55,794
I danced to "Sorry Sorry"
in front of you.

22
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:57,194
When bullies hassled you for money,

23
00:00:57,194 --> 00:00:59,124
I came to the rescue
while letting them pull out my hair.

24
00:00:59,124 --> 00:01:00,523
I also treated you to tteokbokki.

25
00:01:00,963 --> 00:01:01,993
Don't you remember that?

26
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:03,563
Take a closer look at me.

27
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,603
It's me. I'm Dae Chung, Do Ra.

28
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:13,903
But you go as Ko Pil Seung.

29
00:01:13,903 --> 00:01:15,513
Why is that your name?

30
00:01:15,513 --> 00:01:16,644
I changed it.

31
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:18,144
My mom went to a seer...

32
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:19,784
and was told that my name
was weighing me down.

33
00:01:19,784 --> 00:01:21,114
She was told
I would do things halfheartedly,

34
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,413
so I changed it
because my mom was adamant.

35
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,554
How can this be?

36
00:01:29,254 --> 00:01:30,894
But why...

37
00:01:32,123 --> 00:01:34,663
Why didn't you tell me
from the start?

38
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,694
Why did you pretend not to know me?

39
00:01:36,894 --> 00:01:38,903
How could I possibly do that...

40
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:41,674
when you're an A-list actress
and I'm an assistant director?

41
00:01:42,304 --> 00:01:44,644
Besides, people knowing
wouldn't do us any good.

42
00:01:44,644 --> 00:01:46,603
I was going to tell you
after we wrapped things up.

43
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,373
Anyway, Do Ra,

44
00:01:49,144 --> 00:01:51,383
please cut me some slack
for old times' sake.

45
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:53,844
It's not because I hated you.

46
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,954
You and Bong Soo
kept butting heads on set.

47
00:01:57,153 --> 00:01:58,724
I didn't want it to interfere
with our filming schedule,

48
00:01:59,254 --> 00:02:01,084
but things went sideways.

49
00:02:02,493 --> 00:02:03,554
That's the truth.

50
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:06,023
Please, Do Ra.

51
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,094
Come on.

52
00:02:08,894 --> 00:02:10,993
- Do Ra...
- Give me a second.

53
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:22,243
You!

54
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:25,213
Why are you back here?

55
00:02:25,484 --> 00:02:27,544
I told you to stay away.

56
00:02:27,544 --> 00:02:29,414
Would you rather see me
lose my mind?

57
00:02:31,213 --> 00:02:33,324
Leave, will you?

58
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:35,354
Ms. Park, don't worry.

59
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:37,253
I'll deal with him...

60
00:02:37,253 --> 00:02:38,993
so that he won't bother you.

61
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:41,123
It's all right, Director Hong.

62
00:02:41,864 --> 00:02:43,433
I'm going
to let it slide this once...

63
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:45,533
for the sake of our show.

64
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,134
What did you just say?

65
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:49,674
Really?

66
00:02:49,674 --> 00:02:50,704
Yes.

67
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:55,514
Mr. Ko promised not to do anything
that despicable again,

68
00:02:55,514 --> 00:02:56,743
so I'm going to let it slide.

69
00:02:57,414 --> 00:02:59,584
I thought from his perspective,

70
00:02:59,584 --> 00:03:01,484
and I guess
I understand his actions.

71
00:03:02,153 --> 00:03:04,414
He has worked hard on this show,
and it didn't seem right...

72
00:03:04,414 --> 00:03:06,384
for him to drop out.

73
00:03:07,183 --> 00:03:09,324
He can stay on board.

74
00:03:09,324 --> 00:03:10,593
Goodness.

75
00:03:10,593 --> 00:03:14,063
Ms. Park,
your kindness is boundless.

76
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:16,693
I appreciate
your understanding of his situation.

77
00:03:16,693 --> 00:03:19,033
Spoken like a true A-list star.

78
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,104
You're the best!

79
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,104
I'll get ready to film
my next scene, then.

80
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:26,873
Of course.

81
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:33,014
Pil Seung, this is great news!

82
00:03:33,644 --> 00:03:36,614
Stop that. Get off me.

83
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:39,084
I was taught
what kind of a person you are,

84
00:03:39,683 --> 00:03:42,294
and I have completely
lost my faith in people.

85
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:45,723
Pil Seung, think about
why I had to do it.

86
00:03:45,723 --> 00:03:47,023
What else could I have done...

87
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:48,364
when she didn't want
to work with you?

88
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,134
I'm sorry.

89
00:03:51,503 --> 00:03:53,533
It was heartbreaking
on my part as well.

90
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,273
I felt like someone had ripped off
one of my arms.

91
00:03:56,473 --> 00:03:58,743
Like someone had ripped off
one of your arms?

92
00:03:59,503 --> 00:04:01,204
Keep lying, why don't you?

93
00:04:01,204 --> 00:04:02,574
I mean it.

94
00:04:02,973 --> 00:04:05,743
By the way, how did you get her
to change her mind?

95
00:04:05,743 --> 00:04:07,514
It didn't seem like
she was going to forgive you.

96
00:04:09,454 --> 00:04:10,514
Jin Gu.

97
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:13,484
I'm Ko Pil Seung, remember?

98
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,424
Those go over there.

99
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:19,264
Monolid eyes...

100
00:04:19,963 --> 00:04:21,093
and curly hair.

101
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:23,563
It's Dae Chung for sure.

102
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:25,433
No way.

103
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:27,104
Talk about it being a small world.

104
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:28,234
Who knew we'd run
into each other like this?

105
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:32,143
If he had told me
he was Dae Chung from the get-go,

106
00:04:32,143 --> 00:04:34,174
I would've cut him more slack.

107
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:37,013
After all, he gave me bike rides...

108
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:38,443
to cheer me up...

109
00:04:39,784 --> 00:04:41,554
and treated me to tteokbokki.

110
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,393
Hey.
You're the kid from the other day?

111
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:14,044
- What did you say?
- I like you, Dae Chung.

112
00:05:16,154 --> 00:05:17,154
Right.

113
00:05:18,154 --> 00:05:20,154
I did the right thing
by telling her I'm Dae Chung.

114
00:05:20,883 --> 00:05:22,823
It didn't feel right
to keep it from her,

115
00:05:23,953 --> 00:05:25,563
and now I feel relieved
to get it off my chest.

116
00:05:31,234 --> 00:05:32,433
Curly-haired Assistant Director,

117
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,304
I'm near the house
Dae Chung used to live.

118
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:37,503
We should talk.

119
00:05:37,573 --> 00:05:39,243
We said everything earlier,

120
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:41,474
so why does she want
to talk some more?

121
00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:43,243
It scares me.

122
00:05:54,123 --> 00:05:55,253
I haven't been back...

123
00:05:55,253 --> 00:05:57,224
in this neighborhood for 15 years.

124
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,964
Nothing seems to have changed.

125
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,833
The corner shop is still here,
so is the dry cleaner's,

126
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,693
and also the tteokbokki place.

127
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:05,604
It brought back
so many childhood memories.

128
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:07,964
Really?

129
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:12,044
Anyway, you said
you had something to say.

130
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,674
What could it be
that had you come all this way?

131
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,143
We could've talked on set tomorrow.

132
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:18,943
It's nothing serious.

133
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:21,114
There are too many people on set,

134
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,784
so we won't get to talk comfortably.

135
00:06:24,513 --> 00:06:27,284
By the way,
how is your family doing?

136
00:06:27,383 --> 00:06:28,993
Is your grandfather doing well?

137
00:06:32,263 --> 00:06:33,524
They're all doing fine,

138
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:36,063
but my grandfather passed away.

139
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:37,763
What?

140
00:06:38,763 --> 00:06:39,763
When?

141
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,304
Around the time
your family moved out.

142
00:06:43,174 --> 00:06:45,304
I guess you didn't know
that he passed away.

143
00:06:46,044 --> 00:06:47,844
No, I didn't.

144
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,443
Of course.
He was already quite old back then.

145
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,183
I remember how nice he was
to my family,

146
00:06:57,654 --> 00:06:59,424
but I didn't know
that he had passed away.

147
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,493
I feel guilty for some reason.

148
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:07,323
Do Ra must not know
that her mother was the reason...

149
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:08,493
he passed away.

150
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,693
By the way,

151
00:07:10,193 --> 00:07:13,433
was there trouble
between our moms...

152
00:07:13,464 --> 00:07:15,373
around the time...

153
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:17,833
our family moved out of your house?

154
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,643
Why would you suddenly ask me that?

155
00:07:22,114 --> 00:07:23,813
One night,

156
00:07:23,813 --> 00:07:26,984
my mom suddenly told us to pack up,

157
00:07:26,984 --> 00:07:29,114
and we left your house in a hurry.

158
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:33,883
I didn't get to properly say goodbye
to you or your family.

159
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,693
Later on,
when I got the part in a TV series,

160
00:07:37,693 --> 00:07:39,464
I went by your house...

161
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:41,524
to tell you I passed the audition
among other things,

162
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:44,893
but your mom
almost bit my head off...

163
00:07:44,893 --> 00:07:46,633
telling me never to come back.

164
00:07:47,703 --> 00:07:49,474
That's why I stayed away
from this neighborhood.

165
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,844
- My mom said that?
- Yes.

166
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:56,044
I see.

167
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,513
So I'm asking just in case.

168
00:08:00,344 --> 00:08:02,214
Did your mom and my mom...

169
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,284
fight over something
and could that be why?

170
00:08:06,683 --> 00:08:08,953
Or did my mom do something bad?

171
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,794
What? Well...

172
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:16,993
It was a thing between the adults,
so I don't know the details.

173
00:08:17,693 --> 00:08:20,464
It was long ago,
and I was young too.

174
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:25,143
But I do think
something bad happened.

175
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:27,404
I see.

176
00:08:28,344 --> 00:08:29,943
It makes sense now.

177
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,083
I'd wondered...

178
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,054
why we'd upped and left
in the middle of the night.

179
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:39,683
Something did happen
that we don't know about.

180
00:08:41,284 --> 00:08:43,924
Let's not tell our families...

181
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,524
that we met each other again.

182
00:08:45,963 --> 00:08:47,524
I don't know what happened,

183
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,333
but why bring up bad memories?

184
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:51,963
Sure. Let's do that.

185
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,203
The tteokbokki's getting cold.
Eat up.

186
00:08:55,374 --> 00:08:56,703
You liked the tteokbokki here.

187
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:00,044
Pil Seung.

188
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:03,244
You remember
I liked the tteokbokki here.

189
00:09:06,343 --> 00:09:07,483
Thanks.

190
00:09:08,483 --> 00:09:10,514
Why thank me? Let's eat.

191
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,723
Okay. Let's eat.

192
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:20,924
How is it?

193
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,863
It tastes just the same.

194
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:25,664
It brings back memories.

195
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,103
How am I to pay it all back?

196
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:34,603
I must sort it out
before Do Ra finds out.

197
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:37,374
How did I end up in this mess?

198
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:40,313
What should I do now?

199
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,613
My head aches.

200
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:44,613
Oh, gosh.

201
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:50,254
Hello, Mr. Gong. How are you?

202
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:52,024
Hello, Mother.

203
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:54,624
"Mother?" Goodness.

204
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:59,804
It's lovely
to hear you call me that.

205
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:03,573
My Do Ra gave you a rough time
when she came home drunk, right?

206
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:06,203
She had so much to drink.

207
00:10:06,203 --> 00:10:09,813
I hope she didn't do anything
to humiliate herself.

208
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,113
No, she didn't.

209
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:14,813
She's so cute when drunk.

210
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:18,554
Thanks to you, we had a great time.

211
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:20,284
Oh, did you?

212
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:23,453
That's so good to hear.

213
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,164
What does Do Ra say about me?

214
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:30,764
Right.

215
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,764
She says you're such a gentleman,

216
00:10:33,764 --> 00:10:36,034
and you have a great sense of humor.

217
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:37,933
You have a good sense of fashion,

218
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:39,703
and you're very cool.

219
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:42,443
Did Do Ra really say that?

220
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:46,083
Yes, she did. This time,
I didn't add anything to the list.

221
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,244
It's for real.

222
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,683
Thank you. I owe it all to you.

223
00:10:50,254 --> 00:10:53,054
I'd like to invite you and Do Ra...

224
00:10:53,054 --> 00:10:55,353
to a musical my company invested in.

225
00:10:55,794 --> 00:10:57,054
And have dinner too.

226
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,264
Are you free today?

227
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:02,894
I called you before calling Do Ra.

228
00:11:02,894 --> 00:11:06,504
Well, I am free, of course,

229
00:11:06,563 --> 00:11:08,103
but why include me?

230
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,703
Little old me would only be...

231
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,274
a speck of pepper
between your teeth.

232
00:11:12,644 --> 00:11:15,544
I think Do Ra will feel
a bit too much pressure...

233
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:18,374
if I ask to meet her
without anyone else.

234
00:11:19,284 --> 00:11:21,514
If I hit on her and she rejects me,

235
00:11:21,953 --> 00:11:23,483
will you take the blame?

236
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,483
Oh, gosh.

237
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,884
Mr. Gong.

238
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:29,894
Yes, I'll take the blame.

239
00:11:31,494 --> 00:11:35,894
Then Mr. Gong. Do as I say.

240
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:38,494
What should I do?

241
00:11:39,703 --> 00:11:41,034
This evening?

242
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:42,804
Well,

243
00:11:43,174 --> 00:11:45,374
I do have the day off.

244
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:48,174
- Who are you talking to?
- Mr. Gong.

245
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,443
I see.

246
00:11:50,113 --> 00:11:51,174
Yes.

247
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:53,983
With my mom?

248
00:11:55,353 --> 00:11:56,983
Okay, well...

249
00:11:57,953 --> 00:11:59,124
Just a moment.

250
00:12:00,323 --> 00:12:02,424
Mom. Mr. Gong wants to invite...

251
00:12:02,424 --> 00:12:05,264
you and me to a musical.
What do I say?

252
00:12:05,394 --> 00:12:06,863
He wants to have dinner too after.

253
00:12:07,264 --> 00:12:09,034
Say yes, of course.

254
00:12:09,034 --> 00:12:11,433
You don't have any other plans.

255
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,504
It would be nice to watch a musical.
It has been a while.

256
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:16,174
Come on, say yes.

257
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,004
Okay.

258
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:20,703
Let's do it, Mr. Gong.

259
00:12:20,703 --> 00:12:22,414
My mom's up for it too.

260
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:24,443
Thanks so much for the invitation.

261
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,784
What? You'll pick us up?

262
00:12:27,983 --> 00:12:30,353
No, you don't have to.

263
00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:34,583
Well, okay, then.

264
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:36,424
Sure.

265
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:39,063
I'll see you later.

266
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,164
Did he say he'll come get us?

267
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:44,733
Yes.

268
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,433
He said he should
since he invited an elder.

269
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:52,044
I'd prefer to go without him.

270
00:12:53,843 --> 00:12:56,213
Mr. Gong knows
how to care for his elders.

271
00:12:56,473 --> 00:12:58,884
That's why they say
it shows when someone...

272
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:00,784
grows up in a rich family
and is taught well.

273
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:04,654
Mr. Gong's such a gentleman,

274
00:13:04,654 --> 00:13:07,884
he's handsome, tall,
and has a great sense of fashion.

275
00:13:07,884 --> 00:13:10,593
The man is luxury itself.

276
00:13:11,294 --> 00:13:13,494
He's just my type.

277
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:17,333
Mom. Don't start getting ideas.

278
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,603
He helped with the casting,

279
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:22,203
and I'm grateful
for all the support he gave me,

280
00:13:22,203 --> 00:13:24,703
so I'm only going to see him
because I'd feel better...

281
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:25,804
if I were to treat him.

282
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:29,113
So don't you tag along...

283
00:13:29,113 --> 00:13:31,174
and go overboard
and say stuff, okay?

284
00:13:31,514 --> 00:13:33,284
Okay.

285
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:36,683
I'm off to shower.

286
00:13:39,154 --> 00:13:41,524
- Oh, gosh.
- Yes.

287
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:54,863
- The place is empty.
- What now?

288
00:13:55,504 --> 00:13:56,534
No.

289
00:13:58,774 --> 00:14:00,843
My friend Myung Soo
wouldn't do that.

290
00:14:03,014 --> 00:14:04,073
Hyun Chul.

291
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,483
Hey.

292
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:09,554
Young Hoon.
This is Myung Soo's office.

293
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:11,483
Why is it like this?

294
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:12,953
What happened?

295
00:14:13,223 --> 00:14:15,024
Hyun Chul. Did you...

296
00:14:15,994 --> 00:14:17,353
invest as well?

297
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:21,093
I put in 100,000 dollars.
How much did you invest?

298
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,593
The amount doesn't matter.

299
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:26,933
This isn't right.

300
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:30,004
There's no way
our friend would con us.

301
00:14:30,004 --> 00:14:31,473
Who's our friend?

302
00:14:32,244 --> 00:14:35,044
He took our money
and went to the Philippines.

303
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:37,073
Gosh...

304
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:38,544
What...

305
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:41,014
What do you mean?

306
00:14:41,784 --> 00:14:44,914
He deposited the dividend
just a few days ago.

307
00:14:45,213 --> 00:14:48,853
That was all part of the bait
to earn him time...

308
00:14:48,953 --> 00:14:51,294
to leave the country
before we caught on.

309
00:14:51,754 --> 00:14:53,024
My gosh...

310
00:14:53,723 --> 00:14:55,994
What am I to do?

311
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:24,593
(My beloved Geum Ja)

312
00:15:32,463 --> 00:15:34,703
Hyun Chul.

313
00:15:34,703 --> 00:15:36,774
Hyun Chul.

314
00:15:36,774 --> 00:15:38,473
No, Hyun Chul.

315
00:15:38,473 --> 00:15:41,504
No, Hyun Chul! Don't do it!

316
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:44,813
No. You can't do it, Hyun Chul.

317
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:47,884
What are you doing here?

318
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:52,254
Were you going to kill yourself...

319
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:54,924
without me knowing?

320
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,524
No, Mom.

321
00:15:58,353 --> 00:16:00,063
Okay, good.

322
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:03,394
My son wouldn't do that.

323
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:08,603
You'd never die
leaving me all alone, would you?

324
00:16:09,573 --> 00:16:11,004
- Mom.
- Yes?

325
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,404
I really did want to die.

326
00:16:13,744 --> 00:16:15,044
I don't want to live.

327
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:18,213
I was hoping
to make things work this time.

328
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,644
Why am I like this?

329
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:22,914
That money meant so much.

330
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:24,914
It meant so much.

331
00:16:32,563 --> 00:16:33,693
Hyun Chul.

332
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:38,233
Sun Young doesn't know
about the money.

333
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,563
No one does.

334
00:16:41,063 --> 00:16:42,833
No one could ever know.

335
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,603
Yes.

336
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,374
The money never existed.

337
00:16:47,843 --> 00:16:51,544
So you were never conned.

338
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,144
Hyun Chul.

339
00:16:56,654 --> 00:16:57,884
Don't say things like...

340
00:16:59,024 --> 00:17:01,284
you don't want to live,
and that you want to die.

341
00:17:03,124 --> 00:17:04,424
Why would you die...

342
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:07,563
when nothing at all happened?

343
00:17:08,664 --> 00:17:09,693
Mom.

344
00:17:09,994 --> 00:17:13,403
Yes. It's okay. It's fine.

345
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,403
You can do anything.

346
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:19,704
You can get back up.

347
00:17:20,143 --> 00:17:23,014
I can vouch for you.
Okay, Hyun Chul?

348
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,014
- Hyun Chul...
- Mom.

349
00:17:39,994 --> 00:17:41,063
Come in.

350
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:43,994
- Auntie.
- Hey.

351
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:47,934
Sit down.

352
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:49,534
Okay.

353
00:17:53,804 --> 00:17:54,873
So...

354
00:17:55,643 --> 00:17:57,014
did you give it some thought?

355
00:17:57,813 --> 00:17:58,873
About what?

356
00:17:58,873 --> 00:18:00,744
Come on.

357
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:02,613
Are you playing dumb again?

358
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:04,514
After what I've told you?

359
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,823
I know it's not an easy thing to do.

360
00:18:11,653 --> 00:18:13,163
But...

361
00:18:13,163 --> 00:18:15,633
this is for the future
of our family and company.

362
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,063
As Jin Taek's wife,

363
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:20,863
you should step up and find a way
to get him a son.

364
00:18:22,373 --> 00:18:24,073
I'll be here to help you.

365
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:30,214
Auntie, Jin Taek is
in his sixties now.

366
00:18:30,214 --> 00:18:32,784
How would he get a son?
Why are you being like this?

367
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:36,583
What's wrong with his age?
He's still in his prime.

368
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:39,724
That's why I'm telling you
to find a way.

369
00:18:39,724 --> 00:18:42,454
You can find Jin Taek a woman
or hire a surrogate mother.

370
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,294
Gosh, Auntie.

371
00:18:44,294 --> 00:18:46,524
That's enough. Please stop it now.

372
00:18:46,524 --> 00:18:50,163
Stop what? Do you hold grudges
against our family or what?

373
00:18:50,893 --> 00:18:53,663
Do you want to ruin our family?

374
00:18:53,663 --> 00:18:56,034
How could you say such a thing?

375
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:58,274
If that's not the case,
why are you being like this?

376
00:18:58,774 --> 00:19:00,643
I'm not even asking you
to give birth.

377
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:04,573
What is it you did for our family?

378
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:08,343
All you did was have a girl.
And you know how she ended up.

379
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:12,383
What makes you so high and mighty?

380
00:19:14,883 --> 00:19:15,893
Auntie.

381
00:19:16,794 --> 00:19:19,294
I can put up with anything else,

382
00:19:20,163 --> 00:19:23,034
but I don't want you to say
things like that about Ma Ri.

383
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:24,163
Please.

384
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,063
My gosh. Are you crying?

385
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:31,704
I'm the one that should be crying.

386
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:34,704
Do you not have a conscience?

387
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:37,974
If I were you, I would've
already left this house...

388
00:19:37,974 --> 00:19:39,643
for the sake of our family.

389
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:45,254
My goodness.

390
00:19:46,323 --> 00:19:47,724
Gosh, you startled me.

391
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,653
Why do you always
sneak up like that?

392
00:19:56,893 --> 00:19:59,333
That surly brat.

393
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,304
By the way,
Dae Sook is going too far.

394
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:05,704
It's not like we're living
in the Joseon Dynasty.

395
00:20:06,103 --> 00:20:07,843
And they have my Jin Dan.

396
00:20:08,244 --> 00:20:10,974
Jin Dan can take over the company
if things don't work out.

397
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,613
Jin Taek is just too old
to get a son.

398
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:19,184
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

399
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:26,224
Ma Ri, what's up?

400
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,833
Just calm yourself down
and speak slowly.

401
00:20:33,764 --> 00:20:34,764
What?

402
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,103
Auntie did?

403
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:42,863
My gosh.

404
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:47,010
Why are you home
at this time of the day?

405
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,950
Auntie, we need to talk.

406
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:51,321
Honey.

407
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,321
Gosh.

408
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:54,920
That was quick.

409
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,791
Did you tell Jin Taek already?

410
00:20:56,791 --> 00:21:00,091
It wasn't her. Ma Ri called me
and told me what happened.

411
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:01,760
What is going on here?

412
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,031
A surrogate mother? A son?

413
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,141
Is it true
that you said such things to her?

414
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,170
Yes, I did. Is it wrong?

415
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,071
I'm willing to do such a thing...

416
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,440
if it's to protect
our family and company.

417
00:21:15,781 --> 00:21:17,980
Auntie, why are you being like this?

418
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,111
I think I've made myself clear.

419
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,851
But how could you say such a thing?

420
00:21:22,851 --> 00:21:24,990
Are you saying
you will have your son-in-law...

421
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,660
take over the company
when Ma Ri gets married?

422
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,230
Do you seriously mean that?

423
00:21:31,831 --> 00:21:34,000
You never know what kind of jerk
your son-in-law would be.

424
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:35,361
Auntie.

425
00:21:36,101 --> 00:21:38,700
You know APP Group isn't
your own company.

426
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,841
My father, my brother, and I
worked hard to grow the company.

427
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:43,470
You can't just have it
your own way like that.

428
00:21:46,111 --> 00:21:48,311
Do you really think
I'm wrong about all this?

429
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,781
It's not something you can't do
for the sake of our family.

430
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:54,121
Auntie.

431
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:56,581
I'm telling you again.

432
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,220
Ma Ri is my only child.

433
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,521
And she is getting better.

434
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,321
I can make this work.

435
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:05,490
So please don't say
anything like that ever again.

436
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,230
Pull yourself together!
How are you going to make it work?

437
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:11,831
And Ma Ri has a mental age of 12.

438
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,900
There's no way
she can find a decent husband.

439
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,371
Only black-hearted jerks
will want to marry her for money.

440
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,371
Auntie!

441
00:22:20,371 --> 00:22:22,641
- I said I wasn't a fool!
- What?

442
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,650
Dad said I wasn't a fool.

443
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,821
What makes you say
I'm a fool, Great Auntie?

444
00:22:28,821 --> 00:22:31,621
Do you like it
when I call you a fool?

445
00:22:32,521 --> 00:22:34,861
You're an old fossil, Great Auntie.

446
00:22:34,861 --> 00:22:36,490
A self-centered old fossil.

447
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,190
You just think whatever you want
and get your own way.

448
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,400
And you're not even
part of our family.

449
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,101
Why are you telling us what to do?

450
00:22:45,101 --> 00:22:46,200
Ma Ri.

451
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,801
What? I have a right to say
what I want to say.

452
00:22:50,841 --> 00:22:52,240
Great Auntie.

453
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,740
Just to be clear,

454
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,180
a surrogate mother is illegal
in this country.

455
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:00,150
So I don't want you to say...

456
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,980
anything like that to my mom again.

457
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,051
If you do,

458
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,190
I will call the police!

459
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,990
My goodness.

460
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,791
- Auntie.
- Auntie.

461
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:10,791
- Auntie.
- Auntie.

462
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:12,561
- Auntie.
- My gosh.

463
00:23:12,561 --> 00:23:14,331
Get up, Auntie.

464
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,500
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

465
00:23:18,801 --> 00:23:20,101
It's killing me.

466
00:23:20,101 --> 00:23:23,271
Mom, what's wrong?
Do you have a stomachache?

467
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:24,970
Yes. I think I have
an upset stomach.

468
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,740
I have diarrhea and vomiting.

469
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:28,881
What did you eat?

470
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,410
I don't know. I guess something was
wrong with the lunch I had.

471
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,581
I've had diarrhea all day.

472
00:23:32,581 --> 00:23:34,720
I had to keep going to the bathroom.

473
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,321
Gosh, it hurts.

474
00:23:36,321 --> 00:23:38,051
Well... Do Ra.

475
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:40,121
I don't think I can make it.

476
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:43,021
You should go
and watch the musical with Mr. Gong.

477
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,291
- Gosh.
- What?

478
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,260
Do you want me to go alone?

479
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,900
No, I don't want to.
How can I go by myself?

480
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,700
Gosh, it really hurts.

481
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,071
My stomach is killing me.

482
00:23:54,071 --> 00:23:55,541
- Well...
- My gosh.

483
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,000
What on earth did you eat?

484
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,311
I don't know.

485
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,160
How can she be so beautiful?

486
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,861
This scene isn't even that sad.

487
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,871
How can she be so sensitive
and innocent?

488
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:29,470
Is that why she's an actress?

489
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,371
I order food for dinner.

490
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:35,180
- For breakfast...
- For breakfast...

491
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,811
You can meet her in the morning.

492
00:24:37,381 --> 00:24:38,381
I can meet her again.

493
00:24:38,381 --> 00:24:40,281
- That's right.
- Early in the morning.

494
00:24:42,551 --> 00:24:44,750
In a foreign movie...

495
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,591
Do Ra, you're home.

496
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,091
How was it? What did you do today?

497
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,230
You know what I did.
I watched the musical.

498
00:24:52,861 --> 00:24:54,831
Are you feeling better now?

499
00:24:55,101 --> 00:24:56,131
Yes.

500
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,670
I took some pills,
and I got a lot better.

501
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,631
It was really bad earlier today.

502
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,871
I guess you enjoyed
the date with Mr. Gong.

503
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:07,710
What are you talking about?
It wasn't a date.

504
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,510
I had to go by myself...

505
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,180
because you got an upset stomach.
It was really uncomfortable.

506
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,650
When we were alone in the car,
I had nothing to say.

507
00:25:16,021 --> 00:25:18,690
And I didn't want people
to get the wrong idea.

508
00:25:19,091 --> 00:25:20,650
We got there too early,

509
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,091
so we took a walk around the park,
but it suddenly started raining.

510
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,861
It rained? So?

511
00:25:25,861 --> 00:25:28,400
I said it was okay,

512
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,831
but Mr. Gong took off his jacket
and covered me with it.

513
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:32,871
It was really uncomfortable.

514
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,900
I don't know. I had too many things
to worry about.

515
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,841
I'm tired,
and my shoulders are tense.

516
00:25:38,341 --> 00:25:39,541
My gosh.

517
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,680
Mr. Gong sounds like a man.

518
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,581
That's so romantic.

519
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:47,851
Isn't it that
Mr. Gong is interested in you?

520
00:25:47,851 --> 00:25:50,680
Hey, you should go out with him.

521
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,160
Mom, don't try to set me up
with some random guy.

522
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,490
Mr. Gong isn't a random guy.
He's a son of a rich family.

523
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,291
You can't find a man like him.

524
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:01,031
I can't go out with him
just because he's from a rich family.

525
00:26:01,031 --> 00:26:02,400
What is it I don't have?

526
00:26:03,611 --> 00:26:06,381
Dating a son from a rich family
isn't trendy these days.

527
00:26:07,422 --> 00:26:09,292
Mr. Gong is known to be a womanizer.

528
00:26:09,692 --> 00:26:12,262
What? Mr. Gong is a womanizer?

529
00:26:12,262 --> 00:26:14,861
Yes. No matter how rich he is,

530
00:26:14,861 --> 00:26:16,962
I will never go out
with a womanizer.

531
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,631
Hey, who says
Mr. Gong is a womanizer?

532
00:26:19,631 --> 00:26:22,631
How can he be a womanizer
when he's so gentle?

533
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:26,442
I should teach those who spread
false rumors like that a lesson.

534
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:30,911
Mom, are you Mr. Gong's mom or what?

535
00:26:31,012 --> 00:26:32,141
Why are you being like this?

536
00:26:32,182 --> 00:26:35,911
Mr. Gong is just outstanding,
so women are interested in him.

537
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:37,752
It's not his fault
that he stands out.

538
00:26:37,881 --> 00:26:39,522
Gosh, what are you talking about?

539
00:26:41,192 --> 00:26:42,651
Seriously...

540
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:46,161
Who is spreading
such ridiculous rumors?

541
00:26:52,631 --> 00:26:53,762
Gosh, Mother.

542
00:26:55,101 --> 00:26:58,101
Did you enjoy the musical
with Do Ra today?

543
00:26:58,101 --> 00:27:00,901
Yes, I had a great time
thanks to you.

544
00:27:02,772 --> 00:27:05,081
By the way, what did Do Ra say?

545
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:08,012
She said she enjoyed the musical...

546
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:10,581
and that you took off
your jacket for her...

547
00:27:10,811 --> 00:27:13,722
when it suddenly rained at the park.

548
00:27:13,851 --> 00:27:16,692
She called you a romantic.

549
00:27:17,621 --> 00:27:19,591
Did Ms. Park really say that?

550
00:27:20,762 --> 00:27:24,601
Yes, and she also said
you were adorable.

551
00:27:26,262 --> 00:27:29,002
Really? Did she say I was adorable?

552
00:27:29,371 --> 00:27:30,472
Did Ms. Park say that?

553
00:27:31,472 --> 00:27:32,601
Absolutely.

554
00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:35,611
And I say this out of experience.

555
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:37,442
Women don't say...

556
00:27:37,442 --> 00:27:39,942
that just about anyone is adorable.

557
00:27:41,051 --> 00:27:42,911
Gosh, it's an honor.

558
00:27:43,482 --> 00:27:45,651
I can't believe
she called me adorable.

559
00:27:45,782 --> 00:27:47,422
Mother, thank you.

560
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:49,391
I owe you for today.

561
00:27:50,321 --> 00:27:53,391
Sure, Mother.
I wish you a pleasant night too.

562
00:27:54,262 --> 00:27:55,262
Got it.

563
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:10,341
Gosh, I'm so sorry about this.

564
00:28:16,952 --> 00:28:19,722
Isn't it a done deal
when a woman sees you...

565
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:22,222
as adorable?

566
00:28:39,502 --> 00:28:40,542
Hey, Kim!

567
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:43,672
Can you sort out those slabs?

568
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:44,782
Sure.

569
00:28:55,222 --> 00:28:56,252
What are you up to?

570
00:28:57,591 --> 00:29:00,661
Pil Seung is filming
at a location far away today.

571
00:29:00,861 --> 00:29:01,861
I see.

572
00:29:02,432 --> 00:29:05,401
You didn't even see your husband out
when he left for work,

573
00:29:06,502 --> 00:29:08,331
but look at you making gimbap
for your son.

574
00:29:09,002 --> 00:29:10,831
Did he leave for work?

575
00:29:11,301 --> 00:29:13,101
I woke up and he was already gone.

576
00:29:13,242 --> 00:29:16,012
I thought he went out to exercise.

577
00:29:16,341 --> 00:29:18,111
Your husband left for work
at the crack of dawn!

578
00:29:19,182 --> 00:29:20,282
I'm heading out.

579
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,351
Gosh. Pil Seung, wait.

580
00:29:28,492 --> 00:29:31,361
Take your lunch with you.
I made gimbap.

581
00:29:31,962 --> 00:29:34,361
Mom, you didn't have
to go through all that trouble.

582
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:37,161
- Here.
- I'll enjoy it.

583
00:29:37,161 --> 00:29:38,502
- Sure.
- Thanks for this.

584
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:42,232
Don't tell me
you're still letting Do Ra...

585
00:29:42,232 --> 00:29:43,732
treat you like dirt.

586
00:29:44,672 --> 00:29:47,341
Of course not. I'm doing fine.

587
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:51,942
Anyway, if Do Ra
gives you a hard time again,

588
00:29:52,111 --> 00:29:54,551
do as I say.

589
00:29:54,911 --> 00:29:56,911
Don't let her get the best of you.

590
00:29:57,551 --> 00:29:59,682
- Got it. I'll get going, then.
- Sure.

591
00:30:00,081 --> 00:30:01,992
Beware of cars and women.

592
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:04,962
You!

593
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:09,831
How can you be this cold?

594
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,962
You have nothing but love for
the son you didn't give birth to,

595
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:16,331
but you couldn't care less
about your own husband.

596
00:30:16,502 --> 00:30:17,801
Mother, please.

597
00:30:17,801 --> 00:30:20,801
How could you say
something like that?

598
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:22,371
A son I didn't give birth to?

599
00:30:22,371 --> 00:30:25,512
Why? What?
I spoke the truth, didn't I?

600
00:30:25,881 --> 00:30:26,942
You...

601
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:30,012
I wouldn't be this way
if you were half as nice...

602
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:31,821
No, if only you gave him...

603
00:30:31,821 --> 00:30:33,452
a quarter of the love
you have for that boy.

604
00:30:34,022 --> 00:30:37,252
Mother, Pil Seung's my son.

605
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:39,962
Why would you say otherwise
every now and again?

606
00:30:41,692 --> 00:30:43,331
Say that once again,

607
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:46,401
and I'll choose
not to live with you.

608
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:48,772
Fine. So be it.

609
00:30:49,172 --> 00:30:51,472
I can't live with you either!

610
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:53,772
I can't stand you either.

611
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:56,942
Fine. Kick me out, why don't you?

612
00:30:58,242 --> 00:30:59,311
Gosh.

613
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:01,682
Goodness.

614
00:31:02,351 --> 00:31:04,151
My poor boy.

615
00:31:04,551 --> 00:31:06,952
Poor wretched me.

616
00:31:07,222 --> 00:31:10,051
My gosh.

617
00:31:10,992 --> 00:31:12,022
Goodness me.

618
00:31:13,492 --> 00:31:15,631
It's a gift for the filming crew.

619
00:31:15,932 --> 00:31:17,901
Please pick out items
the younger generation would like.

620
00:31:18,101 --> 00:31:20,061
Well... Oh, right.

621
00:31:21,331 --> 00:31:23,071
How about this one?

622
00:31:23,301 --> 00:31:26,071
It's a favored item
among youngsters.

623
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:31,212
This is nice.

624
00:31:35,752 --> 00:31:38,222
Gosh, how touching is this?

625
00:31:38,851 --> 00:31:40,722
Mr. Gong, thank you so much.

626
00:31:40,722 --> 00:31:42,022
We'll work even harder.

627
00:31:42,492 --> 00:31:44,192
I know you've been working hard
on the show.

628
00:31:44,492 --> 00:31:46,591
This is me showing my support.

629
00:31:48,561 --> 00:31:49,561
Go, team.

630
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:52,462
Mr. Gong, you're the best.

631
00:31:52,462 --> 00:31:53,532
I'm the best.

632
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,472
I love this color.

633
00:31:56,732 --> 00:31:58,242
Come and get your jackets!

634
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:02,641
- I'm loving this color.
- Me too.

635
00:32:03,012 --> 00:32:04,782
I know we're here to work,

636
00:32:04,782 --> 00:32:06,542
but it sure is nice
to be on an uninhabited island.

637
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:09,012
Tell me about it.
It feels refreshing.

638
00:32:09,712 --> 00:32:11,212
Even the air is different.

639
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:19,962
- Dae Chung.
- What the...

640
00:32:20,492 --> 00:32:21,532
What's up?

641
00:32:22,061 --> 00:32:24,801
Do Ra, what if someone hears you?

642
00:32:25,462 --> 00:32:27,502
We agreed not to say anything
while on set.

643
00:32:27,901 --> 00:32:29,772
There's no need to be startled.

644
00:32:29,901 --> 00:32:32,141
I approached you
after seeing you were alone.

645
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:34,611
Filming will soon begin!

646
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:36,911
We need to get this in one take.

647
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:39,982
A wind wave warning has been issued
for this afternoon,

648
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,411
so let's wrap this up quickly
and get going.

649
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:43,611
Ms. Park, please get ready.

650
00:32:43,651 --> 00:32:45,321
Sure thing, Director Hong.

651
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:47,282
I'll catch you later.

652
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,952
- Hey, watch your step.
- Sure.

653
00:33:05,772 --> 00:33:06,841
Darling!

654
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:12,841
How are you here?

655
00:33:12,841 --> 00:33:15,881
You lied to me
about there being another woman,

656
00:33:16,752 --> 00:33:19,252
but in fact,
you came to this island to die.

657
00:33:19,851 --> 00:33:20,922
Leave.

658
00:33:23,051 --> 00:33:24,422
Leave me.

659
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:28,232
Leave me while I let you.

660
00:33:29,032 --> 00:33:30,091
No.

661
00:33:31,432 --> 00:33:33,631
I won't let you
go through this alone.

662
00:33:35,502 --> 00:33:37,901
I won't leave without you.

663
00:33:39,141 --> 00:33:41,242
I'll head straight for you instead.

664
00:33:53,051 --> 00:33:54,252
Cut, okay. Nice!

665
00:33:56,922 --> 00:33:58,161
Good job, everyone.

666
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,522
- Good job.
- Good job.

667
00:34:00,692 --> 00:34:01,732
All right.

668
00:34:01,932 --> 00:34:04,532
A wind wave warning has been issued,
and we must pack up for the day.

669
00:34:04,901 --> 00:34:06,631
- Pack up your things.
- Thanks.

670
00:34:06,631 --> 00:34:08,401
- Gosh, it's cold.
- To the dock, everyone!

671
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:09,972
- Sure.
- We should get going.

672
00:34:09,972 --> 00:34:11,571
- The wind is getting stronger.
- Let's hurry.

673
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:13,571
Gosh, it's cold.

674
00:34:14,401 --> 00:34:16,742
- Hurry up, everyone.
- Hurry.

675
00:34:17,672 --> 00:34:19,081
Do Ra, take this
and get on the boat.

676
00:34:19,081 --> 00:34:20,311
I'll give them a hand.

677
00:34:20,311 --> 00:34:21,612
Sure thing.

678
00:34:23,252 --> 00:34:24,581
Come on.

679
00:34:25,081 --> 00:34:27,351
All right. Let's get going.

680
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:31,822
Wait. My backpack.

681
00:34:34,522 --> 00:34:36,161
I must've left it back there.

682
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:40,061
I'm going to get the backpack
that I left where we filmed earlier.

683
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,201
Sure.

684
00:34:44,942 --> 00:34:45,942
This as well.

685
00:34:50,411 --> 00:34:52,141
- What?
- Come on.

686
00:34:53,181 --> 00:34:54,212
Wait.

687
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:56,552
My phone.

688
00:34:58,382 --> 00:34:59,581
Move!

689
00:35:00,752 --> 00:35:01,792
Darn it.

690
00:35:02,192 --> 00:35:04,621
I must've forgotten about it
after taking photos earlier.

691
00:35:05,491 --> 00:35:06,721
Darn it.

692
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:09,031
Hurry up already.

693
00:35:12,232 --> 00:35:13,362
Where is it?

694
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:15,172
I know it was here somewhere.

695
00:35:17,002 --> 00:35:18,442
Hey, there it is.

696
00:35:29,351 --> 00:35:31,951
This is where I last took photos.

697
00:35:32,851 --> 00:35:34,022
Where on earth is it?

698
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:40,792
What?

699
00:35:41,962 --> 00:35:43,031
What the...

700
00:35:44,491 --> 00:35:45,561
Isn't that our boat?

701
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:47,732
What...

702
00:35:48,002 --> 00:35:49,502
No, you can't leave.

703
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:52,402
Hey! Over here.

704
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,811
I'm not on the boat.

705
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:56,471
Jae Dong!

706
00:35:56,811 --> 00:35:58,641
Lee Jae Dong!

707
00:35:59,112 --> 00:36:00,681
- You can't leave.
- No!

708
00:36:00,681 --> 00:36:03,752
- What the... Who...
- Stop!

709
00:36:03,752 --> 00:36:06,281
Jin Gu, stop!

710
00:36:06,281 --> 00:36:07,322
Dae Chung?

711
00:36:08,391 --> 00:36:10,322
Do Ra, why are you here?

712
00:36:10,422 --> 00:36:11,721
Did you also miss the boat?

713
00:36:12,592 --> 00:36:14,761
I'll explain that later.

714
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:16,331
- Just call someone for now.
- Right.

715
00:36:20,132 --> 00:36:21,161
What?

716
00:36:22,232 --> 00:36:23,632
Do Ra, my phone's dead.

717
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:26,371
You make the call.
Call Jae Dong right now.

718
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:28,741
I lost my phone, Dae Chung.

719
00:36:28,741 --> 00:36:31,542
I got off the boat
to find it out here.

720
00:36:31,641 --> 00:36:33,842
What? You've got to be kidding me.

721
00:36:34,281 --> 00:36:36,152
Where did you misplace your phone?

722
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,152
What?

723
00:36:37,681 --> 00:36:39,963
- Where...
- Think, darn it!

724
00:36:39,987 --> 00:36:40,719
Park Do Ra.

725
00:36:40,743 --> 00:36:43,244
- Yes?
- Are you sure? Is this the place?

726
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:45,069
Yes, I'm sure.

727
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:46,178
Or maybe this isn't the place.

728
00:36:46,509 --> 00:36:48,879
How can you not know
if this is where you lost it?

729
00:36:48,879 --> 00:36:50,379
Stop yelling at me.

730
00:36:50,379 --> 00:36:53,319
Your constant yelling
is only making me draw a blank.

731
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:56,589
Well, I'm not angry with you
or anything.

732
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,219
I just want you to think hard
about where you left your phone.

733
00:37:00,158 --> 00:37:02,018
This seems like the place.

734
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,529
Where on earth is my phone?

735
00:37:06,529 --> 00:37:08,899
Do Ra, it's here!

736
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:11,069
- Look.
- Hand it over.

737
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:14,669
Jae Dong!

738
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:17,768
Do Ra, why can't I see you?

739
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:21,279
Jae Dong, I didn't get on the boat.

740
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:23,209
I'm still on that island.

741
00:37:23,209 --> 00:37:24,379
Darn.

742
00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:26,618
You got on the boat earlier,

743
00:37:26,618 --> 00:37:28,348
so how are you still on the island?

744
00:37:28,348 --> 00:37:30,448
I got off to look for my phone.

745
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:33,689
Anyway, tell them
to turn the boat around.

746
00:37:34,158 --> 00:37:37,158
Darn. Just a second, Do Ra.

747
00:37:39,158 --> 00:37:41,698
Ms. Park, what on earth happened?

748
00:37:41,698 --> 00:37:43,799
I'll explain everything later.

749
00:37:43,799 --> 00:37:45,868
Just turn the boat around
this instant.

750
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:48,899
They can't
due to the wind wave warning.

751
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,439
What did you just say?

752
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:53,138
What are we supposed to do, then?

753
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:56,149
Ms. Park, please calm down
for a moment.

754
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:59,748
What do you mean "we?"
Is someone there with you?

755
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:03,589
I'm with
Assistant Director Ko Pil Seung.

756
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:05,118
Let me.

757
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:06,589
Director, just a second.

758
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,759
Jin Gu, what's with
all the questions?

759
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:11,359
Turn the boat around this instant.

760
00:38:11,788 --> 00:38:13,859
Pil Seung, we can't
turn the boat around.

761
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:15,969
It's too dangerous
with the wind wave warning.

762
00:38:15,969 --> 00:38:17,698
The waves are crashing at the boat.

763
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:19,698
What are we supposed to do, then?

764
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:21,339
We'll come for you...

765
00:38:21,339 --> 00:38:22,609
once the weather clears
tomorrow morning.

766
00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:25,268
So hang in there until then.

767
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:26,339
What?

768
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:27,408
Pil Seung,

769
00:38:27,408 --> 00:38:30,509
it's a relief
that you're with Ms. Park.

770
00:38:30,948 --> 00:38:34,379
She would've been scared
to be on the island all by herself.

771
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:37,049
Take good care of her. Got it?

772
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:38,089
I'm hanging up.

773
00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:40,259
I got it for now.

774
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:46,158
Dae Chung, what are we going to do?

775
00:38:49,129 --> 00:38:50,998
Do Ra, let's get out of the rain.

776
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:52,598
- You'll catch a cold.
- What?

777
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:07,719
Why are you home so early?

778
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,748
I thought you went out on a date.

779
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:12,788
Is something up, Mom?

780
00:39:13,388 --> 00:39:15,959
Recently, you've
mostly been on cloud nine.

781
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:17,759
What could be up?

782
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,498
It's old age, I suppose.

783
00:39:22,669 --> 00:39:25,399
Anyway, why are you home so early?

784
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:27,569
Didn't you go out on a date?

785
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:30,538
No, I went to a cafe to work.

786
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:35,678
How are things going with that guy?

787
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:39,518
Why haven't I heard
about any of your dates?

788
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:43,719
Well, that's...

789
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,888
Come on. Just get out there.

790
00:39:45,888 --> 00:39:48,118
Go out and spend time with him.

791
00:39:48,118 --> 00:39:50,058
And stop this nonsense...

792
00:39:50,058 --> 00:39:51,959
about writing screenplays
for a living.

793
00:39:53,899 --> 00:39:56,169
By the way, Myung Dong,

794
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:59,228
he said he'd give back the ring...

795
00:39:59,228 --> 00:40:00,998
after he had it set for you again.

796
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:03,268
Did you still not receive it?

797
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,178
Mom.

798
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:09,879
I broke up with that guy.

799
00:40:09,879 --> 00:40:11,109
Just know that.

800
00:40:11,448 --> 00:40:14,649
What... What was that?
You broke up with him?

801
00:40:14,649 --> 00:40:15,649
Why?

802
00:40:16,018 --> 00:40:17,319
As if you must ask.

803
00:40:18,018 --> 00:40:19,419
He's short, ugly,

804
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:20,788
and isn't that nice.

805
00:40:20,788 --> 00:40:22,419
He turned out to be a jerk,

806
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:23,428
so I dumped him.

807
00:40:23,428 --> 00:40:25,629
What was that?

808
00:40:25,629 --> 00:40:27,399
You dumped him?

809
00:40:27,899 --> 00:40:31,529
You moron. I can't believe you.

810
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:32,569
Seriously.

811
00:40:32,569 --> 00:40:35,399
Does one's height and looks
put food on the table?

812
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:37,439
Why you...

813
00:40:37,439 --> 00:40:40,308
Where else would you find a man
who could give you a diamond ring...

814
00:40:40,308 --> 00:40:42,879
considering your situation?

815
00:40:43,078 --> 00:40:44,879
How could you not see...

816
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:46,649
that a blessing
came rolling your way?

817
00:40:46,649 --> 00:40:49,589
What about my situation?
What's so bad about it?

818
00:40:49,819 --> 00:40:52,288
- Must you be on my case too?
- What?

819
00:40:58,959 --> 00:40:59,998
My gosh.

820
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:05,728
First Hyun Chul and now Myung Dong.

821
00:41:06,768 --> 00:41:10,069
What is the matter with my children?

822
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:22,888
What the...

823
00:41:23,288 --> 00:41:25,618
I can't believe
I almost ran into her again.

824
00:41:25,919 --> 00:41:27,288
My heart almost stopped.

825
00:41:49,879 --> 00:41:52,248
Maybe I should buy her a purse...

826
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:54,919
and end it
with some comforting words.

827
00:41:56,819 --> 00:41:59,049
No way. I'd rather
not get involved with her again.

828
00:42:12,669 --> 00:42:16,308
Come to think of it,
I don't know her name or her age.

829
00:42:18,609 --> 00:42:19,609
Well,

830
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:22,038
I guess...

831
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:24,478
she's kind of cute.

832
00:42:26,618 --> 00:42:29,348
But for some reason,
she looks like an aunt figure.

833
00:42:32,018 --> 00:42:34,158
How much older than me could she be?

834
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,658
What good would knowing that do?

835
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:43,098
Darn it.

836
00:42:47,768 --> 00:42:48,998
Ko, are you all right?

837
00:42:48,998 --> 00:42:50,209
Yes, I'm good.

838
00:42:53,009 --> 00:42:54,038
I'm good.

839
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:09,359
Ko!

840
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:12,728
- Ko, are you all right?
- What happened?

841
00:43:12,728 --> 00:43:14,928
- Go and get help.
- Right.

842
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:16,198
- Hurry.
- Ko!

843
00:43:16,198 --> 00:43:17,799
(Emergency Medical Center)

844
00:43:17,799 --> 00:43:19,598
Hyun Chul...

845
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:20,969
- Mother.
- My gosh.

846
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:23,069
Gosh. Goodness me.

847
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:24,709
- Where...
- Over there.

848
00:43:24,709 --> 00:43:27,379
- Hyun Chul, my gosh!
- Hyun Chul.

849
00:43:27,379 --> 00:43:28,877
- Hyun Chul.
- My goodness.

850
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:31,741
What on earth happened to you?

851
00:43:31,741 --> 00:43:36,350
This is exactly why I told you
not to work at construction sites.

852
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,750
What about your head?

853
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:42,421
What about your leg?
You hurt your leg!

854
00:43:42,421 --> 00:43:44,250
Mom, it's all right.

855
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,821
The injuries aren't severe,
so don't worry. I'm fine.

856
00:43:46,821 --> 00:43:49,690
How is this fine?

857
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:52,060
Honey, what on earth is going on?

858
00:43:52,361 --> 00:43:55,761
Was the part-time job you mentioned
carried out at construction sites?

859
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,671
You're too old to be doing
such challenging work.

860
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,310
While not knowing
what you were doing,

861
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,370
I was thrilled to know
that you were making money.

862
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:06,410
Honey, don't worry.

863
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,210
My injuries aren't severe.
It's all right.

864
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:11,381
How is this all right?

865
00:44:11,381 --> 00:44:14,020
What do you mean
these are only light injuries?

866
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:17,551
Your head and leg
are wrapped up in bandages!

867
00:44:18,221 --> 00:44:20,591
Gosh, you're killing me.

868
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:23,060
My heart aches because of you.

869
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,330
This is killing me!

870
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,401
Gosh.

871
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,730
Mom, please.

872
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,301
I'm too ashamed...

873
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,071
to even look at Sun Young right now.

874
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,910
Please don't make it worse.

875
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,681
Like I said, I'm fine. Come on!

876
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,310
What?

877
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:45,881
What...

878
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,480
What do you mean by that?

879
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:52,051
I never nagged you
to bring home extra money.

880
00:44:52,721 --> 00:44:54,421
When did I tell you
to bring home money...

881
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:56,120
by taking on such a challenging job?

882
00:44:56,531 --> 00:44:59,060
I can't believe this.
This breaks my heart.

883
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:00,861
Unbelievable.

884
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,660
Ko Myung Dong.

885
00:45:03,471 --> 00:45:05,901
Why are you standing there in tears?

886
00:45:06,201 --> 00:45:08,500
I'm fine, okay?

887
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,671
Gosh.

888
00:45:17,451 --> 00:45:19,350
Should I take this or not?

889
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:22,418
(Dong Ho's mom)

890
00:45:22,951 --> 00:45:24,190
Darn.

891
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:33,631
Ms. Baek, pick up this instant,

892
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:35,901
or I'll go see Park Do Ra on set.

893
00:45:36,971 --> 00:45:39,701
Are you kidding me with that threat?

894
00:45:48,341 --> 00:45:50,611
Hey, Dong Ho's mom.

895
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:53,620
I was in the shower stark naked.

896
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,381
That's why I didn't pick up.

897
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:57,821
What were you talking about?

898
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,921
Why would you go to Do Ra's set?

899
00:46:00,361 --> 00:46:02,160
Aren't we friends?

900
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,690
You paid Mal Soo back.

901
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:05,790
Where's my 500,000 dollars?

902
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:08,801
Give me a few months.

903
00:46:08,801 --> 00:46:11,031
Come on. Don't you trust me?

904
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:13,100
I'm nothing if not honest.

905
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,971
Do you think I'd swindle you?

906
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:17,140
Yes, I'm worried you'll swindle me.

907
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,071
I don't trust you anymore.

908
00:46:19,341 --> 00:46:23,551
I'll deal with your daughter
Do Ra from now on. That's final.

909
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,350
Wait. I'll pay you back. I promise.

910
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:29,421
I will.

911
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,491
Mother. What brought you here?

912
00:46:33,261 --> 00:46:35,321
I have this problem.

913
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:39,901
I have no one to talk to,
so I came here out of frustration.

914
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:44,401
But now I'm here, I feel too bad
and I don't think I can talk to you.

915
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:48,000
Please don't hesitate to tell me.
I'm a good listener.

916
00:46:50,171 --> 00:46:53,281
It might be too soon
to broach this subject,

917
00:46:53,681 --> 00:46:57,350
but the moment I first saw you,
I thought...

918
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,781
it would be just great...

919
00:46:59,781 --> 00:47:03,390
if such a lovely man
were to be my son-in-law.

920
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:06,861
I'm so pleased
you think highly of me.

921
00:47:07,421 --> 00:47:08,991
If Ms. Park allows it,

922
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:11,631
I'd gladly be your son-in-law
starting tomorrow.

923
00:47:12,031 --> 00:47:14,801
Would you really, Mr. Gong?

924
00:47:14,801 --> 00:47:16,671
- Yes.
- Goodness.

925
00:47:16,931 --> 00:47:20,100
Then,
though it's a bit embarrassing,

926
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:23,111
I'll talk to you
as if you're family.

927
00:47:23,111 --> 00:47:24,370
Okay. Go ahead.

928
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:28,410
I invested a huge amount
without letting Do Ra know,

929
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:31,810
and it will be a while
until I can get my money back.

930
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,480
The company
suddenly needs some money,

931
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:40,190
but I can't go to anyone
because of Do Ra's reputation.

932
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:42,591
Which is why...

933
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,060
How much do you need?

934
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:48,460
I need 500,000 dollars.

935
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:54,870
Mother.

936
00:47:57,071 --> 00:48:00,511
Why make such a big deal
over such a small amount?

937
00:48:00,741 --> 00:48:01,781
Goodness.

938
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,750
Mr. Cho!

939
00:48:15,861 --> 00:48:17,031
(Gong Jin Dan,
500,000 dollars deposit)

940
00:48:17,031 --> 00:48:18,531
He really sent it right away.

941
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,301
Should I have asked for more?

942
00:48:22,701 --> 00:48:25,870
Why is Do Ra playing hard to get
with a man like this?

943
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,611
Gong Jin Dan.

944
00:48:30,971 --> 00:48:34,281
I swear I'll make him my son-in-law.

945
00:48:44,951 --> 00:48:45,951
My gosh.

946
00:48:46,221 --> 00:48:48,190
I don't believe this.

947
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:49,960
Goodness.

948
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:52,460
She left without greeting me?

949
00:48:55,201 --> 00:48:57,370
Yesterday, Ma Ri talked back at me,

950
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,031
and she never apologized.

951
00:48:59,531 --> 00:49:01,901
I'm in bed sick with a headache...

952
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:03,870
and she didn't even check on me.

953
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:06,011
How could she?

954
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:08,111
While I'm here,

955
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,051
I'll do whatever it takes
to get rid of her.

956
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:15,520
I'll get Jin Taek
to marry someone else.

957
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:19,790
I will do this before I die
even if it's the last thing I do.

958
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,390
How dare she?

959
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,091
Oh, gosh.

960
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,000
Hey. Madam Cho.

961
00:49:27,261 --> 00:49:28,931
It has been so long.

962
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,870
We should meet.

963
00:49:33,171 --> 00:49:36,301
I have so much to say, Madam Cho.

964
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:39,671
How could she treat you like that?

965
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:44,580
I'd thought for a long time
that she was brazen and shameless.

966
00:49:45,051 --> 00:49:46,881
Why do that when she's in the wrong?

967
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,520
Goodness.

968
00:49:48,651 --> 00:49:49,850
"For a long time?"

969
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,890
What do you mean by that?

970
00:49:54,761 --> 00:49:57,031
Have you known Soo Yeon
for a long time?

971
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,261
Oh, it's nothing.

972
00:50:00,301 --> 00:50:04,000
You just talked about her
like you knew her well.

973
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:07,270
That she was brazen and shameless.

974
00:50:07,741 --> 00:50:10,341
Well, actually,

975
00:50:10,671 --> 00:50:13,171
it's not a story to tell lightly.

976
00:50:13,171 --> 00:50:15,241
I'm reluctant to tell you.

977
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:18,011
I messed up. I apologize.

978
00:50:18,951 --> 00:50:19,980
Madam Cho.

979
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:23,421
If it's about my nephew's wife,
it's about my family.

980
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,750
Must you keep things from me?

981
00:50:26,421 --> 00:50:27,721
Tell me already.

982
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,460
Whatever you tell me,
I won't hold you responsible.

983
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:33,801
What should I do?

984
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,701
Come on, Madam Cho.

985
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:40,540
You know
I used to live in Boston, right?

986
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:44,241
In Boston? Yes, I know that.

987
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:47,080
I had a good friend called Jessica.

988
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:51,281
We were close enough
to visit each other's homes.

989
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:53,681
My friend had an annex...

990
00:50:53,681 --> 00:50:56,690
that was rented by a Korean student
studying there.

991
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:58,850
He was a handsome young man.

992
00:50:59,651 --> 00:51:02,261
A Korean student? What then?

993
00:51:03,091 --> 00:51:04,261
One day,

994
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,491
when I went over to visit,

995
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:09,100
I saw the young man who was moving.

996
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,730
He said he was going to
move in with his girlfriend.

997
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:15,241
His girlfriend came over
to help him pack.

998
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,040
The couple was so adorable,

999
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,940
I couldn't stop looking.

1000
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:21,841
They were a handsome couple.

1001
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,250
My friend told me
they would marry soon.

1002
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:28,850
She was pregnant.

1003
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,951
Gosh. What then?

1004
00:51:32,451 --> 00:51:35,520
But then, later on,
after I returned to Korea.

1005
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:38,290
At Chairman Gong's wedding.

1006
00:51:38,431 --> 00:51:41,031
I was so shocked
I almost passed out.

1007
00:51:43,031 --> 00:51:45,600
At my nephew Jin Taek's wedding?

1008
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,370
Why?

1009
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,471
The bride by Chairman Gong's side...

1010
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:54,210
was the girlfriend who was
going to marry the Korean student...

1011
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,310
because she'd gotten pregnant.

1012
00:51:56,341 --> 00:51:58,051
What?

1013
00:51:59,381 --> 00:52:02,451
That woman was Jin Taek's wife?

1014
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:05,951
You mean that was Ma Ri's mom?

1015
00:52:05,951 --> 00:52:06,991
Yes.

1016
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,821
Oh, my gosh.

1017
00:52:09,821 --> 00:52:13,261
- Madam Gong. Are you all right?
- My goodness.

1018
00:52:14,361 --> 00:52:15,431
Oh, dear.

1019
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,401
It's okay.

1020
00:52:19,471 --> 00:52:23,410
Why would you tell me
something this important only now?

1021
00:52:24,071 --> 00:52:26,410
How could I tell you such a story?

1022
00:52:26,571 --> 00:52:29,781
At the time, Soo Yeon's father
was an assemblyman,

1023
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,980
and they were getting married
because Chairman Gong was besotted.

1024
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:38,020
I'd heard the couple
got along so well too,

1025
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,651
and I couldn't shatter the family.

1026
00:52:39,651 --> 00:52:43,160
So I'd kept it to myself.

1027
00:52:43,991 --> 00:52:46,031
But then I heard
how she treated you,

1028
00:52:46,361 --> 00:52:49,500
and I decided to tell you
because I can't stand her ways.

1029
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,671
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, dear.

1030
00:52:51,671 --> 00:52:53,901
- Madam Gong.
- This is unbelievable.

1031
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,241
- Do Ra. Block the wind.
- What?

1032
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,611
Okay.

1033
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:11,750
Darn it.

1034
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:20,761
Do it properly.
There are just two left.

1035
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,560
Okay.

1036
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,080
Park Do Ra!

1037
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:38,750
My bad. Sorry.

1038
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:41,221
- Go over there.
- What?

1039
00:53:41,381 --> 00:53:42,451
Okay.

1040
00:53:42,451 --> 00:53:44,451
Take this
and block the wind properly.

1041
00:53:44,451 --> 00:53:45,491
Okay.

1042
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,190
- Hey.
- What?

1043
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:49,921
This is the last match.

1044
00:53:49,991 --> 00:53:51,790
If this doesn't work, then we...

1045
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,401
Give it a go. You can do it.

1046
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:56,830
- Good luck.
- Please.

1047
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,500
Good luck. You can do this!

1048
00:54:09,111 --> 00:54:11,651
It's so much better with fire.

1049
00:54:12,951 --> 00:54:15,120
I realized only today
how much it means to us.

1050
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:17,421
Me too.

1051
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:24,261
Pil Seung.
Sitting here like this with you...

1052
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,960
makes it feel like
we're out camping, doesn't it?

1053
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,500
Are you hungry?

1054
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:37,410
Yes.

1055
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:40,440
I didn't eat anything earlier
because of the shoot.

1056
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:42,841
Just a moment.

1057
00:54:44,611 --> 00:54:46,310
I should've saved some gimbap.

1058
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:49,850
Hey, a stroke of luck.

1059
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,850
There's a snack I didn't eat.

1060
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,451
Eat this, Do Ra.

1061
00:54:56,991 --> 00:54:58,761
This will make me fat.

1062
00:54:58,991 --> 00:55:00,861
That means you're not hungry enough.

1063
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,330
Let's halve it.
You must be hungry too.

1064
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,551
Here we go.

1065
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,480
Here.

1066
00:55:29,921 --> 00:55:30,960
Gosh.

1067
00:55:32,261 --> 00:55:34,100
This is so good.

1068
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:37,100
Was red bean pastry this good?

1069
00:55:37,931 --> 00:55:40,071
Whenever Mom gave me this
when I was a kid,

1070
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:42,341
I gave it to Do Jun
because I didn't like it.

1071
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,841
It's sweet as honey.

1072
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,881
Do Ra. Eat this too.

1073
00:55:51,451 --> 00:55:52,451
What?

1074
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:55,451
Why? You must be hungry.

1075
00:55:55,451 --> 00:55:56,890
I don't like red bean pastry.

1076
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:58,690
I got an upset stomach
from red bean pastry when I was little.

1077
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,020
You can eat mine.

1078
00:56:01,261 --> 00:56:02,290
Are you serious?

1079
00:56:02,421 --> 00:56:03,730
Yes, I'm serious.

1080
00:56:19,341 --> 00:56:20,611
This is really good.

1081
00:56:21,741 --> 00:56:22,810
Where did you get this?

1082
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:28,381
Hey, Do Ra. You're so mean.

1083
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:31,221
You could've told me to try
a bite of it. How inconsiderate.

1084
00:56:32,551 --> 00:56:33,551
What?

1085
00:56:35,721 --> 00:56:36,721
I'm sorry.

1086
00:56:37,531 --> 00:56:39,830
I thought you didn't want to eat it.

1087
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:40,960
I'm joking.

1088
00:56:41,261 --> 00:56:42,861
Watching you eat makes me full.

1089
00:56:45,171 --> 00:56:46,431
What was that?

1090
00:56:48,201 --> 00:56:49,201
Here.

1091
00:56:54,111 --> 00:56:56,741
What's wrong, Do Ra? Are you sick?

1092
00:56:59,051 --> 00:57:00,850
What? Is there a bug?

1093
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,290
No, it's not like that.

1094
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:12,531
I need to go to the bathroom.

1095
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:17,471
Is it bad?

1096
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,370
Actually, I've been holding it
for quite a while.

1097
00:57:23,401 --> 00:57:25,071
Do Ra, just wait a moment.

1098
00:57:25,071 --> 00:57:26,671
I'll go and take a look around.

1099
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:42,491
Do Ra, I looked around this place.

1100
00:57:43,591 --> 00:57:45,960
I think you should do it
behind the rock here.

1101
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,801
I'll wait in there.

1102
00:57:48,801 --> 00:57:50,701
Take your time. Okay?

1103
00:57:52,071 --> 00:57:54,171
No, Pil Seung. Don't go.

1104
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,600
I'm scared.

1105
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:00,980
Okay. I'll stay here then.

1106
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,491
Pil Seung.

1107
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:20,361
Go further away.

1108
00:58:20,531 --> 00:58:22,631
Okay. I will.

1109
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:27,401
Pil Seung, that's too far.

1110
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,410
Okay. I get it.

1111
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:33,140
That's too close, Pil Seung.

1112
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,341
What do you want me to do?

1113
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:41,781
Do Ra, I'll turn around
and sing out loud.

1114
00:58:41,821 --> 00:58:44,321
So don't worry about me
and relieve yourself.

1115
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:45,390
Okay?

1116
00:58:46,451 --> 00:58:47,491
Okay.

1117
00:58:52,761 --> 00:58:56,100
<i>I'm attracted to her</i>

1118
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,830
<i>I'm falling for her</i>

1119
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:04,210
<i>The woman who stole my heart</i>

1120
00:59:04,471 --> 00:59:09,910
<i>Real, real, she's a real deal</i>

1121
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:13,381
<i>She's a total real deal</i>

1122
00:59:13,381 --> 00:59:17,051
<i>The real deal has just appeared</i>

1123
00:59:17,151 --> 00:59:19,290
<i>Eat your chicken and peep</i>

1124
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:20,321
Pil Seung.

1125
00:59:23,991 --> 00:59:26,261
I'm done.

1126
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:30,261
Okay. Let's go.

1127
00:59:31,671 --> 00:59:33,901
Did you hear it?

1128
00:59:35,401 --> 00:59:38,270
With all the noises of the wind
and waves, I couldn't hear anything.

1129
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:41,410
And I was so into my song
I didn't care about anything else.

1130
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:43,850
So you don't have to worry about it.

1131
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,511
Let's go.

1132
01:01:03,261 --> 01:01:04,261
Pil Seung?

1133
01:01:07,861 --> 01:01:08,960
Pil Seung.

1134
01:01:10,571 --> 01:01:11,571
Pil Seung.

1135
01:01:11,971 --> 01:01:14,571
Pil Seung.

1136
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,440
Pil Seung.

1137
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:20,440
Pil Seung.

1138
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:23,011
Pil Seung.

1139
01:01:23,611 --> 01:01:26,651
Do Ra, I'm over here. Do Ra.

1140
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,350
Pil Seung.

1141
01:01:29,151 --> 01:01:30,151
Do Ra.

1142
01:01:33,451 --> 01:01:35,790
Do Ra, what's wrong? What happened?

1143
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:38,160
Where have you been?

1144
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:42,060
Where on earth did you go?

1145
01:01:42,901 --> 01:01:45,870
I went to relieve myself.

1146
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,201
I thought you left me alone...

1147
01:01:50,201 --> 01:01:53,741
in the haunted house
and went somewhere else.

1148
01:01:55,381 --> 01:01:58,850
Don't go anywhere without me
from now on.

1149
01:02:01,381 --> 01:02:03,281
Okay. I won't.

1150
01:02:04,951 --> 01:02:08,421
Do Ra, you always pretend
to be strong, but you're a coward.

1151
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,261
You just grew old and tall,

1152
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:14,100
but you're still like the little kid
from 15 years ago.

1153
01:02:14,901 --> 01:02:16,761
I don't know.

1154
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,301
The fire was out.

1155
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,241
I was really scared.

1156
01:02:26,571 --> 01:02:28,281
It felt like a ghost would show up.

1157
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:32,750
Gosh. There's no ghost.

1158
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,361
Hey, look. There's no ghost.

1159
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,931
Ghost! Come on out if you're there!

1160
01:02:53,571 --> 01:02:54,671
Ghost!

1161
01:02:54,801 --> 01:02:56,040
See? There's no ghost.

1162
01:02:58,571 --> 01:03:01,080
Pil Seung, wait for me.

1163
01:04:23,991 --> 01:04:25,131
What are you doing?

1164
01:04:27,801 --> 01:04:29,131
Why are you...

1165
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:32,171
staring at me like that?

1166
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:44,151
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1167
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:18,250
Why don't you try
going out with Mr. Gong?

1168
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,551
I'm not saying this
because of the necklace.

1169
01:05:19,551 --> 01:05:21,850
I think he's a really nice guy.

1170
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:23,480
I'm not in need of money.
Why would I take this?

1171
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:24,491
Give it back right away.

1172
01:05:24,491 --> 01:05:26,721
You know Park Do Ra, right?

1173
01:05:26,721 --> 01:05:29,361
Is this Actress Park Do Ra?
This is...

1174
01:05:29,361 --> 01:05:32,290
Pil Seung,
don't you have a girlfriend?

1175
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:35,000
Why can't I stop
thinking about Pil Seung?

1176
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
What's wrong with me?

1177
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,631
He seems like a nice guy.

1178
01:05:38,631 --> 01:05:40,230
The more I see him,
the more I like him.

1179
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:41,600
If she gave birth back then,

1180
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,040
what did she do with the child?

1181
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,410
Dad, you should tell me
when you have a hard time.

1182
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:48,511
And don't forget that your son,
Ko Pil Seung, has your back.

1183
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,681
Pil Seung, don't die.

1184
01:05:50,681 --> 01:05:52,710
Please wake up!

1185
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:54,951
