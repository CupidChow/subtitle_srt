00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,456
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:08,343 --> 00:00:09,643
Sun Young!

3
00:00:09,782 --> 00:00:11,782
(Episode 33)

4
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:13,333
Ae Kyo.

5
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:16,073
If this is about Soo Yeon,
just leave.

6
00:00:16,178 --> 00:00:19,355
I'm busy and don't have the time
to idly chat with you.

7
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:21,328
Sun Young, that's not it.

8
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:23,199
Check this out.

9
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:24,938
Do you remember this photo?

10
00:00:28,389 --> 00:00:29,708
Gosh, Ae Kyo.

11
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:33,609
Why do you have
a photo of my Pil Seung?

12
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,278
Sun Young, is this really Pil Seung?

13
00:00:37,998 --> 00:00:39,278
Yes.

14
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:41,988
Gosh.

15
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:45,888
He was like an angel at that age.

16
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:49,308
Anyway, how do you have this photo?

17
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:50,488
What?

18
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:55,799
I found it while going through
my old photo albums.

19
00:00:56,518 --> 00:00:58,219
Pil Seung was so adorable
at that age,

20
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:00,598
and I must've asked you for a photo.

21
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:04,509
Goodness.
He was one adorable baby, wasn't he?

22
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:07,439
Gosh, silly me.

23
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:10,329
Sun Young, I forgot
I had a prior engagement.

24
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:12,419
You must be busy too,
so I'll get going.

25
00:01:12,998 --> 00:01:14,028
What...

26
00:01:14,028 --> 00:01:17,369
And here I thought
she came barging in...

27
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,659
to say something urgent.

28
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:21,659
Gosh.

29
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,448
Why does that family
keep coming by to see us...

30
00:01:25,448 --> 00:01:27,698
at the house and at the restaurant?

31
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:30,679
I'm annoyed by them coming by,

32
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:33,098
so tell them not to come, okay?

33
00:01:33,388 --> 00:01:35,809
I didn't ask her here.

34
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:39,188
I can't believe Ae Kyo.

35
00:01:39,188 --> 00:01:41,948
It's not like
she's welcomed anywhere.

36
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:46,148
Of course.

37
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:49,719
It's not a big deal for Soo Yeon
to have a photo of Pil Seung.

38
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,618
After all, she and Sun Young
were the best of friends.

39
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:55,228
But what's odd...

40
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,059
is that she kept his baby photo
hidden in some secret place.

41
00:02:00,278 --> 00:02:01,649
She signed him
as an in-house director...

42
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:03,194
by offering a huge signing bonus...

43
00:02:03,218 --> 00:02:05,139
and saved him
at the risk of losing her own life.

44
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,738
But Pil Seung is a foundling.

45
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:12,058
My gosh!

46
00:02:12,058 --> 00:02:14,804
Wait.
Could Pil Seung be Soo Yeon's son?

47
00:02:14,828 --> 00:02:16,229
Goodness me!

48
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:19,219
Gosh, no. No way.

49
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:23,318
I doubt she would've abandoned
her baby at her friend's house.

50
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:25,772
Of course.

51
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:27,701
Soo Yeon might be annoying,

52
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:29,291
but she's not a monster.

53
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:31,641
What on earth am I thinking?

54
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:34,191
That's impossible.

55
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:39,571
Look here, Ms. Baek.

56
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:43,501
You should've notified us
that you were released from prison.

57
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:46,112
You should've paid back
our 500,000 dollars.

58
00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:47,872
Did you think...

59
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:51,381
we wouldn't find you
if you kept laying low?

60
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:53,682
Really?

61
00:02:55,372 --> 00:02:57,922
Please don't. Please spare my life.

62
00:02:58,502 --> 00:03:01,791
After my daughter died,
I served time in prison.

63
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:03,842
Now I'm completely broke,

64
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:05,541
and I have no money
to even kill myself.

65
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,302
The 500,000 dollars
I borrowed from you?

66
00:03:08,682 --> 00:03:10,161
The 500,000 dollars?

67
00:03:10,652 --> 00:03:13,902
I don't have any of it left.
Please believe me.

68
00:03:14,282 --> 00:03:16,391
Your lame excuses
are none of my concern.

69
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:18,722
I'll be generous enough
to wait until tomorrow,

70
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:20,242
so get me my 500,000 dollars.

71
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:24,041
Don't even think
about running off again.

72
00:03:25,761 --> 00:03:28,908
Don't even think about dying
when you owe me money.

73
00:03:28,932 --> 00:03:30,152
If you do,

74
00:03:30,972 --> 00:03:34,191
your sons Do Sik and Do Jun
won't live to see another day.

75
00:03:34,772 --> 00:03:37,062
Remember that, okay?

76
00:03:40,712 --> 00:03:41,902
My...

77
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:44,031
sons?

78
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:46,098
Darn you!

79
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:48,172
You lunatic. You psycho.

80
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:51,397
Don't you dare touch
Do Sik or Do Jun.

81
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:53,668
If you so much as touch a hair,

82
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,242
I'll make sure you pay for it.

83
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,831
I'll follow you
to the end of the world...

84
00:03:57,831 --> 00:03:59,932
and rip your body to shreds.

85
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:01,781
Do you get that, punk?

86
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:03,552
Darn you all.

87
00:04:06,141 --> 00:04:08,791
- I'll kill you.
- You have until tomorrow.

88
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:10,892
Tomorrow.

89
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:13,992
What? 500,000 dollars?

90
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:20,832
Ms. Baek. Do you think
that money is easy to come by?

91
00:04:21,622 --> 00:04:23,991
Who are we to each other anyway?

92
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:26,672
Who am I to you that you keep
coming to me for money?

93
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:28,912
Am I a bank?

94
00:04:29,462 --> 00:04:30,982
Did you give me money
for safekeeping?

95
00:04:31,191 --> 00:04:33,881
Don't you at all feel bad
for what you put me through?

96
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:37,608
I do feel bad. I do, so very much.

97
00:04:37,632 --> 00:04:40,277
And I have no shame.
I know that, but Mr. Gong.

98
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:42,741
For dead Do Ra's sake,
help me out one more...

99
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,591
Do Ra! That darn name!

100
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:48,062
Will you stop mentioning her?

101
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:50,631
It might actually drive me insane!

102
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:54,631
I still think of you
as my son-in-law.

103
00:04:54,691 --> 00:04:58,711
If you had married Do Ra,
you would've been my son-in-law.

104
00:04:58,861 --> 00:05:00,771
That darn engagement...

105
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,337
It was Do Ra who ruined everything.

106
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:06,182
At the dress shop
on the day of our engagement,

107
00:05:06,662 --> 00:05:09,751
she rushed off and ditched me.

108
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,521
Why would you consider me
your son-in-law?

109
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:13,992
Back then,

110
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:17,062
if it hadn't been for Ko Pil Seung,

111
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:19,318
Do Ra would've married you.

112
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:21,912
It was all because of him.

113
00:05:21,912 --> 00:05:24,001
Blame it on Ko Pil Seung.

114
00:05:25,551 --> 00:05:28,172
Why are you mentioning Ko Pil Seung?

115
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:31,102
What did he do?

116
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:34,271
Actually,

117
00:05:35,691 --> 00:05:37,381
when Do Ra was young,

118
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:40,581
we rented a room at Pil Seung's.

119
00:05:40,702 --> 00:05:42,871
They reunited years later
as the female lead...

120
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:46,521
and assistant director
of "Straightforward Romance."

121
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:49,261
Pil Seung seduced Do Ra,

122
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:53,888
she fell for him and his tricks,
and that's how it all went wrong.

123
00:05:53,912 --> 00:05:57,461
Ko Pil Seung got to Do Ra,
and she got cold feet.

124
00:05:58,711 --> 00:06:02,332
Are you saying
my engagement fell through...

125
00:06:03,182 --> 00:06:05,431
because of Ko Pil Seung?

126
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:08,441
- Is that it?
- Yes.

127
00:06:08,921 --> 00:06:10,571
If it hadn't been for him,

128
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:12,912
you'd be my son-in-law now.

129
00:06:13,262 --> 00:06:17,282
You know for a fact
how much I liked you.

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,181
Darn it.

131
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,051
Why are you telling me this now?

132
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:25,421
Why now?

133
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,760
What's the point in telling you
when Do Ra's dead?

134
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,030
It's as pointless
as touching a dead body.

135
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:40,270
Get out.

136
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:44,041
I don't want to see you
or dead Do Ra.

137
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,410
Get out of my face right now.

138
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,390
What now? Jin Dan won't help either.

139
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:08,160
Where am I to get that much money?

140
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:10,200
I can't take my own life either.

141
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,470
What will happen
to poor Do Sik and Do Jun?

142
00:07:22,091 --> 00:07:24,751
Ko Pil Seung and Do Ra dated?

143
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:28,780
And that's why
she canceled the engagement?

144
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:35,861
I don't believe it.

145
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,160
Wait.

146
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:40,991
Did Pil Seung go after Ji Young,

147
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,861
because like me,
he was reminded of Do Ra?

148
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:47,071
Gosh, then...

149
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,741
did I lose a girl to him twice?

150
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:55,311
Goodness. Who and what is he?

151
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,741
It feels worse by the minute.

152
00:07:59,161 --> 00:08:00,681
No, wait.

153
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,981
They said they ended it.

154
00:08:04,231 --> 00:08:06,421
Yes. It's okay, Jin Dan.

155
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,691
Let it go.

156
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:12,561
Yes. Let it go. Drop it.

157
00:08:15,581 --> 00:08:17,061
Shoot...

158
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,140
No.

159
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,510
They work together all day long,

160
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:28,881
and they do this at home too?

161
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,251
Does he like her that much?

162
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,520
Why do you only look at her?

163
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,891
Why won't you look at me even once?

164
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,531
I want to ruin her face.

165
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,200
Will he look at me then?

166
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,240
Cut, okay. Looking good.

167
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,737
That's all for today.

168
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:08,080
- Good job.
- Well done.

169
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:11,271
- Well done.
- Great job.

170
00:09:11,271 --> 00:09:12,300
You did great.

171
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,860
I'm dead scared of you, Ji Young.

172
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:16,460
What will you do to my face?

173
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:18,881
Yes. You're such a great actor.

174
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:20,710
Just your voice gave me the chills.

175
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,931
Did it really?

176
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:23,627
Thank you.

177
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:24,970
You're so good.

178
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,521
- Good job.
- You too.

179
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:27,881
- You did well.
- Nice job.

180
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:29,141
- Well done.
- Thanks.

181
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:32,110
Ji Young, you did a good job.

182
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:34,911
Thank you.

183
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:48,921
Gosh. Why are you crying, Granny?

184
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:52,161
Why would you be so horrible?

185
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,350
Why do you want to steal
someone's boyfriend,

186
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,700
and why do you want to ruin
someone's face?

187
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:02,100
Is that what I taught you
to be like?

188
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:07,970
Grandma. This is called acting.
It's not for real.

189
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:10,240
Oh, Director.

190
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:13,080
- Director.
- Yes?

191
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:15,700
Why would you...

192
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,181
make Ji Young do
such terrible things?

193
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:22,647
Why would you
turn her into an evil witch?

194
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:24,561
Grandma.

195
00:10:24,881 --> 00:10:27,757
Ma'am, that was just her acting.

196
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:29,500
She played a drama character.

197
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:31,771
It doesn't look like acting.

198
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:36,041
It feels like Ji Young
actually became someone evil.

199
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,291
Gosh...

200
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,891
If you got that engrossed,

201
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:41,941
Ji Young must've done a great job.

202
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:45,337
Ma'am. Our drama will be a hit.

203
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:47,131
Even so,

204
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:51,021
you made her stare at people
like this and roll her eyes.

205
00:10:51,131 --> 00:10:53,641
And try to steal someone's man.

206
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:55,916
No human being should do that.

207
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,381
Director, I'm against Ji Young...

208
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:01,550
doing stuff like this.
I won't let her do it anymore.

209
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,511
- You're coming with me.
- No, Grandma.

210
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:05,381
- Ma'am.
- What?

211
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:07,921
- I'm...
- I need Ji Young to play the role.

212
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:10,571
What must I do to make you let her?

213
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:13,271
I guess...

214
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:17,041
- you can buy me jjajangmyeon.
- What?

215
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,090
Ma'am. Do you like the food?

216
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:30,891
It's so very delicious.

217
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:34,691
Even more so
because it's your treat.

218
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,830
Does that mean
you're not angry anymore?

219
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,200
I'm not angry at all.

220
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:46,066
Earlier, as you said,
I guess I was upset...

221
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:50,291
because Ji Young
did such a great job...

222
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,960
portraying her character.

223
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,250
I think our drama will be a hit
and now I'm overjoyed.

224
00:11:55,531 --> 00:11:58,990
Ms. Lee, I'll buy you dessert too.
What do you want?

225
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:02,321
Well, I don't want to eat
anything else,

226
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:04,960
but I do want to go somewhere.

227
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,661
- What?
- Where?

228
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,031
Mount Nam.

229
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:11,460
Duk Ja said...

230
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,271
when I'm in Seoul,
I must visit Mount Nam.

231
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:18,840
- Mount Nam?
- Yes.

232
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:26,380
Grandma. Do you have to go there?

233
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:28,250
Yes.

234
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,391
This is lovely.

235
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,411
My goodness.

236
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:37,440
- Grandma.
- I love it here.

237
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,661
Grandma. Let's not go this way.

238
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,330
Let's go that way.

239
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,200
No. I like this side.

240
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:46,901
I like this place.

241
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:48,671
My gosh.

242
00:12:57,031 --> 00:13:00,850
Why are there so many padlocks?

243
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,480
My goodness.

244
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:05,720
They're so colorful and pretty.

245
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:10,261
Kevin, heart, Jenny.

246
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,931
Gosh.

247
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:16,431
Even foreigners came here
to put one up.

248
00:13:17,011 --> 00:13:18,161
Oh, well.

249
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:21,401
I never got to do
anything like this.

250
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,470
What did I do my whole life?

251
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:27,811
It's as if I did nothing meaningful.

252
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,441
If it's not too late,

253
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:33,181
should I find someone nice?

254
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:36,350
Gosh, Grandma.

255
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,921
No, I was just joking.

256
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:43,741
Forget about me.

257
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:47,291
You and Director Ko
should try something like this.

258
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:49,901
My gosh.

259
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,931
Grandma.

260
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:55,031
Why would we do that? It's so tacky.

261
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,190
It's not tacky at all.

262
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,521
You should have fun...

263
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:04,641
doing stuff like this with someone
you like. That's life.

264
00:14:05,031 --> 00:14:08,921
People call you country bumpkin
because you say such a thing.

265
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,480
Forget it.

266
00:14:10,531 --> 00:14:13,750
There's no way I'm doing this
even if I'm called country bumpkin.

267
00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:16,620
And this is something...

268
00:14:18,141 --> 00:14:20,130
you do with someone you like.

269
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,161
But you and Director Ko...

270
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,097
like each other.

271
00:14:26,121 --> 00:14:28,521
Come on, Grandma.
What are you saying?

272
00:14:28,521 --> 00:14:30,600
I said it wasn't true.

273
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,610
Wait.

274
00:14:32,861 --> 00:14:36,811
This one says
Ji Young, heart, Pil Seung.

275
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,107
What...

276
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:42,921
Pil Seung? Isn't that your name,
Director Ko?

277
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:46,450
Ji Young, when did you do this?

278
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,391
Have you been hiding it from me?

279
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,411
- No.
- My gosh.

280
00:14:52,411 --> 00:14:54,730
- This isn't me.
- What are you doing?

281
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:56,460
Stop it.

282
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,401
Why did you have to find this,
Grandma?

283
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,041
You could've pretended
you didn't see it.

284
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,781
Ji Young.

285
00:15:10,631 --> 00:15:13,100
What are you waiting for,
Director Ko?

286
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,380
Hurry and follow her.

287
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,430
Ms. Lee, please wait here
for a moment.

288
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,651
All right.

289
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:26,460
Wait, Ji Young.

290
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:33,271
Ji Young.

291
00:15:34,751 --> 00:15:36,470
You still have feelings for me,
don't you?

292
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,541
No.

293
00:15:42,161 --> 00:15:44,281
I don't have feelings
for you anymore.

294
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,411
I know you do.

295
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,850
You like me too.

296
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,250
Why do you keep denying it?

297
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:54,750
It's hard and heartbreaking...

298
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:57,521
for you to push me away
when you still have feelings for me.

299
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,931
I don't want to see you suffer.

300
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,661
Let's just follow our hearts.

301
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:07,000
Why are you being like this,
Director Ko?

302
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,470
I'm telling you I don't have
feelings for you anymore.

303
00:16:14,121 --> 00:16:15,511
Then why are you crying?

304
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,441
That's...

305
00:16:33,011 --> 00:16:36,360
Actually, I don't know
how I'm feeling.

306
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,970
I'm so confused.

307
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:47,011
When I see you,
you don't seem like a bad person.

308
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,110
But my mom says you are.

309
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:58,051
I'm caught caught
between a rock and a hard place.

310
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:03,960
I guess that's because
I haven't recovered my memories.

311
00:17:09,911 --> 00:17:11,660
What if I like you again...

312
00:17:13,651 --> 00:17:15,271
and recover my memories?

313
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:19,940
What if I end up blaming you,

314
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,241
hating you,

315
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,951
and having a hard time again?

316
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,920
Ji Young.

317
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,761
I'll be okay no matter what.

318
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:41,190
Even if you get
your memories back...

319
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,930
and hate me again, I won't mind.

320
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:48,071
I don't mind you hating me.

321
00:17:49,391 --> 00:17:51,140
But I don't want to see you
have a hard time.

322
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,840
So, Ji Young,

323
00:17:54,891 --> 00:17:56,511
put your mind at ease...

324
00:17:57,131 --> 00:17:58,711
and just like me.

325
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:01,700
And when you recover
your memories someday,

326
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,601
if I turn out to be a bad person,

327
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:04,951
you can just dump me.

328
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:06,291
That's what you can do.

329
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,920
That doesn't make sense.

330
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,770
It does.

331
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,991
My gosh.

332
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,071
So, Ji Young,

333
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,741
just listen to your heart. Okay?

334
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,671
That's so nice.

335
00:18:39,671 --> 00:18:41,500
Director Ko. Ji Young.

336
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,061
Oh, dear.

337
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,280
Were you two doing something?

338
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,261
I'm so sorry.

339
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:53,330
What do you mean
we were doing something?

340
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,330
I mean...

341
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:59,741
There's this thing
a man and a woman would do.

342
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,580
All right, Director Ko.

343
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:14,051
I'll head back inside first.

344
00:19:14,871 --> 00:19:17,221
The young man and the young woman
that you two are...

345
00:19:17,611 --> 00:19:19,780
can stay here and finish things up.

346
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,311
My gosh. Grandma.

347
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:24,980
What is there to finish up?

348
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,600
Listen, Director Ko.

349
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,301
My Ji Young is so naive that
she doesn't know how things work.

350
00:19:32,391 --> 00:19:33,670
Ji Young.

351
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:38,331
A date ends with a kiss.

352
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:39,481
What?

353
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,107
- I'm going in.
- What? Gosh.

354
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:44,551
- Grandma!
- See you.

355
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,120
No one can stop my grandma.

356
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,111
Please get home safely then.

357
00:19:58,111 --> 00:19:59,971
Thank you for today.

358
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,400
Ji Young,

359
00:20:08,121 --> 00:20:10,580
don't ever forget
that I'm here to support you.

360
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:13,080
Call me...

361
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:15,521
if you ever need my help.

362
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,371
Like when...

363
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:21,051
you want to eat tteokbokki
which is your favorite...

364
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:23,521
or want to go to a food stall.

365
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,491
I'll come to see you
whenever you like...

366
00:20:27,581 --> 00:20:29,100
and buy you whatever you want.

367
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,711
Just make sure to drive safely.

368
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,241
Just go.

369
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:46,080
After I see you go in.

370
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,951
I'll go in after you leave.

371
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,540
Then we both should go now.

372
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,690
Bye.

373
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:01,531
Ji Young.

374
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,751
What? Are they back together?

375
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:25,321
Park Do Ra left me
because of Ko Pil Seung.

376
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,090
And Kim Ji Young is rejecting me
because of him again?

377
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,130
Darn it.

378
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,630
What am I supposed to do?

379
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,322
Mom, what's wrong? Are you sick?

380
00:21:57,322 --> 00:21:59,252
You've been looking awful
since yesterday.

381
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:00,501
Are you feeling dizzy?

382
00:22:00,842 --> 00:22:02,053
Oh, right.

383
00:22:02,443 --> 00:22:04,072
Do Sik, if anything happens
when you're out,

384
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,788
you have to call me immediately.

385
00:22:05,812 --> 00:22:08,932
And if someone asks you
to go with them,

386
00:22:09,443 --> 00:22:12,213
you should run away right away.
Do you understand?

387
00:22:12,213 --> 00:22:13,782
I'm not a kid.

388
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:15,833
Are you afraid I'd be kidnapped?

389
00:22:17,653 --> 00:22:19,963
- What is it? Is something wrong?
- What?

390
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,822
Hey, you darn witch.

391
00:22:22,822 --> 00:22:25,993
Your husband is supposed
to go to work now.

392
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:27,653
What do you think you're doing?

393
00:22:27,703 --> 00:22:29,032
It's nothing.

394
00:22:29,032 --> 00:22:31,323
I'm just telling him
to always stay safe.

395
00:22:31,673 --> 00:22:33,403
Stop sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong.

396
00:22:33,403 --> 00:22:35,403
Do Sik, hurry on off to work.

397
00:22:35,403 --> 00:22:37,848
- Can you zip it up?
- I'll do it.

398
00:22:37,872 --> 00:22:39,072
- I'll get going.
- Bye.

399
00:22:39,072 --> 00:22:41,082
- I'm off to work.
- Sure thing, Geum Dong.

400
00:22:41,082 --> 00:22:43,312
- Earn a lot of money.
- Got it, Mother.

401
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:46,772
Good. My sweet boy.

402
00:23:02,562 --> 00:23:04,548
You good-for-nothing housewife.

403
00:23:04,572 --> 00:23:05,752
Hold on.

404
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:08,943
Are you sulking because I told you...

405
00:23:08,943 --> 00:23:10,513
to make kimchi with 100 cabbages?

406
00:23:10,513 --> 00:23:12,612
Grandma, please don't.

407
00:23:12,612 --> 00:23:16,713
After I married, I made kimchi
with 200 of them every year.

408
00:23:16,713 --> 00:23:19,552
Your husband leaves early
in the morning to earn money,

409
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:23,442
so how dare you waste your time
sulking at the breakfast table?

410
00:23:23,723 --> 00:23:27,092
Think about eating up
and making the kimchi today.

411
00:23:27,092 --> 00:23:29,813
- How dare you...
- Lady!

412
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,562
Life is stressful as is,

413
00:23:31,562 --> 00:23:34,102
so why are you also
giving me a hard time?

414
00:23:34,102 --> 00:23:35,538
- Why you...
- Just stop.

415
00:23:35,562 --> 00:23:38,452
- She...
- Ms. Baek, is something up?

416
00:23:38,703 --> 00:23:41,292
- Baek Mi Ja!
- What's this?

417
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,118
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

418
00:23:44,142 --> 00:23:46,913
- What on earth?
- Ms. Baek, who are these people?

419
00:23:46,913 --> 00:23:48,633
Kicking back, are you?

420
00:23:49,582 --> 00:23:52,202
Baek Mi Ja, why aren't you
taking my calls?

421
00:23:52,413 --> 00:23:54,573
Should I take time out of
my busy schedule to come here?

422
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:56,843
Where's my money? My money!

423
00:23:57,092 --> 00:23:59,472
Please don't hurt me.

424
00:23:59,892 --> 00:24:02,122
Give me more time.

425
00:24:02,122 --> 00:24:04,969
How can I get you all that money
in just one day?

426
00:24:04,993 --> 00:24:06,703
Give me time. How about five years?

427
00:24:06,703 --> 00:24:08,763
No, just a year.

428
00:24:08,763 --> 00:24:13,323
If you do, I'll pay back
what I owe you.

429
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:16,379
I'm surprised you have an appetite.

430
00:24:16,403 --> 00:24:20,163
- You scoundrel.
- Grandma!

431
00:24:20,312 --> 00:24:21,513
Who are you...

432
00:24:21,513 --> 00:24:23,382
- to kick our breakfast table?
- What the...

433
00:24:23,382 --> 00:24:26,058
- The worst kind of person is one...
- Grandma...

434
00:24:26,082 --> 00:24:28,882
- who messes with precious food.
- Move it, Grandma.

435
00:24:28,882 --> 00:24:31,742
- Why you...
- What is this even about?

436
00:24:32,023 --> 00:24:33,723
I'll call the police.

437
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:35,892
Ji Young, no!

438
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:38,493
Do Sik and Do Jun will die
if you do, so no.

439
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:40,583
Are you kidding me?

440
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:43,313
Let's wrap this up and leave.
Give it to her.

441
00:24:45,332 --> 00:24:47,792
Here. Sign this.

442
00:24:48,673 --> 00:24:51,063
What on earth is it?

443
00:24:51,372 --> 00:24:53,063
You'll give up your rights
to your own body.

444
00:24:53,513 --> 00:24:57,032
If you don't have the money,
pay it back with your organs!

445
00:24:57,513 --> 00:25:00,122
- Don't you think so?
- Please spare my life.

446
00:25:00,122 --> 00:25:02,983
- Gosh, please. Don't do this.
- You can't!

447
00:25:02,983 --> 00:25:05,472
- Darn it.
- Let go!

448
00:25:06,158 --> 00:25:08,088
(Relinquishment of Rights
to One's Body)

449
00:25:09,062 --> 00:25:11,532
- Oh, no!
- Unbelievable.

450
00:25:11,532 --> 00:25:14,553
Our contract
has been signed and sealed.

451
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:17,473
Pay back the money
while your organs are intact,

452
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:18,823
and I'll say this never existed.

453
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:22,292
You know what'll happen
if you run away, right?

454
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:25,812
- Let's go. We're busy enough.
- Oh, dear.

455
00:25:25,812 --> 00:25:28,612
- No!
- My gosh.

456
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:29,962
Seriously?

457
00:25:30,282 --> 00:25:31,312
Darn it.

458
00:25:31,312 --> 00:25:34,633
Ms. Baek, until next time.

459
00:25:36,852 --> 00:25:39,303
- Grandma, don't.
- Those scoundrels.

460
00:25:43,122 --> 00:25:47,608
Ms. Baek,
what on earth was all that?

461
00:25:47,632 --> 00:25:49,613
You gave up your rights
to your own body.

462
00:25:52,173 --> 00:25:53,423
Ji Young.

463
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:57,962
They'll take her liver, kidney,
and even eyes...

464
00:25:58,013 --> 00:25:59,663
to sell for a price.

465
00:25:59,713 --> 00:26:02,118
Ji Young, we'll call the police.

466
00:26:02,142 --> 00:26:05,032
You can't! Ji Young, no.

467
00:26:05,552 --> 00:26:08,873
If you do, they'll take
Do Sik and Do Jun away.

468
00:26:09,453 --> 00:26:13,122
They'll come after us until we die,
so you can't call the police.

469
00:26:13,122 --> 00:26:14,493
Ms. Baek.

470
00:26:14,493 --> 00:26:18,012
Just how much money do you owe them?

471
00:26:18,993 --> 00:26:21,632
It's the money I borrowed...

472
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:23,682
while you were Do Ra.

473
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,818
The rest of my debt was cleared
when I went to prison,

474
00:26:26,842 --> 00:26:29,692
but I still owe the same amount
to those loan sharks.

475
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:38,189
Even if I want to die,
I can't because of my two boys.

476
00:26:38,213 --> 00:26:40,282
My poor Do Sik and Do Jun.

477
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:44,942
What am I going to do about this?

478
00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:47,573
What am I going to do?

479
00:26:49,963 --> 00:26:53,212
Mr. Gong? It's Mr. Gong.

480
00:26:53,463 --> 00:26:54,712
Mr. Gong.

481
00:26:56,403 --> 00:26:58,623
Mr. Gong, I...

482
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:03,923
Mr. Gong, it's me.

483
00:27:04,224 --> 00:27:06,224
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

484
00:27:09,243 --> 00:27:10,403
So tell me.

485
00:27:11,312 --> 00:27:13,603
Just how much money do you need?

486
00:27:15,122 --> 00:27:16,373
Why do you ask?

487
00:27:17,253 --> 00:27:20,472
Are you going to help me out
if I tell you the number?

488
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,012
Try me.

489
00:27:24,362 --> 00:27:25,512
For now,

490
00:27:27,032 --> 00:27:28,212
I need 500,000 dollars.

491
00:27:29,663 --> 00:27:30,853
Is that so?

492
00:27:31,903 --> 00:27:33,452
If I give you 500,000 dollars,

493
00:27:34,342 --> 00:27:35,692
will you do anything I ask?

494
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,492
Of course I would.

495
00:27:38,943 --> 00:27:40,192
Absolutely.

496
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:43,459
Mr. Gong, please help me out.

497
00:27:43,483 --> 00:27:45,163
Please save my life.

498
00:27:46,683 --> 00:27:48,002
Then...

499
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:55,413
Have Kim Ji Young,
the actress you're living with,

500
00:27:58,193 --> 00:27:59,782
come to me.

501
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:03,613
Mr. Gong.

502
00:28:04,532 --> 00:28:05,722
What...

503
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,022
do you mean by that?

504
00:28:29,693 --> 00:28:30,883
Have a seat.

505
00:28:38,532 --> 00:28:40,593
What was so urgent
that we had to meet outside?

506
00:28:41,572 --> 00:28:43,792
If it was work-related,
we could've talked at the office.

507
00:28:47,282 --> 00:28:48,863
I had something to give you.

508
00:29:02,463 --> 00:29:03,643
That's right.

509
00:29:04,862 --> 00:29:06,512
It's a photo of your father.

510
00:29:11,102 --> 00:29:13,022
His Korean name is Kim Sung Soo,

511
00:29:13,842 --> 00:29:15,623
and he goes by John Kim in English.

512
00:29:17,142 --> 00:29:18,363
Your father...

513
00:29:19,473 --> 00:29:21,492
studied biotechnology...

514
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:25,163
at Columbus State University
in the US.

515
00:29:25,483 --> 00:29:28,002
He's a Korean-American.

516
00:29:31,592 --> 00:29:33,673
We dated while attending
the same university.

517
00:29:36,763 --> 00:29:38,442
I loved him...

518
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:41,853
and thought about marrying him.

519
00:29:42,503 --> 00:29:45,353
But your father...

520
00:29:46,273 --> 00:29:47,952
died...

521
00:29:50,743 --> 00:29:53,192
at the young age of 28...

522
00:29:55,213 --> 00:29:56,792
while on a hiking trip.

523
00:29:58,983 --> 00:30:00,772
He was only 28.

524
00:30:03,582 --> 00:30:04,903
Your father...

525
00:30:06,493 --> 00:30:08,873
was an impressive young man.

526
00:30:11,193 --> 00:30:12,913
I may have abandoned you,

527
00:30:15,403 --> 00:30:17,782
but he wouldn't have.

528
00:30:19,003 --> 00:30:21,093
That's all I want you to know.

529
00:30:22,903 --> 00:30:24,623
That's why I brought you this photo.

530
00:30:25,312 --> 00:30:27,633
You should at least know
what he looks like.

531
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:32,932
You...

532
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:37,303
take after him a lot.

533
00:31:08,552 --> 00:31:10,573
Chairman Gong!

534
00:31:11,023 --> 00:31:12,753
Chairman Gong.

535
00:31:12,753 --> 00:31:14,712
- What's this about?
- I'm glad you're at home.

536
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:16,673
It's huge.

537
00:31:17,332 --> 00:31:20,083
I don't even know where to begin.

538
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:23,752
That's right.
First, check out this photo.

539
00:31:24,673 --> 00:31:28,823
Wait. Isn't this a photo
of Pil Seung and my wife?

540
00:31:29,273 --> 00:31:32,363
But why is Soo Yeon in tears?

541
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:33,882
Beats me.

542
00:31:33,882 --> 00:31:36,262
I only took a photo of them
because I found it odd.

543
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:38,333
But on my way home, I got thinking.

544
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:41,523
And all these years,
she's been acting strange...

545
00:31:41,523 --> 00:31:43,303
whenever it came to Pil Seung.

546
00:31:43,582 --> 00:31:45,622
When Ma Ri had a crush on Pil Seung,

547
00:31:45,622 --> 00:31:47,523
she disapproved of it
by slapping Ma Ri.

548
00:31:47,523 --> 00:31:49,822
She offered him
an unprecedented signing bonus...

549
00:31:49,822 --> 00:31:51,463
just to have him
at GOGO Entertainment.

550
00:31:51,463 --> 00:31:53,632
When he was at the risk
of getting hurt,

551
00:31:53,632 --> 00:31:54,733
she threw herself to save him.

552
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:56,813
Not anyone could do that.

553
00:31:58,102 --> 00:32:00,282
What are you getting at?

554
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:03,722
Gosh.
My brain's getting ahead of itself.

555
00:32:04,072 --> 00:32:07,262
Let me start from the top.

556
00:32:07,513 --> 00:32:09,882
I needed a nail clipper,

557
00:32:09,882 --> 00:32:12,732
so I went to Soo Yeon's room
to borrow one.

558
00:32:12,882 --> 00:32:14,959
However, I knocked over
her jewelry box in the process.

559
00:32:14,983 --> 00:32:17,629
There, I found a photo of a baby.

560
00:32:17,653 --> 00:32:19,523
Who keeps a photo of a baby
in her jewelry box?

561
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:20,972
Why would she hide it?

562
00:32:21,062 --> 00:32:23,933
I thought it looked like
Pil Seung as a baby,

563
00:32:23,933 --> 00:32:25,482
so I showed it to Sun Young.

564
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:27,712
She said
it was Pil Seung's baby photo.

565
00:32:28,632 --> 00:32:30,083
What about that?

566
00:32:30,703 --> 00:32:32,508
Do you still not get...

567
00:32:32,532 --> 00:32:33,952
what I'm saying?

568
00:32:34,273 --> 00:32:36,053
Are you still clueless?

569
00:32:37,443 --> 00:32:40,462
I think Pil Seung is Soo Yeon's son.

570
00:32:40,513 --> 00:32:41,663
What...

571
00:32:41,782 --> 00:32:44,253
What? Her son?

572
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:47,373
Pil Seung isn't
Sun Young's biological son.

573
00:32:47,723 --> 00:32:49,373
You may not know about this,

574
00:32:49,782 --> 00:32:53,023
but there was a rumor about
Soo Yeon giving birth to a child.

575
00:32:53,023 --> 00:32:54,439
This proves it.

576
00:32:54,463 --> 00:32:56,493
Hong Ae Kyo,
are you out of your mind?

577
00:32:56,493 --> 00:32:58,982
My gosh. Chairman Gong.

578
00:33:00,032 --> 00:33:02,802
What is it? What is this about?

579
00:33:02,802 --> 00:33:03,933
Auntie,

580
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:07,823
I'm done living under the same roof
with this woman.

581
00:33:08,072 --> 00:33:09,173
What was that?

582
00:33:09,173 --> 00:33:12,173
My wife gave birth to a child
in the past...

583
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:14,932
and that child
is actually Pil Seung?

584
00:33:15,112 --> 00:33:16,858
Do you even hear yourself?

585
00:33:16,882 --> 00:33:18,582
You can't just spit out words
because you can.

586
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:19,903
Hong Ae Kyo,

587
00:33:20,052 --> 00:33:21,633
you are to leave my house
this instant.

588
00:33:21,983 --> 00:33:23,502
Get out of my house!

589
00:33:23,822 --> 00:33:25,852
Chairman Gong,
I must've lost my mind for a second.

590
00:33:25,852 --> 00:33:27,892
Something must've come over me.

591
00:33:27,892 --> 00:33:30,739
Chairman Gong, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about what I said.

592
00:33:30,763 --> 00:33:33,182
If you're going to lose your mind,
do so elegantly.

593
00:33:34,602 --> 00:33:35,883
Oh, dear.

594
00:33:41,802 --> 00:33:43,423
How clueless are you?

595
00:33:44,112 --> 00:33:46,423
As if that makes any sense.

596
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:48,983
Why else would
the gentle Chairman Gong...

597
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:50,432
explode like that?

598
00:33:51,153 --> 00:33:53,202
But it was weird for sure.

599
00:33:53,923 --> 00:33:55,972
Auntie, see the photo yourself.

600
00:33:56,253 --> 00:33:57,942
It's odd.

601
00:33:58,292 --> 00:34:00,542
Why would she be like this
with a friend's son?

602
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:04,042
Also, why would she be cherishing
a baby photo of Pil Seung?

603
00:34:04,663 --> 00:34:05,843
Unbelievable.

604
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:09,012
How does that prove
he's actually her son?

605
00:34:09,663 --> 00:34:11,403
Besides,
there isn't a woman crazy enough...

606
00:34:11,403 --> 00:34:12,883
to abandon her child
at her friend's house.

607
00:34:13,943 --> 00:34:17,562
But you told me
she had given birth in the past.

608
00:34:18,343 --> 00:34:20,192
There was nothing certain about it.

609
00:34:20,613 --> 00:34:22,142
I looked for years...

610
00:34:22,142 --> 00:34:23,792
but couldn't come across
any evidence.

611
00:34:24,713 --> 00:34:27,229
If you're that curious,
get definitive proof.

612
00:34:27,253 --> 00:34:29,633
How can you make such an accusation
without any proof?

613
00:34:30,423 --> 00:34:33,073
Do you think I'm keeping quiet
because I want to?

614
00:34:33,452 --> 00:34:36,912
I've been quiet all these years
because I don't have any proof.

615
00:34:37,733 --> 00:34:39,492
When it comes
to something this important,

616
00:34:39,492 --> 00:34:41,412
one must have proof.

617
00:34:42,003 --> 00:34:44,852
Without any,
you'll suffer the backlash like earlier.

618
00:34:45,472 --> 00:34:46,723
Proof?

619
00:35:03,283 --> 00:35:04,602
Ms. Baek...

620
00:35:06,222 --> 00:35:08,073
My poor mom.

621
00:35:09,093 --> 00:35:12,082
Where can she get that much money?

622
00:35:12,892 --> 00:35:14,082
Gosh.

623
00:35:14,202 --> 00:35:17,283
What will happen to her
if she fails to pay them back?

624
00:35:18,573 --> 00:35:22,192
How can they harvest organs
from a living person?

625
00:35:28,713 --> 00:35:29,962
Ms. Baek, my gosh.

626
00:35:30,983 --> 00:35:32,232
Ms. Baek.

627
00:35:33,153 --> 00:35:36,403
Ms. Baek, how did it go?

628
00:35:36,852 --> 00:35:40,002
What do we do?
It's not like we can run away.

629
00:35:40,923 --> 00:35:44,283
Why did you borrow money
from people that scary?

630
00:35:47,832 --> 00:35:49,013
Ji Young.

631
00:35:52,332 --> 00:35:53,953
There's a way...

632
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:56,423
out of this mess.

633
00:35:56,642 --> 00:35:57,792
What?

634
00:35:59,012 --> 00:36:00,292
What is it?

635
00:36:00,642 --> 00:36:01,792
But...

636
00:36:02,483 --> 00:36:05,633
it can't be done without your help.

637
00:36:06,352 --> 00:36:07,703
Me?

638
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:11,073
Do I have to perform
at a nightclub again?

639
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:14,062
But when will I earn 500,000 dollars
by performing on stage?

640
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:17,473
Besides, doing that
will be a breach of contract.

641
00:36:18,193 --> 00:36:19,513
That's not it.

642
00:36:20,162 --> 00:36:23,352
I'm sure you know CEO Gong Jin Dan.

643
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:26,982
Yes, I do.

644
00:36:27,273 --> 00:36:28,453
You see,

645
00:36:29,602 --> 00:36:31,093
back when you were Do Ra,

646
00:36:32,213 --> 00:36:34,263
you were engaged to him.

647
00:36:35,312 --> 00:36:38,062
What? Me? My gosh.

648
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:40,363
You...

649
00:36:41,352 --> 00:36:44,403
may not remember
since the memories are lost on you,

650
00:36:45,722 --> 00:36:47,203
but you and Mr. Gong...

651
00:36:48,622 --> 00:36:50,372
were in love.

652
00:36:52,693 --> 00:36:54,752
Is that true?

653
00:36:55,803 --> 00:36:56,982
Yes.

654
00:36:57,303 --> 00:37:01,153
Mr. Gong had feelings for you
because you reminded him of her.

655
00:37:03,202 --> 00:37:04,363
Ji Young.

656
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:06,792
Can't you...

657
00:37:07,372 --> 00:37:09,082
go back to Mr. Gong?

658
00:37:09,082 --> 00:37:12,703
If things can work out
between you and him,

659
00:37:13,253 --> 00:37:14,772
he'll give me 500,000 dollars.

660
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,502
Ms. Baek,
what are you talking about?

661
00:37:18,852 --> 00:37:21,062
I don't remember my past,

662
00:37:21,062 --> 00:37:24,093
and I have no feelings
for him at all.

663
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:26,383
How can I date a man I don't like?

664
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:29,412
Besides, he's already engaged.

665
00:37:29,702 --> 00:37:33,183
No, that's not true. They broke up.

666
00:37:33,803 --> 00:37:37,662
Also, he helped us immensely
back when you were Do Ra.

667
00:37:37,773 --> 00:37:41,012
If Ko Pil Seung
hadn't gotten in the way,

668
00:37:41,012 --> 00:37:43,662
you would've married Mr. Gong.

669
00:37:43,912 --> 00:37:46,102
Then...

670
00:37:46,613 --> 00:37:49,372
Did I betray Mr. Gong?

671
00:37:49,783 --> 00:37:51,272
That's right.

672
00:37:51,423 --> 00:37:55,023
Your engagement to him
was in the press.

673
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,442
Should I show you the article?

674
00:38:00,762 --> 00:38:03,953
Here. See for yourself.

675
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:07,923
My gosh.

676
00:38:08,403 --> 00:38:10,053
You're right.

677
00:38:10,573 --> 00:38:12,863
Exactly. Read the article.

678
00:38:13,943 --> 00:38:17,863
He held out his hand for us
when our family had lost everything.

679
00:38:19,082 --> 00:38:21,452
He's a sweetheart
if you get to know him.

680
00:38:21,452 --> 00:38:22,602
But...

681
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:25,992
you couldn't stay engaged to him
because of Ko Pil Seung.

682
00:38:25,992 --> 00:38:29,593
When you betrayed Mr. Gong
and went to Ko Pil Seung,

683
00:38:29,593 --> 00:38:31,992
Mr. Gong took down
all the related articles...

684
00:38:31,992 --> 00:38:33,642
to maintain your reputation.

685
00:38:33,963 --> 00:38:36,553
That's how decent that man is.

686
00:38:38,702 --> 00:38:42,319
Does he know that I'm Park Do Ra?

687
00:38:42,343 --> 00:38:44,692
No, he doesn't.

688
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:47,122
No one can know you're her.

689
00:38:48,082 --> 00:38:49,682
If people find out you're Do Ra,

690
00:38:49,682 --> 00:38:51,352
people will harass you
day and night.

691
00:38:51,352 --> 00:38:55,173
No one but our family
can know that you're Park Do Ra.

692
00:38:55,653 --> 00:38:56,973
Ji Young,

693
00:38:57,753 --> 00:39:00,042
please hide the fact
that you're Do Ra...

694
00:39:00,823 --> 00:39:02,843
and meet with Mr. Gong.

695
00:39:05,162 --> 00:39:07,162
Ms. Baek, please.

696
00:39:07,162 --> 00:39:08,412
Ji Young.

697
00:39:09,202 --> 00:39:11,033
That's our only way to survive.

698
00:39:11,033 --> 00:39:14,903
Please...
Please help your mother this once.

699
00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:17,653
Think about Do Sik and Do Jun.

700
00:39:17,713 --> 00:39:19,962
Please help them this one time.

701
00:39:26,996 --> 00:39:28,347
Ms. Baek...

702
00:39:40,223 --> 00:39:41,572
Gosh.

703
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:51,413
Whose photo is this?

704
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,623
Hold on.

705
00:39:53,994 --> 00:39:55,843
It's not Pil Seung,

706
00:39:57,094 --> 00:40:00,253
but he looks a lot like him.
Who could it be?

707
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:23,673
Hey.

708
00:40:25,893 --> 00:40:27,943
What's wrong? Is something up?

709
00:40:28,994 --> 00:40:30,383
No, I...

710
00:40:31,094 --> 00:40:32,244
I found...

711
00:40:32,752 --> 00:40:35,572
a weird photo in Pil Seung's wallet.

712
00:40:36,574 --> 00:40:37,873
What photo?

713
00:40:37,873 --> 00:40:40,244
He carries around a photo
of the three of us.

714
00:40:40,244 --> 00:40:44,193
Right, but I found another one.

715
00:40:45,913 --> 00:40:49,133
It was of a man
who looked like Pil Seung.

716
00:40:50,313 --> 00:40:51,604
I think...

717
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,074
he's Pil Seung's biological father.

718
00:40:54,654 --> 00:40:56,673
They look too much alike.

719
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:03,113
Ms. Jang must have given him
that photo.

720
00:41:08,534 --> 00:41:11,954
Hey, Pil Seung. What is it?
Shouldn't you be in bed?

721
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,474
I had something to tell you two.

722
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:17,523
Really? What is it?

723
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:23,503
I found out
about my biological father today.

724
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:32,054
Ms. Jang called me out of the blue.

725
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:34,673
She said she had something important
to give me, so we met.

726
00:41:35,563 --> 00:41:37,313
She gave me a photo of my birth dad.

727
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:41,713
He was a Korean-American,

728
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,824
and he died in a hiking accident...

729
00:41:45,074 --> 00:41:46,523
when he was 28.

730
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,693
Oh, okay. I see.

731
00:41:54,344 --> 00:41:56,863
Pil Seung. That photo...

732
00:41:57,753 --> 00:41:59,503
Could we see it too?

733
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,434
Sure.

734
00:42:02,824 --> 00:42:03,974
Thanks.

735
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:08,914
Gosh, he was handsome.

736
00:42:10,293 --> 00:42:11,813
I see...

737
00:42:13,103 --> 00:42:15,483
Pil Seung looks like his dad.

738
00:42:15,773 --> 00:42:17,324
Right, honey?

739
00:42:19,844 --> 00:42:21,153
Yes.

740
00:42:24,614 --> 00:42:26,334
Part of me...

741
00:42:27,184 --> 00:42:28,994
always wondered...

742
00:42:30,353 --> 00:42:32,503
who my birth dad was.

743
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:37,173
I feel much better
now that I have a photo.

744
00:42:38,963 --> 00:42:40,914
Yes, you would.

745
00:42:41,724 --> 00:42:42,943
That's good.

746
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:46,184
Mom.

747
00:42:47,603 --> 00:42:50,624
I'm sorry I met Ms. Jang
without telling you.

748
00:42:51,974 --> 00:42:55,793
Gosh, don't.
Why would you apologize?

749
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,894
You work together.

750
00:43:00,983 --> 00:43:03,563
I'm okay as long as you are.

751
00:43:05,184 --> 00:43:06,374
Thank you.

752
00:43:06,824 --> 00:43:08,804
Go to bed. I'll go upstairs.

753
00:43:09,224 --> 00:43:11,773
- Okay. Go on upstairs.
- Good night.

754
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:15,784
- Sleep well.
- You too.

755
00:43:21,804 --> 00:43:23,023
Actually,

756
00:43:24,674 --> 00:43:27,324
I'd wanted to know...

757
00:43:28,704 --> 00:43:30,994
who his birth father was.

758
00:43:33,184 --> 00:43:36,963
Now that I've seen his face,
I feel much more at ease.

759
00:43:38,884 --> 00:43:40,074
So do I.

760
00:43:41,424 --> 00:43:43,343
I'd have always wondered...

761
00:43:43,924 --> 00:43:47,313
who Pil Seung's biological dad was.

762
00:43:49,663 --> 00:43:51,914
I'm grateful she gave him a photo.

763
00:44:09,483 --> 00:44:11,934
What did you do today?

764
00:44:14,724 --> 00:44:17,874
I went shopping
and bought some groceries.

765
00:44:19,864 --> 00:44:21,043
Okay.

766
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:24,084
How is Pil Seung doing?

767
00:44:24,293 --> 00:44:25,784
Is he working hard?

768
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:29,523
He's shooting a drama called
"The House of Roses?"

769
00:44:31,273 --> 00:44:34,093
Yes. I think he's doing well.

770
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:39,434
I haven't seen him in a while.

771
00:44:42,184 --> 00:44:43,934
How long has it been?

772
00:44:45,313 --> 00:44:47,474
You never met in private?

773
00:44:48,924 --> 00:44:51,123
No. Why would we meet in private...

774
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:52,613
when he's a busy man,

775
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:55,074
and I have no reason
to visit the set?

776
00:44:59,034 --> 00:45:00,253
Right.

777
00:45:17,554 --> 00:45:20,160
There, I found a photo of a baby.

778
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:22,083
Who keeps a photo of a baby
in her jewelry box?

779
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:23,574
Why would she hide it?

780
00:45:23,623 --> 00:45:26,494
I thought it looked like
Pil Seung as a baby,

781
00:45:26,494 --> 00:45:28,014
so I showed it to Sun Young.

782
00:45:28,264 --> 00:45:30,144
She said
it was Pil Seung's baby photo.

783
00:45:30,893 --> 00:45:34,014
Pil Seung isn't
Sun Young's biological son.

784
00:45:34,304 --> 00:45:35,954
You may not know about this,

785
00:45:36,503 --> 00:45:39,680
but there was a rumor about
Soo Yeon giving birth to a child.

786
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:41,093
This proves it.

787
00:45:47,413 --> 00:45:50,164
Yes. I think he's doing well.

788
00:45:51,813 --> 00:45:55,474
I haven't seen him in a while.

789
00:46:15,174 --> 00:46:17,264
Do you remember our promise?

790
00:46:17,413 --> 00:46:19,934
You bet.
I swear to keep the promise.

791
00:46:22,043 --> 00:46:24,903
If you don't and run away from home
and upset everyone,

792
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:27,104
I won't buy you any more ice cream.

793
00:46:27,853 --> 00:46:30,244
Okay, I got it.

794
00:46:31,523 --> 00:46:33,113
You're so silly.

795
00:46:35,424 --> 00:46:37,709
You got some on your shirt.

796
00:46:37,733 --> 00:46:40,184
- Where?
- Thanks for bowing to me.

797
00:46:42,003 --> 00:46:43,423
Hello, Grandma.

798
00:46:43,773 --> 00:46:44,923
What?

799
00:46:48,904 --> 00:46:50,193
Darn you.

800
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:51,919
How could you?

801
00:46:51,943 --> 00:46:53,543
- Okay, sorry.
- Stay still.

802
00:46:53,543 --> 00:46:56,284
- I need to get even.
- Okay, I won't do it again.

803
00:46:56,284 --> 00:46:57,963
- Hold still.
- I'll wipe it off.

804
00:46:58,954 --> 00:47:00,900
- Don't eat anymore.
- Why not?

805
00:47:00,924 --> 00:47:02,874
Why say that
when you put it on my face?

806
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,304
There.

807
00:47:04,994 --> 00:47:07,974
Were Ma Ri and Pil Seung that close?

808
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:20,168
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

809
00:47:24,713 --> 00:47:25,713
Hey.

810
00:47:26,184 --> 00:47:27,443
- Dad.
- Take a seat.

811
00:47:27,443 --> 00:47:28,583
Why did you call me?

812
00:47:30,313 --> 00:47:33,523
I'm hurt and upset.

813
00:47:33,724 --> 00:47:35,523
You were in the neighborhood,

814
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,554
and you didn't call me.

815
00:47:38,253 --> 00:47:40,724
How did you know I was nearby?

816
00:47:41,364 --> 00:47:44,463
I felt your presence
with my superpowers.

817
00:47:44,463 --> 00:47:46,304
That's silly.

818
00:47:47,634 --> 00:47:49,574
I was coming back from a meeting,

819
00:47:50,134 --> 00:47:53,143
and I saw you and Pil Seung
walk along having ice cream.

820
00:47:53,344 --> 00:47:54,804
You even had your arm in his.

821
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:57,373
Ma Ri.

822
00:47:58,273 --> 00:48:00,443
Do you like him again?

823
00:48:01,114 --> 00:48:02,983
Do you want to marry him?

824
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,014
No, Dad.

825
00:48:05,014 --> 00:48:08,353
Pil Seung is just like
an older brother.

826
00:48:09,054 --> 00:48:12,353
Don't be silly, Dad.
How can a brother and sister marry?

827
00:48:12,594 --> 00:48:14,224
Don't even think of that.

828
00:48:14,523 --> 00:48:16,963
A brother and sister can't marry.

829
00:48:16,963 --> 00:48:18,463
That's not right.

830
00:48:19,364 --> 00:48:20,764
Oh, really?

831
00:48:21,534 --> 00:48:24,733
I was going to sit down
and talk to him...

832
00:48:24,733 --> 00:48:27,003
if you said you liked him again.

833
00:48:27,503 --> 00:48:29,244
You can't.
Don't say anything like that.

834
00:48:29,244 --> 00:48:31,143
Pil Seung and I can't marry.

835
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:34,043
Okay, fine.

836
00:48:36,454 --> 00:48:39,454
Dad, I'll be late for class.
I have to go.

837
00:48:40,324 --> 00:48:42,023
Okay. Stay safe.

838
00:48:42,284 --> 00:48:43,293
I will.

839
00:48:59,943 --> 00:49:01,043
Pil...

840
00:49:02,304 --> 00:49:03,344
Director Ko.

841
00:49:04,913 --> 00:49:07,014
I'm not here with another motive.

842
00:49:07,943 --> 00:49:09,813
I had to sign some papers.

843
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,554
You must do your job too.

844
00:49:13,253 --> 00:49:14,353
Goodbye.

845
00:49:14,784 --> 00:49:16,094
I must prepare for tomorrow's shoot.

846
00:49:35,873 --> 00:49:38,174
A brother and sister can't marry.

847
00:49:38,174 --> 00:49:39,784
That's not right.

848
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:48,353
I want a divorce.

849
00:49:49,393 --> 00:49:50,693
This isn't something sudden.

850
00:49:55,563 --> 00:49:57,063
I've been thinking...

851
00:49:58,793 --> 00:50:01,864
about a divorce for quite some time.

852
00:50:07,996 --> 00:50:10,496
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

853
00:50:14,744 --> 00:50:15,963
Mr. Gu.

854
00:50:16,853 --> 00:50:19,003
I need you
to look into something quietly.

855
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:34,514
Excuse me.

856
00:50:36,873 --> 00:50:38,054
Me?

857
00:50:38,733 --> 00:50:41,124
I fell for you at first sight.

858
00:50:41,744 --> 00:50:43,293
Can I have your number?

859
00:50:44,514 --> 00:50:46,664
I fell for me at first sight?

860
00:50:47,483 --> 00:50:49,334
Give me your phone.

861
00:50:54,023 --> 00:50:56,474
Sorry. She's my girlfriend.

862
00:50:57,494 --> 00:50:59,503
Oh, I apologize.

863
00:51:03,233 --> 00:51:04,414
What?

864
00:51:04,534 --> 00:51:06,653
I'm your girlfriend?

865
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:10,153
Ma Ri. You can't
give your number to just anyone.

866
00:51:10,273 --> 00:51:11,954
You don't know what they're like.

867
00:51:12,103 --> 00:51:14,443
He said he fell in love
at first sight.

868
00:51:14,443 --> 00:51:15,643
We could be friends.

869
00:51:15,643 --> 00:51:17,293
It could also be dangerous.

870
00:51:17,614 --> 00:51:20,764
So from now on
tell people you have a boyfriend.

871
00:51:21,213 --> 00:51:22,693
I don't have one.

872
00:51:23,154 --> 00:51:25,334
Just say that you do.

873
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:27,503
Okay?

874
00:51:31,753 --> 00:51:34,874
Does that mean
I just got a boyfriend?

875
00:51:38,364 --> 00:51:39,684
Hey, Eun Hee.

876
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:42,184
It's been a long time.

877
00:51:42,634 --> 00:51:44,733
I'm on my way to the store now.

878
00:51:44,733 --> 00:51:46,293
Do you want to come over
to my store?

879
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:48,954
Okay. I'll see you then.

880
00:52:02,924 --> 00:52:04,144
My baby.

881
00:52:05,094 --> 00:52:06,414
My Ae Kyo.

882
00:52:10,793 --> 00:52:14,284
She hasn't changed at all.

883
00:52:17,574 --> 00:52:18,854
My gosh.

884
00:52:19,543 --> 00:52:22,174
Ae Kyo, are you sure
you're the owner of this store?

885
00:52:22,174 --> 00:52:24,293
Yes. My son got it for me.

886
00:52:24,744 --> 00:52:26,534
My goodness.

887
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:29,884
You'd go around only with a purse...

888
00:52:29,884 --> 00:52:32,164
saying you wanted
to eat cream puffs.

889
00:52:32,213 --> 00:52:34,054
But after giving birth to a son,

890
00:52:34,054 --> 00:52:35,753
you became the wife
of APP Group's chairman right away.

891
00:52:35,753 --> 00:52:36,924
My goodness.

892
00:52:36,924 --> 00:52:38,999
It's like a rags-to-riches story.

893
00:52:39,023 --> 00:52:40,494
Come on.

894
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:43,414
You just blabber on,
just like you used to.

895
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,364
I heard you were in Brazil,
by the way.

896
00:52:45,364 --> 00:52:46,704
Why did you come to Korea?

897
00:52:46,704 --> 00:52:49,503
My husband is on vacation,

898
00:52:49,503 --> 00:52:51,224
so I'm staying in Korea for a month.

899
00:52:51,304 --> 00:52:54,124
Oh, right. I hear you and Soo Yeon
are living in the same house.

900
00:52:54,574 --> 00:52:57,344
You're the mother-in-law,
and she's the daughter-in-law.

901
00:52:57,344 --> 00:52:59,474
Hey, it started a long time ago.
Why are you asking...

902
00:52:59,474 --> 00:53:00,543
after all this time?

903
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:03,633
Hey, that's
such an interesting coincidence.

904
00:53:03,983 --> 00:53:06,503
Isn't that strange and fun?

905
00:53:07,654 --> 00:53:10,753
So is your daughter-in-law,
Soo Yeon doing fine?

906
00:53:10,753 --> 00:53:12,273
Yes, she's doing well.

907
00:53:12,654 --> 00:53:13,800
How many children does she have?

908
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:14,864
One girl.

909
00:53:14,864 --> 00:53:15,864
Really?

910
00:53:15,864 --> 00:53:17,864
Her daughter is
the same age as mine,

911
00:53:17,864 --> 00:53:19,144
so she must be married.

912
00:53:19,193 --> 00:53:22,010
No way. She's not married yet.

913
00:53:22,034 --> 00:53:25,050
She's 34, and she's still single?

914
00:53:25,074 --> 00:53:27,554
Oh, well. People tend to marry
at a later age these days.

915
00:53:28,003 --> 00:53:30,873
Did you say 34? That's not true.

916
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:33,643
Ma Ri is only 28.
What are you talking about?

917
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:36,733
Hey, you said
she had only one daughter.

918
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:39,483
Then she should be 34, not 28.

919
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:42,154
When I was almost due
with my daughter,

920
00:53:42,154 --> 00:53:44,123
Soo Yeon was near
the end of her pregnancy too.

921
00:53:44,123 --> 00:53:46,514
What did you say?

922
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:49,094
When you were pregnant
with your daughter,

923
00:53:49,094 --> 00:53:50,813
Soo Yeon was almost due?

924
00:53:51,134 --> 00:53:53,684
Eun Hee, are you sure?

925
00:53:53,934 --> 00:53:55,240
I'm sure.

926
00:53:55,264 --> 00:53:57,373
Soo Yeon didn't see me back then,

927
00:53:57,373 --> 00:53:59,854
but I'm sure I saw her
at Bless Hospital.

928
00:54:00,074 --> 00:54:02,904
She was as big as I was.

929
00:54:02,904 --> 00:54:05,990
So I thought we'd give birth
around the same time.

930
00:54:06,014 --> 00:54:09,083
Since then,
on my daughter's birthday every year,

931
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:10,784
I always wondered...

932
00:54:10,784 --> 00:54:12,614
if Soo Yeon's kid was growing well.

933
00:54:12,614 --> 00:54:14,704
Are you serious?

934
00:54:14,983 --> 00:54:16,293
Are you sure?

935
00:54:16,293 --> 00:54:19,054
How many times
do I have to tell you?

936
00:54:19,054 --> 00:54:21,673
Do you think I mistook
someone else for Soo Yeon?

937
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:25,193
Wait. Hey.

938
00:54:25,193 --> 00:54:28,383
Did I just make a mistake?

939
00:54:28,804 --> 00:54:29,954
Eun Hee.

940
00:54:30,404 --> 00:54:33,543
What you just told me
and what you saw.

941
00:54:33,543 --> 00:54:35,724
Can you say that to Chairman Gong?

942
00:54:36,003 --> 00:54:38,523
Do you want me to talk
to Soo Yeon's husband?

943
00:54:39,313 --> 00:54:41,093
My goodness.

944
00:54:41,844 --> 00:54:43,063
No way.

945
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,284
Hey, Ae Kyo.

946
00:54:45,284 --> 00:54:48,284
Please just pretend
you didn't hear it from me.

947
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:52,123
I think there was
some kind of misunderstanding.

948
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:54,769
I'm busy, so I should get going.

949
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:56,663
My goodness.

950
00:54:56,663 --> 00:54:57,914
Eun Hee.

951
00:55:01,333 --> 00:55:04,454
Ma Ri is 28, and Pil Seung is 34.

952
00:55:04,904 --> 00:55:07,923
Even the story
about their ages adds up.

953
00:55:09,003 --> 00:55:10,043
That's right.

954
00:55:10,043 --> 00:55:13,434
I'm sure Pil Seung is
Soo Yeon's son.

955
00:55:13,684 --> 00:55:15,164
I was right about that.

956
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:20,474
I have to stay calm though.

957
00:55:21,654 --> 00:55:24,543
I will need
some hard evidence this time.

958
00:55:25,594 --> 00:55:28,644
If I jump the gun,
it will only backfire on me.

959
00:55:29,123 --> 00:55:30,744
They will think I'm insane.

960
00:55:40,873 --> 00:55:44,293
I got them, but I don't know
which one is Soo Yeon's.

961
00:55:44,614 --> 00:55:47,193
I don't know.
I'll have them tested anyway.

962
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:52,934
Sun Young. Ms. So.

963
00:55:53,253 --> 00:55:55,003
Is anyone here?

964
00:55:55,523 --> 00:55:57,003
Who is this?

965
00:56:05,364 --> 00:56:07,184
What brings you here?

966
00:56:08,163 --> 00:56:10,584
Sun Young isn't here.
She is at the restaurant.

967
00:56:10,704 --> 00:56:14,454
I see. So Sun Young is working
at the restaurant now.

968
00:56:15,043 --> 00:56:18,643
Ms. So, I was in the neighborhood
to take care of something,

969
00:56:18,643 --> 00:56:20,184
and I was really thirsty.

970
00:56:20,184 --> 00:56:22,034
Can I have some water, please?

971
00:56:23,253 --> 00:56:24,604
Water?

972
00:56:24,753 --> 00:56:28,574
So are you saying you're here
just to get some water?

973
00:56:40,534 --> 00:56:41,684
What?

974
00:56:41,864 --> 00:56:45,153
Where did she go
after asking me for some water?

975
00:56:46,074 --> 00:56:47,554
Did she leave?

976
00:56:50,813 --> 00:56:53,363
What? Her shoes are here.

977
00:56:54,943 --> 00:56:56,133
Wait.

978
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:59,114
You asked me for water.

979
00:56:59,114 --> 00:57:00,684
What were you doing there?

980
00:57:00,684 --> 00:57:02,483
The thing is,

981
00:57:02,483 --> 00:57:05,594
I wasn't actually thirsty.
I needed to use the bathroom.

982
00:57:05,594 --> 00:57:06,773
So...

983
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:09,474
We have the bathroom
on the first floor.

984
00:57:09,934 --> 00:57:12,684
Why did you go upstairs?

985
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:15,764
I got you some water anyway.
Do you want some?

986
00:57:15,764 --> 00:57:16,780
No, it's okay.

987
00:57:16,804 --> 00:57:18,503
Thank you for letting me use
the bathroom.

988
00:57:18,503 --> 00:57:20,450
Thank you. Take care.

989
00:57:20,474 --> 00:57:21,624
What?

990
00:57:25,514 --> 00:57:26,543
My gosh.

991
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:29,514
She could've said that
she needed to use the bathroom.

992
00:57:29,514 --> 00:57:32,264
Why would she go back
on her words like that?

993
00:57:32,614 --> 00:57:35,934
What a waste of time.

994
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:47,134
Mom, I'm going out.

995
00:57:47,134 --> 00:57:50,634
Myung Dong, come here.
Eat this before you go.

996
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:51,983
What is it?

997
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:56,724
Hey, you often bump into things.

998
00:57:57,213 --> 00:57:59,693
Take this so I can stop
worrying about you.

999
00:58:00,184 --> 00:58:02,133
Gosh, I'm busy.

1000
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:07,773
You're old enough
to take care of your health.

1001
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:09,934
Okay.

1002
00:58:14,693 --> 00:58:15,914
Myung Dong.

1003
00:58:16,563 --> 00:58:19,043
You work on your screenplay
every day.

1004
00:58:19,264 --> 00:58:21,284
When is it going to be on TV?

1005
00:58:22,063 --> 00:58:24,204
I don't know. Why ask such a thing?

1006
00:58:24,204 --> 00:58:25,354
What?

1007
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,079
My gosh.

1008
00:58:28,103 --> 00:58:30,943
Why did she choose
such a difficult path...

1009
00:58:30,943 --> 00:58:33,593
just to go through all the trouble?

1010
00:58:45,494 --> 00:58:46,713
Hey.

1011
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:52,070
Lady, go tell Ms. Baek
what I say to you.

1012
00:58:52,094 --> 00:58:54,454
That I want her to eat well
and stay healthy.

1013
00:58:54,733 --> 00:58:56,784
She should be in good health
to have good organs.

1014
00:58:57,074 --> 00:59:00,593
And we know where Park Do Jun lives.

1015
00:59:01,043 --> 00:59:03,253
My people are watching him there.

1016
00:59:03,543 --> 00:59:06,023
So she shouldn't be trying
to run away or kill herself.

1017
00:59:06,913 --> 00:59:08,059
Do you understand?

1018
00:59:08,083 --> 00:59:10,563
She will pay you back.

1019
00:59:10,784 --> 00:59:12,654
She will pay back the money,

1020
00:59:12,654 --> 00:59:14,704
so please don't say
such scary things.

1021
00:59:17,123 --> 00:59:18,903
She better pay us back.

1022
00:59:19,795 --> 00:59:22,396
(Director Ko Pil Seung)

1023
00:59:23,534 --> 00:59:24,744
Ji Young,

1024
00:59:25,693 --> 00:59:28,284
don't ever forget
that I'm here to support you.

1025
00:59:29,103 --> 00:59:32,554
Call me if you ever need my help.

1026
00:59:50,324 --> 00:59:51,503
No.

1027
00:59:52,454 --> 00:59:55,543
It would be just wrong
to ask Director Ko for money.

1028
00:59:56,264 --> 00:59:58,744
I mean, it's
an immense amount of money.

1029
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,554
I just can't be...

1030
01:00:03,373 --> 01:00:05,354
so shameless like that.

1031
01:00:22,154 --> 01:00:23,434
Do Ra.

1032
01:00:23,554 --> 01:00:26,813
Your mom, Do Sik, and Do Jun.

1033
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,514
Look after them for me.

1034
01:00:31,764 --> 01:00:34,813
You said that to me
in my dream the other day, Dad.

1035
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:40,153
Dad, please don't worry.

1036
01:00:41,074 --> 01:00:43,423
My mom, Do Sik, and Do Jun.

1037
01:00:44,043 --> 01:00:45,264
My family.

1038
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,633
I'll save them.

1039
01:01:03,563 --> 01:01:05,983
Ji Young, where have you been?

1040
01:01:14,773 --> 01:01:15,954
Ms. Baek.

1041
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:19,264
Yes, Ji Young.

1042
01:01:20,983 --> 01:01:23,034
If I go out with CEO Gong,

1043
01:01:23,753 --> 01:01:26,363
are you sure
he will pay off your debt?

1044
01:01:27,623 --> 01:01:28,804
Yes.

1045
01:01:30,224 --> 01:01:33,104
He'll pay off the debt.
Every penny of it.

1046
01:01:35,893 --> 01:01:37,284
All right.

1047
01:01:38,934 --> 01:01:40,383
I'll meet with him.

1048
01:01:42,804 --> 01:01:43,954
Ji Young.

1049
01:01:46,574 --> 01:01:48,554
You made the right choice.

1050
01:01:48,943 --> 01:01:50,124
Mr. Gong...

1051
01:01:50,943 --> 01:01:53,273
is a decent man.

1052
01:01:53,273 --> 01:01:56,494
You were right to choose him.

1053
01:01:57,483 --> 01:02:01,023
You saved us all, Ji Young.

1054
01:02:01,023 --> 01:02:03,334
Thank you, my daughter.

1055
01:02:03,654 --> 01:02:05,104
Thank you so much.

1056
01:02:05,853 --> 01:02:07,374
Thank you, Ji Young.

1057
01:02:08,663 --> 01:02:10,514
I truly appreciate it.

1058
01:02:13,094 --> 01:02:14,383
Thank you.

1059
01:02:14,903 --> 01:02:17,773
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

1060
01:02:23,813 --> 01:02:25,264
Yes, Mr. Gu.

1061
01:02:27,913 --> 01:02:29,133
What?

1062
01:02:31,284 --> 01:02:33,034
She was set to marry another man?

1063
01:02:34,384 --> 01:02:35,604
And his name?

1064
01:02:36,623 --> 01:02:38,173
Kim Sung Soo.

1065
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:43,613
All right. Keep looking into it.

1066
01:02:52,217 --> 01:02:54,456
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

1067
01:03:05,454 --> 01:03:06,664
Auntie!

1068
01:03:08,753 --> 01:03:11,704
Auntie, look.

1069
01:03:12,753 --> 01:03:15,613
Goodness. What's up with you
this time around?

1070
01:03:15,864 --> 01:03:18,610
Auntie, don't let this
shock you to death.

1071
01:03:18,634 --> 01:03:20,514
You must brace yourself.

1072
01:03:20,864 --> 01:03:22,713
What is this about?

1073
01:03:22,764 --> 01:03:25,574
What are you making
a huge fuss over?

1074
01:03:25,574 --> 01:03:29,554
I requested a DNA test
between Soo Yeon and Pil Seung,

1075
01:03:29,643 --> 01:03:31,943
and they're mother and son.

1076
01:03:31,943 --> 01:03:33,583
The probability
is 99.9999 percent or whatever.

1077
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:35,844
Anyway, it's for sure.

1078
01:03:35,844 --> 01:03:38,463
- Just look.
- What was that?

1079
01:03:43,161 --> 01:03:44,274
(Jang Soo Yeon and Ko Pil Seung
are mother and son.)

1080
01:03:44,298 --> 01:03:46,847
"Jang Soo Yeon and Ko Pil Seung..."

1081
01:03:47,622 --> 01:03:49,641
"are mother and son."

1082
01:03:50,321 --> 01:03:53,272
My gosh. I can't believe it.

1083
01:03:54,031 --> 01:03:55,861
- Goodness me.
- My gosh.

1084
01:03:55,861 --> 01:03:58,361
Auntie, are you all right?

1085
01:03:58,361 --> 01:04:00,082
- Please stay with me.
- I can't believe this.

1086
01:04:00,531 --> 01:04:03,522
My gosh. How can this be?

1087
01:04:03,801 --> 01:04:05,551
Sure. Get home safely.

1088
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:08,522
Chairman Gong!

1089
01:04:08,671 --> 01:04:11,317
Soo Yeon must be
thrown out immediately!

1090
01:04:11,341 --> 01:04:12,712
Kick her out.

1091
01:04:12,712 --> 01:04:14,852
- What... What are you saying?
- Here.

1092
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:18,132
Just look at this.

1093
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:21,301
I can't believe it.

1094
01:04:22,551 --> 01:04:23,741
See?

1095
01:04:24,721 --> 01:04:25,942
My gosh.

1096
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:31,451
I'm home.

1097
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:39,692
Where's Jin Taek?

1098
01:04:40,841 --> 01:04:42,221
Chairman Gong!

1099
01:04:42,772 --> 01:04:44,031
Chairman Gong.

1100
01:04:53,151 --> 01:04:54,301
Jang Soo Yeon!

1101
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:10,356
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1102
01:05:42,316 --> 01:05:44,038
Grandma, I can't today.

1103
01:05:44,062 --> 01:05:45,792
I have something important to do.

1104
01:05:45,792 --> 01:05:48,232
Be nice and have fun with Ms. Baek.

1105
01:05:48,232 --> 01:05:49,607
I won't be gone long.

1106
01:05:49,631 --> 01:05:51,808
You promise, right?

1107
01:05:51,832 --> 01:05:54,772
You won't leave me all alone
and go somewhere far away?

1108
01:05:54,772 --> 01:05:56,832
What was I to you all this time?

1109
01:05:56,832 --> 01:05:58,341
An empty shell of a man?

1110
01:05:58,341 --> 01:06:00,202
That punk's Soo Yeon's hidden son?

1111
01:06:00,202 --> 01:06:02,741
Are you going to let Ko Pil Seung
roam around the building like that?

1112
01:06:02,741 --> 01:06:04,341
If you can't do it,
I'll do it myself.

1113
01:06:04,341 --> 01:06:05,611
Let me take care of it all.

1114
01:06:05,611 --> 01:06:08,087
Ms. Jang passed out
in front of the office building.

1115
01:06:08,111 --> 01:06:09,952
I brought her to the hospital,

1116
01:06:09,952 --> 01:06:11,151
but she still hasn't woken up.

1117
01:06:11,151 --> 01:06:13,031
I'm afraid you're needed here.

1118
01:06:14,051 --> 01:06:16,051
