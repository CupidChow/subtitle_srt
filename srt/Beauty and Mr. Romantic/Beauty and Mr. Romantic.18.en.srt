(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:39,363
You are my star,

3
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:40,973
and I'm your moon.

(Episode 18)

6
00:01:00,615 --> 00:01:01,856
How is this possible?

7
00:01:04,085 --> 00:01:06,426
How can Ms. Kim
have that star tattoo on her ankle?

8
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:09,435
Could she...

9
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:13,466
really be Do Ra?

10
00:01:14,736 --> 00:01:17,276
Director Ko, the credit card.

11
00:01:17,665 --> 00:01:19,606
I forgot to give it to you.

12
00:01:22,605 --> 00:01:25,545
Director Ko, what is it?
Is something the matter?

13
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:27,886
Gosh, no.

14
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:30,686
Something important came up,

15
00:01:30,686 --> 00:01:32,186
and I have someplace to be.

16
00:01:32,186 --> 00:01:33,425
Can you look after Ms. Kim?

17
00:01:34,615 --> 00:01:36,585
Sure. Don't worry
and run your errand.

18
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:37,825
I'll make sure she's okay.

19
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:40,795
Thanks. Call me if anything happens.

20
00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:41,996
Sure.

21
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:48,006
That's right. I must confirm it.

22
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:50,506
I must find out about Ms. Kim.

23
00:01:51,206 --> 00:01:52,875
Is she really
that old lady's granddaughter?

24
00:02:03,186 --> 00:02:06,226
Mom, let's go over
to Ms. Kim's place.

25
00:02:06,885 --> 00:02:10,425
I want to see Pil Seung like crazy.

26
00:02:10,725 --> 00:02:12,656
Ma Ri, I already told you...

27
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:15,096
that Pil Seung isn't home.

28
00:02:15,096 --> 00:02:17,726
He's too busy
filming his drama series...

29
00:02:17,726 --> 00:02:20,635
that even Sun Young
hasn't been able to see him lately.

30
00:02:21,565 --> 00:02:24,135
Then let's visit him on set.
We can do just that.

31
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:28,576
Gosh, what are you saying?

32
00:02:28,576 --> 00:02:30,106
Interrupting someone
at his workplace?

33
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:32,546
That's absurd and completely rude.

34
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:36,315
You don't know
Pil Seung's phone number,

35
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:38,625
and you won't let me
visit him on set.

36
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:41,526
At least tell me where he lives.

37
00:02:42,226 --> 00:02:44,195
Tell me, Mom.

38
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:47,555
Ma Ri, please.
What's the matter with you?

39
00:02:47,555 --> 00:02:49,296
This isn't something
to throw a tantrum over.

40
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:52,896
I finally found the man of my dreams
who I've been looking for,

41
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:54,435
but you won't let me see him.

42
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:56,666
I'll wait for him at his house...

43
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,905
until he gets home.

44
00:02:57,905 --> 00:03:00,506
That's how much I want to see him.

45
00:03:00,506 --> 00:03:03,776
All right, fine. But later, Ma Ri.

46
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:06,476
Pil Seung's busy today, and so am I.

47
00:03:06,476 --> 00:03:08,516
There will be other days.

48
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:11,115
Later, when? On what other day?

49
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:12,416
I hate you, Mom.

50
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,486
Ma Ri!

51
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,195
Goodness.

52
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:25,366
Was the man of Ma Ri's dreams...

53
00:03:25,896 --> 00:03:27,306
Sun Young's son?

54
00:03:28,305 --> 00:03:30,806
What are you talking about?

55
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:38,445
Grandma, there you are.

56
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:40,785
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

57
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:44,385
Me? Why would you want to see me?

58
00:03:45,815 --> 00:03:49,595
Grandma, you're friends
with Ms. Kim too, right?

59
00:03:50,486 --> 00:03:51,866
Of course.

60
00:03:52,296 --> 00:03:54,996
Then, you must know where she lives.

61
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:58,565
Can you tell me? Please.

62
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:02,535
What?

63
00:04:04,136 --> 00:04:07,576
Sun Young, look at how chubby
and tender these are.

64
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:10,275
It would make a great water kimchi.

65
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:11,976
We'll make water kimchi, then.

66
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:13,516
We can make a noodle dish
with it too.

67
00:04:14,076 --> 00:04:16,516
- Yes, that sounds good.
- Right.

68
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:19,125
My mouth is watering
at the sound of it.

69
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:22,326
Ms. Kim, are you home?

70
00:04:23,456 --> 00:04:24,526
Who could that be?

71
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:28,995
Who is it?

72
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:31,336
Gosh, welcome.

73
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:34,566
Ms. Kim, hi.

74
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:38,136
Hey, Ma Ri.
What brings you by our house?

75
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:39,446
- Sun Young.
- Yes?

76
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:40,535
Who is she?

77
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:43,245
She's the daughter
of my friend Soo Yeon.

78
00:04:44,746 --> 00:04:46,545
That rich friend of yours?

79
00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:50,555
- Oh, that friend.
- Yes.

80
00:04:51,085 --> 00:04:53,186
Ma Ri, say hello to her.

81
00:04:53,415 --> 00:04:54,886
She's Pil Seung's grandmother.

82
00:04:54,886 --> 00:04:59,165
Right. Hello, ma'am. I'm Gong Ma Ri.

83
00:04:59,196 --> 00:05:00,896
Yes, hello.

84
00:05:01,155 --> 00:05:02,725
Do Jun, say hello.

85
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:04,865
He's my driver and bodyguard.

86
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:06,835
- Hello.
- Yes, hi.

87
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:08,675
- Here you go.
- Goodness.

88
00:05:09,235 --> 00:05:11,646
This really wasn't necessary.
Thank you.

89
00:05:15,306 --> 00:05:17,376
Do Jun, wait for me in the car.

90
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:19,975
Okay. Goodbye.

91
00:05:19,975 --> 00:05:21,756
Bye, and thanks.

92
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:24,555
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes?

93
00:05:25,016 --> 00:05:26,725
Is Pil Seung not here?

94
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:28,425
What?

95
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:30,355
Is someone here?

96
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:33,595
Soo Yeon's daughter is here.

97
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:36,436
I see.

98
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:48,276
You fell in love with Pil Seung
at first sight?

99
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:51,876
Yes. Actually, about two years ago,

100
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:55,055
I was really angry with my dad.

101
00:05:55,246 --> 00:05:57,215
I prefer certain types of guys,

102
00:05:57,215 --> 00:05:59,956
and he kept telling me
to date someone I didn't like.

103
00:05:59,956 --> 00:06:02,225
- Oh, dear.
- So my dad and I fought,

104
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:03,995
- and hit the roof...
- What?

105
00:06:05,196 --> 00:06:07,466
Mom told me
not to say things like that.

106
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,365
Anyway, so,

107
00:06:10,896 --> 00:06:14,165
I ran out of the house
because I wanted to get away.

108
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:17,605
Right outside the subway station,
I bumped into a guy,

109
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:20,306
and I dropped
my little sister Ru Ru.

110
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:22,245
- What?
- Your sister Ru Ru?

111
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:25,615
The doll. Her doll.

112
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:29,946
But the man who bumped into me...

113
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:31,516
picked Ru Ru up for me,

114
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,956
and that person was Pil Seung.

115
00:06:34,985 --> 00:06:36,155
Goodness.

116
00:06:36,386 --> 00:06:39,256
He looked so cool and amazing.

117
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:41,665
A light was shining from his face,

118
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:44,225
and he looked exactly like a man
from a romantic novel.

119
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:45,396
Seriously?

120
00:06:45,396 --> 00:06:46,865
- Gosh.
- What?

121
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:48,576
He what?

122
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:52,006
I was so busy staring at him
because he was so cool,

123
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:55,076
I got too flustered
and I didn't ask for his number.

124
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:56,151
Oh, dear.

125
00:06:56,175 --> 00:06:58,545
I was so upset because I didn't know
how to find him,

126
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:00,975
but my mom said
if we were meant to be,

127
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:03,655
we would always meet again.

128
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:08,126
And just like destiny,
we did meet again.

129
00:07:08,556 --> 00:07:09,802
Ms. Gong.

130
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:12,126
No. I'm Gong Ma Ri.

131
00:07:12,126 --> 00:07:13,896
Just call me by my name.

132
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:17,665
Sorry because this might sound like
I'm ruining your idea of him,

133
00:07:18,535 --> 00:07:21,365
but my nephew Pil Seung
isn't a prince.

134
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,076
What kind of prince
lives in a house like this?

135
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:26,951
I know that much.

136
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,446
He's not a real prince.

137
00:07:28,446 --> 00:07:30,975
I'm saying he looked like one.

138
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:33,785
- Goodness.
- She knows her stuff.

139
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:36,886
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes?

140
00:07:37,186 --> 00:07:38,925
When will Pil Seung come home?

141
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:42,555
He comes home very late these days.

142
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:44,595
He must be busy filming.

143
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,665
I see.

144
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:50,235
Then could you give him a call?

145
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:52,305
A call?

146
00:07:52,436 --> 00:07:54,936
Yes, call him for her.

147
00:07:54,936 --> 00:07:56,605
It's not a difficult thing to do.

148
00:07:56,605 --> 00:07:58,745
Well... Okay, then.

149
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:01,576
I think he's busy.

150
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:13,785
He's not picking up.

151
00:08:14,386 --> 00:08:16,555
He has been very busy lately.

152
00:08:17,725 --> 00:08:20,196
I don't mind. I'll wait.

153
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:22,795
What?

154
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:34,975
Yes, that's it.

155
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:39,245
When I was very young,
I used to live here.

156
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:43,416
I remember that lady
and the grandma too.

157
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:47,355
Should I say hello later on?

158
00:08:48,586 --> 00:08:51,426
And say I'm the youngest kid Do Jun
who used to live here?

159
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:59,066
No. We ran away from this place
in the middle of the night.

160
00:09:01,496 --> 00:09:05,176
And I don't know what to say
if they were to ask about my family.

161
00:09:07,305 --> 00:09:08,505
Forget it.

162
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:12,086
Why bother
when they didn't recognize me?

163
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:17,456
Why isn't the grandpa at home?

164
00:09:21,285 --> 00:09:22,355
Here.

165
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:26,826
Ma'am. Do you know
the two-story house over there?

166
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:28,836
Is the old man still healthy?

167
00:09:29,396 --> 00:09:30,566
The two-story house?

168
00:09:31,626 --> 00:09:34,066
The former school principal
died long ago.

169
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:36,076
What?

170
00:09:36,905 --> 00:09:39,576
The old man died?

171
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:42,576
When?

172
00:09:43,006 --> 00:09:45,385
Has it been 15 years? 17, maybe?

173
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:48,216
Anyway, it was long ago.

174
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:52,556
How do you know that old man?

175
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:55,656
Never mind. Thanks.

176
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:13,405
Mom!

177
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,576
- Seo Jun.
- Mom!

178
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:18,046
- Min Ji.
- Mom!

179
00:10:18,476 --> 00:10:19,945
Did you have fun today?

180
00:10:19,945 --> 00:10:21,515
Hey, it's Grandpa.

181
00:10:26,256 --> 00:10:27,826
I came
because I heard it would rain.

182
00:10:27,955 --> 00:10:29,796
- Really?
- Yes.

183
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:33,066
Your mom is very busy.

184
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:37,166
Even if it rains,
I can run between the raindrops.

185
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:39,635
What? Run between the raindrops?

186
00:10:41,336 --> 00:10:43,275
That's impressive, Do Jun.

187
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:49,576
Do Jun.
Shall we get some jjajangmyeon?

188
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,475
- Yes, I'd like that.
- Let's go.

189
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:02,196
It tastes awesome, Grandpa.

190
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:04,901
- Is it that tasty?
- Yes.

191
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:07,126
Jjajangmyeon's my favorite food
in the world.

192
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:08,365
Is it?

193
00:11:08,665 --> 00:11:10,095
Then...

194
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:13,005
what about this tangsuyuk?

195
00:11:13,195 --> 00:11:14,836
Should I not have ordered this?

196
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:17,936
That doesn't mean
I don't like tangsuyuk.

197
00:11:19,675 --> 00:11:21,435
Eat all you want, Do Jun.

198
00:11:21,435 --> 00:11:23,646
Okay. You too, Grandpa.

199
00:11:23,646 --> 00:11:24,775
Okay.

200
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,345
Oh, thank you.

201
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:50,605
(Soonjung Diner)

202
00:12:04,346 --> 00:12:05,985
How are you, ma'am?

203
00:12:07,915 --> 00:12:10,956
Goodness. Who's this?

204
00:12:12,295 --> 00:12:15,265
Aren't you Ji Young's director boss?

205
00:12:15,496 --> 00:12:16,925
You are, aren't you?

206
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:17,995
Yes.

207
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:21,396
I was in the area for work,
so I dropped by.

208
00:12:21,396 --> 00:12:25,206
Goodness. That's so nice of you.

209
00:12:25,435 --> 00:12:27,505
No, I shouldn't keep you standing.

210
00:12:27,606 --> 00:12:30,245
Take a seat here.

211
00:12:30,746 --> 00:12:32,346
Please wait.

212
00:12:32,346 --> 00:12:34,646
I'll make you kalguksu
with lots of clams...

213
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:36,185
and small octopus.

214
00:12:36,185 --> 00:12:39,056
No, ma'am. I just ate.

215
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:41,086
Did you?

216
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:45,566
You came all the way here
and I can't treat you to kalguksu?

217
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:47,726
That's so upsetting.

218
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:50,665
I'll come by for some next time.
You can cook for me then.

219
00:12:50,665 --> 00:12:54,365
Then let me serve you a coffee.

220
00:12:54,396 --> 00:12:56,466
Sit here and wait a bit.

221
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:57,906
- Okay.
- Okay?

222
00:12:58,035 --> 00:12:59,145
Goodness.

223
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:06,921
Here you go.

224
00:13:06,945 --> 00:13:09,885
- Thank you.
- It's nice and sweet.

225
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:20,595
I'm not sure
if my Ji Young is doing...

226
00:13:21,295 --> 00:13:24,635
good enough work
to be worth her pay.

227
00:13:25,896 --> 00:13:28,706
She doesn't shy away from any jobs,

228
00:13:29,305 --> 00:13:32,546
but you make TV programs.

229
00:13:34,006 --> 00:13:38,375
Did Ji Young
get into trouble or something?

230
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:42,255
No, ma'am.
She's doing fine. Don't worry.

231
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:44,786
Oh, gosh. Is that true?

232
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:46,326
Good.

233
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:50,155
I was so worried
that she was living...

234
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:52,966
and working all on her own in Seoul.

235
00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:55,635
What you just told me...

236
00:13:56,065 --> 00:13:57,995
put me at ease.

237
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:02,306
Ma'am.

238
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:05,845
I heard that Ms. Kim...

239
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:08,245
was gravely injured two years ago.

240
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:13,385
The accident Ji Young was in?

241
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:17,816
I told her not to mention that.

242
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:22,156
Did Ji Young...

243
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:24,595
tell you everything?

244
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:28,166
Yes. She told me
she was in hospital for a long time.

245
00:14:30,096 --> 00:14:32,406
Yes. She was.

246
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:38,536
Since you say she told you
everything already,

247
00:14:39,476 --> 00:14:42,645
I might as well tell you the truth.

248
00:14:45,305 --> 00:14:48,686
Because of that dreadful accident,

249
00:14:49,616 --> 00:14:52,015
Ji Young
has no memory of her life...

250
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:55,725
before that time.

251
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:02,495
The doctor said she had amnesia.

252
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:05,565
Amnesia?

253
00:15:05,565 --> 00:15:06,735
Yes.

254
00:15:07,795 --> 00:15:11,306
And she ended up
with a whole new face.

255
00:15:15,175 --> 00:15:18,216
What do you mean
she got a whole new face?

256
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:23,355
The thing is,
in the dreadful accident,

257
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:27,355
she fell into the sea.

258
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:30,326
You can imagine
what she had to go through.

259
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:33,025
She was swept away by the waves...

260
00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:34,895
and dashed against the rocks.

261
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:40,088
My Ji Young
almost died in the accident.

262
00:15:40,435 --> 00:15:44,076
She had to go through
numerous surgeries too.

263
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:46,236
That's why...

264
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,676
her face has changed a lot.

265
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:52,686
Are you saying
Ji Young's face looks...

266
00:15:54,116 --> 00:15:55,846
a lot different from before?

267
00:15:55,846 --> 00:15:57,485
Yes, I am.

268
00:15:58,086 --> 00:15:59,815
After all those hardships,

269
00:15:59,815 --> 00:16:02,086
her looks can't stay the same.

270
00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:04,525
Of course, she looks different now.

271
00:16:07,455 --> 00:16:08,525
Then...

272
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:11,536
you must've been really shocked.

273
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:15,676
Now that her face looks different,

274
00:16:17,506 --> 00:16:19,375
she probably doesn't look
like your granddaughter.

275
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:22,376
That's impossible, Mr. Ko.

276
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:24,775
I lost my son and daughter-in-law...

277
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,746
in a horrible accident
on the same day and time.

278
00:16:27,746 --> 00:16:30,516
And I've raised Ji Young...

279
00:16:30,516 --> 00:16:31,985
since elementary school.

280
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:34,986
Ji Young is the only family...

281
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:37,255
I have left in this world.

282
00:16:37,685 --> 00:16:41,166
There's no way I can't recognize her
just because her face changed.

283
00:16:41,655 --> 00:16:45,365
That's impossible. No way.

284
00:16:46,295 --> 00:16:48,136
It's not just her face.

285
00:16:48,136 --> 00:16:52,106
Even if her whole body changed,

286
00:16:52,106 --> 00:16:54,736
she would still be my granddaughter.

287
00:16:54,736 --> 00:16:57,875
That doesn't make her
stop being my granddaughter.

288
00:16:58,205 --> 00:16:59,716
Don't you think so?

289
00:17:03,285 --> 00:17:05,156
I guess you're right.

290
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:15,735
That's right.

291
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:18,636
Kim Ji Young isn't Park Do Ra.

292
00:17:20,096 --> 00:17:21,466
She's the old lady's granddaughter.

293
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:24,775
Like she said,

294
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:27,975
there's no way she can't
recognize her own granddaughter.

295
00:17:31,806 --> 00:17:33,346
But what about the tattoo?

296
00:17:36,086 --> 00:17:38,216
How can there be
so many coincidences?

297
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:42,896
Still, it must be a coincidence.

298
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:46,096
Everything is a coincidence.

299
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:52,735
My gosh. Is it you, Director Ko?

300
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:54,866
What brings you here?

301
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:58,665
Hello. I had some business
to take care of here.

302
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:00,306
I see.

303
00:18:00,306 --> 00:18:02,815
Is Ji Young doing well?

304
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:05,505
Yes, she's doing fine.

305
00:18:05,505 --> 00:18:08,376
I see.
Then can you please tell her...

306
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:11,485
that she doesn't need to worry
about her grandmother's dementia?

307
00:18:11,485 --> 00:18:13,515
And that Auntie Duk Ja is...

308
00:18:13,515 --> 00:18:15,725
taking good care of her
all the time.

309
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:20,795
Does Ji Young's grandmother
have dementia?

310
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:24,265
Yes. But she's in the early stage,
so she's fine.

311
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:27,096
Ji Young was worried about her,

312
00:18:27,096 --> 00:18:29,965
so she refused to move to Seoul.

313
00:18:29,965 --> 00:18:32,066
But I persuaded her to go.

314
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:33,275
That's what I did.

315
00:18:34,036 --> 00:18:37,205
Everyone in the neighborhood knows
that she's a devoted granddaughter,

316
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:39,585
so I told her to care
only about her future.

317
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:41,616
I see.

318
00:18:43,816 --> 00:18:45,755
Ji Young met with an accident,

319
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:49,126
and she lost her memories,
so her grandmother seemed worried.

320
00:18:49,126 --> 00:18:52,825
You don't even have to
listen to worries like that.

321
00:18:53,056 --> 00:18:56,126
After Ji Young lost
her memories in the accident,

322
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:57,826
she's become really nice.

323
00:18:57,826 --> 00:18:59,606
It's all for the best.

324
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:02,072
What does that mean?

325
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:03,566
Let me be honest with you.

326
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:07,276
Ji Young used to worry
her grandmother a lot.

327
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:09,276
When she went to Seoul or something,

328
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:11,106
she never called her grandmother.

329
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:13,576
So when she went missing last time,

330
00:19:13,576 --> 00:19:15,116
I thought she was dead.

331
00:19:15,215 --> 00:19:18,656
But she came back alive.

332
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:21,186
And there was an odd rumor
going around in the neighborhood.

333
00:19:22,685 --> 00:19:25,096
What do you mean
about there being an odd rumor?

334
00:19:25,126 --> 00:19:29,166
The thing is,
her face has completely changed.

335
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:32,065
She wasn't
the Ji Young we remembered.

336
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,935
She said she lost all her memories.

337
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:38,176
And she was acting like
a completely different person.

338
00:19:38,606 --> 00:19:41,876
So there was a rumor
that she wasn't the real Ji Young.

339
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,306
People said
Soon Jung was mistaken...

340
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:46,985
because she had dementia.

341
00:19:50,015 --> 00:19:51,116
Are...

342
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:53,686
Are you serious?

343
00:19:54,655 --> 00:19:57,661
My gosh. What did I just say?

344
00:19:57,685 --> 00:20:01,565
Mr. Ko, you didn't hear it from me.

345
00:20:01,856 --> 00:20:05,535
If Soon Jung finds out,
she will kill me.

346
00:20:05,695 --> 00:20:08,466
Okay? Gosh, what did I just do?

347
00:20:10,336 --> 00:20:11,835
Her grandmother had dementia,

348
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:16,475
so there was a rumor that
Ji Young wasn't her granddaughter?

349
00:20:20,376 --> 00:20:21,745
If that's the case...

350
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:33,196
It's me, Jae Dong.

351
00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:35,765
Could you find out...

352
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:38,596
where Park Do Ra's mother is?

353
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:09,835
When will I get the test result?

354
00:22:10,634 --> 00:22:13,105
Ms. Yeoju.

355
00:22:13,904 --> 00:22:15,075
Yes, ma'am.

356
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,505
Ma Ri isn't in her room.

357
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:18,535
And she's not answering my call.

358
00:22:18,535 --> 00:22:20,974
She left with Mr. Park
early in the morning.

359
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:22,815
- Early in the morning?
- Yes.

360
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,545
Where did she go?

361
00:22:30,555 --> 00:22:33,755
Do Jun, are you with Ma Ri now?

362
00:22:34,185 --> 00:22:35,255
Where are you?

363
00:22:38,195 --> 00:22:40,194
What? Where?

364
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:46,404
- Eat a lot.
- It's good, isn't it?

365
00:22:49,805 --> 00:22:52,475
You know what? This cheonggukjang.

366
00:22:52,475 --> 00:22:55,205
- I used to hate it since it stunk.
- What?

367
00:22:55,205 --> 00:22:58,275
But the cheonggukjang you made
tastes good for some reason.

368
00:22:58,275 --> 00:23:01,315
What?
You think cheonggukjang stinks?

369
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,984
I'm glad that you like it, Ma Ri.

370
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:09,130
Eat a lot. And try
this bulgogi and rolled omelet.

371
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,255
Okay.

372
00:23:10,394 --> 00:23:13,055
Ma Ri must be so into Pil Seung.

373
00:23:13,055 --> 00:23:16,664
Now you even like the cheonggukjang
that you used to hate.

374
00:23:18,134 --> 00:23:22,375
Ma Ri, so what do you like
about Pil Seung?

375
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,134
Everything.

376
00:23:24,134 --> 00:23:26,104
From head to foot.
I like everything about him.

377
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,515
Even his eyes, nose, and lips.

378
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:29,775
I think his curly hair is cute.

379
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,314
Even his nostrils look pretty.

380
00:23:32,314 --> 00:23:33,384
My goodness.

381
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:36,185
What? Even his nostrils are pretty?

382
00:23:36,185 --> 00:23:38,855
Of course. Pil Seung is adorable.

383
00:23:39,414 --> 00:23:41,654
- My goodness.
- How cute.

384
00:23:41,955 --> 00:23:43,055
Sun Young.

385
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:44,495
- Hey.
- My gosh.

386
00:23:44,495 --> 00:23:45,795
Soo Yeon.

387
00:23:46,055 --> 00:23:47,064
Mom?

388
00:23:47,064 --> 00:23:50,265
- Hello, Soo Yeon.
- Hello.

389
00:23:50,265 --> 00:23:51,964
I'm glad you're here, Soo Yeon.

390
00:23:52,995 --> 00:23:55,904
Sun Young, I'm here
to pick Ma Ri up.

391
00:23:57,205 --> 00:23:59,045
Ma Ri, let's go.

392
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:05,214
No, I don't want to.

393
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,714
Gosh, why is she being like this?

394
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,125
Ma Ri.

395
00:24:12,715 --> 00:24:15,694
Come here, Ma Ri. We should go home.
Let's go.

396
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:18,854
But I haven't been able
to see Pil Seung today.

397
00:24:18,854 --> 00:24:20,964
I'm going to wait
until he gets home.

398
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:23,964
Ma Ri, you're putting
these people out.

399
00:24:24,094 --> 00:24:25,335
Come on.

400
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:28,235
I don't want to. I'm not leaving.

401
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:31,275
Hold on. We're fine
with her being here.

402
00:24:31,275 --> 00:24:32,574
It isn't an inconvenience.

403
00:24:32,574 --> 00:24:33,574
She's right, Soo Yeon.

404
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:36,404
Since you're here,
have dinner with us...

405
00:24:36,404 --> 00:24:37,914
and see Pil Seung when he gets home.

406
00:24:37,914 --> 00:24:39,144
That's not necessary.

407
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:41,255
I'm sorry
for interrupting your dinner.

408
00:24:41,285 --> 00:24:42,454
I'm sorry.

409
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,814
- It's...
- Have a nice evening. Enjoy.

410
00:24:44,814 --> 00:24:45,884
Soo Yeon, wait.

411
00:24:46,015 --> 00:24:48,154
But Ma Ri was in the middle
of having dinner.

412
00:24:48,424 --> 00:24:50,225
- Gosh.
- Enjoy. I'm sorry about this.

413
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:52,654
- She wasn't putting us out.
- I don't want to go.

414
00:24:52,654 --> 00:24:54,535
- I don't have the time for this.
- But...

415
00:24:54,664 --> 00:24:56,164
- Take care, then.
- Sure.

416
00:24:56,164 --> 00:24:57,735
- Get home safely.
- My shoes...

417
00:24:57,735 --> 00:24:59,605
At least let me put on my shoes.

418
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:06,474
Was that absolutely necessary?

419
00:25:10,574 --> 00:25:11,644
Get in here.

420
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:13,515
Mom, let go of me.

421
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:15,954
- You're hurting me.
- How am I hurting you?

422
00:25:21,384 --> 00:25:24,525
You're killing me, Ma Ri.

423
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:26,664
What am I going to do with you?

424
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:30,095
Why? What did I even do?

425
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,105
As if you don't know.

426
00:25:32,295 --> 00:25:35,204
You went to someone else's house
and stayed well past dinnertime.

427
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:38,074
Then you spoke about Pil Seung
being the man of your destiny.

428
00:25:38,074 --> 00:25:41,174
On top of that, you threw a tantrum
saying you'd stay until he got home.

429
00:25:41,174 --> 00:25:42,575
Where's your pride?

430
00:25:43,005 --> 00:25:45,344
How would it make me look
when Sun Young's my friend?

431
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:46,845
Did that ever occur to you?

432
00:25:47,515 --> 00:25:49,785
It's not like she's some stranger.

433
00:25:49,914 --> 00:25:53,525
You and Ms. Kim are best friends.
She's your best friend.

434
00:25:53,654 --> 00:25:57,055
Besides, Ms. Kim, the grandma,
her husband, and the aunt...

435
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,365
told me to stay...

436
00:25:58,654 --> 00:26:00,894
and see Pil Seung when he got home.

437
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,464
But you ruined everything!

438
00:26:02,864 --> 00:26:04,535
Honestly, you're the one
acting weird.

439
00:26:04,535 --> 00:26:06,305
Why are you this upset?

440
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:10,775
Gosh, why are you making her cry?

441
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:12,874
It sounds like...

442
00:26:12,874 --> 00:26:15,444
she went to Sun Young's place,
so why are you scolding her?

443
00:26:15,745 --> 00:26:17,244
Ma Ri wasn't putting anyone out.

444
00:26:17,515 --> 00:26:19,144
Besides, what's so wrong
about her seeing Pil Seung?

445
00:26:20,785 --> 00:26:23,344
Pil Seung has a girlfriend.
That's why.

446
00:26:23,344 --> 00:26:24,454
What?

447
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:28,954
Mom, Pil Seung has a girlfriend?

448
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,394
Are you sure?

449
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:35,495
Yes, so don't go there
and stick around like that.

450
00:26:35,495 --> 00:26:36,595
Got it?

451
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:39,795
Why are you telling me that now?

452
00:26:39,795 --> 00:26:42,305
You knew how much I was glad
to have found him!

453
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:45,674
Goodness.

454
00:26:46,975 --> 00:26:48,674
Does Pil Seung have a girlfriend?

455
00:26:50,745 --> 00:26:52,644
How can you tell Ma Ri
his address...

456
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:55,315
without coming to me first?

457
00:26:55,785 --> 00:26:57,755
It's not like I knew
he had a girlfriend.

458
00:26:57,884 --> 00:27:00,215
Besides, girlfriend or not,

459
00:27:00,215 --> 00:27:01,625
Ma Ri could still go there.

460
00:27:01,824 --> 00:27:03,454
Why are you being so sensitive?

461
00:27:04,555 --> 00:27:05,625
What...

462
00:27:07,324 --> 00:27:08,734
Why are you...

463
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,365
Is something up?

464
00:27:11,995 --> 00:27:15,035
Honey, it's nothing.

465
00:27:17,975 --> 00:27:19,174
Really?

466
00:27:20,904 --> 00:27:24,045
Is Pil Seung really seeing someone?

467
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:26,615
Yes, he is.

468
00:27:27,844 --> 00:27:29,585
So please stop...

469
00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:33,555
talking about him
in Ma Ri's presence.

470
00:27:36,424 --> 00:27:38,725
Ma Ri longed to see him
for two years...

471
00:27:38,725 --> 00:27:40,865
thinking that he was
the man of her dreams.

472
00:27:42,164 --> 00:27:44,704
She must be disappointed.

473
00:27:45,935 --> 00:27:47,734
We must nip it in the bud though...

474
00:27:48,765 --> 00:27:50,744
before she's hurt by it even more.

475
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:52,944
Honey,

476
00:27:53,604 --> 00:27:55,904
let's quickly find someone for her.

477
00:27:55,904 --> 00:27:57,015
I'll look as well.

478
00:27:59,074 --> 00:28:00,244
Yes, let's do that.

Do Ra.

484
00:28:50,882 --> 00:28:51,952
She's Do Ra.

485
00:28:54,322 --> 00:28:55,622
She really is Do Ra.

(Korea Genetic Analysis Center)

487
00:29:11,872 --> 00:29:13,942
Hey, Director Ko. It's me.

488
00:29:22,315 --> 00:29:23,415
Hello?

489
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:27,186
Hello? Director Ko?

490
00:29:37,295 --> 00:29:39,305
Ji Young, where are you right now?

491
00:29:40,396 --> 00:29:41,476
Me?

492
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:44,645
I'm heading home
after being discharged.

493
00:29:46,335 --> 00:29:47,516
Are you good?

494
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:50,476
Yes, I'm perfectly fine.

495
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:53,216
My tests came back clean.

496
00:29:56,585 --> 00:29:57,926
So where are you right now?

497
00:29:59,485 --> 00:30:00,756
I'll pick you up.

498
00:30:01,726 --> 00:30:04,595
Gosh, there's no need for that.

499
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,372
I'm perfectly fine.

500
00:30:06,396 --> 00:30:08,296
I was on my way to catch the bus.

501
00:30:10,396 --> 00:30:11,506
Sure.

502
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:17,905
Why does he sound
so emotional today?

503
00:30:20,606 --> 00:30:22,746
He must've been deeply worried...

504
00:30:23,646 --> 00:30:25,446
about me.

505
00:30:43,065 --> 00:30:45,135
Tell someone you love them
a thousand times.

506
00:30:45,765 --> 00:30:47,405
What good does that do?

507
00:30:49,966 --> 00:30:51,575
It's just a mirage.

508
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:54,676
It means nothing without money.

509
00:30:56,976 --> 00:30:58,585
So let's call it quits.

510
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:05,486
Okay.

511
00:31:07,386 --> 00:31:08,496
Let's end it.

512
00:31:11,095 --> 00:31:12,865
I didn't know
this was what you were like.

513
00:31:15,025 --> 00:31:16,466
I regret the time...

514
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:19,006
I spent liking you.

515
00:31:21,106 --> 00:31:22,335
As you wish,

516
00:31:22,735 --> 00:31:25,006
get engaged to and marry Mr. Gong,

517
00:31:25,876 --> 00:31:27,176
and have a great life.

518
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:30,216
And the money you love so much?

519
00:31:32,575 --> 00:31:34,716
I hope you drown in a hole of it.

520
00:31:35,585 --> 00:31:37,385
You read the news, didn't you?

521
00:31:39,085 --> 00:31:40,585
It's not true.

522
00:31:41,585 --> 00:31:43,825
I don't care
what other people think,

523
00:31:43,956 --> 00:31:46,966
but I don't want you
to get the wrong idea about me.

524
00:31:47,626 --> 00:31:49,496
None of that is true.

525
00:31:50,025 --> 00:31:51,706
It was all made up.

526
00:31:58,005 --> 00:31:59,575
What about the photos
taken at the hotel?

527
00:32:00,206 --> 00:32:02,575
How much were you offered
that you did something like that?

528
00:32:02,906 --> 00:32:04,315
Why do you live like this?

529
00:32:05,015 --> 00:32:07,085
What kind of life
did you lead so far?

530
00:32:11,386 --> 00:32:12,486
Forget it.

531
00:32:13,755 --> 00:32:15,696
Why should I care how you live?

532
00:32:16,356 --> 00:32:17,665
Do whatever you want.

533
00:32:18,156 --> 00:32:21,236
But don't show yourself again.

534
00:32:24,436 --> 00:32:25,536
Pil Seung,

535
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:29,276
I lied about having feelings
for you. It was all a lie.

536
00:32:30,436 --> 00:32:32,605
I played around with you
out of boredom,

537
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,415
so forget about this cruel witch.

538
00:32:36,946 --> 00:32:38,216
I wish you happiness, Pil Seung.

539
00:32:44,686 --> 00:32:45,786
I'm sorry.

540
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:49,555
I'm sorry.

541
00:32:56,196 --> 00:32:57,266
Do Ra.

542
00:33:26,896 --> 00:33:28,065
Do Ra.

543
00:33:31,495 --> 00:33:32,665
Thank you...

544
00:33:37,206 --> 00:33:38,845
for being alive.

545
00:33:43,345 --> 00:33:44,585
Thank you, Do Ra.

546
00:33:50,515 --> 00:33:52,555
Goodness me.

547
00:33:53,356 --> 00:33:54,555
I'm aching all over.

548
00:34:00,426 --> 00:34:03,266
What? Who's here at this hour?

549
00:34:05,196 --> 00:34:07,006
Who is it?

550
00:34:08,335 --> 00:34:09,476
It's me.

551
00:34:11,436 --> 00:34:13,206
Gosh. Director Ko, is that you?

552
00:34:14,106 --> 00:34:15,915
Just a second.

553
00:34:29,825 --> 00:34:31,065
Director Ko.

554
00:34:32,256 --> 00:34:34,765
Ji Young, may I come in?

555
00:34:35,495 --> 00:34:37,565
Yes, of course. Come in.

556
00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:48,076
Director Ko,
what brings you by at this hour?

557
00:34:48,606 --> 00:34:50,475
And what's all that?

558
00:34:51,816 --> 00:34:54,116
Can I open your fridge?

559
00:34:55,285 --> 00:34:57,285
Yes, of course.

560
00:35:14,035 --> 00:35:15,835
Director Ko, what is all this?

561
00:35:16,465 --> 00:35:18,946
Who did you buy all of this for?

562
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:23,346
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I got some of everything.

563
00:35:23,905 --> 00:35:25,886
You were injured in my stead,

564
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:28,185
and eating well
promotes a fast recovery.

565
00:35:28,615 --> 00:35:31,056
But this is a lot of food.

566
00:35:31,816 --> 00:35:33,056
Take your time...

567
00:35:33,486 --> 00:35:36,296
and let me know
if you need anything else.

568
00:35:36,726 --> 00:35:39,926
Gosh, no. This will keep me full.

569
00:35:45,035 --> 00:35:46,105
Ji Young,

570
00:35:46,736 --> 00:35:48,506
are you sure
you don't need to see a doctor?

571
00:35:48,506 --> 00:35:49,835
Are you really all right?

572
00:35:51,336 --> 00:35:53,506
Yes, I'm fine.

573
00:35:53,506 --> 00:35:56,546
See? I'm fine.

574
00:35:59,316 --> 00:36:02,185
Ji Young, I'm sorry about earlier.

575
00:36:03,115 --> 00:36:04,386
Something urgent came up,

576
00:36:06,115 --> 00:36:07,926
so I left you at the hospital
when you were injured.

577
00:36:09,956 --> 00:36:11,696
I should've been there for you.

578
00:36:12,655 --> 00:36:15,835
Why should you
have been there for me?

579
00:36:16,495 --> 00:36:18,265
I'm not a kid, you know.

580
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:21,535
Besides, the assistant director
took good care of me.

581
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:27,035
You must feel guilty...

582
00:36:27,035 --> 00:36:29,376
since I was injured in your place.

583
00:36:29,376 --> 00:36:30,576
But don't feel that way.

584
00:36:31,075 --> 00:36:32,815
I'm perfectly fine.

585
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:44,026
Ji Young,

586
00:36:45,026 --> 00:36:46,696
if it hurts anywhere,

587
00:36:47,765 --> 00:36:48,966
or if you're craving anything,

588
00:36:49,595 --> 00:36:52,105
or if you need anything,
let me know right away.

589
00:36:52,896 --> 00:36:55,276
I'll be at your beck and call. Okay?

590
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:59,946
Director Ko, stop it.

591
00:37:00,276 --> 00:37:02,015
You're embarrassing me.

592
00:37:03,706 --> 00:37:05,716
You saved my life, Ji Young.

593
00:37:06,115 --> 00:37:07,756
Of course I should take care of you.

594
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:12,455
So don't feel bad about it
and tell me if you need any help.

595
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,725
Sure. I got it.

596
00:37:16,726 --> 00:37:18,356
Anyway, I'm fine,

597
00:37:18,356 --> 00:37:20,665
so go ahead and get some rest.

598
00:37:22,896 --> 00:37:25,165
Right. Rest well, then.

599
00:37:25,396 --> 00:37:26,565
Sure.

600
00:37:32,236 --> 00:37:33,546
Please call me...

601
00:37:34,345 --> 00:37:36,875
if you need my help with anything.

602
00:37:38,575 --> 00:37:42,185
Right. I'll let you know.

603
00:37:52,695 --> 00:37:55,866
Thank you. Rest up, then.

604
00:38:00,566 --> 00:38:04,006
Why is he suddenly
being so nice to me?

605
00:38:04,936 --> 00:38:06,446
That was embarrassing.

606
00:38:07,675 --> 00:38:10,075
If I save him again,

607
00:38:10,075 --> 00:38:11,446
he'll offer to carry me around.

608
00:38:14,785 --> 00:38:15,855
Do Ra,

609
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:19,156
I won't let you suffer alone again.

610
00:38:23,026 --> 00:38:24,495
No matter what happens,

611
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,636
I will never let go of your hand.

612
00:38:30,095 --> 00:38:31,306
Never...

613
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:34,875
will I let you leave my side.

614
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:45,843
The deadline
for the screenwriting contest...

615
00:38:45,843 --> 00:38:47,313
is drawing near,

616
00:38:48,372 --> 00:38:50,482
so what's the matter with me?

617
00:38:52,553 --> 00:38:54,853
Maybe it's time I finally gave up.

618
00:38:56,082 --> 00:38:59,092
Is Mom right about
my not having the knack for it?

619
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:04,893
Why can't I write anything good?

620
00:39:09,403 --> 00:39:10,672
All right.

621
00:39:12,573 --> 00:39:14,473
I'll have one drink...

622
00:39:15,473 --> 00:39:17,313
and go home to write.

623
00:39:19,173 --> 00:39:20,272
Welcome.

624
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:21,342
Hi.

625
00:39:27,082 --> 00:39:29,123
It's been a while.

626
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:34,262
It's been a while.

627
00:39:36,522 --> 00:39:37,592
Then...

628
00:39:47,502 --> 00:39:48,773
Are you here alone?

629
00:39:50,203 --> 00:39:53,442
I was on my way home from work
and wanted to grab a drink.

630
00:39:54,843 --> 00:39:55,913
Right.

631
00:39:58,442 --> 00:39:59,583
Then,

632
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:03,422
why don't I join you?

633
00:40:05,852 --> 00:40:09,333
It'd be weird to drink separately
when we know each other.

634
00:40:14,462 --> 00:40:15,632
Sure.

635
00:40:16,002 --> 00:40:17,703
We can have a drink like old times.

636
00:40:25,343 --> 00:40:28,782
I don't know
what fate has designed for us.

637
00:40:31,212 --> 00:40:33,582
Numerous encounters like this...

638
00:40:33,582 --> 00:40:36,623
may bring two people together
in TV shows,

639
00:40:38,053 --> 00:40:41,422
but even though what we had
ended a long time ago...

640
00:40:43,923 --> 00:40:45,632
Either way, it's fascinating.

641
00:40:46,392 --> 00:40:48,003
I can't believe
we crossed paths again.

642
00:40:51,303 --> 00:40:52,942
Still, it's not too bad.

643
00:40:54,433 --> 00:40:55,973
I didn't want to drink alone today.

644
00:40:57,602 --> 00:40:59,072
I agree. It was...

645
00:40:59,673 --> 00:41:01,643
getting lonely to drink alone.

646
00:41:03,482 --> 00:41:05,712
Since that's the case,
let's raise our glasses.

647
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:20,732
I see you carry the purse around.

648
00:41:21,662 --> 00:41:24,203
It suits you for sure.

649
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:26,103
The purse?

650
00:41:27,102 --> 00:41:28,243
Oh, right.

651
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:32,842
You should know
that it's my go-to purse.

652
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:36,612
It's my first designer purse,
you see.

653
00:41:37,212 --> 00:41:40,453
Although that's not the only reason
why I like it.

654
00:41:40,712 --> 00:41:44,592
Anyway, I've been using it well.

655
00:41:45,553 --> 00:41:46,723
So thanks.

656
00:41:47,953 --> 00:41:50,833
I'm grateful that you kept it
and made good use of it.

657
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,832
I was so sick of you...

658
00:41:53,832 --> 00:41:55,873
that I thought
about throwing it away,

659
00:41:57,863 --> 00:42:01,003
but the purse
didn't do anything wrong.

660
00:42:05,173 --> 00:42:09,212
We had enough to drink,
so let's call it a night.

661
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:13,013
I'll pay for the drinks today.

662
00:42:13,013 --> 00:42:16,152
No, let me get the bill.
We haven't met in a while, so...

663
00:42:16,383 --> 00:42:18,753
No, let me.

664
00:42:19,522 --> 00:42:21,563
- Here you go.
- But...

665
00:42:27,533 --> 00:42:29,203
Do you have another credit card?

666
00:42:29,203 --> 00:42:30,933
This keeps on bouncing.

667
00:42:31,263 --> 00:42:33,973
What do you mean? That's odd.

668
00:42:33,973 --> 00:42:36,543
I said I would get it.

669
00:42:37,743 --> 00:42:40,142
It's nothing compared
to the price of this purse,

670
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:41,843
so let me pay you back for it.

671
00:42:41,843 --> 00:42:44,413
- I'll get it with that.
- Got it.

672
00:42:51,582 --> 00:42:53,653
I must've brought
the wrong credit card.

673
00:42:53,653 --> 00:42:54,793
I'm sorry about that.

674
00:42:55,522 --> 00:42:58,293
It happens.
I do that sometimes as well.

675
00:42:58,923 --> 00:43:02,602
Besides, whoever
buys the drinks doesn't matter...

676
00:43:02,602 --> 00:43:05,703
when we've gained a drinking buddy
who is also an old acquaintance.

677
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,512
I have things to do,
so I'll get going.

678
00:43:11,243 --> 00:43:12,512
Hold on.

679
00:43:13,113 --> 00:43:14,542
Is your phone number still the same?

680
00:43:14,542 --> 00:43:16,712
I'll buy you a drink next time.

681
00:43:17,383 --> 00:43:19,112
Okay. You do that.

682
00:43:42,533 --> 00:43:44,273
- Ji Young.
- Goodness.

683
00:43:47,343 --> 00:43:48,842
Hello, Director Ko.

684
00:43:49,513 --> 00:43:50,953
Get in.

685
00:43:51,383 --> 00:43:53,552
Gosh, no.

686
00:43:53,683 --> 00:43:55,482
I'll take the bus.

687
00:43:55,582 --> 00:43:56,828
You go ahead.

688
00:43:56,852 --> 00:43:58,922
Why go separately
when we work at the same place?

689
00:43:59,323 --> 00:44:00,623
Are you rich?

690
00:44:01,122 --> 00:44:02,893
Why waste money on transport?

691
00:44:03,062 --> 00:44:04,668
No, but...

692
00:44:04,692 --> 00:44:06,902
We might both be late. Get in.

693
00:44:08,192 --> 00:44:11,473
I wouldn't dare
share a ride with you.

694
00:44:11,703 --> 00:44:13,372
I really am fine.

695
00:44:13,372 --> 00:44:15,143
We're just carpooling.

696
00:44:16,872 --> 00:44:18,012
"Carpooling?"

697
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:20,183
What's that?

698
00:44:20,412 --> 00:44:22,013
It's when colleagues...

699
00:44:22,013 --> 00:44:24,753
share rides to conserve energy.

700
00:44:25,142 --> 00:44:27,052
We don't produce oil of our own,

701
00:44:27,283 --> 00:44:29,058
so we should try to conserve energy.

702
00:44:29,082 --> 00:44:30,553
You save transportation costs,

703
00:44:30,553 --> 00:44:32,862
and I save gas. Isn't that great?

704
00:44:33,192 --> 00:44:35,622
You're right. That is a good thing.

705
00:44:35,622 --> 00:44:37,223
Yes, it is a good thing.

706
00:44:37,223 --> 00:44:38,962
- Now get in the car.
- But...

707
00:44:40,662 --> 00:44:42,402
Watch your head.

708
00:44:54,872 --> 00:44:57,652
Did something happen
to make him really happy?

709
00:44:59,982 --> 00:45:01,253
By the way, Ji Young.

710
00:45:01,852 --> 00:45:03,183
We've worked together...

711
00:45:03,183 --> 00:45:05,053
and lived in the same house
for a month,

712
00:45:05,053 --> 00:45:06,822
but we know
so little about each other.

713
00:45:07,553 --> 00:45:10,962
Shouldn't we know each other better
if we're to carpool?

714
00:45:12,192 --> 00:45:14,063
Well, I guess?

715
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:15,862
That would be nice.

716
00:45:16,703 --> 00:45:18,032
What do you like?

717
00:45:18,363 --> 00:45:19,503
What do you mean?

718
00:45:19,933 --> 00:45:21,342
What food do you like?

719
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:23,372
Korean, Chinese, Japanese.

720
00:45:23,372 --> 00:45:24,712
Or Thai?

721
00:45:26,312 --> 00:45:29,212
I like all kinds of foods.

722
00:45:29,312 --> 00:45:30,813
There's nothing I can't eat.

723
00:45:31,912 --> 00:45:34,453
There must be something
you especially like.

724
00:45:36,223 --> 00:45:40,122
I guess I like kalguksu,

725
00:45:40,122 --> 00:45:43,933
spicy cold noodles,
sujebi, everything,

726
00:45:44,423 --> 00:45:47,902
but out of all that,
my favorite is tteokbokki.

727
00:45:50,062 --> 00:45:51,333
I knew it.

728
00:45:52,872 --> 00:45:54,273
You knew it?

729
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,212
How?

730
00:45:59,542 --> 00:46:01,112
Why are you smiling?

731
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,612
What did I do to make you smile?

732
00:46:04,243 --> 00:46:05,683
Your company...

733
00:46:06,582 --> 00:46:08,223
makes the drive to work fun.

734
00:46:08,453 --> 00:46:09,592
For real?

735
00:46:09,823 --> 00:46:10,993
Yes, for real.

736
00:46:11,582 --> 00:46:13,123
I'm glad we're carpooling.

737
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:16,993
He thinks it's fun to drive with me?

738
00:46:17,093 --> 00:46:18,632
What does that mean?

739
00:46:24,763 --> 00:46:28,873
Gosh. Why does he keep looking at me
and talking to me so sweetly?

740
00:46:29,033 --> 00:46:30,172
It's perplexing.

741
00:46:31,002 --> 00:46:32,572
No. No way.

742
00:46:32,772 --> 00:46:35,543
He's like this
because I saved him yesterday.

743
00:46:40,312 --> 00:46:43,023
Kim Ji Young,
don't you get the wrong idea.

744
00:46:51,962 --> 00:46:53,962
The new script is out.

745
00:46:56,962 --> 00:47:01,043
Here's the new script,
hot off the printer's press.

746
00:47:01,173 --> 00:47:02,673
- Thanks, Ji Young.
- Sure.

747
00:47:02,673 --> 00:47:05,112
- Thank you.
- It's fine.

748
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:11,183
Oh, dear.

749
00:47:11,582 --> 00:47:14,023
Are you okay, Ji Young?
Were you hurt?

750
00:47:14,613 --> 00:47:15,723
What?

751
00:47:17,082 --> 00:47:19,692
All I did was drop some scripts.

752
00:47:19,792 --> 00:47:21,862
Why would that hurt me?

753
00:47:22,223 --> 00:47:25,063
I'm just fine now.
You don't have to worry.

754
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:26,802
Be careful anyway.

755
00:47:28,593 --> 00:47:29,703
Goodness.

756
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:32,433
Why is he staring at me so intently?

757
00:47:33,533 --> 00:47:36,143
What does this fiery gaze mean?

758
00:47:36,473 --> 00:47:37,612
Oh, gosh.

759
00:47:38,372 --> 00:47:40,012
My face is so hot.

760
00:47:40,372 --> 00:47:43,012
His gaze might burn my skin.

761
00:47:59,392 --> 00:48:01,503
Oh, my gosh.

762
00:48:02,962 --> 00:48:06,373
Why has he been
acting like that since yesterday?

763
00:48:06,732 --> 00:48:08,873
Even though I saved his life,

764
00:48:09,673 --> 00:48:12,442
why is he looking at me
with such emotion?

765
00:48:13,642 --> 00:48:14,982
Isn't that a melodrama look?

766
00:48:17,883 --> 00:48:21,283
I told myself I'd look at him
as if he were a rock.

767
00:48:21,283 --> 00:48:23,692
What am I to do
if he keeps acting like that?

768
00:48:24,283 --> 00:48:25,353
Oh, gosh.

769
00:48:26,022 --> 00:48:27,692
This is killing me.

770
00:48:41,872 --> 00:48:42,942
Auntie.

771
00:48:44,473 --> 00:48:45,973
Jin Dan's leaving.

772
00:48:47,173 --> 00:48:48,342
I'm heading out.

773
00:48:48,442 --> 00:48:51,083
Okay. Take a seat first.

774
00:48:52,412 --> 00:48:53,482
Okay.

775
00:48:57,723 --> 00:48:58,893
Jin Dan.

776
00:48:59,622 --> 00:49:02,393
Do you know how important
this blind date is?

777
00:49:03,363 --> 00:49:05,532
I went through a lot to arrange it.

778
00:49:07,062 --> 00:49:08,433
I know that.

779
00:49:10,602 --> 00:49:11,672
Jin Dan.

780
00:49:12,303 --> 00:49:15,842
You're the only person
in this family that I can trust now.

781
00:49:16,903 --> 00:49:20,043
You know I have a share
in the company, right?

782
00:49:20,473 --> 00:49:22,942
If you marry, settle down,
and have a child,

783
00:49:23,412 --> 00:49:26,552
then I'll give you
my share of the company.

784
00:49:27,752 --> 00:49:31,623
That means you could
become APP Group's owner.

785
00:49:34,153 --> 00:49:37,333
The woman you'll meet today
will help with that.

786
00:49:38,363 --> 00:49:40,232
I can't allow APP Group...

787
00:49:40,232 --> 00:49:42,532
to go to someone
with a different family name.

788
00:49:43,502 --> 00:49:46,172
My father went through so much
to build it up.

789
00:49:48,033 --> 00:49:49,942
Do you know how I feel?

790
00:49:51,372 --> 00:49:52,442
Yes.

791
00:49:53,142 --> 00:49:55,842
I'll do my best
so I don't let you down.

792
00:49:56,912 --> 00:49:58,012
Okay.

793
00:49:58,243 --> 00:50:00,723
Meet the lady,
and if you don't like her, say so.

794
00:50:00,883 --> 00:50:02,853
Marriage can't be forced.

795
00:50:03,283 --> 00:50:05,652
I can always find you someone else.

796
00:50:06,323 --> 00:50:07,422
Okay.

797
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:09,839
Don't worry, Auntie.

798
00:50:09,863 --> 00:50:11,993
Jin Dan has made up his mind,

799
00:50:11,993 --> 00:50:13,703
and he'll do great from now on.

800
00:50:13,993 --> 00:50:15,762
Yes, you should.

801
00:50:30,912 --> 00:50:32,913
Hello. I'm Gong Jin Dan.

802
00:50:33,383 --> 00:50:34,523
Ms. Kim Tae Hee?

803
00:50:34,812 --> 00:50:36,453
Yes. Long time no see.

804
00:50:38,053 --> 00:50:39,253
You know me?

805
00:50:40,053 --> 00:50:42,523
Have we met somewhere?

806
00:50:43,093 --> 00:50:45,292
Six years ago in New York
at Michael's wedding.

807
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,563
We said hi then.

808
00:50:46,993 --> 00:50:48,203
At Michael's wedding?

809
00:50:50,933 --> 00:50:52,203
Right.

810
00:50:52,462 --> 00:50:55,603
Your name
wasn't Tae Hee then, was it?

811
00:50:58,042 --> 00:50:59,143
Thanks.

812
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:04,613
That's right.

813
00:51:04,613 --> 00:51:07,753
I went by Linda when I lived
in the US. I was Linda Kim.

814
00:51:08,212 --> 00:51:09,422
Yes.

815
00:51:09,852 --> 00:51:11,493
I remember now, Linda.

816
00:51:12,553 --> 00:51:15,462
We had a great time
with Michael at the dance party.

817
00:51:16,292 --> 00:51:17,793
It's good to see you again.

818
00:51:18,692 --> 00:51:20,402
I'm pleased to see you again too.

819
00:51:21,633 --> 00:51:24,103
That's actually why I'm here.

820
00:51:24,732 --> 00:51:25,933
To see you.

821
00:51:27,002 --> 00:51:28,103
Really?

822
00:51:32,272 --> 00:51:34,543
Hello, Ma Ri.

823
00:51:35,372 --> 00:51:36,813
Sorry.

824
00:51:36,912 --> 00:51:39,612
Pil Seung's away at work.

825
00:51:40,852 --> 00:51:42,252
I know that Pil Seung...

826
00:51:42,252 --> 00:51:45,592
is at work at this time of day,
but I still came here.

827
00:51:46,593 --> 00:51:50,333
Today, I'm here
to ask for his phone number.

828
00:51:51,892 --> 00:51:54,662
Ms. Kim. Pil Seung and I
have something serious...

829
00:51:54,662 --> 00:51:57,132
to talk about in person.

830
00:51:58,462 --> 00:52:02,442
Could you give me his number?

831
00:52:04,803 --> 00:52:05,873
Well...

832
00:52:06,343 --> 00:52:08,012
Let's sit down, Ma Ri.

833
00:52:09,883 --> 00:52:11,152
Sit down.

834
00:52:19,683 --> 00:52:23,092
Ma Ri. I might be his mom,

835
00:52:23,192 --> 00:52:26,762
but I think it's rude
to give out his number.

836
00:52:27,162 --> 00:52:30,133
I'll ask Pil Seung if I can
give it to you, and if he says...

837
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:32,402
I can, can I give it to you then?

838
00:52:34,303 --> 00:52:37,313
Okay.
But you must promise to ask him,

839
00:52:37,703 --> 00:52:39,373
then tell me what he said.

840
00:52:40,343 --> 00:52:41,683
Okay, I will.

841
00:52:43,343 --> 00:52:46,343
What do you want to talk about...

842
00:52:46,343 --> 00:52:49,183
with Pil Seung
in person that's serious?

843
00:52:53,752 --> 00:52:56,862
Do you not want to tell us?

844
00:53:01,892 --> 00:53:03,132
Actually,

845
00:53:04,062 --> 00:53:05,132
I felt...

846
00:53:05,903 --> 00:53:09,473
a bit betrayed by you both.

847
00:53:10,142 --> 00:53:13,143
What? You felt betrayed?

848
00:53:13,513 --> 00:53:14,982
What are you talking about?

849
00:53:15,013 --> 00:53:16,782
What did we do?

850
00:53:18,712 --> 00:53:19,853
Ma Ri.

851
00:53:20,412 --> 00:53:23,023
Did we do anything wrong?

852
00:53:23,883 --> 00:53:25,893
It's okay to tell me.

853
00:53:28,093 --> 00:53:29,592
I told you...

854
00:53:29,892 --> 00:53:32,893
that I fell in love with Pil Seung
at first sight.

855
00:53:34,292 --> 00:53:36,632
That he was like a prince to me.

856
00:53:36,832 --> 00:53:40,373
And that I really liked him,
so I wanted to marry him.

857
00:53:43,073 --> 00:53:46,413
But why did you not tell me
after hearing all that?

858
00:53:48,013 --> 00:53:50,413
That Pil Seung had a girlfriend.

859
00:53:50,942 --> 00:53:53,723
Why did you not tell me about that?

860
00:53:54,153 --> 00:53:55,583
What? Girlfriend?

861
00:53:56,453 --> 00:53:58,822
Does Pil Seung have a girlfriend?

862
00:53:59,122 --> 00:54:01,752
Ms. Kim, who is the woman?

863
00:54:01,752 --> 00:54:03,293
How old is she?

864
00:54:04,093 --> 00:54:06,362
Is she prettier than me?

865
00:54:06,732 --> 00:54:09,862
What?
Pil Seung doesn't have a girlfriend.

866
00:54:10,403 --> 00:54:11,633
That's strange.

867
00:54:11,633 --> 00:54:14,373
Where did you hear that?

868
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,873
He doesn't have a girlfriend?

869
00:54:18,803 --> 00:54:20,043
No.

870
00:54:20,673 --> 00:54:21,673
He doesn't.

871
00:54:21,673 --> 00:54:23,813
If he did, I would've told you.

872
00:54:24,743 --> 00:54:27,152
Are you serious? Is that true?

873
00:54:27,852 --> 00:54:30,422
What? Ma Ri is missing?

874
00:54:30,522 --> 00:54:32,153
She's not answering my call.

875
00:54:32,153 --> 00:54:33,692
And Do Jun doesn't know
where she is.

876
00:54:34,453 --> 00:54:36,523
She left without Do Jun knowing?

877
00:54:37,562 --> 00:54:39,732
Maybe she went there again.

878
00:54:40,533 --> 00:54:42,438
Call Sun Young now.

879
00:54:42,462 --> 00:54:43,603
Okay.

880
00:54:46,203 --> 00:54:47,302
What...

881
00:54:49,232 --> 00:54:50,342
Gong Ma Ri.

882
00:54:51,042 --> 00:54:53,273
Where did you go without telling us?

883
00:54:53,613 --> 00:54:55,482
And why didn't you answer my calls?

884
00:54:56,343 --> 00:54:57,413
Mom.

885
00:54:58,343 --> 00:54:59,953
Why did you lie to me?

886
00:55:00,082 --> 00:55:01,883
Pil Seung doesn't have a girlfriend.

887
00:55:01,883 --> 00:55:04,152
Why did you tell me
that he had a girlfriend?

888
00:55:04,383 --> 00:55:05,453
What...

889
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,563
- Well...
- Ma Ri.

890
00:55:09,553 --> 00:55:12,392
I just went to Pil Seung's place...

891
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,593
and asked his mother.

892
00:55:14,593 --> 00:55:16,563
She says
he doesn't have a girlfriend.

893
00:55:16,633 --> 00:55:18,373
Why did you lie to me?

894
00:55:19,162 --> 00:55:20,873
Well... Honey.

895
00:55:21,872 --> 00:55:25,112
Did you really lie to her?

896
00:55:37,482 --> 00:55:38,853
Why did you do that?

897
00:55:42,093 --> 00:55:45,433
I thought it was the only way
to make Ma Ri give up.

898
00:55:46,162 --> 00:55:49,902
Why are you being like this
without giving it a try?

899
00:55:50,562 --> 00:55:53,672
You know how I liked Pil Seung
and asked you about him before.

900
00:55:54,772 --> 00:55:56,072
Does that mean...

901
00:55:56,703 --> 00:55:58,602
you've been lying to me...

902
00:55:58,602 --> 00:56:00,842
for the past two years?

903
00:56:07,953 --> 00:56:10,793
Sun Young and I are
best friends in the whole world.

904
00:56:12,683 --> 00:56:15,192
I don't want to fall out with her
because of our kids.

905
00:56:15,192 --> 00:56:17,493
It will put us
in an awkward situation.

906
00:56:17,593 --> 00:56:20,093
And it's rude
that Ma Ri is acting like this...

907
00:56:20,093 --> 00:56:21,732
because of her crush.

908
00:56:21,732 --> 00:56:23,063
She shouldn't be doing this.

909
00:56:23,662 --> 00:56:26,973
Do you even hear yourself?

910
00:56:27,033 --> 00:56:30,712
Are you saying your friendship is
more important than her feelings?

911
00:56:31,602 --> 00:56:33,303
Don't you feel bad...

912
00:56:33,303 --> 00:56:36,583
that Ma Ri has a crush on Pil Seung
and runs after him like that?

913
00:56:37,283 --> 00:56:38,353
How...

914
00:56:39,343 --> 00:56:42,353
When you were supposed
to support her, how could you...

915
00:56:43,053 --> 00:56:44,293
Honey.

916
00:56:44,783 --> 00:56:48,053
I just don't want Ma Ri to be hurt.

917
00:56:48,053 --> 00:56:49,822
That's why.

918
00:56:50,392 --> 00:56:52,163
Stop with the nonsense already.

919
00:57:01,872 --> 00:57:04,813
I haven't seen Jin Taek
so furious in a long time.

920
00:57:05,872 --> 00:57:08,212
And I don't understand you either.

921
00:57:09,042 --> 00:57:11,982
You know
how hard Jin Taek is trying...

922
00:57:11,982 --> 00:57:13,453
to find someone nice for Ma Ri.

923
00:57:14,153 --> 00:57:16,212
That's why he tried so hard...

924
00:57:16,212 --> 00:57:18,183
to set Ma Ri up with someone...

925
00:57:18,183 --> 00:57:20,563
even when she refused
to go out with him.

926
00:57:21,692 --> 00:57:25,792
And now we finally found someone
Ma Ri really likes.

927
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:27,333
But you don't
even want to give it a try.

928
00:57:28,332 --> 00:57:30,802
How could you even lie to her
to make her give up?

929
00:57:31,102 --> 00:57:34,442
She's right.
You were wrong on this one.

930
00:57:34,973 --> 00:57:37,442
It's ridiculous that you didn't want
to ruin your friendship with her.

931
00:57:37,803 --> 00:57:40,442
Is there any reason...

932
00:57:40,442 --> 00:57:42,512
Pil Seung and Ma Ri
can't be together?

933
00:57:44,212 --> 00:57:45,712
What did you say?

934
00:57:46,042 --> 00:57:49,782
I just don't understand
why you're being like this.

935
00:57:51,153 --> 00:57:54,022
To be frank, Sun Young's family
is far from being rich,

936
00:57:54,022 --> 00:57:56,493
and her husband
doesn't have a decent job.

937
00:57:56,493 --> 00:57:58,562
So they might be interested
in making their kid...

938
00:57:58,562 --> 00:58:00,532
the son-in-law of APP Group.

939
00:58:01,162 --> 00:58:02,892
If you find it difficult
to bring it up,

940
00:58:02,892 --> 00:58:05,273
I can meet Sun Young
and talk about it.

941
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,442
That's a good idea.
You should do something.

942
00:58:08,502 --> 00:58:09,902
Please!

943
00:58:11,073 --> 00:58:13,942
Please stay out of all this.

944
00:58:17,582 --> 00:58:19,112
Are you as upset as I am now?

945
00:58:19,812 --> 00:58:22,013
Do you care about Ma Ri
as much as I do?

946
00:58:22,013 --> 00:58:24,652
Do you want her to be happy
as desperately as I do?

947
00:58:25,522 --> 00:58:28,063
Can't you just stay out of this?

948
00:58:28,122 --> 00:58:30,362
She's my daughter,
so I'll take care of everything.

949
00:58:31,363 --> 00:58:32,462
What...

950
00:58:34,033 --> 00:58:35,333
Gosh, what's with her?

951
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:38,072
I think she has lost her mind.

952
00:58:39,062 --> 00:58:40,203
My goodness.

953
00:58:49,743 --> 00:58:52,683
When did you get here?
Did I keep you waiting for long?

954
00:58:55,212 --> 00:58:56,382
By the way,

955
00:58:57,482 --> 00:58:59,353
why are you staring at me like that?

956
00:59:03,192 --> 00:59:05,362
You look so pretty today.

957
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:10,502
The screenwriting contest is over,

958
00:59:10,502 --> 00:59:12,433
and the weather is nice today.

959
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:16,072
You said you'd buy me dinner,
so I spruced up a little.

960
00:59:17,903 --> 00:59:19,873
Is this it? Let's go in.

961
00:59:33,622 --> 00:59:37,163
I like the ambiance of this place.
And the night view is great.

962
00:59:37,892 --> 00:59:39,092
The chicken tastes good too.

963
00:59:42,633 --> 00:59:43,703
Eat a lot.

964
00:59:44,203 --> 00:59:46,902
Okay. I'm eating a lot.

965
00:59:54,912 --> 00:59:57,413
Why do you keep
staring at me like that today?

966
00:59:58,343 --> 01:00:01,023
Have I got more wrinkles on my face?

967
01:00:01,982 --> 01:00:04,493
I don't want to age.

968
01:00:06,953 --> 01:00:08,192
It's not like that.

969
01:00:11,493 --> 01:00:13,663
You're so pretty
that I can't stop looking at you.

970
01:00:22,772 --> 01:00:23,973
I'll tell you what.

971
01:00:25,173 --> 01:00:27,083
Why don't we start
a serious relationship?

972
01:00:28,272 --> 01:00:29,342
What?

973
01:00:30,812 --> 01:00:33,482
You keep staring at me
and say I'm pretty.

974
01:00:33,953 --> 01:00:35,282
You're the first person
who ever did that.

975
01:00:37,352 --> 01:00:39,853
We went our separate ways
even before exchanging names,

976
01:00:40,953 --> 01:00:44,339
but to be honest, I liked you a lot.

977
01:00:44,363 --> 01:00:45,433
You know that, right?

978
01:00:51,033 --> 01:00:52,172
Why...

979
01:00:53,263 --> 01:00:54,603
What's wrong?

980
01:00:59,142 --> 01:01:01,012
I'm sorry, but I should get going.

981
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:07,583
Wait.

982
01:01:08,383 --> 01:01:09,453
Wait.

983
01:01:11,283 --> 01:01:13,183
You can't leave like this
while we were talking.

984
01:01:13,183 --> 01:01:15,192
We were having a moment
because you started it.

985
01:01:15,923 --> 01:01:18,433
I guess I'm being punished
for breaking your heart.

986
01:01:19,562 --> 01:01:20,732
No.

987
01:01:20,863 --> 01:01:23,163
I don't want to talk
about something pathetic like this.

988
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:26,002
We just ran into each other again,

989
01:01:26,002 --> 01:01:28,403
and I felt bad about
how you bought me a drink last time.

990
01:01:28,403 --> 01:01:30,573
So I bought you dinner today.
That's it.

991
01:01:30,573 --> 01:01:31,773
I'm sorry.

992
01:01:33,542 --> 01:01:34,743
Take care.

993
01:01:36,473 --> 01:01:37,683
Hey, wait.

994
01:01:38,743 --> 01:01:41,253
Are you running away again
after shaking me up?

995
01:01:41,553 --> 01:01:44,253
Why did you buy me dinner
and say I was pretty then?

996
01:01:45,252 --> 01:01:48,223
Or are you messing with me again?

997
01:01:50,153 --> 01:01:52,462
Or are you seeing someone else?

998
01:01:53,093 --> 01:01:54,892
No, I didn't mean to mess with you.

999
01:01:54,892 --> 01:01:56,802
And it's not that
there's someone else.

1000
01:01:57,002 --> 01:01:58,072
I just...

1001
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,743
I'm just not sure
if I can make you happy.

1002
01:02:04,942 --> 01:02:06,373
What does that mean?

1003
01:02:07,212 --> 01:02:09,212
You're not sure?
What's that supposed to mean?

1004
01:02:10,042 --> 01:02:12,212
Do you have to be 100 percent sure
when you see someone?

1005
01:02:12,582 --> 01:02:14,982
If you like someone,
you can just see her.

1006
01:02:15,383 --> 01:02:16,482
You see...

1007
01:02:18,453 --> 01:02:20,052
I'm completely broke.

1008
01:02:20,823 --> 01:02:22,322
I'm penniless now.

1009
01:02:23,553 --> 01:02:24,632
What?

1010
01:02:26,692 --> 01:02:28,933
I'm doing everything I can...

1011
01:02:28,933 --> 01:02:30,632
just to make ends meet.

1012
01:02:31,363 --> 01:02:32,973
And do you still
want to go out with me?

1013
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:38,102
Once I get paid, I have to pay
the rent and settle my debt.

1014
01:02:38,102 --> 01:02:39,572
Then all I have left
is less than 500 dollars.

1015
01:02:40,303 --> 01:02:41,743
I can't buy you a decent meal...

1016
01:02:41,743 --> 01:02:44,012
or take you to a movie
with that money.

1017
01:02:45,582 --> 01:02:47,382
Are you sure you can date...

1018
01:02:49,653 --> 01:02:51,092
a poor guy like me?

1019
01:02:57,763 --> 01:02:59,632
See? I told you.

1020
01:03:00,993 --> 01:03:02,203
I'm sorry.

1021
01:03:04,962 --> 01:03:08,342
I will pray with all my heart
that you will be happy.

1022
01:03:29,292 --> 01:03:30,632
Gosh, that stings.

1023
01:03:31,062 --> 01:03:32,593
Ms. Baek, hurry up with that...

1024
01:03:32,593 --> 01:03:35,162
and bring the meat from the fridge.

1025
01:03:35,162 --> 01:03:36,302
Sure.

1026
01:03:39,962 --> 01:03:41,743
Gosh. Darn, that stings.

1027
01:03:43,133 --> 01:03:45,313
Gosh, my back.

1028
01:03:46,203 --> 01:03:48,043
My back is killing me.

1029
01:03:53,743 --> 01:03:55,683
Oh, no.

1030
01:03:57,252 --> 01:03:59,383
Are you kidding me?

1031
01:03:59,383 --> 01:04:01,923
How could you drop the meat?

1032
01:04:01,923 --> 01:04:05,292
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I suddenly lost my grip.

1033
01:04:05,292 --> 01:04:07,633
I'm so sorry about this.

1034
01:04:07,633 --> 01:04:08,962
What do I do?

1035
01:04:08,962 --> 01:04:10,803
Oh, dear.

1036
01:04:10,803 --> 01:04:13,402
Goodness me. My gosh.

1037
01:04:14,803 --> 01:04:17,179
Ma'am, please.

1038
01:04:17,203 --> 01:04:19,913
- Mr. Oh, pull over.
- Yes, sir.

1039
01:04:22,212 --> 01:04:24,042
Ma'am, you should
at least pay me for the day.

1040
01:04:24,042 --> 01:04:25,552
I worked my butt off today.

1041
01:04:25,642 --> 01:04:27,523
You can't fire me without paying me.

1042
01:04:27,653 --> 01:04:30,152
You have some nerve, don't you?

1043
01:04:30,212 --> 01:04:33,323
You dropped kimchi yesterday.
Today, it was the meat.

1044
01:04:33,323 --> 01:04:35,593
Why should I pay you
when you cost me so much?

1045
01:04:35,593 --> 01:04:37,893
I'll pay your wage,
so pay me back for the meat.

1046
01:04:38,462 --> 01:04:39,493
What?

1047
01:04:39,493 --> 01:04:41,362
You're terrible at this, you know.

1048
01:04:41,462 --> 01:04:44,602
I truly hope you don't work
at other restaurants.

1049
01:04:44,602 --> 01:04:47,543
You not causing trouble
is a good day for anyone.

1050
01:04:48,232 --> 01:04:50,342
Ma'am, please.

1051
01:05:00,343 --> 01:05:03,083
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1052
01:05:35,513 --> 01:05:37,522
Director Ko,
why are you being so nice to me?

1053
01:05:37,522 --> 01:05:39,859
You shouldn't be this nice
to any woman.

1054
01:05:39,883 --> 01:05:41,293
You love ice cream, don't you?

1055
01:05:41,423 --> 01:05:43,493
You love flowers, right?
Let me get you some.

1056
01:05:43,493 --> 01:05:45,632
This is extremely dangerous.

1057
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:47,538
You're flirting with me.

1058
01:05:47,562 --> 01:05:50,763
I hear you don't remember your life
before your accident.

1059
01:05:50,763 --> 01:05:52,208
Don't you want your memories back?

1060
01:05:52,232 --> 01:05:54,402
Of course, I want them back.

1061
01:05:54,502 --> 01:05:57,103
But not knowing your past
could be better for you.

1062
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,303
Do you still want them back
despite that?

1063
01:05:58,303 --> 01:06:00,612
No matter how painful
the memories are,

1064
01:06:00,673 --> 01:06:02,413
they are a part of me.

1065
01:06:02,442 --> 01:06:05,152
They form my life
and show the path I've been on.

1066
01:06:06,613 --> 01:06:08,822
