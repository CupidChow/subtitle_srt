00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,443
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:11,150
(Episode 36)

3
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,310
Hey. Ko Pil Seung.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,711
How dare you come here?

5
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,480
I'm here to see Ma Ri.

6
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,551
What? To see Ma Ri?

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,551
You've got to be kidding me.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,061
Who allowed this?

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,331
Hold on.
Did Jang Soo Yeon call you here?

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,461
That woman is no longer
a part of this family.

11
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,531
She was kicked out.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,241
So leave this second,

13
00:00:48,851 --> 00:00:51,570
and don't even think
about posing as Ma Ri's brother.

14
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:53,411
Jin Dan,

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,911
that's not how you treat a guest.

16
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,580
I'm the one who asked him here.

17
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:03,620
You?

18
00:01:04,271 --> 00:01:05,521
Why?

19
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:07,841
Director Ko.
Ma Ri's room is upstairs.

20
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:09,147
Let me take you up there.

21
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:10,421
Sure.

22
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,431
What the...

23
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,031
What is wrong with Jin Taek?

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,921
Goodness me.

25
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:23,250
Who's that? Isn't that Pil Seung?

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,860
Did he really ask Pil Seung
to come here?

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,591
Mom, what on earth is going on?

28
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:29,567
Because of Ma Ri,
your brother can't see reason.

29
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:31,600
She hasn't been able
to even drink water all day...

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,410
and has only been asking
for Pil Seung.

31
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:35,451
That doesn't mean
he should invite him here.

32
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:38,121
Not when he's the son Soo Yeon
kept hidden for over 30 years.

33
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,220
Is he not thinking straight?

34
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,960
Where's his pride?

35
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,401
Director Ko, how are you here?

36
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,901
I asked him here.

37
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,770
How's Ma Ri?

38
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:01,690
She must not have the energy...

39
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,781
seeing how she
is constantly sleeping.

40
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,151
Ma Ri.

41
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,651
Pil Seung's here.

42
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:20,291
Ma Ri.

43
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,501
It's me.

44
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:25,030
Are you asleep?

45
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:33,471
Ma Ri.

46
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,011
Do you recognize me?

47
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:40,876
Mom.

48
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,481
Yes, Ma Ri.

49
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,391
I must be dreaming.

50
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:51,291
I can see Pil Seung.

51
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:56,930
Ma Ri, this isn't a dream.

52
00:02:57,251 --> 00:03:00,171
Pil Seung's here to see you.

53
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:03,300
Really?

54
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:06,596
Mom, help me sit up.

55
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,011
Sure.

56
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,110
See for yourself.

57
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,620
It's Pil Seung, right?

58
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,590
Pil Seung.

59
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:23,421
Ma Ri.

60
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:26,391
Why are you crying?

61
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,131
I don't know.

62
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:35,800
Seeing you...

63
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:38,737
brought tears to my eyes.

64
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:41,710
Gosh. Why are you crying?

65
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,210
Ma Ri.

66
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:49,481
Where does it hurt?

67
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,050
You can tell me.

68
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:53,221
Pil Seung, I...

69
00:03:54,471 --> 00:03:57,147
Right here.

70
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,131
It hurts so badly.

71
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:02,231
I feel like I can't breathe,

72
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,830
and I can't even drink water.

73
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,941
I didn't know
you were hurting this badly.

74
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:13,671
I heard you haven't been able
to eat anything,

75
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,641
so I got you strawberry ice cream
which is your favorite.

76
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,650
Really?

77
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:21,351
The one from the store
we had before?

78
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,441
I think I'll be able to eat
whatever you got me.

79
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:27,146
I'll have that.

80
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,691
Hold on. Ma Ri, wait.

81
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:31,811
You haven't even had any water,

82
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:34,287
so something that cold
could upset your stomach.

83
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:36,631
Why don't you have some water first?

84
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:38,181
He's right.

85
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:41,100
As the chairman said,
have some water first.

86
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,001
All right.

87
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:46,071
Here.

88
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,117
Ma Ri, were you able to drink that?

89
00:05:04,141 --> 00:05:05,991
Were you able to swallow?

90
00:05:06,511 --> 00:05:07,761
Yes.

91
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,330
It went down
without me even realizing it.

92
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,741
Why don't you take
another sip of water?

93
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,051
It went down again.

94
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:32,251
Gosh, Ma Ri. Thank you so much.

95
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,691
Pil Seung, can I now
have the ice cream?

96
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:41,480
Auntie, just look at Ma Ri.

97
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,126
A while ago, she even threw up
the water she drank,

98
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,051
but now she's eating
porridge and ice cream...

99
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:47,996
because Pil Seung suggested it.

100
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,400
Could they be scheming something
to change Chairman Gong's mind?

101
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:53,237
Tell me about it.

102
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:56,641
How did Director Ko manage that
when even Dr. Kim failed?

103
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:58,111
It's not like he's a doctor himself.

104
00:05:58,931 --> 00:06:00,900
How can Ma Ri be better now...

105
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,006
when she wasn't even able
to drink water?

106
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,391
Auntie, I believe
this is some kind of show.

107
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:08,790
A show?

108
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,030
Director Ko,
I appreciate what you did today.

109
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,100
I apologize for my actions earlier.

110
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:23,441
It was harsh of me.

111
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,066
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,170
Please don't apologize.
It's all right.

113
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,506
If there's anything else you need
regarding Ma Ri,

114
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,020
call me at any time.

115
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:38,220
Until she gets better,

116
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:40,650
I'll help in any way I can.

117
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:45,530
Director Ko, thank you.

118
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:49,301
I'll get going, then.

119
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,590
Hey, Director Ko.

120
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:21,491
As if I don't know
what you're playing at.

121
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:24,011
Your biological mother Jang Soo Yeon
shamelessly moved back in...

122
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:26,001
using Ma Ri's illness as an excuse.

123
00:07:26,251 --> 00:07:27,770
So what is it that you want?

124
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,571
Now that the cat's out of the bag,

125
00:07:30,691 --> 00:07:31,720
you're trying to take advantage
of the stupid Ma Ri...

126
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,040
to score a position in the company.

127
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:36,681
Watch your words.

128
00:07:39,931 --> 00:07:42,280
Talk about Ma Ri
like that once more,

129
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,850
and you'll pay dearly.

130
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:47,121
Got it?

131
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,431
Hey, Ko Pil Seung!
You haven't heard the last of this!

132
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:02,441
As if I'll let him off the hook
this easily.

133
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,061
Answer us truthfully.

134
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:10,480
I bet this is a scheme
designed by you and Ma Ri.

135
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:12,311
What?

136
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,631
What do you mean by that?

137
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:16,720
Who are you trying to fool?

138
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:19,270
What are you trying to gain...

139
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,660
by using Ma Ri
to bring your son into our house?

140
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:25,287
How can you be this audacious?

141
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:26,561
That's not true.

142
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,061
I'm the one
who asked Director Ko here.

143
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,730
Ma Ri and Soo Yeon
had nothing to do with it.

144
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:37,871
Chairman Gong,
are you not in your right mind?

145
00:08:38,321 --> 00:08:40,440
I don't care how sick Ma Ri is.

146
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,040
Don't you know who Ko Pil Seung is?

147
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:45,837
He's the son of this minx,
and he was kept hidden from you.

148
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:48,251
What other choice did I have
when Ma Ri was sick?

149
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,581
I will gladly invite anyone over
if they can help Ma Ri.

150
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:53,920
So don't blame Soo Yeon.

151
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:02,126
Auntie, Chairman Gong must be crazy.

152
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,357
How could he defend
Soo Yeon of all people?

153
00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:06,670
My goodness.

154
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:26,721
Talk about Ma Ri like that
once more,

155
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,361
and you'll pay dearly.

156
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,861
My gosh.

157
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:36,101
What should I do with Ko Pil Seung?

158
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,050
Yes.

159
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,050
Right.

160
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:04,261
Mr. Yoon.

161
00:10:05,241 --> 00:10:06,560
Mr. Yoon!

162
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,091
Yes, sir.

163
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,270
I was reading the script.

164
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,670
Scene eight is set in the rain.

165
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,540
It doesn't have to rain, does it?

166
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:22,331
I mean, it costs a lot
to hire a sprinkler truck.

167
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,581
Why would you do that?

168
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:26,650
And this scene here.

169
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,950
Why are there so many extras?

170
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:33,217
Tell them to film
without them, okay?

171
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:35,150
And the last scene.

172
00:10:36,711 --> 00:10:39,660
Why would you go to Jeju Island
for this one scene?

173
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:42,160
Are you insane?
It'll cost a fortune.

174
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,930
Are they using the drama
as an excuse to travel?

175
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:50,540
If they want to go to Jeju that bad,
they can go on their own dime.

176
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:53,670
They spend so freely
because it's not their money.

177
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:58,310
Hey. Go to Director Ko Pil Seung...

178
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,020
and tell him everything I just said.

179
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:04,150
- Understood?
- Sir.

180
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,070
Director Ko
and Ms. Kim the writer...

181
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,790
insisted they film on Jeju Island.

182
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:13,190
Director Yoon, who pays your salary?

183
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,300
Very well, I'll pass it on, sir.

184
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,381
Ko Pil Seung.

185
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:36,121
Nothing will go the way you want.

186
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,690
Let's wait and see who wins.

187
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,487
Even if this drama flops,

188
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:47,660
I'll bet everything and my life
that I'll get rid of you.

189
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:54,420
What brought you here...

190
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,940
when you must be busy
writing the script?

191
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,310
I'm here to tell you something
you must know.

192
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,780
Please speak freely.

193
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:11,050
I've been in this field
for over 20 years.

194
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,676
I've worked
with many production houses,

195
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,320
and this has never happened before.

196
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:19,930
I was told to kill off the male lead
because they didn't like him...

197
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:22,660
or to replace him with someone else.

198
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,270
I was even told to delete
an important scene.

199
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,520
If we go over the budget,
then as the writer,

200
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,611
I have a responsibility
to discuss and negotiate.

201
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,780
But I can't stand having someone
who knows nothing about dramas...

202
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:40,810
demeaning my work like this.

203
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:45,650
TV dramas are a form of popular art.

204
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,461
My pride as an artist was crushed.

205
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,361
Sir.

206
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:55,861
Do you also think...

207
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,001
art can be controlled
and manipulated...

208
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,670
with power and money?

209
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,396
Ms. Kim, I understand what you mean.

210
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,481
I'll look into it and handle things.

211
00:13:14,131 --> 00:13:17,751
Ko Pil Seung should be here by now.

212
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,020
Is he with Kim Oh Kyeong
planning a double attack?

213
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,290
Fine.

214
00:13:25,641 --> 00:13:27,731
I'll crush them both.

215
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:36,070
Yes, Mr. Cho.

216
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,040
What? The chairman wants to see me?

217
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:50,900
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

218
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,020
What are you up to?

219
00:13:57,241 --> 00:13:58,690
What's wrong, Jin Taek?

220
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,591
Chairman, I mean.

221
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,261
What did you do that made
Kim Oh Kyeong come to see me?

222
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,900
Kim Oh Kyeong the scriptwriter?

223
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,170
She was here?

224
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,511
Jin Taek, that woman...

225
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:18,111
defended Pil Seung
and practically led the protests.

226
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:22,011
She has a crazy temper
and can't be controlled.

227
00:14:22,471 --> 00:14:23,981
There's nothing to discuss.

228
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,690
I'm taking you off the management
of GOGO Entertainment.

229
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,121
What did you say?

230
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:32,491
Jin Taek!

231
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,841
Whatever. Fine.

232
00:14:48,891 --> 00:14:50,141
I quit.

233
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:52,180
I'll just quit.

234
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,851
Darn it!

235
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,150
What's the matter, Jin Dan?

236
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,376
What's this mess?

237
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,251
Jin Taek fired me
as GOGO's temporary CEO.

238
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:02,786
What's wrong with him?

239
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,320
Why are you so upset about that?

240
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,141
Once you take over
as chairman of APP Group,

241
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:10,761
you can shut down GOGO or GUGU,
whatever it's called.

242
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,756
Yes, I could do that.

243
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,800
You shouldn't be caring
about things like that.

244
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,197
What did your brother say?
Did he mention the adoption?

245
00:15:20,221 --> 00:15:23,481
No, that's why I'm losing my mind.

246
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,381
Why is he dragging his feet
when he just has to give in?

247
00:15:26,861 --> 00:15:30,280
I'm annoyed to death
and sick of trying to appease him.

248
00:15:30,331 --> 00:15:31,780
Will he even adopt me?

249
00:15:31,871 --> 00:15:34,420
Your brother
tends to overthink things.

250
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:37,520
I don't get why
when you're his only option.

251
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:38,680
In any case,

252
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,930
watch what you do and say
for a while.

253
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,261
We'll be back at square one
if your brother gets angry with you.

254
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:46,327
I got it, okay?

255
00:15:46,351 --> 00:15:48,570
I know that already.

256
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:52,737
Director,

257
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:55,611
isn't Mr. Gong harassing
us on purpose?

258
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,310
Why else would he want
a new lead or a scene change?

259
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:01,310
It makes no sense.

260
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:04,581
How can we work in this environment?

261
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,221
Ms. Kim was furious.
She said she couldn't work like this.

262
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:13,131
We risk missing our deadline
if we keep being delayed.

263
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:17,331
I'll meet with Mr. Gong
and end it once and for all.

264
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,601
Director.

265
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,430
You can stick to the script.

266
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:23,526
You can go to Jeju Island too.

267
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,567
You're not to change
what Ms. Kim wrote.

268
00:16:25,591 --> 00:16:28,341
- Says who?
- Chairman Gong Jin Taek.

269
00:16:28,391 --> 00:16:31,636
Ms. Kim went straight to him
in his office...

270
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,050
and told him everything.

271
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:35,906
Chairman Gong got so angry...

272
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,251
that he fired CEO Gong Jin Dan
on the spot.

273
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:42,141
You can stop worrying...

274
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:44,520
and film according to the script.

275
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,317
- Is that really true?
- Yes.

276
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:50,400
I got a call
from the chairman's secretary.

277
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,170
Ms. Kim, it's Director Ko.

278
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,410
You did great.

279
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,111
Concentrate on the script now.

280
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,437
We'll handle the filming
so you don't have to worry.

281
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:09,081
Keep it up!

282
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,470
- It worked out.
- Jeju Island.

283
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,861
- Jeju Island.
- Jeju Island.

284
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,160
My gosh.

285
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,591
(Incoming call: Tae Hee)

286
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,680
I'd been feeling rotten lately,

287
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,381
but going on a drive with you
lifted my spirits.

288
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:48,351
You're definitely my vitamin,
Ji Young.

289
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,990
- Your vitamin?
- Yes.

290
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,186
It's a bit hot, isn't it?

291
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,460
Yes.

292
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,180
Reduce the temperature.

293
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,851
(Reduce the temperature.)

294
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,470
You don't have to jump.

295
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,500
Look, Ji Young.

296
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,841
Which finger was it?

297
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,381
I don't know.

298
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,641
It was this one.

299
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
Look, I'll do it again.

300
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,051
See if you can guess.

301
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,101
There.

302
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:55,220
Which finger was it?

303
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,430
This one.

304
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,801
What? My goodness.

305
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:05,601
You're a genius, Ji Young.

306
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:08,071
This is no big deal.

307
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,250
Anyway, you got it right.

308
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,537
Go ahead give me a flick
on the forehead.

309
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:13,561
A flick?

310
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:15,220
Yes. You won.

311
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,910
Here. Go ahead.

312
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:35,950
You may not remember...

313
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,057
since the memories are lost on you,

314
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:39,771
but you and Mr. Gong...

315
00:19:41,051 --> 00:19:42,841
were in love.

316
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,567
Please help your mother this once.

317
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:48,071
Think about Do Sik and Do Jun.

318
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,940
Please help them this one time.

319
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,510
That's right.

320
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,720
I have to try.

321
00:19:57,801 --> 00:20:00,450
We owe Mr. Gong a lot.

322
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,720
Mr. Gong is...

323
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,160
a really nice person.

324
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:17,690
I don't like you anymore.

325
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,641
I've decided to like Mr. Gong.

326
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:38,160
Mr. Gong, thank you
for driving me home.

327
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,361
Get home safely then.

328
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:44,930
I hate that
I have to leave you here.

329
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,771
Why is it so hard
to let you go home?

330
00:20:54,091 --> 00:20:55,341
My gosh.

331
00:20:55,591 --> 00:20:57,240
What's that?

332
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,480
Isn't that our Ji Young?

333
00:21:00,531 --> 00:21:02,111
What? Shush.

334
00:21:02,371 --> 00:21:03,730
It's her.

335
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,321
But who is the man in front of her?

336
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,190
Isn't that Mr. Gong?

337
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,791
Why is he here with Ji Young?

338
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:14,930
Ji Young must've lost her mind.

339
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:17,787
I mean, she has
Director Ko with him.

340
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:19,881
What is she doing with another man?

341
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:22,156
- That silly thing...
- Gosh, Mom.

342
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,190
I forgot to buy something.
We should go to the supermarket.

343
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,440
Let's go.

344
00:21:25,521 --> 00:21:27,641
- But...
- Just go.

345
00:21:46,881 --> 00:21:48,190
Ji Young.

346
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,460
What was that?

347
00:21:50,611 --> 00:21:52,650
My gosh. I...

348
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,700
I'm really sorry.

349
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,510
Do you not want to kiss me?

350
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,440
Well...

351
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:06,660
I don't think...

352
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,881
I'm ready for this.

353
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,170
You don't have to be ready
to kiss someone.

354
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,821
It's just a kiss.

355
00:22:15,271 --> 00:22:16,591
Forget it.

356
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,960
So are you saying I was being hasty?

357
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,601
Fine. I guess
I should give you more time.

358
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:12,525
Hello?

359
00:23:13,045 --> 00:23:15,065
Director Ko, it's me.

360
00:23:15,446 --> 00:23:19,065
I'm calling you for the last time.

361
00:23:19,785 --> 00:23:21,136
For the last time?

362
00:23:21,886 --> 00:23:24,332
Ms. Lee, what are you talking about?

363
00:23:24,356 --> 00:23:28,505
Ji Young is head over heels
for another man.

364
00:23:28,926 --> 00:23:32,946
So Director, you should move on.

365
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:36,735
I absolutely had no idea...

366
00:23:36,735 --> 00:23:38,755
she would be like this.

367
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:41,725
But she changed her mind.
What can we do about it?

368
00:23:42,206 --> 00:23:46,281
Director Ko, I hope
you will find someone better.

369
00:23:46,305 --> 00:23:49,325
Please forget about Ji Young.

370
00:23:50,886 --> 00:23:52,196
Ms. Lee.

371
00:24:23,146 --> 00:24:24,495
Kim Ji Young.

372
00:24:25,815 --> 00:24:28,406
What are you doing here?
It's just pathetic.

373
00:24:29,116 --> 00:24:31,035
Why are you here again?

374
00:24:32,926 --> 00:24:34,775
You shouldn't be doing this.

375
00:24:42,795 --> 00:24:44,116
Ji Young.

376
00:24:47,975 --> 00:24:49,225
Ji Young.

377
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,856
What are you doing here?

378
00:24:53,846 --> 00:24:55,265
You're here to see me, right?

379
00:24:57,186 --> 00:24:58,666
But why are you running away?

380
00:24:59,545 --> 00:25:01,106
No.

381
00:25:02,156 --> 00:25:03,406
I...

382
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,206
I didn't come here to see you.

383
00:25:06,856 --> 00:25:09,505
I was in the neighborhood
to take care of something, and...

384
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:16,485
I think you came here to see me.

385
00:25:17,505 --> 00:25:18,985
Why are you lying?

386
00:25:25,245 --> 00:25:26,555
That's right.

387
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:32,336
Actually, I came here to see you.

388
00:25:35,255 --> 00:25:37,535
Because I was feeling...

389
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:42,346
so bad for you.

390
00:25:44,196 --> 00:25:45,815
Feeling bad for me?

391
00:25:47,765 --> 00:25:49,086
Why?

392
00:25:53,305 --> 00:25:55,025
I don't know.

393
00:25:56,676 --> 00:25:57,956
I'm just...

394
00:26:00,116 --> 00:26:01,696
I'm sorry.

395
00:26:04,186 --> 00:26:05,735
Listen, Ji Young.

396
00:26:07,686 --> 00:26:09,406
I'm the one to apologize.

397
00:26:11,356 --> 00:26:13,235
Once you regain your memories,

398
00:26:14,225 --> 00:26:16,545
you'll know why I'm saying this.

399
00:26:19,325 --> 00:26:21,916
I'm aware that I have no right
to say this to you.

400
00:26:22,465 --> 00:26:24,055
But now that you're here,

401
00:26:24,535 --> 00:26:26,156
I have to say it.

402
00:26:29,336 --> 00:26:31,156
Don't date Mr. Gong.

403
00:26:32,505 --> 00:26:34,666
He's not a good man for you.

404
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:45,336
I shouldn't have come here.

405
00:26:48,656 --> 00:26:50,176
Listen to me, Ji Young.

406
00:26:51,196 --> 00:26:53,416
I'm just worried
you might end up getting hurt.

407
00:26:53,765 --> 00:26:56,312
It's true that you were
going to get engaged to him.

408
00:26:56,336 --> 00:26:58,255
But you had no feelings for him.

409
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:05,225
I should get going.

410
00:27:07,116 --> 00:27:10,025
Just regain your memories quickly
if you're going to be like this!

411
00:27:23,096 --> 00:27:24,416
Hey.

412
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:27,646
Ji Young, where have you been?
It's raining now.

413
00:27:27,795 --> 00:27:30,656
Do Sik, what are you doing here?

414
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:33,856
I saw you in front of the house,
but you weren't coming home.

415
00:27:36,176 --> 00:27:38,896
I had a place to stop by.

416
00:27:40,315 --> 00:27:43,765
Ji Young, are you seeing
Mr. Gong again?

417
00:27:44,315 --> 00:27:45,565
What?

418
00:27:48,215 --> 00:27:49,505
Yes.

419
00:27:49,555 --> 00:27:50,936
Since when?

420
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:52,575
Well...

421
00:27:53,795 --> 00:27:55,846
It hasn't been that long.

422
00:27:58,596 --> 00:28:00,946
Ji Young, how about
we grab some beer?

423
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:03,245
Beer?

424
00:28:24,586 --> 00:28:27,275
Ji Young, are you dating Mr. Gong
because you like him?

425
00:28:27,795 --> 00:28:29,075
What?

426
00:28:30,596 --> 00:28:32,245
Well, yes.

427
00:28:33,995 --> 00:28:37,586
Did Mom force you to date him?

428
00:28:37,765 --> 00:28:40,356
Of course not. That's not it.

429
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:43,586
Really?

430
00:28:47,376 --> 00:28:48,926
Do Sik.

431
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:51,995
Back when I was Do Ra,

432
00:28:52,586 --> 00:28:56,735
is it true that I was going
to get engaged to Mr. Gong?

433
00:28:58,055 --> 00:29:01,805
Did I really like him that much?

434
00:29:02,456 --> 00:29:04,346
I guess.

435
00:29:04,825 --> 00:29:08,646
You must've liked him
to agree to get engaged to him.

436
00:29:11,005 --> 00:29:13,356
Right, of course.

437
00:29:17,575 --> 00:29:19,096
Ji Young,

438
00:29:19,876 --> 00:29:20,946
are you dating him...

439
00:29:20,946 --> 00:29:22,745
because you two
were almost engaged...

440
00:29:22,745 --> 00:29:23,961
even though you currently
don't have feelings for him?

441
00:29:23,985 --> 00:29:26,596
No, it's not like that.

442
00:29:28,015 --> 00:29:29,305
Ji Young.

443
00:29:29,616 --> 00:29:32,062
then was then, and now is now.

444
00:29:32,086 --> 00:29:34,132
Don't date him if you don't want to.

445
00:29:34,156 --> 00:29:35,626
Why would you force yourself...

446
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:37,346
when you don't remember
having feelings for him?

447
00:29:38,596 --> 00:29:40,446
I'm all for it...

448
00:29:40,596 --> 00:29:42,596
if you're dating him out of love.

449
00:29:42,596 --> 00:29:45,515
He's a competent man
who found success.

450
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:48,225
But to be honest,

451
00:29:48,876 --> 00:29:52,696
I'm a little worried
he might find out you're Do Ra.

452
00:29:54,015 --> 00:29:55,846
So don't date him...

453
00:29:55,846 --> 00:29:57,936
if you've only been forcing yourself
to like him. Okay?

454
00:30:01,555 --> 00:30:02,836
Do Sik.

455
00:30:03,725 --> 00:30:05,406
Do you think...

456
00:30:06,156 --> 00:30:10,201
I liked Director Ko more...

457
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,416
or Mr. Gong more?

458
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:18,715
Do you still have feelings
for Pil Seung?

459
00:30:20,065 --> 00:30:23,586
No, it's not like that.

460
00:30:25,045 --> 00:30:28,825
If I'm being honest,
I still can't forgive him.

461
00:30:29,876 --> 00:30:31,315
He knew you were Do Ra...

462
00:30:31,315 --> 00:30:33,936
but kept you away from us.

463
00:30:37,555 --> 00:30:38,836
That...

464
00:30:44,765 --> 00:30:46,015
Right.

465
00:30:52,235 --> 00:30:54,886
Everyone, may I have your attention?

466
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:56,951
At 10 p.m. tonight,

467
00:30:56,975 --> 00:31:00,122
"The House of Roses" directed
by our son Ko Pil Seung...

468
00:31:00,146 --> 00:31:01,721
will premiere.

469
00:31:01,745 --> 00:31:04,062
To celebrate
the series' first episode,

470
00:31:04,086 --> 00:31:06,565
steamed eggs will be on the house.

471
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:10,525
- Thank you.
- Thanks!

472
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:12,005
Enjoy your eggs.

473
00:31:13,086 --> 00:31:15,725
My goodness.

474
00:31:15,725 --> 00:31:20,196
("The House of Roses")

475
00:31:20,396 --> 00:31:22,946
I want to ruin her face.

476
00:31:25,406 --> 00:31:27,586
Will he then give me his attention?

477
00:31:32,206 --> 00:31:35,422
Gosh, that was entertaining.

478
00:31:35,446 --> 00:31:37,946
You're right. It was entertaining.

479
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:40,991
Pil Seung, I lost track of time
while watching that.

480
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:44,562
Pil Seung, I think
it'll be a huge hit.

481
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:47,876
Gosh, you're a great director.

482
00:31:48,126 --> 00:31:50,745
And how was Ji Young's acting
that good?

483
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,545
Is she really the same girl
who rented our spare unit?

484
00:31:53,596 --> 00:31:55,715
She's even better than Na Bi.

485
00:31:55,936 --> 00:31:58,441
I have a feeling
this will put Ji Young on the map.

486
00:31:58,465 --> 00:32:01,005
Everyone's talking about her
on the real-time chat.

487
00:32:01,005 --> 00:32:02,051
Really?

488
00:32:02,075 --> 00:32:04,221
Pil Seung, I can see
you worked hard on this.

489
00:32:04,245 --> 00:32:07,565
That was golden,
and I think it'll be a huge hit.

490
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,666
Are you sure?
Are you lying to feed my ego?

491
00:32:10,745 --> 00:32:13,862
Gosh. I meant it
when I said it was entertaining.

492
00:32:13,886 --> 00:32:16,136
I wasn't lying at all.

493
00:32:17,156 --> 00:32:19,475
I'm glad to hear
that you all loved it.

494
00:32:20,495 --> 00:32:23,456
Why don't you seem over the moon...

495
00:32:23,456 --> 00:32:25,142
when your show came out nicely?

496
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:26,672
Is something up?

497
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,815
What? Of course not.

498
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:31,106
I had a few drinks
with the crew earlier,

499
00:32:31,106 --> 00:32:32,616
and now I'm a bit dazed.

500
00:32:33,206 --> 00:32:35,751
Thank you for enjoying the episode.

501
00:32:35,775 --> 00:32:37,005
- I'll head upstairs.
- Sure.

502
00:32:37,005 --> 00:32:38,906
- You did well.
- We enjoyed it.

503
00:32:38,906 --> 00:32:40,156
Thanks.

504
00:32:41,815 --> 00:32:44,015
Our ex-tenant sure knows...

505
00:32:44,015 --> 00:32:46,322
how to portray
that bitter side of a woman.

506
00:32:46,346 --> 00:32:48,836
Tell me about it. It shocked me too.

507
00:32:49,086 --> 00:32:50,636
Anyway, it seems...

508
00:32:50,785 --> 00:32:54,295
as though their relationship
is over for real...

509
00:32:54,295 --> 00:32:55,646
judging by the look on his face.

510
00:32:56,156 --> 00:32:59,142
Can you not talk about her anymore?

511
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:01,642
She's someone
who has nothing to do with us now.

512
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:03,586
She's just another actress.

513
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,981
It's good that they ended things.

514
00:33:06,005 --> 00:33:07,511
Imagine
if they had still been dating.

515
00:33:07,535 --> 00:33:09,235
People would have talked about...

516
00:33:09,235 --> 00:33:12,156
how the director was dating
an actress from his show.

517
00:33:14,215 --> 00:33:15,465
Right.

518
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,186
Where are you coming from
at this hour?

519
00:33:53,186 --> 00:33:55,535
- My gosh!
- Gosh.

520
00:33:57,626 --> 00:34:00,906
Why are you so jumpy?
Did you do something wrong?

521
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,446
Do something wrong?

522
00:34:04,025 --> 00:34:06,916
Isn't this where you live?

523
00:34:07,196 --> 00:34:09,872
You were tiptoeing inside
like a cat burglar...

524
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:12,082
and then yelped
as if you had seen a ghost.

525
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:14,725
I didn't want to wake you up.

526
00:34:15,836 --> 00:34:17,155
Is that so?

527
00:34:18,845 --> 00:34:22,591
Hold on. Where were you
at this early hour?

528
00:34:22,615 --> 00:34:24,816
Sorry? Well...

529
00:34:24,816 --> 00:34:26,635
At a Buddhist temple.

530
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:29,236
You were at a temple?

531
00:34:29,615 --> 00:34:32,506
Why were you there
at the crack of dawn?

532
00:34:33,186 --> 00:34:36,832
You know
how Ma Ri has been sick lately.

533
00:34:36,856 --> 00:34:38,725
I wanted to pray for her recovery...

534
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:40,936
as well as for the health
and peace...

535
00:34:40,936 --> 00:34:43,186
of our family, you know.

536
00:34:43,236 --> 00:34:46,035
Also, I prayed for Jin Dan
to be adopted...

537
00:34:46,035 --> 00:34:48,781
and to be a good leader
of APP Group.

538
00:34:48,805 --> 00:34:51,896
Our family should only be in bliss.

539
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:56,421
Gosh. I can't believe
you even thought to do that.

540
00:34:56,445 --> 00:34:57,896
I'm proud of you.

541
00:34:58,686 --> 00:34:59,966
Still,

542
00:35:00,546 --> 00:35:04,035
most early morning prayers
are conducted from dawn to morning.

543
00:35:04,456 --> 00:35:07,675
But you left at night
only to return before daybreak.

544
00:35:07,825 --> 00:35:09,146
Sorry?

545
00:35:13,095 --> 00:35:14,345
Gosh.

546
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:17,285
What are you doing out here
this early?

547
00:35:17,506 --> 00:35:19,515
- Are you off to work out?
- Yes.

548
00:35:20,635 --> 00:35:23,356
Your mother went
to a temple to pray.

549
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,281
Were you not home last night?

550
00:35:26,305 --> 00:35:28,175
What? Well...

551
00:35:28,175 --> 00:35:29,825
Jin Dan, get going.

552
00:35:30,015 --> 00:35:32,265
Auntie, you should rest.
I should rest as well.

553
00:35:39,086 --> 00:35:41,372
- Gosh, hello.
- Hello.

554
00:35:41,396 --> 00:35:42,825
Oh, right.

555
00:35:42,825 --> 00:35:44,716
You must be our new tenant.

556
00:35:44,796 --> 00:35:47,095
I've been busy with work
from morning till night...

557
00:35:47,095 --> 00:35:48,841
and only got to meet you today.

558
00:35:48,865 --> 00:35:51,412
I should've come by
to introduce myself.

559
00:35:51,436 --> 00:35:54,876
Don't be silly. Just let us know
if anything is bothering you.

560
00:35:54,876 --> 00:35:56,756
- Have a good day, then.
- You too.

561
00:35:58,046 --> 00:36:00,995
Hold on, sir.

562
00:36:01,316 --> 00:36:02,595
Yes?

563
00:36:03,015 --> 00:36:07,135
Haven't we met before?
You seem awfully familiar.

564
00:36:07,816 --> 00:36:09,956
Sorry? I'm not sure...

565
00:36:09,956 --> 00:36:12,675
Wait, aren't you Hyun Chul?

566
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:18,171
Yes, I am. But do I know you?

567
00:36:18,195 --> 00:36:20,845
It's me, Jin Sang Gu.

568
00:36:21,836 --> 00:36:23,086
What?

569
00:36:24,135 --> 00:36:27,982
Wait. Jin Sang Gu
from Dong Middle School?

570
00:36:28,006 --> 00:36:30,075
That's right. It's me!

571
00:36:30,075 --> 00:36:31,396
My gosh.

572
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,752
Hyun Chul.

573
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:34,865
Sang Gu, no way.

574
00:36:35,575 --> 00:36:38,962
Gosh, what a small world.

575
00:36:38,986 --> 00:36:40,316
I can't believe...

576
00:36:40,316 --> 00:36:42,531
you ran into your friend
from middle school.

577
00:36:42,555 --> 00:36:43,615
- Tell me about it.
- I know, right?

578
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:45,075
- It's fascinating.
- It is.

579
00:36:45,655 --> 00:36:48,546
Anyway, are you married?

580
00:36:48,925 --> 00:36:50,276
Do you have children?

581
00:36:50,325 --> 00:36:51,646
Mother, please.

582
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:54,345
It's rude to ask that these days.

583
00:36:54,436 --> 00:36:56,642
How's that rude...

584
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:58,312
when he's friends with Hyun Chul...

585
00:36:58,336 --> 00:37:00,385
and used to live
in our neighborhood?

586
00:37:00,975 --> 00:37:04,356
I lost my wife
to a car accident five years ago.

587
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,095
We didn't have any children.

588
00:37:06,646 --> 00:37:09,026
Gosh, silly me.

589
00:37:10,376 --> 00:37:12,991
I'm sorry I asked.

590
00:37:13,015 --> 00:37:14,365
That's all right.

591
00:37:15,856 --> 00:37:19,332
A long time ago,
I remember hearing...

592
00:37:19,356 --> 00:37:21,725
that you moved somewhere abroad.

593
00:37:21,725 --> 00:37:24,166
Right. I just got back to Korea
after living in the Philippines...

594
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:25,475
for over 30 years.

595
00:37:25,595 --> 00:37:27,316
I moved here for good.

596
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,686
There's no better place
than your homeland.

597
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,686
Of course.

598
00:37:32,736 --> 00:37:36,051
You're young enough to start anew.

599
00:37:36,075 --> 00:37:37,555
Right. That I should.

600
00:37:39,106 --> 00:37:40,356
Goodness.

601
00:37:41,015 --> 00:37:42,595
You must have someone.

602
00:37:42,876 --> 00:37:44,126
What?

603
00:37:44,586 --> 00:37:45,896
Well...

604
00:37:46,316 --> 00:37:47,586
I see.

605
00:37:47,586 --> 00:37:49,405
- Mother, please.
- What?

606
00:37:55,796 --> 00:37:57,155
("The House of Roses" premieres
with a rating of 15.7 percent.)

607
00:37:57,155 --> 00:37:58,495
(Director Ko Pil Seung
proved himself once again!)

608
00:37:58,495 --> 00:38:00,796
(Will Ko Pil Seung and Kim Oh Kyeong
continue to be a success story?)

609
00:38:00,896 --> 00:38:02,312
Director, congratulations.

610
00:38:02,336 --> 00:38:03,535
Director, I appreciate
your hard work.

611
00:38:03,535 --> 00:38:05,216
You all did a great job.

612
00:38:05,706 --> 00:38:06,905
Good job, everyone.

613
00:38:06,905 --> 00:38:08,982
The entire team
should eat out today.

614
00:38:09,006 --> 00:38:10,206
Call everyone over.

615
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:12,225
Dinner will be on me!

616
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:17,686
- Kim Oh Kyeong!
- Writer Kim Oh Kyeong!

617
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:19,316
- Kim Oh Kyeong!
- Writer Kim Oh Kyeong!

618
00:38:19,316 --> 00:38:20,956
- Kim Oh Kyeong!
- Writer Kim Oh Kyeong!

619
00:38:20,956 --> 00:38:23,765
- Kim Oh Kyeong.
- Writer Kim Oh Kyeong.

620
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:26,638
Do Jun, over here.

621
00:38:30,317 --> 00:38:31,638
What was so urgent?

622
00:38:31,857 --> 00:38:33,638
Did something happen at home?

623
00:38:33,888 --> 00:38:35,904
Nothing's up.

624
00:38:35,928 --> 00:38:39,547
I called you here to give you this.

625
00:38:40,968 --> 00:38:42,218
What's this?

626
00:38:42,397 --> 00:38:44,098
Meatballs, cucumber kimchi,

627
00:38:44,098 --> 00:38:46,487
jangjorim, and some side dishes.

628
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:49,007
I made some of your favorite dishes.

629
00:38:49,007 --> 00:38:51,127
Boys your age have huge appetites.

630
00:38:52,107 --> 00:38:53,457
Thank you,

631
00:38:54,047 --> 00:38:56,328
but don't cook for me again.

632
00:38:56,618 --> 00:38:58,618
Why would you thank me in a way...

633
00:38:58,618 --> 00:39:00,368
like you're thanking a stranger?

634
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:04,437
I eat just fine where I'm staying,

635
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:08,237
so care more for Ji Young.

636
00:39:09,428 --> 00:39:10,777
All right.

637
00:39:11,328 --> 00:39:13,377
I'll do right by your sister too.

638
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:17,848
But you're the one
who I feel like I wronged the most.

639
00:39:18,038 --> 00:39:19,813
So just wait a while longer.

640
00:39:19,837 --> 00:39:22,377
Once we have the money,
we'll rent a bigger place.

641
00:39:22,377 --> 00:39:23,928
We'll all live together then.

642
00:39:23,978 --> 00:39:26,808
Also, I'll help you continue
your studies abroad.

643
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:28,058
Got it?

644
00:39:28,448 --> 00:39:30,353
I'm not a little boy anymore.

645
00:39:30,377 --> 00:39:31,377
I'll take care of myself...

646
00:39:31,377 --> 00:39:32,797
and that includes
going abroad to study.

647
00:39:33,118 --> 00:39:35,808
So don't worry about me anymore.

648
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,527
You're all I worry about though.

649
00:39:38,527 --> 00:39:40,138
I want to do right by you the most,

650
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,877
and you're constantly on my mind.

651
00:39:42,998 --> 00:39:44,248
Also...

652
00:39:45,598 --> 00:39:46,804
Take this.

653
00:39:46,828 --> 00:39:49,788
It's not much,
but spend it on whatever you need.

654
00:39:49,868 --> 00:39:53,018
Mom, isn't this money
Ji Young earned?

655
00:39:53,737 --> 00:39:55,908
If you have more to spare,
spend it on her.

656
00:39:55,908 --> 00:39:57,587
Do Jun, please.

657
00:40:00,007 --> 00:40:01,297
Mom.

658
00:40:02,118 --> 00:40:04,567
Don't make life hard for her
this time around.

659
00:40:05,317 --> 00:40:06,638
Just don't.

660
00:40:07,788 --> 00:40:08,888
I'll get going.

661
00:40:08,888 --> 00:40:10,368
Do Jun, wait.

662
00:40:10,518 --> 00:40:13,864
Do Jun, when we find
a new place to live,

663
00:40:13,888 --> 00:40:16,808
you'll move in with us, okay?

664
00:40:19,928 --> 00:40:21,848
Do Jun...

665
00:40:36,078 --> 00:40:38,468
Why do you keep checking your phone?

666
00:40:40,248 --> 00:40:41,567
It's nothing.

667
00:40:41,757 --> 00:40:43,607
The naengmyeon here is nice,
don't you agree?

668
00:40:47,857 --> 00:40:50,078
Do Sik, do you know
you've been acting weird lately?

669
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:51,607
Me?

670
00:40:52,527 --> 00:40:54,098
You haven't been
contacting me often...

671
00:40:54,098 --> 00:40:55,917
let alone asking me out on dates.

672
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:57,468
Even when we're together,

673
00:40:57,468 --> 00:40:59,957
it's like your mind is elsewhere.

674
00:41:00,308 --> 00:41:03,257
Did it seem that way?
That was never the case.

675
00:41:04,808 --> 00:41:06,828
Is something going on at home?

676
00:41:08,948 --> 00:41:11,228
What? Of course not.

677
00:41:12,118 --> 00:41:15,098
Myung Dong, I'm sorry
for making you worry like that.

678
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:20,078
Well, I'm glad to know
that nothing's up.

679
00:41:24,658 --> 00:41:25,948
Here.

680
00:41:29,837 --> 00:41:32,187
Dig in, will you? The noodles
will go mushy at that rate.

681
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:36,288
Do Sik, here.

682
00:41:40,908 --> 00:41:42,228
What on earth?

683
00:41:42,518 --> 00:41:43,978
How is it this good?

684
00:41:43,978 --> 00:41:45,498
Is it because you gave this to me?

685
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:48,268
Gosh.

686
00:41:50,357 --> 00:41:52,288
We haven't been
on a date in a while,

687
00:41:52,288 --> 00:41:54,007
so let's go see a movie.

688
00:41:54,388 --> 00:41:57,047
There's a long list of movies
that I've been meaning...

689
00:41:58,257 --> 00:42:00,143
to see with you.

690
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:01,817
A movie?

691
00:42:03,498 --> 00:42:05,837
I'm sorry about this,

692
00:42:05,837 --> 00:42:07,707
but can I take a rain check?

693
00:42:07,707 --> 00:42:09,658
I have to get back early today.

694
00:42:10,908 --> 00:42:13,828
What did you say?
You're heading home early...

695
00:42:14,107 --> 00:42:15,928
after having this naengmyeon?

696
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,968
Why don't we order some dumplings?

697
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:28,707
Myung Dong, I'll be in touch.
Get home safely.

698
00:42:29,457 --> 00:42:30,777
But...

699
00:42:32,698 --> 00:42:33,978
Seriously?

700
00:42:34,228 --> 00:42:36,118
What has gotten into him?

701
00:42:37,567 --> 00:42:38,817
Hold on.

702
00:42:39,368 --> 00:42:41,518
Does he not like me anymore?

703
00:42:43,408 --> 00:42:44,788
This won't do.

704
00:42:48,748 --> 00:42:50,098
Do Sik.

705
00:42:50,647 --> 00:42:51,897
Hey, Ji Young.

706
00:42:53,288 --> 00:42:55,067
Do Sik, I'm sorry.

707
00:42:55,118 --> 00:42:58,707
You always get home early after work
to look after my grandma.

708
00:42:58,928 --> 00:43:00,627
I'm really grateful,
but I also feel guilty.

709
00:43:00,627 --> 00:43:01,957
Why would you even say that?

710
00:43:01,957 --> 00:43:04,733
Of course I should take care
of your grandma in your stead.

711
00:43:04,757 --> 00:43:06,704
- What am I seeing?
- She'll be waiting for us.

712
00:43:06,728 --> 00:43:09,514
Why is Do Sik with Kim Ji Young?

713
00:43:09,538 --> 00:43:11,218
What do you have on your shoulder?

714
00:43:19,978 --> 00:43:22,098
What did I just see?

715
00:43:22,877 --> 00:43:24,828
It isn't with Pil Seung...

716
00:43:25,018 --> 00:43:27,468
or that rich Mr. Gong
for that matter.

717
00:43:28,187 --> 00:43:30,437
Is Ji Young and Do Sik...

718
00:43:30,788 --> 00:43:32,707
living together in that unit?

719
00:43:34,658 --> 00:43:37,848
How... How could this be?

720
00:43:40,268 --> 00:43:44,448
I won't forgive either of them.
No way.

721
00:43:54,448 --> 00:43:55,748
Hey, Myung Dong.

722
00:43:55,748 --> 00:43:57,678
I can't really talk right now,

723
00:43:57,678 --> 00:43:58,994
so I'll call you later.

724
00:43:59,018 --> 00:44:02,538
Of course you can't talk to me
right now.

725
00:44:03,357 --> 00:44:05,463
But you'll meet me this second.

726
00:44:05,487 --> 00:44:09,047
I'm in front of where you live,
so get out here!

727
00:44:25,078 --> 00:44:27,598
Myung Dong, how are you here?

728
00:44:28,047 --> 00:44:29,368
Park Do Sik, you.

729
00:44:29,848 --> 00:44:32,027
Let me ask you this one thing.

730
00:44:33,147 --> 00:44:34,397
Are you...

731
00:44:34,987 --> 00:44:36,808
living with Kim Ji Young?

732
00:44:37,388 --> 00:44:39,808
The same Kim Ji Young
who used to be our tenant?

733
00:44:44,498 --> 00:44:48,018
Yes, you're right
about us living together, but...

734
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,257
You prick.

735
00:44:52,737 --> 00:44:54,018
You...

736
00:44:54,768 --> 00:44:56,737
Don't ever call me again.

737
00:44:56,737 --> 00:44:58,107
Do you hear me?

738
00:44:58,107 --> 00:44:59,357
But...

739
00:45:05,518 --> 00:45:07,598
Myung Dong, wait.

740
00:45:13,357 --> 00:45:14,707
Yes, Chairman Gong.

741
00:45:17,058 --> 00:45:18,348
Right now?

742
00:45:19,297 --> 00:45:20,978
Yes, I'm free.

743
00:45:22,768 --> 00:45:24,118
Sure thing.

744
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:30,627
Ma Ri, are you still
not feeling well?

745
00:45:31,377 --> 00:45:34,928
You should be eating
and sleeping better by now.

746
00:45:35,877 --> 00:45:39,538
I've been trying to do that,

747
00:45:39,748 --> 00:45:43,567
but I can't help but think
of all these bad things.

748
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:45,957
When I think about
my parents divorcing,

749
00:45:45,957 --> 00:45:48,928
I get too sad to the point
that my heart might explode.

750
00:45:48,928 --> 00:45:51,377
It feels...

751
00:45:51,658 --> 00:45:53,917
as though I'm alone in this world.

752
00:45:56,698 --> 00:45:57,948
What?

753
00:45:58,937 --> 00:46:01,983
That's why I don't want to eat.

754
00:46:02,007 --> 00:46:03,377
I want to go to sleep,

755
00:46:03,377 --> 00:46:06,198
but I keep waking up.

756
00:46:09,948 --> 00:46:12,837
Ma Ri, why would you think
like that?

757
00:46:13,718 --> 00:46:16,007
Ms. Jang and Mr. Gong
aren't going anywhere.

758
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:18,167
They will always be by your side.

759
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:20,837
But...

760
00:46:22,857 --> 00:46:24,748
everything scares me now,

761
00:46:25,098 --> 00:46:27,848
and I don't know
why I'm feeling this way.

762
00:46:33,937 --> 00:46:35,187
Ma Ri.

763
00:46:35,408 --> 00:46:37,428
You also have me now.

764
00:46:38,308 --> 00:46:40,158
You'll never be alone.

765
00:46:42,448 --> 00:46:44,527
Do you mean that?

766
00:46:44,848 --> 00:46:46,788
Will you be by my side?

767
00:46:46,788 --> 00:46:48,538
You won't ever leave me?

768
00:46:49,058 --> 00:46:50,837
Of course I won't.

769
00:46:53,328 --> 00:46:56,308
Then... Then promise.

770
00:46:56,998 --> 00:46:58,507
Okay, I promise.

771
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:03,744
I want to eat, Pil Seung.

772
00:47:03,768 --> 00:47:06,288
I want to eat,
then go on a walk with you.

773
00:47:06,937 --> 00:47:09,627
Okay, let's eat, then go on a walk.

- Friendship test.

I won.

777
00:47:23,118 --> 00:47:24,833
- I'll hit hard.
- Okay.

778
00:47:24,857 --> 00:47:26,207
Don't cry.

779
00:47:29,998 --> 00:47:32,527
Gong Ma Ri,
you're better, aren't you?

780
00:47:32,527 --> 00:47:34,503
- I'm not. Let's play again.
- You are.

781

- Friendship test.
- Friendship test.

GOGO Entertainment,

790
00:48:00,158 --> 00:48:02,877
APP Group has grown
in status and reputation a lot.

791
00:48:03,428 --> 00:48:07,147
I realized only recently
what an effect one drama can have.

792
00:48:07,768 --> 00:48:10,248
Compared to what we spent
on PR and advertising,

793
00:48:10,498 --> 00:48:14,058
this one drama is showing
much bigger and better results.

794
00:48:15,308 --> 00:48:18,957
I think we should invest
in GOGO Entertainment...

795
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:20,698
and expand the business.

796
00:48:22,377 --> 00:48:26,698
But GOGO Entertainment
is currently without a CEO.

797
00:48:29,457 --> 00:48:32,507
I'm thinking we should appoint
Director Ko Pil Seung...

00:49:09,397 --> 00:49:13,317
I was completely engrossed,
and I hadn't been in a while.

806
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:15,317
Congratulations on the hit.

807
00:49:16,397 --> 00:49:18,317
Thank you for the compliments.

808
00:49:18,437 --> 00:49:20,487
I owe it to your support.

809
00:49:20,908 --> 00:49:24,888
I got you completely wrong
because of Soo Yeon.

810
00:49:25,207 --> 00:49:28,328
You were misunderstood
when you'd done nothing wrong.

811
00:49:29,147 --> 00:49:33,167
You suffered in many ways
when you shouldn't have had.

812
00:49:36,118 --> 00:49:37,408
No, sir.

813
00:49:38,718 --> 00:49:40,707
I decided to put...

814
00:49:41,627 --> 00:49:46,317
everything else aside
and acknowledge you as a director.

815
00:49:48,828 --> 00:49:50,417
On that note, Director Ko,

816
00:49:51,098 --> 00:49:52,718
I'd like to make you...

817
00:49:53,268 --> 00:49:56,187
an official and permanent CEO
of GOGO Entertainment...

818
00:49:56,377 --> 00:49:58,558
as of today.

819
00:50:01,308 --> 00:50:02,598
What?

820
00:50:05,078 --> 00:50:07,067
How could I...

821
00:50:07,317 --> 00:50:10,417
One drama brought
APP Group's stock prices up...

822
00:50:10,417 --> 00:50:14,377
and practically advertised
our company to the whole world.

823
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:18,678
You made us go truly global.

824
00:50:20,428 --> 00:50:25,087
I learned through you this time
that a drama...

825
00:50:25,768 --> 00:50:29,328
can have such far-reaching
and powerful effects.

826
00:50:30,408 --> 00:50:33,828
I think that performance proves
you're the only one...

827
00:50:33,978 --> 00:50:35,698
qualified for the job.

828
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:40,667
But I...

829
00:50:40,917 --> 00:50:43,007
Once "The House of Roses"
is complete,

830
00:50:43,687 --> 00:50:45,494
I plan to leave GOGO Entertainment.

831
00:50:45,518 --> 00:50:47,078
I'm already preparing.

832
00:50:49,058 --> 00:50:51,147
Let's say...

833
00:50:52,158 --> 00:50:53,917
we never had a problem.

834
00:50:55,968 --> 00:50:57,248
Pardon?

835
00:51:00,538 --> 00:51:04,058
That title belongs to Ms. Jang.

836
00:51:04,408 --> 00:51:07,957
I don't think
it would be right for me to take it.

837
00:51:09,377 --> 00:51:11,067
Don't worry about that.

838
00:51:11,448 --> 00:51:15,498

839
00:51:18,018 --> 00:51:19,737

841
00:51:26,598 --> 00:51:29,817
I'd like you to become
GOGO Entertainment's CEO...

842
00:51:29,937 --> 00:51:32,538
and produce better dramas
than "The House of Roses"...

843
00:51:32,538 --> 00:51:34,558
so we can both benefit.

845

what Korea can produce.

00:51:44,078 --> 00:51:45,667
From now on, I promise...

847
00:51:46,518 --> 00:51:50,138
to support and invest
in GOGO Entertainment.

00:52:14,607 --> 00:52:15,857
What?

00:52:16,417 --> 00:52:19,297

850
00:52:19,987 --> 00:52:22,667
to become CEO of GOGO Entertainment?

851
00:52:23,058 --> 00:52:24,707
Is that true?

852
00:52:25,658 --> 00:52:26,864
Yes.

853
00:52:26,888 --> 00:52:30,134
My goodness, and on top of that,

854
00:52:30,158 --> 00:52:32,777
because your drama was such a hit,

855
00:52:32,928 --> 00:52:35,647
he'll give you
company shares as a bonus?

856
00:52:36,098 --> 00:52:39,618
- Yes.
- Oh, my goodness.

857
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:43,527
Myung Dong, isn't this great news?

858
00:52:44,408 --> 00:52:47,797
To be honest, I thought
you'd get into huge trouble...

859
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:51,793
because of Ma Ri's mom,
and I was so anxious.

860
00:52:51,817 --> 00:52:54,397
You have no idea.

861
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:57,917
- Yes, this is such a twist.
- It is.

862
00:52:57,917 --> 00:53:01,237
Pil Seung, you must take the offer.

863
00:53:01,328 --> 00:53:04,377
It's a huge opportunity for you.
Say yes, no questions asked.

864
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,248
I should still ask
what Mom and Dad think.

865
00:53:07,868 --> 00:53:09,718
If you don't like the idea,

866
00:53:10,268 --> 00:53:11,888
I'll reconsider.

867
00:53:12,368 --> 00:53:13,618
Wait.

868
00:53:13,837 --> 00:53:15,643

869
00:53:15,667 --> 00:53:18,888
You won't say no to this, will you?

870
00:53:19,178 --> 00:53:22,928
You shouldn't.
Why refuse such a great opportunity?

871
00:53:24,018 --> 00:53:27,194
Honey, your mother must be right.

872
00:53:27,218 --> 00:53:31,138

must've done really well...

873
00:53:31,257 --> 00:53:33,587
if someone who wanted him gone...

874
00:53:33,587 --> 00:53:37,948
decided to change his mind
and make Pil Seung a CEO.

875
00:53:38,058 --> 00:53:40,527
Sun Young, he didn't just do well.

876
00:53:40,527 --> 00:53:42,273
He did amazingly well.

877
00:53:42,297 --> 00:53:45,098
All the stocks
related to GOGO Entertainment...

878
00:53:45,098 --> 00:53:46,844
are increasing in price.

879
00:53:46,868 --> 00:53:49,154

880
00:53:49,178 --> 00:53:52,087
giving Pil Seung something
to bait him with.

881
00:53:52,377 --> 00:53:54,784
Let's be frank.
We know what he is and is like.

882
00:53:54,808 --> 00:53:57,817
He's a chairman of a large company,

883
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:00,018
and he makes decisions
based on profit and benefits...

884
00:54:00,018 --> 00:54:01,864
as he should.

885
00:54:01,888 --> 00:54:05,357
That's why we don't have to worry...

886
00:54:05,357 --> 00:54:07,808
about grudges or emotions.

887
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,978
Yes, you have a point.

888
00:54:13,098 --> 00:54:16,187
Pil Seung, to be honest,

889
00:54:16,268 --> 00:54:20,487
I was going to tell you to resign
after the drama was done.

890
00:54:21,038 --> 00:54:24,558
But now I don't think you should.

891
00:54:25,377 --> 00:54:27,623
You worked hard
for this opportunity.

892
00:54:27,647 --> 00:54:30,527
Why would you turn down an offer
you earned by doing well?

893
00:54:30,817 --> 00:54:33,138
Your future is at stake.

894
00:54:35,248 --> 00:54:36,607
Honey.

895
00:54:37,558 --> 00:54:41,038
I think he should take the offer.
What do you think?

896
00:54:41,728 --> 00:54:43,348
Well...

897
00:54:43,728 --> 00:54:47,417
Pil Seung's being rewarded
for doing well.

898
00:54:47,768 --> 00:54:50,797
Why would I object or be displeased?
Of course, I'm happy for you.

899
00:54:50,797 --> 00:54:52,047
I am.

900
00:54:54,768 --> 00:54:57,728
Yes, Pil Seung, do it.

901
00:54:58,237 --> 00:55:01,857
Accept the promotion
and do even better.

902
00:55:02,147 --> 00:55:03,897
I'm all for it.

903
00:55:12,857 --> 00:55:14,178
Director Ko.

904
00:55:14,388 --> 00:55:15,957
You're more qualified than anyone...

905
00:55:15,957 --> 00:55:18,578
to take over
GOGO Entertainment as CEO.

906
00:55:18,897 --> 00:55:21,218
Please don't refuse the offer.

907
00:55:21,698 --> 00:55:24,047
I offer my support
as the previous CEO.

908
00:55:24,768 --> 00:55:26,344
CEO Ko Pil Seung.

909
00:55:26,368 --> 00:55:29,158
Take over GOGO Entertainment for me.

910
00:55:30,478 --> 00:55:32,388
Who texted you?

911
00:55:35,147 --> 00:55:36,527
Ms. Jang Soo Yeon.

912
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,198
She wants me to take over...

913
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:42,538
and offers her support
as the previous CEO.

914
00:55:45,487 --> 00:55:46,877
Soo Yeon said that?

915
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:49,207
Yes.

916
00:55:56,737 --> 00:55:59,437
(Ko's Drama Has Positive Effects
on APP Group-Related Stocks' Prices)

917
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:20,478
Where's Ma Ri?

918
00:56:21,158 --> 00:56:23,277
She's out for a walk with Mr. Park.

919
00:56:25,058 --> 00:56:26,317
Is she?

920
00:56:26,797 --> 00:56:29,248
Did you tell Mr. Park...

921
00:56:29,698 --> 00:56:32,018
not to keep her out for too long?

922
00:56:32,538 --> 00:56:34,087
Yes, I did.

923
00:56:34,237 --> 00:56:35,957
They'll stay close to home.

924
00:56:40,908 --> 00:56:43,998
For deciding to make Pil Seung...

925
00:56:44,547 --> 00:56:47,368
I mean, for deciding
to make Director Ko the CEO...

926
00:56:48,018 --> 00:56:51,368
of GOGO Entertainment,
I want to thank you.

927
00:56:55,288 --> 00:56:56,808
Why are you thanking me?

928
00:56:57,558 --> 00:57:00,078
It's the board
that made him the CEO, not me.

929
00:57:01,527 --> 00:57:04,018
And I just accepted it...

930
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,713
based on his performance...

931
00:57:06,737 --> 00:57:08,687
for the good of the company.

932
00:57:09,237 --> 00:57:10,527
So...

933
00:57:12,038 --> 00:57:13,698
don't get the wrong idea.

934
00:57:14,877 --> 00:57:16,158
Okay.

935
00:57:17,448 --> 00:57:19,297
Speaking of which,

936
00:57:21,087 --> 00:57:24,038
now that Ma Ri is feeling better,

937
00:57:25,158 --> 00:57:27,207
I think I should move out now.

938
00:57:32,228 --> 00:57:33,718
What are you talking about?

939
00:57:34,797 --> 00:57:37,087
You didn't close down
GOGO Entertainment,

940
00:57:37,498 --> 00:57:39,957
and Director Ko's dismissal
has been canceled.

941
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,357
This is what
we have already agreed on.

942
00:57:44,007 --> 00:57:46,698
I'll do as you say.

943
00:57:48,107 --> 00:57:50,368
Once the divorce paper is ready,

944
00:57:51,547 --> 00:57:52,897
let me leave.

945
00:57:56,388 --> 00:57:58,737
But Ma Ri still
hasn't fully recovered.

946
00:57:59,257 --> 00:58:01,538
She can't sleep well
without you at night.

947
00:58:01,757 --> 00:58:03,448
And you still want to move out?

948
00:58:05,027 --> 00:58:08,478
If you are okay with it,

949
00:58:09,127 --> 00:58:11,718
I really want to live with Ma Ri.

950
00:58:12,337 --> 00:58:15,183
But me staying in this house...

951
00:58:15,207 --> 00:58:17,328
isn't just right.

952
00:58:20,147 --> 00:58:23,127
It's not like
I want you to stay here.

953
00:58:23,618 --> 00:58:25,998
I'm just doing this
for Ma Ri's sake.

954
00:58:26,888 --> 00:58:28,167
So...

955
00:58:29,087 --> 00:58:32,207
just stay here a little longer
until Ma Ri gets better.

956
00:58:38,957 --> 00:58:40,844
Mom, you're here.

957
00:58:40,868 --> 00:58:42,118
Hey.

958
00:58:44,468 --> 00:58:46,888
What? Did you two fight again?

959
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:50,627
No, we didn't fight.

960
00:58:51,377 --> 00:58:53,158
Go to your room
with your mom and rest.

961
00:58:54,478 --> 00:58:55,728
Okay.

962
00:58:56,248 --> 00:58:57,523
Let's go, Mom.

963
00:58:57,547 --> 00:58:59,428
All right. Let's go.

964
00:59:18,368 --> 00:59:20,384
Jin Taek!

965
00:59:20,408 --> 00:59:23,154
What's the matter?
Why are you yelling?

966
00:59:23,178 --> 00:59:26,328
Jin Taek is home, right?
Jin Taek! Are you in the study?

967
00:59:27,248 --> 00:59:28,498
What's the matter?

968
00:59:29,178 --> 00:59:32,067
Jin Taek, do you think
this makes any sense?

969
00:59:32,547 --> 00:59:33,837
Fine.

970
00:59:33,888 --> 00:59:36,733
I accept that I was dismissed
as CEO of GOGO Entertainment.

971
00:59:36,757 --> 00:59:39,707
But how could you make that jerk,
Ko Pil Seung, the CEO?

972
00:59:40,027 --> 00:59:42,134
When you were supposed
to kick him out,

973
00:59:42,158 --> 00:59:45,174
how could you let him
take over the company as CEO?

974
00:59:45,198 --> 00:59:47,578
Chairman Gong, is that true?

975
00:59:47,728 --> 00:59:49,047
Chairman Gong.

976
00:59:50,167 --> 00:59:53,218
Jin Taek, what is he talking about?

977
00:59:53,607 --> 00:59:54,917
So...

978
00:59:55,138 --> 00:59:58,313
Soo Yeon's son
whom she had been hiding...

979
00:59:58,337 --> 01:00:01,277
from you for over 30 years...

980
01:00:01,277 --> 01:00:05,067
became the CEO
of one of our subsidiaries?

981
01:00:05,478 --> 01:00:07,397
Are you out of your mind?

982
01:00:07,848 --> 01:00:09,138
Auntie.

983
01:00:09,558 --> 01:00:11,658
GOGO Entertainment was
without a CEO,

984
01:00:11,658 --> 01:00:14,437
so the board voted unanimously
to make him the CEO.

985
01:00:14,957 --> 01:00:17,777
Director Ko Pil Seung
was qualified for the job,

986
01:00:18,228 --> 01:00:21,518
and that was why the board agreed.
End of discussion.

987
01:00:28,468 --> 01:00:30,158
What's wrong with him?

988
01:00:30,908 --> 01:00:33,198
I mean, how could he make
his wife's hidden son...

989
01:00:33,707 --> 01:00:35,428
become the CEO?

990
01:00:36,178 --> 01:00:39,768
I've been trying really hard
to understand him,

991
01:00:40,587 --> 01:00:42,897
but I just can't.

992
01:00:48,187 --> 01:00:51,103
Auntie, can you believe this?

993
01:00:51,127 --> 01:00:53,078
Chairman Gong
must be out of his mind.

994
01:00:53,397 --> 01:00:55,848
What on earth is he up to?

995
01:00:56,198 --> 01:00:58,897
I told him
to adopt Jin Dan as his son,

996
01:00:58,897 --> 01:01:00,357
but he's not taking care of it.

997
01:01:00,437 --> 01:01:02,667
And he's not kicking that witch out.

998
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:06,388
But he made that witch's hidden son
become the CEO?

999
01:01:06,547 --> 01:01:07,797
My goodness.

1000
01:01:07,978 --> 01:01:11,277
I mean, this could be
something serious.

1001
01:01:11,277 --> 01:01:14,598
We have to do something
to have Jin Dan adopted.

1002
01:01:15,718 --> 01:01:17,288
Yes, we have to.

1003
01:01:17,288 --> 01:01:19,768
I don't have a good feeling
about how things are going here.

1004
01:01:20,658 --> 01:01:23,507
You should go to meet
Lawyer Kang tomorrow.

1005
01:01:23,627 --> 01:01:25,178
Ask him how things are going.

1006
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:26,948
Yes, Auntie.

1007
01:01:31,638 --> 01:01:34,784
Mr. Kang, how are things going
about the adoption?

1008
01:01:34,808 --> 01:01:36,683
Will there be any legal issues?

1009
01:01:36,707 --> 01:01:38,687
There won't be any legal issues.

1010
01:01:39,207 --> 01:01:42,154
I told Chairman Gong
about all the necessary procedures.

1011
01:01:42,178 --> 01:01:44,293
And I gave him
all the documents needed.

1012
01:01:44,317 --> 01:01:47,288
So it's not that Chairman Gong
had a change of heart.

1013
01:01:47,288 --> 01:01:50,317
No. Once he makes up his mind,

1014
01:01:50,317 --> 01:01:52,207
the procedure won't be
so complicated.

1015
01:01:52,817 --> 01:01:55,937
I get it. I appreciate
your hard work, Mr. Kang.

1016
01:01:56,187 --> 01:01:59,377
Give me a call
once you hear from Chairman Gong.

1017
01:01:59,728 --> 01:02:01,218
Yes, ma'am.

1018
01:02:01,897 --> 01:02:04,047
Wait, Mr. Kang.

1019
01:02:04,797 --> 01:02:08,518
How are things going
for Chairman Gong's divorce?

1020
01:02:09,337 --> 01:02:11,328
The documents are ready,

1021
01:02:11,808 --> 01:02:13,897
but they are still
discussing the details.

1022
01:02:14,007 --> 01:02:15,598
I see.

1023
01:02:16,007 --> 01:02:17,277
Thank you.

1024
01:02:17,277 --> 01:02:18,527
All right then.

1025
01:02:27,987 --> 01:02:30,078
Yes. It's me, Sang Gu.

1026
01:02:32,598 --> 01:02:36,047
We were supposed to meet tomorrow.
Could you not wait?

1027
01:02:36,167 --> 01:02:38,218
Did you miss me that much?

1028
01:02:38,667 --> 01:02:39,957
Yes.

1029
01:02:40,707 --> 01:02:43,154
I just can't get enough
of you, Ae Kyo.

1030
01:02:43,178 --> 01:02:46,428
Come on, Sang Gu. Don't be silly.

1031
01:02:46,948 --> 01:02:50,527
And I wanted to ask you something.

1032
01:02:50,948 --> 01:02:53,567
Ask me? What?

1033
01:02:54,748 --> 01:02:58,138
Actually, there's a question
I've been meaning to ask you.

1034
01:02:58,417 --> 01:03:00,264
A question you've been
meaning to ask me?

1035
01:03:00,288 --> 01:03:02,987
What is it? Just tell me.

1036
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:05,808
There's nothing
we can't talk about now, right?

1037
01:03:07,268 --> 01:03:08,518
Ae Kyo.

1038
01:03:09,797 --> 01:03:12,348
- Take a look at this.
- What is it?

1039
01:03:13,067 --> 01:03:15,368
I think
this is a photo of Jin Dan...

1040
01:03:15,368 --> 01:03:17,654
published in a magazine.

1041
01:03:17,678 --> 01:03:18,957
Yes.

1042
01:03:19,038 --> 01:03:21,353
I cut it out a long time ago,
and I've kept it.

1043
01:03:21,377 --> 01:03:25,027
Why did you keep
my son's photo, Sang Gu?

1044
01:03:26,118 --> 01:03:27,437
Look at this photo.

1045
01:03:28,348 --> 01:03:31,138
Doesn't he look just like my father
in his youth?

1046
01:03:31,757 --> 01:03:33,937
So I found it very strange.

1047
01:03:34,158 --> 01:03:36,607
What are you talking about?

1048
01:03:36,828 --> 01:03:38,078
Ae Kyo.

1049
01:03:38,558 --> 01:03:41,178
Do you remember the breakup trip
we went on for the last time?

1050
01:03:41,667 --> 01:03:43,147
So I was wondering...

(Special Interview with CEO Gong
of Angel Investment Corp.)

1052

1053
01:03:50,908 --> 01:03:54,228
Sang Gu, what are you talking about?

1054
01:03:54,478 --> 01:03:55,728

01:04:33,687 --> 01:04:34,793
Wait, Do Ra!

01:04:34,817 --> 01:04:37,737
We love you, Do Ra!

You are my star,

and I'm your moon.

1061
01:04:50,198 --> 01:04:51,587
I'm sorry, Mr. Gong.

1062
01:04:54,308 --> 01:04:55,468
I can't do this.

1063
01:04:55,468 --> 01:04:57,987
I can make two million dollars
after a few hours of a photo shoot.

1064
01:04:58,308 --> 01:05:00,297
Can you give me that money instead?

1065
01:05:01,408 --> 01:05:03,178
The mistake will be mine to regret,

1066
01:05:03,178 --> 01:05:05,667
so shut it and get lost
unless you have two million dollars!

1067
01:05:11,788 --> 01:05:13,877
