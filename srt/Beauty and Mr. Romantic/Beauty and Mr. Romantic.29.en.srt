00:00:00,407 --> 00:00:01,907
- Pil Sung!
- Go Pil Sung!

2
00:00:01,907 --> 00:00:03,797
Pil Sung!
[Episode 29]

3
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:04,987
Pil Sung!

4
00:00:04,987 --> 00:00:07,247
Pil Sung, are you okay?

5
00:00:07,247 --> 00:00:09,357
What happened?

6
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:12,407
Mom, I'm okay, but the President...

7
00:00:13,577 --> 00:00:16,127
Oh, my! Soo Yeon!

8
00:00:16,127 --> 00:00:19,827
Soo Yeon! Soo Yeon, open your eyes!

9
00:00:19,827 --> 00:00:22,297
Ma Ri, what happened?

10
00:00:22,297 --> 00:00:25,127
A wall fell on her on the set

11
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:28,907
and Mom tried to protect Pil Sung, and this is what happened.

12
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:31,917
My mom won't wake up, no matter how much I try to wake her.

13
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:35,337
What? She was trying to protect Pil Sung?

14
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:39,347
No... No, not my Pil Sung!

15
00:00:39,347 --> 00:00:41,580
Pil Sung!

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,537
Mom, Mom, what are you doing?

17
00:00:50,537 --> 00:00:52,197
Wake up, Mom.

18
00:00:52,197 --> 00:00:53,997
Open your eyes, Mom!

19
00:00:53,997 --> 00:00:56,547
Mom! Mom!

20
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:02,487
Mom, can you see me?

21
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:04,247
It's me!

22
00:01:04,247 --> 00:01:05,517
Soo Yeon, are you okay?

23
00:01:05,517 --> 00:01:07,677
Are you awake now?

24
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:10,067
Where's Pil Sung?

25
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:13,747
President, I'm here. I'm okay.

26
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:19,297
Yes, Director Go.

27
00:01:19,297 --> 00:01:21,427
Are you sure you're okay?

28
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:23,567
Yes.

29
00:01:26,557 --> 00:01:33,577
President Jang, you must've worried a lot about Pil Sung getting hurt.

30
00:01:34,907 --> 00:01:37,747
Doctor, are my mom and oppa okay?

31
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:41,237
There's nothing wrong with Director Go, according to the test results.

32
00:01:41,237 --> 00:01:44,397
But Ms. Jang bruised her knee and shoulder.

33
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:48,587
She'll have to take medicine and receive physical therapy for now.

34
00:01:49,217 --> 00:01:50,957
Yes.

35
00:01:50,957 --> 00:01:52,857
Thank you.

36
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:58,357
I'm glad nothing worse happened.

37
00:01:58,357 --> 00:02:03,727
Pil Sung is totally fine. How did you get so injured, President Jang?

38
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:09,087
My mom held Pil Sung like this to protect him, and they fell.

39
00:02:12,197 --> 00:02:18,207
Soo Yeon, thank you so much for saving Pil Sung. But...

40
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:21,007
I'm so sorry you got injured.

41
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:24,427
I feel so guilty about it. I'm sorry.

42
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:26,427
It's okay, Seon Yeong.

43
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:29,987
I'm totally fine. I'm really okay.

44
00:02:29,987 --> 00:02:34,237
The doctor said I was fine, too.

45
00:02:36,597 --> 00:02:39,277
Honey, what happened?

46
00:02:39,277 --> 00:02:40,657
How did you get into an accident?

47
00:02:40,657 --> 00:02:42,737
Are you okay?

48
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:45,497
I'm okay.

49
00:02:45,497 --> 00:02:48,077
They said I'm totally fine.

50
00:02:53,957 --> 00:02:56,327
My gosh, my gosh.

51
00:02:56,327 --> 00:03:01,507
If it wasn't for your friend, something bad could've happened to Pil Sung.

52
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:03,657
I know.

53
00:03:03,657 --> 00:03:10,487
How could she throw her fragile body to save Pil Sung?

54
00:03:11,217 --> 00:03:15,147
Your friend must really care for him a lot.

55
00:03:15,147 --> 00:03:17,407
She paid him so much contract money, too.

56
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:19,747
And now she saved his life.

57
00:03:20,397 --> 00:03:26,647
Pil Sung, you'll have to be loyal to President Jang from now on.

58
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:28,077
Of course.

59
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:32,287
I didn't know she cared about me this much, either.

60
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:36,097
You still need to relax. Rest upstairs.

61
00:03:36,097 --> 00:03:38,897
- Okay, I'll go upstairs.
- Yes, go upstairs.

62
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:41,817
Hey, Myeong Dong. Get me some water.

63
00:03:41,817 --> 00:03:44,217
My heart is still racing so much.

64
00:03:44,217 --> 00:03:46,447
- Okay.
- Aigoo.

65
00:03:48,947 --> 00:03:52,447
I'm glad Soo Yeon didn't get injured more.

66
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:57,417
What if something terrible happened to her trying to save Pil Sung?

67
00:03:57,417 --> 00:04:01,457
I felt so bad that I couldn't face Chairman Gong earlier at the hospital.

68
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:05,517
I know. I don't even want to think about it.

69
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:08,187
By the way, CEO Jang...

70
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:11,817
She said, "Pil Sung, my Pil Sung," unconsciously.

71
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:14,237
Why was she calling for him in that situation?

72
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:16,287
As if he was her child.

73
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:20,677
One might've thought he was her son.

74
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,207
It's because she got injured saving him, I'm sure.

75
00:04:25,027 --> 00:04:30,037
Soo Yeon has cared for Pil Sung since he was a baby.

76
00:04:31,257 --> 00:04:35,957
I'm too lucky to have a friend like her.

77
00:04:35,957 --> 00:04:38,487
You sure are lucky to have a good friend.

78
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,927
You're lucky to have your husband, too? Right?

79
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:46,147
Pardon? My husband? I'm lucky?

80
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:48,897
W-What? She's right.

81
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:55,140
Seriously, you always say nothing but truths.

82
00:04:55,977 --> 00:04:58,827
Yes, yes. You're right.

83
00:04:59,597 --> 00:05:01,847
Gosh, I got so scared.

84
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:10,947
My gosh, how could you throw yourself to save that big man?

85
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:13,367
We almost had a funeral today.

86
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:14,777
I know.

87
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:17,827
We can't break our bones at our age.

88
00:05:17,827 --> 00:05:20,647
How could you throw yourself to save Pil Sung?

89
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:23,927
Were you that worried about Seon Yeong's son getting hurt?

90
00:05:25,687 --> 00:05:28,737
How could I just let someone get injured?

91
00:05:28,737 --> 00:05:31,587
He got into that dangerous situation working for my company.

92
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:33,527
Let's go inside for now.

93
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:37,517
Right. I left the medicine in the car.

94
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:41,007
Ma Ri, bring her to the room. I'll get her medicine.

95
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,707
Okay, Dad.

96
00:05:42,707 --> 00:05:44,447
Let's go, Mom.

97
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:48,907
Heavens helped her today. Seriously.

98
00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:53,217
She's so devoted to Seon Yeong's family.

99
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:55,887
She risked her life to save her son this time.

100
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:59,217
Seriously, what a touching friendship.

101
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:06,917
Having a barbecue reminds me of something.

102
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:10,877
You once got us ribs once.

103
00:06:10,877 --> 00:06:12,667
When we used to live in that grandpa's house.

104
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:15,617
- Do you remember, Do Jun?
- I do.

105
00:06:15,617 --> 00:06:20,137
I don't know where you got the money, but you told us to eat as much as we'd like.

106
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:23,667
I think we ate about 15 servings, the four of us.

107
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,967
Ji Yeong must not remember it.

108
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:31,317
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

109
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:35,957
Gosh, seriously. Stop talking about something she doesn't even remember.

110
00:06:35,957 --> 00:06:38,507
Let's just eat. Seriously.

111
00:06:38,507 --> 00:06:42,857
Here. Do Ra, say ah.

112
00:06:42,857 --> 00:06:46,027
Mom, we agreed not to call her that.

113
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:48,777
Oh, right. It came out of nowhere.

114
00:06:48,777 --> 00:06:51,507
We have to call her Ji Yeong from now on, okay?

115
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:54,957
It'd be a disaster if people found out she was Do Ra.

116
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:58,217
Ji Yeong, say ah. Ah.

117
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,457
Okay.

118
00:07:07,357 --> 00:07:09,557
It's tasty.

119
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:13,197
Thank you so much for caring for me so much.

120
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:17,287
Gosh, don't thank me. We're a family.

121
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:20,957
Do Jun, you say ah, too. Ah.

122
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:24,707
I'll eat it myself.

123
00:07:24,707 --> 00:07:28,077
Come on, Mom wants to feed you.

124
00:07:28,077 --> 00:07:32,977
Yes, just take it. Her arms are hurting.

125
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:38,547
Yes, yes, yes.

126
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:44,377
Mom, why are you crying?

127
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:51,707
The four of us having a meal together...

128
00:07:51,707 --> 00:07:53,967
feels like a dream.

129
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:56,237
I'm so happy.

130
00:07:56,237 --> 00:07:58,727
Gosh, Mom. Why are you doing this now?

131
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,987
You're making me tear up.

132
00:08:03,877 --> 00:08:05,737
Let's not ever...

133
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,697
be separated and live together like this.

134
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:14,347
We can't afford Korean beef, but pork belly makes us so happy.

135
00:08:14,947 --> 00:08:19,057
Ji Yeong, you don't remember, but you're my daughter,

136
00:08:19,057 --> 00:08:24,047
Do Sik's younger sister, and Do Jun's older sister, okay?

137
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:27,917
Okay, got it.

138
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:30,607
I'm so happy, too.

139
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:35,087
My Do Ra... I mean, Ji Yeong is alive and well like this.

140
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:41,077
Seriously. Why are we doing this during a meal?

141
00:08:41,077 --> 00:08:42,927
Let's eat.

142
00:08:42,927 --> 00:08:49,327
Things are still awkward, but we'll get used to it once we start living together.

143
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:51,207
Yes, Ahjumma.

144
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:57,227
I'm happy to have a family like this, too.

145
00:08:57,977 --> 00:09:00,457
I wish she'd called me "Mom" when it's just us.

146
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,507
She keeps calling me "Ahjumma."

147
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:06,127
Mom, we agreed to take things slow.

148
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:08,717
She'll get her memories back soon.

149
00:09:08,717 --> 00:09:12,847
Yes, yes. Let's take it slow. Take it slow.

150
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:18,657
And Ji Yeong, you can call me "Ahjumma" forever. It's okay. It's okay.

151
00:09:18,657 --> 00:09:20,547
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:21,087 --> 00:09:24,857
Don't apologize. I said it's okay. It's okay.

153
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:28,847
Let's eat. Let's eat. Come on and eat. Hurry, eat.

154
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:32,057
Eat, eat.

155
00:09:32,057 --> 00:09:33,687
Let's eat.

156
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:53,447
Grandma, what are you up to?

157
00:09:53,447 --> 00:09:57,177
What do you mean? I'm about to go to bed.

158
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,767
What? Is something going on?

159
00:10:01,307 --> 00:10:03,767
Do I call only when something's going on?

160
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:06,127
Everything's fine.

161
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:08,187
How about you? You're okay, right?

162
00:10:08,187 --> 00:10:12,287
Did you go somewhere random singing the national anthem again?

163
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:14,807
No, no.

164
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:20,507
Deok Ja would've called you if I had gone berzerk.

165
00:10:20,507 --> 00:10:24,837
Is it because I'm happy you're in a show?

166
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:27,527
I'm totally fine these days.

167
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:32,807
Ji Yeong, the neighbors saw you on TV

168
00:10:32,807 --> 00:10:35,277
and they say you became successful.

169
00:10:35,277 --> 00:10:39,967
My shoulders are almost touching the sky these days because of pride!.

170
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:41,827
Really?

171
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:43,427
Yes.

172
00:10:43,427 --> 00:10:47,257
So, don't worry about me at all

173
00:10:47,257 --> 00:10:51,367
and just focus on your job, okay?

174
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,797
Okay, Grandma.

175
00:10:53,797 --> 00:10:59,377
You know... I love you the most in the world, right?

176
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:05,807
I love you the most in the world, too.

177
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:08,237
Thank you, Grandma.

178
00:11:10,217 --> 00:11:12,397
Thank you, Grandma.

179
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,317
I love you.

180
00:11:17,987 --> 00:11:20,317
I love you, Grandma.

181
00:11:43,427 --> 00:11:47,347
Soo Yeon's company made me an amazing offer.

182
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:49,927
Then, the CEO did that on her own?

183
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:51,397
Without even asking you?

184
00:11:51,397 --> 00:11:54,367
No, not my Pil Sung!

185
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:56,217
Pil Sung!

186
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,777
How strange.

187
00:11:59,577 --> 00:12:01,587
How strange.

188
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:05,557
This is more than just strange.

189
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:11,067
Mom, why do you keep mumbling instead of sleeping?

190
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:14,147
What do you find so strange, exactly?

191
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,267
Myeong Dong, don't you find it strange?

192
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:20,027
Find what strange?

193
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:24,167
She almost died because the wall fell on her.

194
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:28,947
But she wasn't calling for her daughter, Ma Ri, or her husband.

195
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:32,967
Why did she call for Pil Sung in that situation?

196
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:35,327
So desperately, too.

197
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:37,477
Mom, are you still talking about that?

198
00:12:37,477 --> 00:12:43,877
It's probably because she passed out saving Pil Sung.

199
00:12:43,877 --> 00:12:46,437
That's why I find it strange.

200
00:12:46,437 --> 00:12:50,937
Why would she call for Pil Sung in that situation?

201
00:12:52,177 --> 00:12:55,917
And you said this, too.

202
00:12:55,917 --> 00:13:00,747
Amazingly, she offered him that much contract money with Pil Sung's experience.

203
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:05,407
Why? Why did she pay him twice as much to hire him?

204
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:11,177
She's always been too generous to Pil Sung.

205
00:13:11,177 --> 00:13:15,557
She always sent tons of presents and food whenever he was celebrating something.

206
00:13:16,637 --> 00:13:24,470
But she risked her life to save him this time.

207
00:13:25,197 --> 00:13:26,797
Who would...

208
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:29,667
Who would do that for a friend's son?

209
00:13:30,537 --> 00:13:34,867
So? What are you trying to say right now?

210
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:36,637
Hey...

211
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:40,887
No, no. It's just strange.

212
00:13:42,257 --> 00:13:45,277
Seriously, why wake me up for this?

213
00:13:53,787 --> 00:13:58,037
It's strange. It's strange.

214
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:01,377
This isn't more than just strange.

215
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:07,607
You didn't have to get us a meal, Pil Sung.

216
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:10,227
I felt so bad and grateful toward you.

217
00:14:10,227 --> 00:14:12,277
You got injured saving me.

218
00:14:12,277 --> 00:14:14,257
Is it okay to come to work already?

219
00:14:14,257 --> 00:14:17,057
Of course. I came out because I'm okay.

220
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,317
I feel okay since I took medicine and got good sleep.

221
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,377
How about you? Are you really okay?

222
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:24,717
Yes, I'm fine, thanks to you.

223
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:26,447
Thank you so much.

224
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:30,377
How many times did you thank me? Stop now.

225
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:34,247
How long will you thank each other for?

226
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:36,017
Enough with the pleasantries.

227
00:14:36,017 --> 00:14:39,117
How about we start eating now?

228
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:41,547
Shall we?

229
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,477
- Let's eat.
- Enjoy, President Jang.

230
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:47,207
- The blue one.
- This blue one?

231
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:54,947
Yes, yes, yes.

232
00:15:01,157 --> 00:15:03,797
No! What happened?

233
00:15:03,797 --> 00:15:05,767
Isn't it working?

234
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:08,287
I got it!

235
00:15:09,437 --> 00:15:11,287
- Try again.
- Okay, okay.

236
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:13,477
No, no. I can get it. I can get it.

237
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:26,147
- Again! Get another one!
- Another one? Okay.

238
00:15:28,737 --> 00:15:35,187
Yes, I hope Pil sung and Ma Ri continue to get along like this.

239
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:37,477
I hope they continue to be happy like this.

240
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:38,957
- This one, right?
- Yes.

241
00:15:38,957 --> 00:15:41,047
Go further.

242
00:15:42,027 --> 00:15:43,777
Gosh, it's so hot.

243
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,407
- Ji Yeong.
- Yes.

244
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:51,497
I'll make your favorite, kimchijjim, with ribs.

245
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:55,247
Whenever you finished a strict diet for a shoot,

246
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,877
you always wanted my kimchijjim with ribs.

247
00:15:57,877 --> 00:16:00,477
You ate two bowls of rice easily.

248
00:16:00,477 --> 00:16:01,867
Was I like that?

249
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:04,967
I still like kimchijjim with ribs.

250
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:09,437
Oh, my. You lost your memory, but your taste buds haven't changed.

251
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:19,477
Yes, this is Baek Mi Ja of Bbaek Entertainment.

252
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:23,167
A nightclub wants Ms. Kim to perform as the market lady

253
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:26,747
from "Don't Lie to Me." Do you want her to do it?

254
00:16:26,747 --> 00:16:30,577
There will be 10 shows. I'll negotiate the pay.

255
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:32,677
Excuse me.

256
00:16:32,677 --> 00:16:35,847
Ji Yeong is about to play a supporting actor in a 30-billion-won show.

257
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:39,297
She'll be a star once it gets on air.

258
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:41,907
So, get her something dignified instead.

259
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:45,527
Such as cosmetics or drinks commercials.

260
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:48,757
Call me if you get something like that, okay?

261
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:52,157
Seriously, what was he thinking?

262
00:16:52,157 --> 00:16:54,237
What was it? What was it about?

263
00:16:54,237 --> 00:16:57,857
Huh? You don't have to know.

264
00:16:57,857 --> 00:17:00,347
Why do we keep getting gigs like this?

265
00:17:02,027 --> 00:17:03,897
Hand me those.

266
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:17,387
You're preparing the restaurant opening well, right?

267
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:22,057
Of course, I am. Everything is going perfectly.

268
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:28,497
- You mean it, right?
- Of course. I'll really surprise you this time.

269
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:34,637
I'm opening a restaurant thanks to Pil Sung.

270
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,337
We raised our son well, right?

271
00:17:37,337 --> 00:17:41,747
Yes, we're so lucky to have him.

272
00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:49,507
Yes, I'll work hard and pay Pil Sung back.

273
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:54,987
And I'll buy him a nice apartment when he gets married, too.

274
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:57,257
- Gosh, really?
- Of course.

275
00:17:57,257 --> 00:18:00,027
My gosh! How exciting!

276
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:09,477
Jin Dan, why did you start drinking again?

277
00:18:09,477 --> 00:18:11,847
You said you'd get your act together.

278
00:18:11,847 --> 00:18:15,787
The in-laws' gathering is next week. You can't be like this.

279
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:18,907
Mom,

280
00:18:20,357 --> 00:18:23,137
can we push back the in-laws' gathering?

281
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:25,397
Why would you push it back?

282
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:28,797
Why are we rushing it so much?

283
00:18:28,797 --> 00:18:31,157
It's not like we'd get married immediately.

284
00:18:32,407 --> 00:18:36,887
Gong Jin Dan, will you keep saying "Do Ra" again?

285
00:18:36,887 --> 00:18:38,987
Is this because of her?

286
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:41,747
Are you still not back to your senses?

287
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:44,827
Gosh, I don't know.

288
00:18:44,827 --> 00:18:48,027
I don't know why I'm like this, either.

289
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,247
What do we do with you?

290
00:18:51,957 --> 00:18:54,207
My gosh.
[Goban Restaurant]

291
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:59,177
Hyeon Cheol, this is our restaurant, right?

292
00:18:59,177 --> 00:19:01,967
Yes, Mom. This is our restaurant.

293
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:03,827
Congratulations, Oppa.

294
00:19:03,827 --> 00:19:05,127
Thank you.

295
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:07,027
Congratulations, Father.

296
00:19:07,027 --> 00:19:09,017
Thank you.

297
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:14,157
I paid off the loan and got a nice restaurant like this, thanks to you.

298
00:19:14,157 --> 00:19:16,177
I'll work hard.

299
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:19,317
We'll work hard and pay you back in full.

300
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:21,427
What are you talking about? I gave you that money.

301
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,417
Gosh, no.

302
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:26,517
You have to work and pay back the contract money.

303
00:19:26,517 --> 00:19:30,337
How could I just take your hard-earned money?

304
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:34,707
Parents and children need to be financially independent, too.

305
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:37,567
Yes, I agree with Mom.

306
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:40,507
Much, much later, then.

307
00:19:40,507 --> 00:19:43,607
It's big. There's endless space back there.

308
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:46,297
This is so great.

309
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:47,737
Welcome.

310
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:50,387
Two people? Over there, please.

311
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:56,497
Gosh, Soo Yeon! Ma Ri! What brings you here?

312
00:19:56,497 --> 00:20:00,987
What do you mean? We couldn't miss your opening.

313
00:20:00,987 --> 00:20:05,087
Jin Taek wanted to come, too, but he suddenly had to attend a seminar in Jeju-do.

314
00:20:05,087 --> 00:20:08,217
He said he's sorry and he'll make sure to come next time.

315
00:20:08,217 --> 00:20:12,357
He sent us the beautiful garland. That's enough.

316
00:20:12,357 --> 00:20:14,947
Seeing the garland from the APP Group's chairman,

317
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:20,937
the other store owners asked us how we knew him.

318
00:20:20,937 --> 00:20:23,267
Hyeon Cheol is feeling so confident.

319
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:25,377
He's been smiling all day.

320
00:20:25,377 --> 00:20:27,647
Should I tell him to send one every day, then?

321
00:20:27,647 --> 00:20:30,657
Gosh, come on.

322
00:20:30,657 --> 00:20:32,267
You came.

323
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:33,977
- Yes, Pil Sung.
- Hi, Oppa.

324
00:20:33,977 --> 00:20:35,887
Hi, Ma Ri. You should eat.

325
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:37,707
Come this way.

326
00:20:38,677 --> 00:20:40,497
Let's go.

327
00:20:42,877 --> 00:20:45,147
Give me that.

328
00:20:45,147 --> 00:20:47,147
Pil Sung, have a seat. I'll grill instead.

329
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:50,137
No, we grill for you here.

330
00:20:50,137 --> 00:20:52,337
I'll make it tasty for you.

331
00:20:57,747 --> 00:20:59,637
Look how sweaty you got.

332
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:03,787
Thank you.

333
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:10,497
Why would she wipe the sweat off someone else's son's face?

334
00:21:12,097 --> 00:21:16,957
Why would he do that for a man in his 30s?

335
00:21:16,957 --> 00:21:18,397
I know, huh?

336
00:21:18,397 --> 00:21:20,827
That's a bit much.

337
00:21:20,827 --> 00:21:26,367
I know she's Seon Yeong's friend, but people might get the wrong idea.

338
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:28,027
Wrong idea?

339
00:21:28,027 --> 00:21:29,747
Like what?

340
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,447
Huh?

341
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:32,867
- It's nothing.
- Have some, Mother.

342
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:36,767
Hey, hey. Your friend, Soo Yeon...

343
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:39,777
just because Pil Sung was sweating...

344
00:21:39,777 --> 00:21:42,827
she wiped it off of his face like this.

345
00:21:42,827 --> 00:21:46,457
Who does that to a friend's son?

346
00:21:47,077 --> 00:21:49,307
Tell her not to do that anymore.

347
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:51,247
It looks kind of weird.

348
00:21:51,247 --> 00:21:52,697
Mother, come on.

349
00:21:52,697 --> 00:21:56,437
Why is that weird? It's okay to wipe off someone's sweat.

350
00:21:56,437 --> 00:21:57,477
- Go ahead and eat.
- Excuse me.

351
00:21:57,477 --> 00:21:59,287
Yes.

352
00:22:06,127 --> 00:22:10,447
Why would she look at someone else's son like that?

353
00:22:11,837 --> 00:22:14,967
She's so strange.

354
00:22:16,707 --> 00:22:19,887
- Take care.
- Come back with Chairman next time.

355
00:22:19,887 --> 00:22:21,697
- Did you enjoy the food, Ma Ri?
- Yes.

356
00:22:21,697 --> 00:22:23,447
- Come back again.
- Okay.

357
00:22:23,447 --> 00:22:24,877
Thank you for coming.

358
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:28,157
- Take care.
- Get back safely.

359
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:35,307
Myeong Dong, this looks like Ma Ri's earring.

360
00:22:35,307 --> 00:22:37,377
I'll give this to her now.

361
00:22:37,377 --> 00:22:38,907
Okay.

362
00:22:41,804 --> 00:22:46,644
Mom, can I hang out here for a little longer?

363
00:22:47,474 --> 00:22:49,614
What do you mean you want to hang out here?

364
00:22:49,614 --> 00:22:51,714
Didn't you see how busy everyone was?

365
00:22:51,714 --> 00:22:54,644
Well, I don't mean I'll just hang out.

366
00:22:54,644 --> 00:22:57,564
I want to help them with Oppa, too.

367
00:22:57,564 --> 00:22:58,784
Do it next time.

368
00:22:58,784 --> 00:23:04,634
Since today's the opening day, it's too crowded and chaotic. Get in the car.

369
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,324
I hate saying goodbye to Oppa like this all the time.

370
00:23:07,324 --> 00:23:10,044
I want to live with him in our house.

371
00:23:10,044 --> 00:23:12,804
PIl Sung is my oppa and your son.

372
00:23:12,804 --> 00:23:15,414
How long do we have to be separated like this?

373
00:23:15,414 --> 00:23:19,564
Ma Ri, you promised not to say that.

374
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,454
Get in the car.

375
00:23:21,454 --> 00:23:23,144
Come on.

376
00:23:26,684 --> 00:23:29,194
Good girl. Get in.

377
00:23:42,824 --> 00:23:44,694
My goodness.

378
00:23:45,534 --> 00:23:47,684
What did I just hear?

379
00:23:48,624 --> 00:23:50,954
What did she say just now?

380
00:23:56,944 --> 00:23:58,724
Have a seat.

381
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:05,294
Mom, lie down.

382
00:24:06,234 --> 00:24:08,864
Why are you suddenly dizzy?

383
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,974
Did you overdo it today?

384
00:24:10,974 --> 00:24:13,814
What if you have anemia?

385
00:24:13,814 --> 00:24:15,924
Let's go to the hospital and get a blood test.

386
00:24:15,924 --> 00:24:19,074
I don't have anemia.

387
00:24:19,074 --> 00:24:22,704
It's because I'm in shock. I'm in shock.

388
00:24:22,704 --> 00:24:25,774
Shock? About what?

389
00:24:25,774 --> 00:24:28,754
Myeong Dong, I...

390
00:24:29,794 --> 00:24:33,794
I think I know who Pil Sung's biological mother is.

391
00:24:33,794 --> 00:24:36,404
Pil Sung's biological mother?

392
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,794
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

393
00:24:40,794 --> 00:24:45,844
Myeong Dong, this is a secret between us two.

394
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:48,374
You have to keep it a secret until we die.

395
00:24:48,374 --> 00:24:52,114
Especially from Pil Sung and your sister-in-law.

396
00:24:52,114 --> 00:24:53,964
Come on, seriously!

397
00:24:53,964 --> 00:24:58,424
Today is Oppa's opening day. Why are you wasting time instead of helping?

398
00:24:58,424 --> 00:25:05,504
Myeong Dong, Ma Ri's mom... your sister-in-law's friend, President Jang.

399
00:25:06,634 --> 00:25:10,604
She's Pil Sung's biological mother.

400
00:25:10,604 --> 00:25:14,364
Pil Sung is that woman's son.

401
00:25:18,144 --> 00:25:20,784
What are you talking about?

402
00:25:20,784 --> 00:25:24,594
This is no good. Let's ask the doctor if you have dementia.

403
00:25:24,594 --> 00:25:27,654
Come on! I don't have dementia...

404
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:31,394
When I followed them to give Ma Ri her earrings back,

405
00:25:31,394 --> 00:25:34,754
I overheard clearly with these two ears.

406
00:25:34,754 --> 00:25:38,034
Do you know what Ma Ri and President Jang said?

407
00:25:38,034 --> 00:25:40,904
"How long do we have to be separated?

408
00:25:40,904 --> 00:25:44,694
Pil Sung is your son and my oppa."

409
00:25:44,694 --> 00:25:46,424
That's what she said.

410
00:25:46,424 --> 00:25:49,594
Mom, you're acting strange.

411
00:25:49,594 --> 00:25:51,804
Let's get you tested for dementia.

412
00:25:51,804 --> 00:25:54,444
Come on. What's wrong with you?

413
00:25:54,444 --> 00:25:56,884
It's because you're talking nonsense.

414
00:25:56,884 --> 00:25:59,164
Don't say stuff like that to anyone.

415
00:25:59,164 --> 00:26:03,134
You'd get arrested for defamation if you say that without evidence.

416
00:26:03,134 --> 00:26:10,074
And Ma Ri has said weird things about him since she likes him. Don't you know that?

417
00:26:11,724 --> 00:26:13,504
Is that why?

418
00:26:14,404 --> 00:26:16,764
I'm going back to the store.

419
00:26:18,774 --> 00:26:21,814
We're so busy because it's Oppa's opening day, but you're talking nonsense.

420
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:24,934
What's wrong with you?

421
00:26:28,324 --> 00:26:31,044
Did I really hear that wrong?

422
00:26:32,044 --> 00:26:36,364
I don't think so. My ears work just fine.

423
00:26:38,604 --> 00:26:40,380
Am I wrong?

424
00:26:41,194 --> 00:26:42,844
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

425
00:26:42,844 --> 00:26:45,814
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

426
00:26:49,664 --> 00:26:53,364
Do Sik, don't skip the team dinner from now on.

427
00:26:53,364 --> 00:26:55,454
Stop disappearing all the time.

428
00:26:55,454 --> 00:26:57,344
Okay, I won't.

429
00:26:57,344 --> 00:26:59,994
The soju ad model is Kim Na Bi now.

430
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:03,094
You're right. Wasn't it Jo Sa Ra before?

431
00:27:03,094 --> 00:27:06,284
Jo Sa Ra got cancelled because of prostitution.

432
00:27:06,284 --> 00:27:09,554
Park Do Ra killed herself because of it, too.

433
00:27:10,874 --> 00:27:13,924
Park Do Ra was innocent of that.

434
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:17,444
What do you mean? There were articles about it, too.

435
00:27:17,444 --> 00:27:19,754
It was to pay off her mom's gambling debt.

436
00:27:19,754 --> 00:27:21,904
The photos at the hotel were everywhere, too.

437
00:27:21,904 --> 00:27:23,194
It's not true, I said.

438
00:27:23,194 --> 00:27:25,034
Why do you talk about it as if it is?

439
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:26,474
What do you mean it isn't?

440
00:27:26,474 --> 00:27:28,914
You can still look it up on the internet.

441
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:30,524
It's all fake news.

442
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,814
Enough is enough, please.

443
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:36,434
Geez, why is this asshole pissing me off?

444
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:38,974
That's enough. Why are you ruining the mood?

445
00:27:38,974 --> 00:27:41,094
You're drunk. You're all drunk.

446
00:27:41,094 --> 00:27:44,444
Hey, why would you call it fake news?

447
00:27:44,444 --> 00:27:49,364
Should I show you a photo of Park Do Ra with a man at the hotel?

448
00:27:49,364 --> 00:27:55,424
It says she died out of shame after sleeping with someone for money.

449
00:27:57,474 --> 00:27:59,354
It's not true, you bastard.

450
00:28:00,204 --> 00:28:04,494
Hey, what are you? Are you her cousin or something?

451
00:28:04,494 --> 00:28:05,914
Or are you her older brother?

452
00:28:05,914 --> 00:28:08,324
Yes, I'm Park Do Ra's older brother.

453
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:12,284
Die, you bastard!

454
00:28:18,094 --> 00:28:19,964
Hey! Park Do Sik!

455
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,314
What happened? Why did you hit someone?

456
00:28:22,314 --> 00:28:24,194
You've never done this before!

457
00:28:24,194 --> 00:28:27,074
Excuse me, are you Mr. Park's mother?

458
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:29,414
Yes, I'm his mother.

459
00:28:29,414 --> 00:28:32,064
I'm his younger sister.

460
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:35,784
The victim is at the hospital. Just try to settle.

461
00:28:35,784 --> 00:28:38,754
It'd be a headache if it gets escalated.

462
00:28:38,754 --> 00:28:42,074
Looks like they blew off steam over drinks.

463
00:28:42,074 --> 00:28:44,274
No need to have a criminal record at a young age.

464
00:28:44,274 --> 00:28:46,324
He doesn't even have previous criminal records.

465
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:48,374
You little. Seriously...

466
00:28:48,374 --> 00:28:50,814
Gosh. My goodness.

467
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:52,714
Seriously.

468
00:28:55,554 --> 00:28:59,904
W-What did you say? 50 million won (~$36K)?

469
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:03,964
We have no 50 million. We can't get that money.

470
00:29:03,964 --> 00:29:06,054
Please forgive us just once, sir.

471
00:29:06,054 --> 00:29:10,084
Send him to jail if you don't, then.

472
00:29:10,084 --> 00:29:12,514
Is Park Do Ra his sister or something?

473
00:29:12,514 --> 00:29:16,774
He did this to me by saying Park Do Ra died because she had sex for money.

474
00:29:16,774 --> 00:29:21,764
I can't settle unless you pay me 50 million, okay?

475
00:29:21,764 --> 00:29:24,314
Let the law take care of it! Let's!

476
00:29:24,314 --> 00:29:26,444
He should do time for doing this to me.

477
00:29:26,444 --> 00:29:29,854
My gosh, please have some of this.

478
00:29:29,854 --> 00:29:31,274
This, too. This, too.

479
00:29:31,274 --> 00:29:33,034
Please forgive him just once, Sir.

480
00:29:33,034 --> 00:29:34,944
We're sorry.

481
00:29:38,434 --> 00:29:42,204
I didn't know he got into a fight because of me.

482
00:29:42,204 --> 00:29:46,744
I don't even have five million. How will I get 50 million?

483
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:49,274
Hold on. Should I call Do Jun?

484
00:29:51,464 --> 00:29:55,464
No, he must be living off his small wage.

485
00:29:55,464 --> 00:29:57,184
He can't have any money.

486
00:29:57,184 --> 00:30:00,214
Calling him would only make him worry.

487
00:30:01,214 --> 00:30:05,114
Have some water and calm down, Ahjumma.

488
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,414
Hey, Ji Yeong. Do you have money, by chance?

489
00:30:11,414 --> 00:30:12,984
Could I use it if you do?

490
00:30:12,984 --> 00:30:15,884
We need to stop your brother from going to jail.

491
00:30:15,884 --> 00:30:20,424
I got five million back for the security deposit when I moved out of Director's house.

492
00:30:20,424 --> 00:30:21,994
Is that all you have?

493
00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:23,514
Yes.

494
00:30:25,464 --> 00:30:28,424
Hey, how about the contract fee you're getting from the drama?

495
00:30:28,424 --> 00:30:32,174
Ask Jae Dong when that'll get deposited. Hurry, hurry.

496
00:30:32,174 --> 00:30:33,774
Okay.

497
00:30:49,434 --> 00:30:51,024
President Lee, it's me.

498
00:30:51,024 --> 00:30:55,714
When will I receive the contract fee?

499
00:30:56,814 --> 00:31:01,024
Is that so? Okay.

500
00:31:01,874 --> 00:31:04,554
No, no. E-E-Everything's fine.

501
00:31:04,554 --> 00:31:06,014
I was just curious.

502
00:31:06,014 --> 00:31:08,484
Okay, okay. Bye.

503
00:31:09,764 --> 00:31:11,764
That won't work, either.

504
00:31:11,764 --> 00:31:15,934
I get 30% after the first shoot, but that needs to be used as project expenses.

505
00:31:15,934 --> 00:31:20,384
Gosh, what are we supposed to do, then?

506
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:28,524
Oh, how about your grandma in the countryside? Does she have money?

507
00:31:28,524 --> 00:31:31,054
My grandma? Gosh.

508
00:31:31,054 --> 00:31:34,064
How would she have any money?

509
00:31:34,064 --> 00:31:36,244
What are we going to do about Do Sik?

510
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:38,684
What do we do about Do Sik?

511
00:31:39,824 --> 00:31:44,794
Gosh, Do Ra. I mean, Ji Yeong...

512
00:31:44,794 --> 00:31:48,224
What? Did you come up with a solution?

513
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:54,274
You can get 30 million if you agree to do something.

514
00:31:54,274 --> 00:31:56,324
What? What is it?

515
00:31:56,324 --> 00:31:58,754
I'll do it right now if there's a solution like that.

516
00:31:58,754 --> 00:32:00,874
What is there to think about?

517
00:32:00,874 --> 00:32:02,964
[Hoho Night Club]

518
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:10,284
I didn't want you to do stuff like this again,

519
00:32:10,284 --> 00:32:14,804
but this is the only way to make money now.

520
00:32:14,804 --> 00:32:16,184
It's okay.

521
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:20,074
They'll pay me 30 million if I sing "Pick one, pick one" 10 times.

522
00:32:20,074 --> 00:32:21,464
Of course, I'll do it.

523
00:32:21,464 --> 00:32:25,184
There isn't an easier way to make money than this.

524
00:32:25,184 --> 00:32:29,904
And we can't let Do Sik go to jail.

525
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:32,844
He did that for his sister, Do Ra.

526
00:32:32,844 --> 00:32:38,774
Do Ra... I mean, Ji Yeong, thank you so much.

527
00:32:38,774 --> 00:32:43,144
Thank you so much, my daughter. Thank you.

Everyone!

530

Thank you so much for waiting.

We barely managed to invite the star of "Don't Lie to Me."

I want to live with him in our house.

536
00:33:45,954 --> 00:33:48,504

Yes, I heard them right. I definitely did.

I-Is Pil Sung really President Jang's son?

541
00:34:07,654 --> 00:34:12,604
If that's true... That makes no sense.

Yes, Grandma.

What? You have my other earring?

00:34:56,584 --> 00:34:58,974
Why is no one home, by the way?

548
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:03,614
Everyone went to the restaurant to work.

549
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:11,434
By the way, Ma Ri, you and I are true friends, right?

550
00:35:11,434 --> 00:35:13,524
Of course, we are.

551
00:35:13,524 --> 00:35:21,044
You know true friends can't lie to each other, right?

552
00:35:22,444 --> 00:35:25,434
I guess that's true.

553
00:35:25,434 --> 00:35:27,424
Why do you ask that?

554
00:35:28,654 --> 00:35:32,484
The day our restaurant opened,

555
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:37,584
you left this earring behind.

556
00:35:37,584 --> 00:35:40,724
So, I followed you to give this back to you

557
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:45,024
and heard everything you and your mom, President Jang, said.

558
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:50,674
W-What did you hear?

559
00:35:50,674 --> 00:35:52,774

Is Pil Sung your biological brother?

00:36:29,844 --> 00:36:32,564
M-Ma Ri, is it all true?

572

Yes. You won't... you won't...

573
00:36:36,574 --> 00:36:38,494
You won't tell anyone about it, right?

574
00:36:38,494 --> 00:36:41,114
My dad can't find out about it. That can never happen.

575
00:36:41,114 --> 00:36:45,674
If so, my mom would get kicked out.

576
00:36:45,674 --> 00:36:48,704
She'd get kicked out?

577
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:58,324
Does it mean Pil Sung isn't your dad's son?

578
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:04,884
Yes, he isn't my dad's son. He's my mom's son.

Ms. Kim!

617
00:39:12,974 --> 00:39:15,464
Why would you do this after agreeing to be on our drama?

618
00:39:15,464 --> 00:39:17,204
You didn't tell us anything.

619

Didn't you check the contract?

620

Didn't you read the pre-shoot reminder?

621
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:27,484
I'm sorry. I was so desperate for money.

622
00:39:27,484 --> 00:39:31,324
And I had no idea this would be a problem.

If we feature an actor who sings and dances at a place like this,

632
00:40:02,438 --> 00:40:06,898

I'll understand as we're dismissing Ms. Kim, then.

Director Go, we could've done something if it were just once.

If all of this is true, we can't continue to work with Ms. Kim.

how could you do something so careless?

Tell me what happened.

My older brother...

643
00:40:58,598 --> 00:41:01,498
had a team dinner with his colleagues

644
00:41:01,498 --> 00:41:05,538
and one of them said Park Do Ra died because she got caught having sex for money.

645
00:41:05,538 --> 00:41:09,308
I suppose he said bad things about Park Do Ra.

646
00:41:09,308 --> 00:41:15,038
So, Oppa had a fistfight with him and the colleague got injured a bit.

He said he'd send him to jail if he didn't pay him to settle.

648
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:30,208
The reason he got into a fight was to defend me of all things.

649

I couldn't let him go to jail for that.

650
00:41:34,108 --> 00:41:37,818
Getting the settlement money was all I could think of then.

651
00:41:37,818 --> 00:41:43,848
The nightclub said they'd pay me 30 million won in advance if I performed 10 times.

652
00:41:43,848 --> 00:41:46,318
That's why I performed just once.

How could I ask you for money?

You've never even been to a place like that.

00:42:05,378 --> 00:42:08,468
President Baek did tell you to do this!

661

That was all I could think about.

666
00:42:25,808 --> 00:42:28,578
That's why I did it without considering the consequences.

And I'm your co-CEO.

679
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:31,868
How could you send her there without even telling me?

680
00:43:31,868 --> 00:43:37,138
I mean, she's still unknown as an actor and the shoot hasn't started yet. So I thought it'd be okay.

I did it without thinking through it.

701
00:45:02,078 --> 00:45:04,788
I really didn't know this would happen.

702
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:06,628
And my Do Ra...

703
00:45:07,428 --> 00:45:10,888
I mean, my Ji Yeong can't get fired from the drama.

704
00:45:10,888 --> 00:45:14,328
Please forgive me just once. I beg you.

705
00:45:15,268 --> 00:45:17,408
I know you needed money, but still.

706
00:45:17,408 --> 00:45:19,638
How could you sell Do Ra...

707
00:45:19,638 --> 00:45:21,638
I mean, Ji Yeong to a place like that?

708
00:45:21,638 --> 00:45:24,508
What do you mean, sell? How could you say that?

709
00:45:24,508 --> 00:45:28,958
My son was about to go to jail, but there was no way to get money.

710
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:31,438
And I didn't force her to do it.

711
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:36,358
Do Ra said she'd do it. How could I stop her?

712
00:45:37,558 --> 00:45:39,848
Did you already forget...

713
00:45:40,748 --> 00:45:43,850
how much pain Do Ra was in because of you?

714
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:48,618
Did you already forget what kind of hell she went through because of you?

715
00:45:48,618 --> 00:45:50,748
If she came back to life,

716
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:55,408
if you're truly her mother, you should've embraced her more warmly than anyone.

717
00:45:55,408 --> 00:45:56,918
But...

718
00:45:57,898 --> 00:46:01,418
how could you make Do Ra sing at a place like that?

719
00:46:01,418 --> 00:46:03,548
Can you call yourself a mother?

720
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:06,348
What did you say?

721
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:12,158
This is why I didn't tell you Do Ra was alive. This is why.

722
00:46:12,158 --> 00:46:15,008
That's how desperate I was. That's how...

723
00:46:15,868 --> 00:46:19,688
Don't you feel sorry for me at all?

724
00:46:19,688 --> 00:46:21,368
Seriously, how dare you...

725
00:46:21,368 --> 00:46:23,298
President Baek!

726
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,438
I'm warning you one more time.

727
00:46:26,438 --> 00:46:32,138
If you do something like this again, I swear I won't sit still.

728
00:46:32,138 --> 00:46:34,088
Keep that in mind.

729
00:46:35,088 --> 00:46:38,128
Director Go, it's not like that. Let me...

730
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,458
Wow!

731
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:42,748
How dare that bastard blabber his mouth at me?

732
00:46:42,748 --> 00:46:46,608
My daughter is mine. Why does he care how I use her?

733
00:46:46,608 --> 00:46:49,618
How dare he tell me what to do?

734
00:46:49,618 --> 00:46:53,848
Wow, that bastard. Seriously, how dare he?

735
00:47:00,328 --> 00:47:03,818
This... Where do I hide this?

736
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:12,128
No, no, no. I need to tell them about this.

737
00:47:12,128 --> 00:47:15,808
How could I hide something this important?

738
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:22,248
No, I still promised Ma Ri, though.

739
00:47:22,248 --> 00:47:23,568
How could I...

740
00:47:23,568 --> 00:47:26,688
Gosh, you've got to be kidding me.

741
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,238
Mom, what is it?

742
00:47:32,238 --> 00:47:34,228
Why are you so surprised?

743
00:47:34,228 --> 00:47:37,188
W-What? I didn't do anything.

744
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:40,228
What's that? Why are you hiding it?

745
00:47:40,228 --> 00:47:42,008
Did you cause trouble again?

746
00:47:42,008 --> 00:47:45,648
Gosh, I said it's nothing. It's nothing.

747
00:47:45,648 --> 00:47:48,758
Geez! Give me that!

748
00:47:50,328 --> 00:47:52,968
This is a DNA test result.

749
00:47:52,968 --> 00:47:56,868
Mom, why do you have something like this?

750
00:47:57,928 --> 00:48:00,408
Did you do this by chance?

751
00:48:00,408 --> 00:48:03,868
Yes. I-I did it.

752
00:48:03,868 --> 00:48:08,768
I took Pil Sung's toothbrush and Ma Ri's hair.

753
00:48:08,768 --> 00:48:12,698
They really are biological siblings.

754
00:48:12,698 --> 00:48:14,638
W-What did you say?

755
00:48:14,638 --> 00:48:18,628
Pil Sung and Ma Ri are s-siblings?

756
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:23,218
So, Ma Ri's mom gave birth to Pil Sung. She's his biological mother.

757
00:48:23,218 --> 00:48:25,508
What? Hold on...

758
00:48:25,508 --> 00:48:28,658
Gosh, no way!
[A and B are biologically related and are siblings.]

759
00:48:29,218 --> 00:48:31,558
Mom, I'm home.

760
00:48:33,268 --> 00:48:36,458
Seon Yeong has to run an errand somewhere.

761
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:39,088
Aigoo, aigoo. So tired...

762
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:44,538
What's with you two? What's going on?

763
00:48:44,538 --> 00:48:47,228
What's that piece of paper?

764
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:49,098
What's that?

765
00:48:49,098 --> 00:48:51,518
Let me see. What is it?

766
00:48:51,518 --> 00:48:55,818
- Oppa, Pil Sung's biological mother—
- Hey, hey! You little...

767
00:48:55,818 --> 00:48:59,218
I promised Ma Ri to keep it a secret!

768
00:48:59,218 --> 00:49:00,928
Oppa needs to know. You think that's important?

769
00:49:00,928 --> 00:49:03,048
He's Pil Sung's father.

770
00:49:03,048 --> 00:49:06,588
What about Pil Sung? Did something happen to him?

771
00:49:06,588 --> 00:49:08,068
What's wrong?

772
00:49:08,068 --> 00:49:11,998
Oppa, have a look at this.

773
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,948
- What's this?
- Pil Sung and Ma Ri...

774
00:49:18,548 --> 00:49:21,318
They're siblings, apparently.

775
00:49:22,068 --> 00:49:24,008
What? Seriously.

776
00:49:24,008 --> 00:49:27,108
Mom, what's she saying?

777
00:49:29,518 --> 00:49:31,728
Cheers!

778
00:49:37,258 --> 00:49:40,128
It's so nice and refreshing.

779
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:45,988
I know. It's so nice and cold.

780
00:49:46,968 --> 00:49:52,728
Soo Yeon, Hyeon Cheol has always wanted to have his own restaurant so badly.

781
00:49:52,728 --> 00:49:56,648
He achieved his dream, thanks to you. Thank you so much.

782
00:49:56,648 --> 00:49:58,188
Don't say that.

783
00:49:58,188 --> 00:50:00,808
Pil Sung got him to open the restaurant.

784
00:50:00,808 --> 00:50:03,478
It's because you paid him a lot for the contract.

785
00:50:03,478 --> 00:50:05,458
So, it's all thanks to you.

786
00:50:05,458 --> 00:50:09,378
You keep saying I paid him a lot for the contract.

787
00:50:09,378 --> 00:50:13,388
How many times did I say I hired our Director Go because he's talented?

788
00:50:13,388 --> 00:50:17,028
Thank our Pil Sung instead, okay?

789
00:50:20,848 --> 00:50:27,208
Soo Yeon, you must've been an angel in your previous life.

790
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:32,458
Or my mom sent you to me from heaven.

791
00:50:34,168 --> 00:50:38,348
I don't know what I've done to deserve a friend like you.

792
00:50:38,348 --> 00:50:42,928
Gosh, I'm tired of having to thank you constantly.

793
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:47,388
I'm thankful, too... that I have a friend like you by my side.

794
00:50:47,388 --> 00:50:50,868
that I have a friend like you by my side.

795
00:50:51,658 --> 00:50:56,488
Without you, I would've gone through a lot of hardship.

796
00:50:57,568 --> 00:51:00,428
You've always been by my side whenever I struggled.

797
00:51:00,428 --> 00:51:02,038
Okay, okay.

798
00:51:02,038 --> 00:51:05,958
I'll treat you properly tonight for that reason.

799
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:09,438
Should we drink up this cold beer and do karaoke later, too?

800
00:51:09,438 --> 00:51:11,848
and do karaoke later, too?

801
00:51:11,848 --> 00:51:14,068
Yes, yes! Sounds great!

802
00:51:14,068 --> 00:51:15,818

What was that?

811
00:51:45,448 --> 00:51:47,128
Wait...

812
00:51:47,128 --> 00:51:49,758
H-How could this happen?

813
00:51:49,758 --> 00:51:52,068
Thinking back now,

814
00:51:52,068 --> 00:51:56,348
that woman has been frequenting our house ever since we took in Pil Sung.

815
00:51:56,348 --> 00:51:58,688
She said she decided to be friends with Seon Yeong.

816
00:51:58,688 --> 00:52:02,078
Think about how nice she's been to Seon Yeong and Pil Sung.

817
00:52:02,078 --> 00:52:04,818
She did all this on purpose, I'm telling you.

818
00:52:04,818 --> 00:52:09,438
She wanted to keep an eye on her son after abandoning him here.

819
00:52:09,438 --> 00:52:13,328
A character like that is considered a villain in soap operas.

820
00:52:13,328 --> 00:52:15,778
No, no. She's evil. She's evil.

821
00:52:15,778 --> 00:52:18,978
She's the most evil person ever.

822
00:52:18,978 --> 00:52:22,048
Seon Yeong was so proud of her as a friend.

823
00:52:22,048 --> 00:52:26,688
She depended on her and appreciated her so much. How could she do this?

824
00:52:26,688 --> 00:52:29,458
They say there's nothing scarier than humans.

825
00:52:30,378 --> 00:52:34,568
Oppa, will you tell Seon Yeong about this?

826
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,468
What are you talking about? Why would I tell her?

827
00:52:37,468 --> 00:52:40,098
She'd pass out if she heard about it.

828
00:52:40,098 --> 00:52:42,898
No, she'll die. She'll die...

829
00:52:42,898 --> 00:52:45,488
And Pil Sung is my son. My son.

830
00:52:45,488 --> 00:52:48,298
He's not her son, but mine. Okay?

831
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:51,128
So, Mom, pretend you know nothing about it.

832
00:52:51,128 --> 00:52:53,088
Okay, I will.

833
00:52:53,088 --> 00:52:56,698
Go Myeong Dong, you can't say anything, either.

834
00:52:56,698 --> 00:52:59,548
I won't, Oppa. Don't worry.

835
00:53:01,898 --> 00:53:05,828
Honey! Mother, I'm home!

836
00:53:05,828 --> 00:53:08,908
Oh my gosh, S-Seon Yeong must be here.

837
00:53:08,908 --> 00:53:10,338
What do we do?

838
00:53:10,338 --> 00:53:13,858
What do you mean? Keep your mouth sealed.

839
00:53:17,188 --> 00:53:19,788
What are you all doing here?

840
00:53:21,228 --> 00:53:26,588
We discussed whether we needed anything else at the restaurant.

841
00:53:28,368 --> 00:53:31,098
Where have you been, Honey?

842
00:53:31,098 --> 00:53:34,908
You were able to open the restaurant thanks to Soo Yeon.

843
00:53:34,908 --> 00:53:38,978
So, I treated her to thank her.

844
00:53:38,978 --> 00:53:42,678
We had a beer together like the old days

845
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:47,058
and we sang together, promising a forever friendship at the karaoke.

846
00:53:49,418 --> 00:53:52,658
I'll go to bed now.

847
00:53:52,658 --> 00:53:54,578
I'm so tired!

848
00:53:56,738 --> 00:53:59,678
They promised a forever friendship.

849
00:53:59,678 --> 00:54:03,188
- What do we do with her?
- My goodness.

850
00:54:03,948 --> 00:54:06,878
What are we going to do now?

851
00:54:06,878 --> 00:54:11,428
She has blind faith in that bitch.

Blow out the candle and make a wish, Pil Sung.

857
00:54:37,228 --> 00:54:39,048
Gosh, you're embarrassing me.

858
00:54:39,048 --> 00:54:41,258
I told you not to do this. I'm too old.

859
00:54:41,258 --> 00:54:43,328
- What am I, a child?
- Come on.

860
00:54:43,328 --> 00:54:46,568
- Stop complaining and just do it.
- Seriously.

861
00:54:48,688 --> 00:54:52,018
Father, Mom, Grandma, and Auntie, thank you.

862
00:54:54,238 --> 00:54:55,538

Gosh, Honey. Are you crying?

865
00:55:07,498 --> 00:55:11,838
Gosh, you're so funny.

866
00:55:13,068 --> 00:55:16,048
I-I'm not crying.

00:55:16,048 --> 00:55:18,328
Gosh, seriously.

00:55:20,428 --> 00:55:21,988
Father.

869
00:55:22,608 --> 00:55:24,828
I love you!

870
00:55:24,828 --> 00:55:26,238
I'll go to work now.

871
00:55:26,238 --> 00:55:28,728
Gosh, hey. You should have a slice of cake.

872
00:55:28,728 --> 00:55:30,068
Later.

873
00:55:30,068 --> 00:55:32,698
Aigoo, my son is so busy.

874
00:55:32,698 --> 00:55:38,648
It feels like it was yesterday when he was crawling around here.

875
00:55:39,348 --> 00:55:41,838
When did he grow up so much?

876
00:55:42,538 --> 00:55:45,888
Honey, you're so funny.

877
00:55:45,888 --> 00:55:48,408
I heard men go through menopause, too.

878
00:55:48,408 --> 00:55:53,238
You're probably the only man who cried singing "Happy Birthday" to his son.

879
00:55:54,228 --> 00:55:58,078
He used to be this big, but now he's that big.

880
00:55:58,078 --> 00:56:00,928
Of course, he tears up. Why wouldn't he?

881
00:56:01,598 --> 00:56:03,708
Gosh, well... um...

882
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:06,288
Looks like you're having menopause, too.

883
00:56:06,288 --> 00:56:08,068
Come on now.

884
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:12,228
- My goodness.
- Is anyone home?

885
00:56:13,168 --> 00:56:15,168
Who's that?

886
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:17,868
Unni, someone must be here.

887
00:56:19,778 --> 00:56:21,908
Gosh, Soo Yeon.

888
00:56:22,578 --> 00:56:26,348
You shouldn't have sent all this.

889
00:56:26,348 --> 00:56:30,958
You remember Pil Sung's birthday every year.

890
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:33,248
Yes, thank you.

891
00:56:34,288 --> 00:56:35,878
What?

892
00:56:35,878 --> 00:56:41,548
It's Pil Sung's birthday. Why did you send presents for Hyeon Cheol and me?

893
00:56:42,688 --> 00:56:44,318
Seriously.

894
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:48,008
Gosh, you're driving me crazy.

895
00:56:49,188 --> 00:56:52,318
Okay, thank you.

896
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:55,928
It's Pil Sung's birthday.

897
00:56:55,928 --> 00:56:58,178
She sent you and Hyeon Cheol presents, too?

898
00:56:58,178 --> 00:57:03,728
Yes, she's telling us we went through a lot raising Pil Sung all this time or something.

899
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:08,408
Anyway, she's always coming up with excuses to send presents.

900
00:57:08,408 --> 00:57:09,958
Yes.

901
00:57:09,958 --> 00:57:12,158
This is a purse for me.

902
00:57:12,158 --> 00:57:15,048
This is a belt for you.

903
00:57:15,048 --> 00:57:17,458
Why don't you try this on?

904
00:57:19,748 --> 00:57:21,878
It's okay.

905
00:57:21,878 --> 00:57:25,908
Why does that woman send stuff like this on our son's birthday?

906
00:57:25,908 --> 00:57:28,698
Tell her to care for her daughter instead!

907
00:57:29,728 --> 00:57:33,548
Honey, what's wrong with you?

908
00:57:33,548 --> 00:57:38,068
She's always been generously sending presents for Pil Sung's birthday.

909
00:57:38,068 --> 00:57:41,608
Why are you suddenly doing this?

910
00:57:41,608 --> 00:57:46,618
And what do you mean, "that woman"?

911
00:57:46,618 --> 00:57:50,658
What... What are we, beggars?

912
00:57:50,658 --> 00:57:53,188
Can't we dress or feed ourselves?

913
00:57:53,188 --> 00:57:55,588
We do just fine without stuff like this.

914
00:57:55,588 --> 00:57:57,188
Tell her not to send stuff like this anymore.

915
00:57:57,188 --> 00:57:59,228
You shouldn't accept anything, either.

916
00:57:59,928 --> 00:58:04,148
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

917
00:58:12,828 --> 00:58:14,458
Geez...

918
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:17,218
Hyeon Cheol, what's wrong with you?

919
00:58:17,218 --> 00:58:19,978
She'd end up finding out at this rate.

920
00:58:19,978 --> 00:58:22,498
You told us to play ignorant.

921
00:58:22,498 --> 00:58:25,488
Why would you do this right now?

922
00:58:26,488 --> 00:58:29,288
Am I supposed to tolerate this, then?

923
00:58:29,288 --> 00:58:31,678
We didn't know anything before.

924
00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:34,258
But now we know what she's thinking.

925
00:58:34,258 --> 00:58:38,128
We know what that cunning woman's intentions are.

926
00:58:38,128 --> 00:58:41,218
Are we supposed to just accept stuff from her?

927
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:43,138
What else can you do, then?

928
00:58:43,138 --> 00:58:45,718
Do you think we want to?

929
00:58:45,718 --> 00:58:50,508
As you said, if Seon Yeong finds out the truth, she'll die.

930
00:58:50,508 --> 00:58:52,468
And Pil Sung would find out, too.

931
00:58:52,468 --> 00:58:55,458
Do you want that to happen right now?

932
00:58:55,458 --> 00:59:01,648
Yes, I know I shouldn't. But this isn't right.

933
00:59:01,648 --> 00:59:05,928
How dare she say we raised our son well and stuff like that?

934
00:59:05,928 --> 00:59:10,578
She abandoned her child. How dare she? How dare she?

935
00:59:11,148 --> 00:59:14,098
No, Mom. This is no good.

936
00:59:14,098 --> 00:59:16,928
I'll go see her first thing in the morning and warn her.

937
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,638
I'll tell her never to overstep her boundaries.

938
00:59:19,638 --> 00:59:24,488
I'll tell her to stop showing interest to Pil Sung and Seon Yeong.

939
00:59:26,668 --> 00:59:28,198
Honey...

940
00:59:29,688 --> 00:59:33,888
what are you talking about right now?

941
00:59:33,888 --> 00:59:36,228
H-Honey...

942
00:59:36,788 --> 00:59:39,658
A woman who abandoned her baby?

943
00:59:39,658 --> 00:59:42,728
Who are you talking about right now?

944
00:59:42,728 --> 00:59:45,388

are you talking about Pil Sung's biological mother?

947
00:59:56,748 --> 01:00:00,478
W-Who is it? Who's that woman?

948
01:00:00,478 --> 01:00:02,608
Well, H-Honey...

949
01:00:02,608 --> 01:00:04,768
You said it just now.

950

What did you say?

959
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:45,478
Yes, you need to know, too. Yes.

960
01:00:45,478 --> 01:00:49,928
Pil Sung's biological mother is your friend, Jang Soo Yeon.

961
01:00:50,808 --> 01:00:55,438
