00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:05,421
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:10,070
That's right. Let's end it.

3
00:00:10,341 --> 00:00:11,870
Just end it.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,580
There's no need for you
to try this hard!

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,961
Do Ra...

6
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:40,541
Look at you.

7
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:47,640
Do Ra.

8
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:51,181
Did you just walk?

9
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:53,850
Pil Seung.

10
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:57,151
I...

11
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,861
I just felt a tingling sensation.

12
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,231
I felt something.

13
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,130
I can feel my toes gripping.

14
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,541
Do Ra.

15
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,700
Once more.

16
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,011
Let's try that once more.

17
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,390
Do Ra.

18
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:36,261
You walked.

19
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,060
You walked.

20
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,131
You're good now.

21
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,131
You're good.

22
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:51,571
You're good now.

23
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,650
You said you only felt something...

24
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,550
in the big toe of your right foot,

25
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,620
but the neurological exam
showed great results...

26
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,120
for both your right foot...

27
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,090
and the left.

28
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:11,206
Really?

29
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,530
Yes.

30
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,030
It all depends on the patient now.

31
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,130
Building muscle
in the paralyzed limbs...

32
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,831
is key to your recovery,

33
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:22,041
so focus harder
on your physical therapy.

34
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,110
Sure, Doctor.

35
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,341
Thank you.

36
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,920
See? I said you could do it.

37
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:41,261
Do Ra.

38
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,430
Let's be patient about this...

39
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,531
and take it slow.

40
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:49,630
You'll take
one more step tomorrow...

41
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,571
and then another step
the day after that.

42
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,441
We'll do that. Okay?

43
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,011
Pil Seung,

44
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,811
I walked.

45
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:10,990
Even the doctor said
I could walk again.

46
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,890
So now, you'll keep your promise.

47
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,490
What promise?

48
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,631
You promised...

49
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:22,960
to break up with me
when I could walk again.

50
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:25,971
So, like you promised,

51
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,370
we'll break up.

52
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,841
Park Do Ra.

53
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,310
Do you have to say that
on a good day like today?

54
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,180
A promise is a promise.

55
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:39,850
You saw me walk again,

56
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,251
so lay down...

57
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,351
any burden you have left
and leave me.

58
00:03:46,891 --> 00:03:49,620
I don't want to break up with you
on bad terms,

59
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,606
so do this for me.

60
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,731
I take that back.

61
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:56,100
You thought you were being a burden,

62
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,501
so I said that to ease your guilt.

63
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,571
I never intended
to break up with you.

64
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,011
Besides, you weren't serious
about breaking up with me.

65
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,041
Actually, I meant it.

66
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,881
Why won't you consider your parents?

67
00:04:11,511 --> 00:04:13,821
I may have taken a step today,

68
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:17,390
but who can guarantee
I will be able to walk like before?

69
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,821
No parents would want their child
to date a woman like me.

70
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,060
Is this about last time?

71
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:28,500
If that's the case,
don't let it worry you.

72
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:32,000
My parents are deeply
concerned about you.

73
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:34,671
They want nothing more
than for you to walk again...

74
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:35,940
and are rooting for you.

75
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,911
Stop it. I'm saying
I feel too guilty to stay with you.

76
00:04:40,611 --> 00:04:42,781
You have to start working
on your next project...

77
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:44,481
and should have
even a bigger career.

78
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:46,781
Someone like you
shouldn't waste your time...

79
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:48,451
caring for someone like me.

80
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,521
Park Do Ra.

81
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,421
Must you be this way?

82
00:04:53,421 --> 00:04:56,260
Pil Seung, I want a quiet life now.

83
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,407
So go about your own life,

84
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:01,101
and I'll live mine.

85
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:05,201
Let's live our lives like that
rooting for each other.

86
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:07,800
That's what I want.

87
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,570
You'll keep your word...

88
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,281
and break up with me.

89
00:05:21,651 --> 00:05:23,851
Do you want to break up with me
that desperately?

90
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:27,860
Fine. We'll end it.

91
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:30,190
I've done enough,

92
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,560
and I can't take it anymore.

93
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:56,951
Why are you back here?

94
00:05:57,151 --> 00:05:59,651
We just broke up.

95
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,990
So why are you pushing
my wheelchair for me?

96
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,091
I can manage on my own,

97
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:07,731
so don't mind me and leave!

98
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:17,246
Do Jun, what's with those two?

99
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,781
They obviously love
each other a lot,

100
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:21,411
so why are they breaking up?

101
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:24,750
I know how my sister feels.

102
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,781
She's not breaking up with Pil Seung
because she hates him.

103
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,190
It's because she loves him too much.

104
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,936
What?

105
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,190
Why should they break up
when they love each other a lot?

106
00:06:37,661 --> 00:06:40,201
Pil Seung had it rough
because of my sister.

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,500
She feels guilty.

108
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:44,901
What do you mean by that?

109
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:47,201
Why should they break up
when they love each other?

110
00:06:56,611 --> 00:06:58,880
Do Ra, I saw you...

111
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,620
dumping Pil Seung just now.

112
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,221
From where I stand,

113
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:06,890
you two love each other a lot,
so why did you end things?

114
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,721
Do Ra, you're making a big mistake.

115
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:10,791
What?

116
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:14,260
Do Ra, Do Jun and I had
obstacles to overcome,

117
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,471
but we're going strong.

118
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:19,831
You can overcome anything
as long as you trust each other,

119
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:22,940
so why are you choosing
to crush this precious love?

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,310
Ma Ri, please.

121
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,481
Ma Ri.

122
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:34,880
I'm bad luck.

123
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,791
Do Ra, why would you say that?

124
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,260
Pil Seung...

125
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,300
had it rough because of me.

126
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,870
I only caused him pain,

127
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,541
and he was cursed at.

128
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,940
I want him to be...

129
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,380
in a relationship
that is blessed by others...

130
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,880
and live a happy life.

131
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,120
That is what I want for him.

132
00:08:21,731 --> 00:08:23,130
Do Ra...

133
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,201
Are you pleased now?

134
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,610
You must be pleased now
that Pil Seung and Do Ra broke up...

135
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:35,740
like you wanted.

136
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:42,020
They ended up this way
because of you and Sun Young.

137
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:44,651
You gave money
to a lunatic of a woman...

138
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:47,421
who uses her children
to score gambling money...

139
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,191
and told her to leave with Do Ra.

140
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:58,000
Can you imagine
how Do Ra must've felt?

141
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:01,040
Not being able to walk
was heartbreaking enough,

142
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,310
and she must've hated...

143
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,740
how she needed to run away
from the man she loves.

144
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,910
Honey, I told you I was sorry.

145
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,780
I feel terrible
the more I think about it.

146
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:19,290
That must've shattered her heart...

147
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,261
seeing how she asked Pil Seung...

148
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,321
to break up with her
the moment she took a step.

149
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,360
You and Sun Young
need to clean this up.

150
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:31,371
You two need to talk to her...

151
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:34,270
and mend her heart
as best as you can.

152
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,311
Besides, they clearly love
each other a lot.

153
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,786
I don't think it's wise...

154
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,910
to put them through
the wringer anymore.

155
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,650
All right. I hear you.

156
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,821
All right, Soo Yeon.
I'll see you tomorrow.

157
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:57,591
Why did she call you?
Is something wrong?

158
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,201
That's not it.

159
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,107
Do Ra can walk again.

160
00:10:03,131 --> 00:10:05,001
- My goodness.
- What?

161
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:06,200
That's great.

162
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,001
- I'm so happy for her.
- I can't believe this.

163
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:10,840
How is this happening?
It's such great news.

164
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,946
I'm home.

165
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,757
- Pil Seung.
- Hey. Did you have dinner?

166
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,086
I don't feel like eating.

167
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,181
Wait, Pil Seung.
I hear Do Ra can walk again.

168
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:23,250
- Yes.
- What?

169
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,867
By the way, why the long face?

170
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:30,867
I thought
he would be over the moon...

171
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:33,760
once Do Ra started walking again.

172
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,000
But he seems quite depressed.

173
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,030
Do Ra wanted to break up with him.

174
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:42,316
Why?

175
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,171
Come on, Mom. Isn't that obvious?

176
00:10:45,171 --> 00:10:46,941
It's because of her.

177
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,857
You must be so pleased
that you got your way.

178
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:51,581
- Gosh, how...
- Darn it.

179
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,290
Oh, dear.

180
00:11:33,637 --> 00:11:35,797
(Misong Penitentiary)

181
00:11:36,838 --> 00:11:39,207
Sang Gu, what happened to your face?

182
00:11:39,338 --> 00:11:41,483
Did someone punch you
for not following orders?

183
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:43,248
Or is someone bullying you?

184
00:11:44,978 --> 00:11:46,317
No.

185
00:11:48,647 --> 00:11:51,557
People keep hitting our Jin Dan.

186
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:54,788
Blaming Jin Dan
for Park Do Ra's current condition,

187
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:56,628
they curse and bully him.

188
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:01,527
So I tried to take hits
instead of him and got hurt.

189
00:12:01,527 --> 00:12:04,668
My goodness. Those darn jerks.

190
00:12:06,437 --> 00:12:08,737
I'm sorry, Sang Gu.

191
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,837
But I still need you
to take good care of Jin Dan.

192
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:14,378
You are the only person...

193
00:12:14,378 --> 00:12:16,878
he can count on in there.

194
00:12:17,677 --> 00:12:19,678
That's what I want to do.

195
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,888
But Jin Dan won't have me
on his side.

196
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:26,064
I understand him though.

197
00:12:26,088 --> 00:12:29,388
Our Jin Dan was raised
in easy circumstances.

198
00:12:30,057 --> 00:12:32,498
It must be hard for him to live
in a place like this.

199
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:38,197
I wish he could depend on me
at a time like this.

200
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:43,908
It really breaks my heart
to see Jin Dan here, Ae Kyo.

201
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:51,477
Ae Kyo.

202
00:12:51,718 --> 00:12:54,918
You should meet Jin Dan
and talk to him.

203
00:12:55,187 --> 00:12:58,658
It'd be nice for him to have a dad
whom he could turn to in prison.

204
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:01,687
Even though it’s a bit late
and not the ideal situation,

205
00:13:01,757 --> 00:13:03,898
I still want to spend
some father-son time with him.

206
00:13:04,498 --> 00:13:07,373
You should talk to him for me, okay?

207
00:13:07,397 --> 00:13:08,944
- Okay.
- Tell him...

208
00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:12,067
to get along with me here. Okay?

209
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:13,737
Sure.

210
00:13:21,507 --> 00:13:24,918
Jin Dan, you should get along
with your dad.

211
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:27,248
Your dad worries about you a lot.

212
00:13:27,248 --> 00:13:29,317
Who is my dad?

213
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:32,258
That guy isn't my dad.

214
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:35,388
I will never accept him.

215
00:13:35,657 --> 00:13:37,727
- Jin Dan.
- Darn it.

216
00:13:39,498 --> 00:13:41,368
Stop talking about him.

217
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,038
Mom.

218
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:46,737
What happened to Do Ra?

219
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:48,937
Can she walk yet?

220
00:13:49,738 --> 00:13:52,413
Did she break up with Ko Pil Seung?

221
00:13:52,437 --> 00:13:55,824
Whether she walks or not,
it has nothing to do with you.

222
00:13:55,848 --> 00:13:58,218
Are you still hung up on her?

223
00:13:58,218 --> 00:13:59,878
What are you talking about?

224
00:13:59,878 --> 00:14:01,388
I was just asking.

225
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:05,388
- I should go.
- Wait, Jin Dan.

226
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,033
Get on with your dad, okay?

227
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:09,357
Mom.

228
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:12,957
If that's what you want to say,
stop coming here.

229
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,278
Why did they have to end up
in the same prison?

230
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:27,878
They can't be doing this
as father and son.

231
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:30,178
And I don't deserve any of this.

232
00:14:30,677 --> 00:14:32,977
I work hard and make money
just to visit them in prison.

233
00:14:33,218 --> 00:14:35,918
It's already hard enough
to send them money in prison.

234
00:14:37,057 --> 00:14:39,457
What did I do wrong
in my former life?

235
00:14:46,328 --> 00:14:49,368
My husband wouldn't stop
criticizing me.

236
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,507
He says we did a horrible thing
to a poor girl...

237
00:14:53,507 --> 00:14:55,268
who couldn't even walk.

238
00:14:57,407 --> 00:14:59,278
Did your husband say that?

239
00:15:00,478 --> 00:15:04,278
My husband says
I'm such a spiteful woman.

240
00:15:04,618 --> 00:15:08,248
He even asked if I was happy
after breaking my own son's heart.

241
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:10,658
He wants a divorce.

242
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:18,957
Sun Young, I think
we made a horrible mistake.

243
00:15:20,397 --> 00:15:22,868
I'm not saying this
because of my husband.

244
00:15:24,698 --> 00:15:26,498
Just think of
how she had no choice...

245
00:15:27,137 --> 00:15:29,538
but to go with her mom
knowing what she was really like.

246
00:15:31,437 --> 00:15:33,477
If I were Do Ra,

247
00:15:34,507 --> 00:15:37,008
I would want to kill myself.

248
00:15:41,218 --> 00:15:42,947
I guess we were being selfish...

249
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:46,418
caring only about Pil Seung.

250
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:50,858
Do Ra had to push Pil Seung
out of her life because of us.

251
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:52,528
It breaks my heart
to think about it.

252
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:55,067
So, Sun Young,

253
00:15:57,137 --> 00:16:00,368
let's make Pil Seung happy
though it's a little late.

254
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:03,878
We should do something to help them.

255
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:25,798
It's all right. Just sit still.

256
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,398
Hello.

257
00:16:31,068 --> 00:16:32,398
Congratulations.

258
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,807
I'm so happy
that you can walk again.

259
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:37,577
I'm happy for you too.

260
00:16:38,878 --> 00:16:43,307
I was really glad
when I heard the news about you.

261
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:46,118
Pil Seung was...

262
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:49,148
counting the minutes
until you could walk again.

263
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:53,388
I'm so happy
that you regained your health.

264
00:16:56,728 --> 00:16:58,128
Thank you.

265
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:08,268
Today,

266
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:11,838
we came here to see you
for a reason.

267
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:17,747
We did you a great wrong
the other day.

268
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:20,517
So we want to apologize.

269
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:23,088
Pardon?

270
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:27,217
We understand...

271
00:17:27,858 --> 00:17:30,428
you were deeply hurt because of us.

272
00:17:34,197 --> 00:17:36,568
When you were
already feeling desperate...

273
00:17:36,568 --> 00:17:38,737
thinking
you might not be able to walk,

274
00:17:40,737 --> 00:17:44,037
we made things worse
and hurt you so deeply.

275
00:17:46,578 --> 00:17:48,408
I'm so sorry, Do Ra.

276
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:51,618
It's our fault.

277
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:56,118
Mother.

278
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:07,058
Do Ra.

279
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:11,668
We're the ones in the wrong.

280
00:18:13,637 --> 00:18:15,037
So,

281
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:17,808
please don't do this to Pil Seung.

282
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:24,318
Please don't break...

283
00:18:24,848 --> 00:18:26,818
his heart anymore.

284
00:18:27,848 --> 00:18:30,957
Can't you just accept his heart?

285
00:18:34,427 --> 00:18:36,257
I really want you...

286
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:40,328
to be happy together.

287
00:18:48,838 --> 00:18:50,207
Mother.

288
00:18:52,637 --> 00:18:56,378
Do you really mean that?

289
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:07,328
Is it really okay
that I'm with Pil Seung?

290
00:19:10,227 --> 00:19:11,598
Of course.

291
00:19:12,727 --> 00:19:14,697
We're really sorry.

292
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:17,267
Please forgive us, Do Ra.

293
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:21,207
Mother.

294
00:19:26,878 --> 00:19:28,308
I'm sorry.

295
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:31,118
I really am.

296
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:39,187
Thank you, Mother.

297
00:19:43,387 --> 00:19:45,957
Thank you, Mother.

298
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:48,967
Do Ra.

299
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:52,398
I'm sorry.

300
00:19:53,737 --> 00:19:54,868
I'm sorry.

301
00:19:54,868 --> 00:19:56,308
Mother.

302
00:19:56,637 --> 00:19:58,937
Thank you.

303
00:20:00,947 --> 00:20:03,947
Thank you, Mother.

304
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:08,118
I'm so sorry, Do Ra.

305
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,658
We did something horrible.
Forgive us.

306
00:20:48,828 --> 00:20:50,997
How do I change her mind?

307
00:20:52,957 --> 00:20:55,068
How should I wear down
her stubbornness?

308
00:21:06,153 --> 00:21:10,169
(Pil Seung)

309
00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:23,727
Hi.

310
00:21:25,128 --> 00:21:26,457
Ms. Park.

311
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:31,497
I didn't want to cling to you
like some loser,

312
00:21:31,697 --> 00:21:34,308
so I was going to break up with you.

313
00:21:34,838 --> 00:21:37,638
But since we've been through
a lot together,

314
00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:40,477
I came by one last time
to give you a final chance.

315
00:21:41,977 --> 00:21:43,947
A final chance?

316
00:21:44,318 --> 00:21:45,678
What chance?

317
00:21:47,048 --> 00:21:49,947
I never told you or let it show,

318
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:52,987
but do you know
how many women want me?

319
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:55,187
Let's be honest.

320
00:21:55,187 --> 00:21:56,987
There are over 100 women
waiting to date me.

321
00:21:56,987 --> 00:21:58,834
They're all waiting outside.

322
00:21:58,858 --> 00:22:01,197
I actually have a blind date
scheduled for today.

323
00:22:02,028 --> 00:22:05,467
But if you say
you don't want me to go,

324
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,197
I won't.

325
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:11,178
Pil Seung.

326
00:22:11,338 --> 00:22:13,578
I said I wanted you
to meet someone else...

327
00:22:13,578 --> 00:22:14,977
and be happy.

328
00:22:15,707 --> 00:22:19,148
So go ahead and date
the 100 women lined up for you.

329
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:23,418
Do you mean that?

330
00:22:24,288 --> 00:22:26,217
Are you sure you won't regret it?

331
00:22:29,088 --> 00:22:32,497
I'm disappointed in you, you know.

332
00:22:32,828 --> 00:22:34,997
You talked about
caring only for me...

333
00:22:34,997 --> 00:22:37,737
and sticking to me like chewing gum,

334
00:22:37,737 --> 00:22:40,797
but you had 100 women hidden away?

335
00:22:43,838 --> 00:22:46,437
Why are you still here?
Go on your date.

336
00:22:48,778 --> 00:22:50,008
Do you mean that?

337
00:22:50,008 --> 00:22:51,318
Yes.

338
00:22:52,848 --> 00:22:54,217
Okay, then.

339
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:56,717
Don't regret this later on.

340
00:22:56,818 --> 00:22:59,388
Begging me to come back
won't work on me.

341
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:00,858
Fine.

342
00:23:01,788 --> 00:23:03,588
Go on the date.

343
00:23:04,098 --> 00:23:05,558
I will.

344
00:23:06,157 --> 00:23:07,457
Wait.

345
00:23:13,598 --> 00:23:14,908
Hey.

346
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:19,378
What...

347
00:23:20,878 --> 00:23:22,308
are you doing?

348
00:23:24,578 --> 00:23:26,848
I know you bluffed...

349
00:23:28,818 --> 00:23:30,517
to make me feel jealous.

350
00:23:33,118 --> 00:23:34,757
Then just say so.

351
00:23:35,687 --> 00:23:37,997
Why hug me if you want to break up?

352
00:23:38,828 --> 00:23:40,197
Pil Seung.

353
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:47,668
Both your mothers came to see me.

354
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:52,138
What?

355
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:56,078
What did they say?
Did you cry again?

356
00:23:57,048 --> 00:23:58,378
No.

357
00:24:02,217 --> 00:24:04,787
They said I could see you now.

358
00:24:07,628 --> 00:24:09,527
They gave their seal of approval.

359
00:24:10,457 --> 00:24:11,957
What?

360
00:24:13,758 --> 00:24:15,828
To tell you the truth,

361
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:20,697
I was reluctant and scared
because they disapproved.

362
00:24:22,368 --> 00:24:24,408
I didn't want to hurt them.

363
00:24:25,437 --> 00:24:27,108
But your mothers said...

364
00:24:27,578 --> 00:24:30,608
they wanted us to be together.

365
00:24:31,677 --> 00:24:35,888
I was so grateful and happy
that all I could do was cry.

366
00:24:38,987 --> 00:24:42,888
They apologized
for coming to see me last time.

367
00:24:46,457 --> 00:24:48,797
And they said we had their blessing.

368
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:58,338
Now I feel brave enough
to get back with you.

369
00:25:02,508 --> 00:25:03,947
Do Ra.

370
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:08,648
Pil Seung.

371
00:25:14,088 --> 00:25:17,858
I'll live and work hard
so I won't be a burden on you.

372
00:25:24,098 --> 00:25:26,497
I'm so sorry for hurting you...

373
00:25:29,108 --> 00:25:31,507
with my scathing words.

374
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:35,808
I did nothing but hurt you.

375
00:25:37,048 --> 00:25:40,017
Thank you for not giving up on me.

376
00:25:43,487 --> 00:25:45,487
I won't do it again.

377
00:25:48,328 --> 00:25:50,388
It won't happen again.

378
00:25:56,727 --> 00:25:58,297
I'm sorry.

379
00:25:59,397 --> 00:26:01,068
And I love you.

380
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:07,678
Do Ra.

381
00:26:31,943 --> 00:26:34,683
- This would make a lovely drink.
- Don't you dare.

382
00:26:34,707 --> 00:26:35,707
Grapes?

383
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:37,146
Would that be a wine, then?

384
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:39,747
Mom. Dad.

385
00:26:39,747 --> 00:26:42,717
What is it? What's going on?

386
00:26:46,787 --> 00:26:48,087
Hey.

387
00:26:48,787 --> 00:26:50,356
- What's that about?
- What's that about?

388
00:26:55,267 --> 00:26:56,267
My gosh.

389
00:26:56,267 --> 00:26:57,896
Mom, thank you...

390
00:26:59,096 --> 00:27:02,013
for talking to Do Ra
and bringing her around.

391
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,537
Thanks so much.

392
00:27:06,007 --> 00:27:09,777
You silly thing. Darn you.

393
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:11,876
Do you like her that much?

394
00:27:11,876 --> 00:27:14,416
Are you that happy?

395
00:27:14,447 --> 00:27:17,787
Yes, Mom. I love Do Ra to bits.

396
00:27:21,856 --> 00:27:23,196
Mom.

397
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:27,166
I'll live happily with Do Ra.

398
00:27:27,697 --> 00:27:31,436
I'll remember
and be thankful for what you did.

399
00:27:32,697 --> 00:27:34,166
Pil Seung.

400
00:27:34,537 --> 00:27:36,336
If you're that grateful,

401
00:27:36,336 --> 00:27:39,106
get married and have a baby
as soon as possible.

402
00:27:39,376 --> 00:27:40,646
Yes, Grandma.

403
00:27:40,646 --> 00:27:42,747
I'll give it my best shot.

404
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:44,176
- What?
- Victory!

405
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:47,447
- Don't be silly.
- That's gross.

406
00:27:47,447 --> 00:27:48,916
Good for you.

407
00:27:49,856 --> 00:27:53,787
- My goodness.
- Well done.

408
00:27:53,787 --> 00:27:55,087
My gosh.

409
00:27:56,727 --> 00:27:58,757
- Hey.
- What is it, Pil Seung?

410
00:27:58,757 --> 00:28:00,467
What are the flowers for?

411
00:28:03,636 --> 00:28:05,237
Thank you.

412
00:28:07,406 --> 00:28:08,706
Mother.

413
00:28:16,977 --> 00:28:18,277
"Mother?"

414
00:28:23,156 --> 00:28:24,817
Pil Seung.

415
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:27,686
Did you call me "Mother?"

416
00:28:28,927 --> 00:28:32,727
I heard you persuaded my mom.

417
00:28:33,197 --> 00:28:36,596
You took her to see
and console Do Ra,

418
00:28:37,396 --> 00:28:41,237
and cheered her up
with heartfelt words, so thank you.

419
00:28:42,336 --> 00:28:43,807
From now on,

420
00:28:44,977 --> 00:28:46,906
I'll be a good son to you.

421
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:53,886
Father, I want to thank you as well.

422
00:28:56,917 --> 00:29:00,287
Hold on.
Did you just call me your father?

423
00:29:01,187 --> 00:29:02,626
Thank you.

424
00:29:03,296 --> 00:29:04,727
Thank you.

425
00:29:05,896 --> 00:29:07,297
Thank you.

426
00:29:14,306 --> 00:29:15,636
Honey.

427
00:29:23,517 --> 00:29:24,846
Thank you.

428
00:30:11,697 --> 00:30:13,027
Careful.

429
00:30:20,406 --> 00:30:21,767
Ji Young.

430
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,807
Why are you crying?

431
00:30:40,487 --> 00:30:42,027
Ji Young,

432
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:45,497
you've been through a lot.

433
00:30:46,826 --> 00:30:49,727
I had no idea you were hurt...

434
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:53,767
and thought
you were working a job in the US.

435
00:30:54,537 --> 00:30:56,267
They only told me yesterday.

436
00:30:57,507 --> 00:31:01,206
I'm sorry
for not realizing it sooner.

437
00:31:05,017 --> 00:31:07,322
Why would you apologize...

438
00:31:07,346 --> 00:31:09,317
when I'm the one who's sorry?

439
00:31:10,757 --> 00:31:13,733
I knew you'd be heartbroken,

440
00:31:13,757 --> 00:31:16,856
which is why I chose to lie to you.

441
00:31:17,826 --> 00:31:19,197
I'm sorry, Grandma.

442
00:31:19,197 --> 00:31:22,503
No, it's all right.

443
00:31:22,527 --> 00:31:28,037
I'm just glad you came back to me.

444
00:31:29,437 --> 00:31:30,737
Ji Young.

445
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:35,453
Are you sure
you're able to walk again?

446
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,522
Yes, I'm perfectly fine.

447
00:31:38,546 --> 00:31:39,916
Goodness.

448
00:31:43,886 --> 00:31:47,656
Why is it
that you look terrible, Grandma?

449
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,826
Isn't it obvious?

450
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:52,126
It's because I couldn't see you.

451
00:31:52,427 --> 00:31:55,027
Even if I was going to die
I couldn't do it...

452
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:58,997
without seeing you again,
so I've been waiting.

453
00:31:59,866 --> 00:32:03,166
Grandma, why would you say
something like that?

454
00:32:04,037 --> 00:32:07,077
You need to stay in my life
for as long as possible.

455
00:32:07,576 --> 00:32:08,707
Got it?

456
00:32:08,707 --> 00:32:12,517
Of course. Absolutely.

457
00:32:12,777 --> 00:32:15,916
My goodness, my puppy.

458
00:32:16,287 --> 00:32:20,557
My sweet puppy.

459
00:32:22,656 --> 00:32:24,027
My goodness.

460
00:32:27,326 --> 00:32:28,696
Hello?

461
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:31,737
Yes, this is Park Do Jun.

462
00:32:33,937 --> 00:32:35,307
What?

463
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:37,807
I won the Grand Award?

464
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:43,646
Seriously?

465
00:32:43,646 --> 00:32:44,777
You won the Grand Award...

466
00:32:44,777 --> 00:32:46,217
at the Architecture Competition
of Korea?

467
00:32:46,487 --> 00:32:49,092
Congratulations, Do Jun.
You're the coolest.

468
00:32:49,116 --> 00:32:50,487
Thanks.

469
00:32:53,586 --> 00:32:54,956
But...

470
00:32:55,457 --> 00:32:57,827
I need to go back to the US.

471
00:32:58,427 --> 00:33:01,467
The university I studied at
contacted me after seeing my piece.

472
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:03,267
I was offered a full scholarship...

473
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:04,967
should I choose
to study there again.

474
00:33:05,697 --> 00:33:08,136
Really? That's great news.

475
00:33:12,336 --> 00:33:13,747
Hold on.

476
00:33:14,846 --> 00:33:18,077
Does that mean we have to be apart?

477
00:33:19,816 --> 00:33:21,186
Yes.

478
00:33:22,116 --> 00:33:23,487
Ma Ri.

479
00:33:23,816 --> 00:33:26,587
Can you wait for me
until I complete my studies?

480
00:33:29,826 --> 00:33:31,956
I'll go with you.

481
00:33:32,257 --> 00:33:35,866
What? Can you live away
from your parents?

482
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:39,537
Yes. All I need is you.

483
00:33:46,576 --> 00:33:49,806
Do Jun, congratulations
on winning an award...

484
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:51,017
at the Architecture Competition
of Korea.

485
00:33:51,017 --> 00:33:53,017
That's a huge achievement.

486
00:33:53,187 --> 00:33:55,146
You must've some great ideas.

487
00:33:55,717 --> 00:33:58,217
- Congratulations, Do Jun.
- Thank you.

488
00:33:58,757 --> 00:34:02,727
This sweet and talented man
is my boyfriend.

489
00:34:02,727 --> 00:34:04,072
Make note of that.

490
00:34:04,096 --> 00:34:07,297
Oh, please. I can't believe you.

491
00:34:07,626 --> 00:34:11,497
I heard you had to go back to the US
to finish your studies.

492
00:34:12,037 --> 00:34:15,382
However, it won't be wise
for Ma Ri to join you.

493
00:34:15,406 --> 00:34:19,507
We'll be too worried
for her safety there,

494
00:34:19,877 --> 00:34:22,123
and caring for her
while you're there...

495
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:24,976
will only distract you
from your studies.

496
00:34:25,776 --> 00:34:29,592
Dad, just like I do fine
living with you two,

497
00:34:29,616 --> 00:34:31,793
I can do that with Do Jun as well.

498
00:34:31,817 --> 00:34:33,962
Besides, I will never distract him.

499
00:34:33,986 --> 00:34:35,833
I'm going to study art
while I'm there.

500
00:34:35,857 --> 00:34:38,326
We have this all planned out.

501
00:34:38,926 --> 00:34:42,567
Ma Ri, going with Do Jun
while he's studying abroad...

502
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:44,766
will be a burden to him.

503
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:46,567
We won't be there,

504
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:48,636
so it'll only be you and him.

505
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:50,737
This isn't something
to be childish about.

506
00:34:51,437 --> 00:34:54,407
You can't go with him
to study abroad.

507
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,376
I'm fine with it...

508
00:34:57,116 --> 00:34:59,076
and would like Ma Ri to join me.

509
00:34:59,946 --> 00:35:03,857
I'm well aware of your concerns,

510
00:35:03,857 --> 00:35:07,487
but I know we'll be able to manage.

511
00:35:08,787 --> 00:35:11,556
She's been part-timing
at our kalguksu place...

512
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:13,427
but hasn't made one mistake.

513
00:35:13,997 --> 00:35:16,172
There will be obstacles for us.

514
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:20,936
However, that is a challenge
we need to face and solve anyway.

515
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:24,806
Besides, overcoming
such obstacles...

516
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:26,876
will help her grow stronger.

517
00:35:37,857 --> 00:35:39,257
Honey.

518
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:41,626
I think Do Jun's right.

519
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,596
We've been treating Ma Ri...

520
00:35:43,596 --> 00:35:46,626
like a flower that can't live
outside a greenhouse.

521
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:52,196
She has to leave us at some point...

522
00:35:52,196 --> 00:35:54,737
and find a place for herself
in the world.

523
00:35:55,437 --> 00:35:59,076
And although Do Jun is young,

524
00:35:59,176 --> 00:36:02,606
he is manly and mature.

525
00:36:05,147 --> 00:36:07,993
Do Jun is a decent young man.

526
00:36:08,017 --> 00:36:10,916
He's thoughtful for his age as well.

527
00:36:13,156 --> 00:36:15,956
Honey, let's have Ma Ri...

528
00:36:16,627 --> 00:36:18,697
go with Do Jun.

529
00:36:18,797 --> 00:36:22,326
If he's going to be the one
for our daughter,

530
00:36:22,627 --> 00:36:25,896
it's best for them
to face obstacles together.

531
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:32,476
Then, what should we do
about Ma Ri and Do Jun?

532
00:36:33,236 --> 00:36:35,446
If they're going
to study abroad together,

533
00:36:35,446 --> 00:36:37,416
wouldn't it be nice...

534
00:36:37,576 --> 00:36:40,516
to at least have them engaged?

535
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:44,257
Engaged?

536
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:51,404
(Dementia Relief Center)

537
00:36:51,926 --> 00:36:54,166
I'm broke now...

538
00:36:54,526 --> 00:36:57,536
and my children
are blocking my calls.

539
00:36:58,267 --> 00:37:00,583
That old lady is
all that I have left.

540
00:37:00,607 --> 00:37:02,313
She thinks I'm her daughter,

541
00:37:02,337 --> 00:37:05,237
so I doubt
the kids will send me packing again.

542
00:37:05,636 --> 00:37:08,277
All I have to do
is stay by her side.

543
00:37:09,006 --> 00:37:10,947
Twirl.

544
00:37:11,176 --> 00:37:12,847
Mom!

545
00:37:13,116 --> 00:37:16,117
Goodness. Aren't you Dong Dong?

546
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:19,156
- Have a good day.
- Have a good day, ma'am.

547
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:20,657
Thank you for today.

548
00:37:20,687 --> 00:37:23,933
Goodness.
Where on earth have you been?

549
00:37:23,957 --> 00:37:27,367
That's right! Do you remember
your nephew Do Jun?

550
00:37:27,466 --> 00:37:30,797
He'll soon get engaged
and move to the US.

551
00:37:31,797 --> 00:37:35,306
Mom. Do Jun is getting engaged?
To whom?

552
00:37:35,366 --> 00:37:39,183
Who? Yes, her. Ma Ri.

553
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:42,447
They'll soon get engaged.

554
00:37:42,576 --> 00:37:44,393
Is that true?

555
00:37:44,417 --> 00:37:47,462
That's what I said.
Have you only been lied to?

556
00:37:47,486 --> 00:37:49,647
Anyway, I'm glad you're here.

557
00:37:49,647 --> 00:37:52,287
The aunt should be present...

558
00:37:52,287 --> 00:37:54,786
at her nephew's engagement party.

559
00:37:55,986 --> 00:37:58,427
Grandma!

560
00:38:00,227 --> 00:38:03,097
Grandma, don't talk to this woman.
Let's go.

561
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:05,043
Do Jun, wait!

562
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:08,837
Is it true that you and Ma Ri
are getting engaged?

563
00:38:08,837 --> 00:38:10,706
Did her family accept you?

564
00:38:10,837 --> 00:38:13,206
Why do you care
whether I get engaged or not?

565
00:38:14,147 --> 00:38:17,276
Grandma, don't ever talk
to that woman again.

566
00:38:17,276 --> 00:38:19,092
- Let's go.
- Sure.

567
00:38:19,116 --> 00:38:21,946
I'm not fond of that cow anyway.
Let's go, Do Jun.

568
00:38:21,946 --> 00:38:23,493
Mom, wait!

569
00:38:23,517 --> 00:38:26,317
I'm your daughter Dong Dong
and should come with you.

570
00:38:26,317 --> 00:38:29,326
Who are you referring to
as your mom, you crazy cow?

571
00:38:29,326 --> 00:38:31,873
Besides, how are you Dong Dong?

572
00:38:31,897 --> 00:38:35,797
Do Jun, don't get involved
with a crazy broad like her.

573
00:38:35,797 --> 00:38:36,897
Got it?

574
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:39,396
Come on. Let's go, Do Jun.

575
00:38:39,866 --> 00:38:41,212
Mom!

576
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,837
Mom, take me with you!

577
00:38:44,006 --> 00:38:46,107
That senile old lady! Seriously.

578
00:38:46,107 --> 00:38:48,547
Why is she being so fickle?

579
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,376
And Do Jun, that brat,
treats me like a stranger.

580
00:38:52,817 --> 00:38:54,216
Hang on.

581
00:38:54,216 --> 00:38:57,856
So Do Jun will get engaged to Ma Ri?

582
00:38:58,886 --> 00:39:01,556
What should I do then?

583
00:39:01,857 --> 00:39:05,027
Hang on. What should I do first?

584
00:39:11,897 --> 00:39:13,967
I'm sorry, but we're closed for...

585
00:39:15,506 --> 00:39:17,777
Do Sik, it's me.

586
00:39:18,676 --> 00:39:20,407
Get out so I can close up the shop.

587
00:39:20,446 --> 00:39:23,916
Is it true
that Do Jun is getting engaged?

588
00:39:24,346 --> 00:39:25,776
That means he will get married.

589
00:39:25,776 --> 00:39:29,016
He should talk to his mom
about things like that.

590
00:39:29,587 --> 00:39:31,387
When is the engagement ceremony?

591
00:39:35,156 --> 00:39:37,496
Why are you being like this to me?

592
00:39:37,696 --> 00:39:40,897
I think this is about how
I moved Do Ra to a rural hospital.

593
00:39:40,897 --> 00:39:42,497
But I just did it...

594
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:45,696
because she asked me
to take her far away.

595
00:39:45,696 --> 00:39:48,437
Also, Pil Seung's parents
even offered me money...

596
00:39:48,437 --> 00:39:51,107
and asked me to keep Do Ra away
from Pil Seung.

597
00:39:51,107 --> 00:39:52,506
I just did what I was told.

598
00:39:52,506 --> 00:39:54,876
Why are you taking it out on me?

599
00:39:55,207 --> 00:39:56,907
So that's your excuse?

600
00:39:57,477 --> 00:39:59,317
Just go. Get out.

601
00:39:59,317 --> 00:40:01,346
- Wait, Do Sik.
- Get out.

602
00:40:01,346 --> 00:40:02,446
Do Sik.

603
00:40:02,446 --> 00:40:03,556
- Wait.
- Go.

604
00:40:03,556 --> 00:40:05,087
Listen, Do Jun... Do Sik.

605
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:06,987
- Leave.
- Do Sik.

606
00:40:07,056 --> 00:40:10,157
Gosh, that brat. Wait, Do Sik.

607
00:40:10,397 --> 00:40:13,326
I just... Look at him.

608
00:40:15,926 --> 00:40:19,137
How could they treat their mom
like this?

609
00:40:19,736 --> 00:40:21,036
Hey, Do...

610
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:24,306
I can't believe this.

611
00:40:28,806 --> 00:40:30,177
Who is this?

612
00:40:30,446 --> 00:40:33,447
Hello, I'm Park Do Jun's mom.

613
00:40:33,687 --> 00:40:35,587
I'm here to discuss...

614
00:40:35,587 --> 00:40:39,117
our children's engagement
with Mr. Gong and Ms. Jang.

615
00:40:41,326 --> 00:40:42,326
Who is it?

616
00:40:42,326 --> 00:40:45,627
Well, she says
she is Park Do Jun's mom.

617
00:40:45,627 --> 00:40:47,726
She's here to discuss something
with you.

618
00:40:48,297 --> 00:40:50,527
- Park Do Jun's mom?
- Yes.

619
00:40:56,937 --> 00:40:59,437
What brings you here?

620
00:40:59,437 --> 00:41:01,047
Oh, yes.

621
00:41:01,207 --> 00:41:03,506
I wasn't going to say this,

622
00:41:03,506 --> 00:41:06,322
but I did raise Do Jun
with a lot of care.

623
00:41:06,346 --> 00:41:07,886
We weren't so well off,

624
00:41:07,886 --> 00:41:10,862
but I denied myself
all the comforts of life...

625
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:12,957
to give my Do Jun
everything he needed.

626
00:41:12,957 --> 00:41:14,587
I even let him study abroad...

627
00:41:15,326 --> 00:41:17,227
though he couldn't finish
his school...

628
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:20,056
because of our family circumstances.

629
00:41:20,526 --> 00:41:22,167
But I was told...

630
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:24,937
that your daughter had some issue...

631
00:41:24,937 --> 00:41:28,907
because she was wounded
in a car accident.

632
00:41:29,136 --> 00:41:30,906
So I can't understand...

633
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:33,907
you're pushing ahead
with it like this.

634
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:43,317
Even though
you really like my son...

635
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:46,417
and we are not financially well-off,

636
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:48,887
you can't still be doing this.

637
00:41:49,156 --> 00:41:51,497
My son is so into your daughter,

638
00:41:51,497 --> 00:41:54,027
so I approved of her
though I'm not happy about it.

639
00:41:54,627 --> 00:41:58,043
But this isn't just fair.

640
00:41:58,067 --> 00:42:00,906
My son will have to spend
his whole life...

641
00:42:00,906 --> 00:42:05,306
taking care of your daughter
who is a little dumb.

642
00:42:11,977 --> 00:42:16,187
Well, you know
what I'm saying is true.

643
00:42:16,187 --> 00:42:17,957
So, I mean,

644
00:42:17,957 --> 00:42:21,027
there should be
a reasonable compensation.

645
00:42:21,687 --> 00:42:24,226
Just ask anyone on the street.

646
00:42:24,256 --> 00:42:28,067
What kind of mother would want
to marry her son to your daughter?

647
00:42:28,267 --> 00:42:30,897
And this isn't just about my son.

648
00:42:30,897 --> 00:42:34,506
It will have a huge effect...

649
00:42:34,506 --> 00:42:36,507
on my whole family.

650
00:42:36,636 --> 00:42:39,007
You're going too far
with what you say.

651
00:42:40,236 --> 00:42:43,246
What compensation? Are you...

652
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:46,347
asking for money?

653
00:42:48,517 --> 00:42:50,317
Of course, it's money.

654
00:42:51,256 --> 00:42:52,916
How else would you compensate us
for it?

655
00:43:13,201 --> 00:43:14,501
Welcome...

656
00:43:14,902 --> 00:43:17,772
Oh, hello. What brings you here?

657
00:43:17,902 --> 00:43:21,441
I thought you would be less busy
around this time.

658
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:23,412
I have something to tell you.

659
00:43:24,641 --> 00:43:26,841
Yes, I'm not busy now.
Please have a seat.

660
00:43:27,442 --> 00:43:28,742
Okay.

661
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:34,082
Your mother came to see me at home.

662
00:43:34,882 --> 00:43:36,352
My mom?

663
00:43:37,121 --> 00:43:38,692
Did you tell her...

664
00:43:38,692 --> 00:43:41,722
about Do Jun and Ma Ri's engagement?

665
00:43:42,061 --> 00:43:44,632
I don't know how she found out.

666
00:43:44,632 --> 00:43:46,102
I didn't tell her.

667
00:43:47,701 --> 00:43:49,701
Your mother said...

668
00:43:49,701 --> 00:43:53,602
Do Jun was too good for Ma Ri
and asked for compensation.

669
00:43:54,302 --> 00:43:56,272
And I refused the request.

670
00:43:57,972 --> 00:44:01,211
But I'm not sure
if I did the right thing or not.

671
00:44:01,581 --> 00:44:03,312
It still bothers me,

672
00:44:03,712 --> 00:44:05,352
so I'm here to talk about it
with you.

673
00:44:05,581 --> 00:44:07,722
You did the right thing, sir.

674
00:44:08,152 --> 00:44:09,722
If you had offered her money,

675
00:44:09,722 --> 00:44:11,892
she would've gambled it away again.

676
00:44:12,391 --> 00:44:14,722
My siblings and I already cut ties
with our mom.

677
00:44:14,722 --> 00:44:16,361
You don't have to worry about her.

678
00:44:17,092 --> 00:44:19,331
If my mom shows up again,

679
00:44:19,331 --> 00:44:21,731
please send her back harshly.

680
00:44:22,672 --> 00:44:24,832
I'm really sorry, Mr. Gong.

681
00:44:26,972 --> 00:44:29,301
Now that you say that,

682
00:44:29,871 --> 00:44:31,611
I feel a lot better.

683
00:44:32,072 --> 00:44:33,441
Thank you.

684
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:37,151
And while we're at it,

685
00:44:37,712 --> 00:44:39,952
there's one more thing
we need to discuss.

686
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,151
Yes. Please go ahead.

687
00:44:42,791 --> 00:44:46,162
Do Jun and Ma Ri will go abroad
to study together...

688
00:44:46,692 --> 00:44:49,531
after the engagement ceremony.
Are you aware of that too?

689
00:44:49,661 --> 00:44:50,992
Yes.

690
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:54,862
I'm afraid Ma Ri might be...

691
00:44:54,862 --> 00:44:58,202
distracting Do Jun from his studies.

692
00:44:59,001 --> 00:45:01,102
So I want to hear what you think.

693
00:45:02,001 --> 00:45:04,242
As Do Jun's older brother,

694
00:45:04,242 --> 00:45:07,082
if you are worried
about Ma Ri getting in his way,

695
00:45:07,911 --> 00:45:10,012
I'll try to convince her again.

696
00:45:10,012 --> 00:45:11,312
No, sir.

697
00:45:13,451 --> 00:45:15,582
Maybe I'm being presumptuous,

698
00:45:16,322 --> 00:45:18,552
but I think getting engaged means...

699
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:21,062
that they are considering marriage.

700
00:45:23,391 --> 00:45:25,591
In order for them to be together
for the rest of their lives,

701
00:45:26,402 --> 00:45:29,301
I believe they will have to build
their future together.

702
00:45:29,972 --> 00:45:31,671
Since they are adults,

703
00:45:32,001 --> 00:45:35,372
they will need
to fight their own battles.

704
00:45:37,112 --> 00:45:40,341
That's right. I agree with you.

705
00:45:42,712 --> 00:45:46,322
They say
your kalguksu is really good.

706
00:45:46,322 --> 00:45:47,657
Can I have one?

707
00:45:47,681 --> 00:45:49,852
Sure. Please wait a moment.

708
00:46:13,782 --> 00:46:15,641
Do Sik.

709
00:46:15,641 --> 00:46:17,412
You said you wanted
to see me for a moment.

710
00:46:17,652 --> 00:46:18,911
Why are we here?

711
00:46:18,911 --> 00:46:20,457
It's scary.

712
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:23,591
Why did we come here
in the dead of night?

713
00:46:27,722 --> 00:46:29,662
You will die with me here tonight.

714
00:46:29,931 --> 00:46:33,701
Do Sik.

715
00:46:33,701 --> 00:46:36,177
Are you being like this...

716
00:46:36,201 --> 00:46:39,001
because I took Do Ra
to a rural hospital?

717
00:46:39,001 --> 00:46:41,501
I said I was sorry.

718
00:46:41,501 --> 00:46:44,012
I told you
I would never do it again.

719
00:46:44,242 --> 00:46:46,071
You went to meet Chairman Gong.

720
00:46:46,981 --> 00:46:49,281
You demanded money
for Do Jun's engagement?

721
00:46:50,081 --> 00:46:52,551
You wanted to use Do Jun
to get some money for gambling?

722
00:46:52,822 --> 00:46:56,452
No, I didn't get any money.
I'm serious.

723
00:46:56,891 --> 00:46:58,251
Chairman Gong refused
to give me money,

724
00:46:58,251 --> 00:47:00,222
so I didn't get anything.

725
00:47:00,222 --> 00:47:03,332
I'm serious, Do Sik. Trust me.

726
00:47:08,231 --> 00:47:10,407
You abandoned Do Ra
at a remote hospital...

727
00:47:10,431 --> 00:47:11,771
when she couldn't even walk.

728
00:47:11,771 --> 00:47:13,472
How could you do such a thing?

729
00:47:14,871 --> 00:47:16,541
But you apologized,

730
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:19,781
and you were still our mom,
so I believed you.

731
00:47:20,112 --> 00:47:21,542
And what did you do?

732
00:47:22,612 --> 00:47:24,912
You asked them for money...

733
00:47:25,181 --> 00:47:27,122
using your dearest son, Do Jun?

734
00:47:31,751 --> 00:47:33,392
Do you call yourself a mom?

735
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:38,468
Let's go. Let's end things here.

736
00:47:38,492 --> 00:47:40,901
Only then Do Jun and Do Ra
will live. Let's go.

737
00:47:41,061 --> 00:47:44,847
No, Do Sik. Please, Do Sik!

738
00:47:44,871 --> 00:47:46,242
Do Sik!

739
00:47:49,942 --> 00:47:52,812
Okay, I get it.

740
00:47:54,712 --> 00:47:57,682
I don't know why I'm like this.

741
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:00,921
I don't think I'm human.

742
00:48:02,652 --> 00:48:05,222
I'm worse than a wild animal...

743
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:08,722
and I want to die...

744
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:14,401
I'll just die on my own.

745
00:48:14,532 --> 00:48:16,571
I'll die alone, Do Sik.

746
00:48:16,831 --> 00:48:18,902
You shouldn't have to die.

747
00:48:18,902 --> 00:48:23,242
Why should you die
because of a mom like me?

748
00:48:24,712 --> 00:48:27,711
Do Sik. I...

749
00:48:29,351 --> 00:48:31,751
I promise.

750
00:48:31,782 --> 00:48:36,251
I won't appear
before any of you again.

751
00:48:37,422 --> 00:48:39,091
I swear.

752
00:48:40,621 --> 00:48:43,292
I'm sorry, Do Sik.

753
00:48:44,331 --> 00:48:46,331
Pretend you don't have a mom.

754
00:48:46,331 --> 00:48:50,701
Your mom's dead.
She's dead and gone, Do Sik.

755
00:48:50,701 --> 00:48:53,671
You don't have a mom. She's dead.

756
00:48:53,701 --> 00:48:55,847
Your mom's dead.

757
00:48:55,871 --> 00:48:58,912
I'm long dead, Do Sik.

758
00:48:59,442 --> 00:49:02,182
I'm dead!

759
00:49:02,212 --> 00:49:04,051
I'm dead!

760
00:49:04,951 --> 00:49:08,798
I'm dead!

761
00:49:08,822 --> 00:49:11,292
I'm dead!

762
00:49:26,742 --> 00:49:29,247
- It's such a great day.
- It is.

763
00:49:29,271 --> 00:49:31,972
You look stunning today.

764
00:49:32,472 --> 00:49:37,287
Why does Ma Ri have
such a large family?

765
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:40,152
Us three is all you get.

766
00:49:40,152 --> 00:49:41,628
Yes.

767
00:49:41,652 --> 00:49:45,022
Ma Ri was blessed
with a lot of relatives.

768
00:49:45,422 --> 00:49:48,692
I'm Dad number one.

769
00:49:48,692 --> 00:49:50,508
I'm Dad number two.

770
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:53,438
- Dad One and Dad Two?
- Yes.

771
00:49:53,462 --> 00:49:56,972
- My gosh.
- She basically has two dads...

772
00:49:56,972 --> 00:49:59,771
and two moms over here.

773
00:49:59,771 --> 00:50:02,448
- That's how it is.
- My goodness.

774
00:50:02,472 --> 00:50:04,641
- Hey, Ma Ri's coming.
- Where?

775
00:50:04,641 --> 00:50:06,117
- Goodness.
- Oh, gosh.

776
00:50:06,141 --> 00:50:08,881
- You look amazing, Ma Ri.
- Oh, my gosh.

777
00:50:10,911 --> 00:50:12,112
Ma Ri, you look great.

778
00:50:12,112 --> 00:50:13,551
Let me see.

779
00:50:13,722 --> 00:50:15,222
Looking good.

780
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:19,321
You look perfect together.

781
00:50:19,462 --> 00:50:20,561
My gosh.

782
00:50:20,561 --> 00:50:22,421
My dear friend Ma Ri.

783
00:50:23,692 --> 00:50:26,601
Hang on. Director Ko.

784
00:50:26,601 --> 00:50:29,001
Why are you standing over here?

785
00:50:29,001 --> 00:50:32,008
You should be on our side.

786
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:35,501
Grandma. I must stand here today
because I'm Ma Ri's big brother.

787
00:50:35,641 --> 00:50:37,672
You're Ma Ri's big brother?

788
00:50:37,672 --> 00:50:40,941
- Yes.
- Oh, dear. I didn't know that.

789
00:50:41,342 --> 00:50:43,251
Is that why?

790
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:47,227
I like Director Ko a lot,
and I like Ma Ri just as much.

791
00:50:47,251 --> 00:50:50,891
Ma Ri. Even after you move
to the US with Do Jun,

792
00:50:50,891 --> 00:50:53,722
promise to live happily
and have fun.

793
00:50:53,722 --> 00:50:55,692
Yes, Grandma. Don't worry.

794
00:50:55,692 --> 00:50:57,462
So that Do Jun doesn't stray,

795
00:50:57,462 --> 00:50:59,662
I'll take good care of him.

796
00:50:59,831 --> 00:51:01,832
Yes, do that.

797
00:51:05,431 --> 00:51:08,742
Our handsome son
and pretty daughter...

798
00:51:08,972 --> 00:51:11,887
formed another family
and will leave the nest...

799
00:51:11,911 --> 00:51:14,582
to study far away in the US.

800
00:51:14,842 --> 00:51:17,528
Let's toast to their health
and safety...

801
00:51:17,552 --> 00:51:18,988
as they both study abroad.

802
00:51:19,012 --> 00:51:20,381
Sure.

803
00:51:21,222 --> 00:51:24,528
To Do Jun and Ma Ri's new challenge.

804
00:51:24,552 --> 00:51:26,622
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

805
00:51:30,592 --> 00:51:31,961
Congratulations.

806
00:51:35,302 --> 00:51:36,631
Cheers.

807
00:51:47,811 --> 00:51:50,912
- Welcome to...
- You're looking for a part-timer?

808
00:51:51,981 --> 00:51:53,452
Right...

809
00:51:54,251 --> 00:51:55,881
Is the boss not in?

810
00:51:56,891 --> 00:51:59,421
The boss... I'm the boss.

811
00:52:00,192 --> 00:52:03,432
Sorry. You're too young
and handsome, so I thought...

812
00:52:05,092 --> 00:52:07,562
You don't have to apologize
for that.

813
00:52:08,231 --> 00:52:09,602
Well.

814
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:16,708
("Wisdom Tooth")

815
00:52:17,712 --> 00:52:19,071
I like it.

816
00:52:19,411 --> 00:52:20,941
Good job.

817
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:23,251
That's the fourth episode done.

818
00:52:23,251 --> 00:52:24,981
Let's move onto episode five.

819
00:52:26,152 --> 00:52:29,427
Yes, Director.
I'll send it to you next week.

820
00:52:29,451 --> 00:52:30,727
Okay.

821
00:52:30,751 --> 00:52:32,852
Don't push yourself too hard.

822
00:52:33,561 --> 00:52:34,838
I won't.

823
00:52:34,862 --> 00:52:37,461
I'll see you at our next meeting.

824
00:52:41,731 --> 00:52:43,062
And...

825
00:52:43,731 --> 00:52:45,671
I might as well tell you something.

826
00:52:46,442 --> 00:52:48,272
I don't have a boyfriend anymore.

827
00:52:51,141 --> 00:52:52,441
You what?

828
00:52:52,771 --> 00:52:54,781
We broke up.

829
00:52:55,282 --> 00:52:56,651
Just so you know.

830
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:09,222
We'd feel much better...

831
00:53:09,222 --> 00:53:11,168
if we could see you off
at the airport.

832
00:53:11,192 --> 00:53:15,378
Mom. Do Jun and I have to
fend for ourselves from now on.

833
00:53:15,402 --> 00:53:18,372
We want to do everything on our own
starting at the airport.

834
00:53:18,431 --> 00:53:21,102
Please understand, Mom, Dad.

835
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:24,642
Do Jun.

836
00:53:26,342 --> 00:53:28,111
Take good care of Ma Ri for me.

837
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:31,711
Don't worry, Father.
I'm sure we'll do fine.

838
00:53:35,882 --> 00:53:39,367
My gosh, Dad. Why are you crying?

839
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:41,192
I'm not leaving on my own.

840
00:53:41,192 --> 00:53:43,191
I'm going with Do Jun.

841
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:45,807
So don't worry, okay?

842
00:53:45,831 --> 00:53:48,108
Don't worry. Don't worry, Mommy.

843
00:53:48,132 --> 00:53:50,501
See? I speak
pretty good English now.

844
00:53:50,501 --> 00:53:52,177
Don't worry about me...

845
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:54,341
and live happily as a couple.

846
00:53:54,942 --> 00:53:58,372
If you miss me,
you can visit at any time.

847
00:53:59,911 --> 00:54:01,682
Yes. My dear baby girl.

848
00:54:02,541 --> 00:54:04,452
Let me hug you once more.

849
00:54:10,851 --> 00:54:12,292
Don't worry.

850
00:54:16,431 --> 00:54:17,792
Okay.

851
00:54:18,692 --> 00:54:20,231
- See you soon.
- Yes.

852
00:54:20,231 --> 00:54:21,932
Take care of her for me.

853
00:54:24,532 --> 00:54:26,941
- We'll go now.
- Goodbye.

854
00:54:32,012 --> 00:54:33,341
Ma Ri.

855
00:54:33,681 --> 00:54:35,042
Don't.

856
00:54:36,012 --> 00:54:38,411
She'll do fine, honey.

857
00:54:38,411 --> 00:54:40,082
She'll manage.

858
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,452
Okay?

859
00:54:45,092 --> 00:54:46,522
Bye.

860
00:54:53,061 --> 00:54:56,001
Don't use it too much.
Just a little is fine.

861
00:54:57,931 --> 00:55:02,841
Do Ra.
I said you didn't have to help out.

862
00:55:03,001 --> 00:55:06,418
No, Mother.
I want to learn your kimchi recipe.

863
00:55:06,442 --> 00:55:09,081
- My gosh.
- Teach me your side dishes too.

864
00:55:09,081 --> 00:55:10,782
- My gosh.
- Are you sure?

865
00:55:10,782 --> 00:55:15,281
Do Ra. How did you know
Sun Young was a great cook?

866
00:55:15,951 --> 00:55:19,097
- I'm a really picky eater.
- Are you?

867
00:55:19,121 --> 00:55:21,722
But I love everything Mother makes.

868
00:55:21,722 --> 00:55:24,161
It's nothing at all.

869
00:55:24,161 --> 00:55:26,801
- See how this tastes.
- Okay.

870
00:55:26,831 --> 00:55:29,871
- Me too, Sun Young.
- Is it good?

871
00:55:29,871 --> 00:55:31,501
- Yes, Mother.
- Mother.

872
00:55:31,501 --> 00:55:33,772
- Let me have a taste.
- Me too, Sun Young.

873
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:36,602
- Can I have some?
- It's perfectly seasoned.

874
00:55:36,641 --> 00:55:38,887
- Hurry up.
- Here you go.

875
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:40,358
It's delicious.

876
00:55:40,382 --> 00:55:42,382
- It's amazing.
- Is it?

877
00:55:42,382 --> 00:55:43,588
- It's good.
- Yes.

878
00:55:43,612 --> 00:55:46,528
- Hey, Do Ra.
- Yes?

879
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:48,657
It must be because you helped out.

880
00:55:48,681 --> 00:55:50,821
Today's kimchi tastes even better.

881
00:55:51,291 --> 00:55:52,792
Does it really?

882
00:55:53,862 --> 00:55:56,061
Do Ra, get one of those containers.

883
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,492
Okay.

884
00:55:58,561 --> 00:56:01,031
It looks so appetizing.

885
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:08,571
You walk just fine now.
You don't even limp anymore.

886
00:56:08,771 --> 00:56:11,242
Grandma. I can run now too.

887
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:15,142
You shouldn't run yet. Be careful.

888
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,452
Yes, Mother.

889
00:56:18,981 --> 00:56:20,321
Mom.

890
00:56:20,621 --> 00:56:22,722
Are you putting Do Ra
to work already?

891
00:56:23,021 --> 00:56:24,552
How dare you say that?

892
00:56:24,552 --> 00:56:26,422
What are you talking about?

893
00:56:26,422 --> 00:56:27,822
I'm trying to get her...

894
00:56:27,822 --> 00:56:31,008
to give me her kimchi recipe.

895
00:56:31,032 --> 00:56:33,338
I hate you so much.

896
00:56:33,362 --> 00:56:34,501
- That hopeless romantic.
- How is it?

897
00:56:34,501 --> 00:56:35,577
Do you want a taste?

898
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:38,402
He acts like a fool sometimes.

899
00:56:38,402 --> 00:56:40,271
- Right, Mother?
- Right.

900
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:43,711
He's not just a fool.
He's a serious fool.

901
00:56:44,512 --> 00:56:45,612
My goodness.

902
00:56:45,612 --> 00:56:47,612
- Hey, Do Ra.
- Yes?

903
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,112
Do you know...

904
00:56:49,112 --> 00:56:51,481
Chairman Gong is building a complex
of three houses...

905
00:56:51,481 --> 00:56:54,698
for you, us, and his family
in the same spot?

906
00:56:54,722 --> 00:56:56,891
So we can all live together?

907
00:56:56,891 --> 00:56:58,727
Yes, I heard.

908
00:56:58,751 --> 00:57:02,698
Be sure to get married
before the year ends.

909
00:57:02,722 --> 00:57:05,462
The previous ceremony was disrupted,
so have a real one this time.

910
00:57:05,462 --> 00:57:07,102
Yes, Grandma.

911
00:57:07,201 --> 00:57:09,462
Don't worry, Grandma.
That was the plan.

912
00:57:09,462 --> 00:57:10,871
Oh, was it?

913
00:57:10,871 --> 00:57:14,148
Shall we pick out
an auspicious day, then?

914
00:57:14,172 --> 00:57:16,141
I'll visit a good fortune-teller...

915
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,312
- and pick out a nice date.
- Okay.

916
00:57:18,342 --> 00:57:20,142
- Who is the fortune-teller?
- What?

917
00:57:20,282 --> 00:57:23,341
- We should go with her.
- Director Yoon. Go ahead.

918
00:57:24,911 --> 00:57:27,321
The Yellow Dragon Arts Awards?

919
00:57:30,922 --> 00:57:32,292
Okay, thanks.

920
00:57:35,791 --> 00:57:37,162
Do Ra.

921
00:57:38,992 --> 00:57:41,401
What, Pil Seung? What is it?

922
00:57:42,831 --> 00:57:44,772
The Yellow Dragon Arts Awards.

923
00:57:45,371 --> 00:57:48,742
For our work on "Seoul Lady,"
we were nominated...

924
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:50,571
as Best Director...

925
00:57:51,572 --> 00:57:53,542
and Best Actress respectively.

926
00:57:53,641 --> 00:57:54,882
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

927
00:57:54,882 --> 00:57:57,411
My goodness!

928
00:57:57,411 --> 00:57:59,451
- Really?
- For real?

929
00:57:59,451 --> 00:58:02,681
I was nominated for Best Actress?

930
00:58:02,681 --> 00:58:03,992
Yes.

931
00:58:05,222 --> 00:58:07,362
- Really?
- Congratulations!

932
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:08,762
My gosh, you two.

933
00:58:08,762 --> 00:58:10,831
- I'm happy for you two.
- What on earth?

934
00:58:10,831 --> 00:58:12,092
This is great news.

935
00:58:12,092 --> 00:58:14,332
I can't believe it.

936
00:58:20,207 --> 00:58:21,701
(Yellow Dragon Arts Awards)

937
00:58:21,701 --> 00:58:24,172
It's the moment
you've all been waiting for.

938
00:58:24,172 --> 00:58:26,012
We will announce Best Actress...

939
00:58:26,012 --> 00:58:28,142
for Yellow Dragon Arts Awards
this year.

940
00:58:40,121 --> 00:58:43,122
Park Do Ra in "Seoul Lady."
Congratulations.

941
00:58:49,431 --> 00:58:51,108
Congratulations.

942
00:58:51,132 --> 00:58:52,231
Park Do Ra!

943
00:58:52,231 --> 00:58:53,901
Congratulations.

944
00:59:02,681 --> 00:59:04,082
Congratulations.

945
00:59:37,451 --> 00:59:38,912
Hello.

946
00:59:47,791 --> 00:59:49,162
What is this?

947
00:59:50,362 --> 00:59:53,562
Pil Seung, it looks great, right?

948
01:00:06,641 --> 01:00:10,651
I don't have the hope to go on now.

949
01:00:19,391 --> 01:00:20,892
Hello.

950
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:23,962
I'm Kim Ji Young
who officially begins...

951
01:00:23,962 --> 01:00:25,631
her first day at work.

952
01:00:26,061 --> 01:00:27,378
Ji Young!

953
01:00:27,402 --> 01:00:28,832
Pil Seung.

954
01:00:30,331 --> 01:00:31,702
Do Ra.

955
01:00:34,402 --> 01:00:35,841
You walked.

956
01:00:38,172 --> 01:00:39,912
You walked.

957
01:00:42,012 --> 01:00:43,512
You're good now.

958
01:00:44,552 --> 01:00:46,151
You're good.

959
01:01:01,362 --> 01:01:03,401
Thank you.

960
01:01:19,911 --> 01:01:21,351
Congratulations.

961
01:01:21,351 --> 01:01:23,198
- Thank you.
- You're beautiful. Congratulations.

962
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:24,597
Thank you.

963
01:01:24,621 --> 01:01:27,462
(Best Actress)

964
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:30,353
(Best Actress:
Park Do Ra in "Seoul Lady")

965
01:01:36,701 --> 01:01:38,071
First,

966
01:01:38,931 --> 01:01:42,372
I'd like to thank the viewers...

967
01:01:42,442 --> 01:01:43,841
who enjoyed "Seoul Lady."

968
01:01:45,811 --> 01:01:48,381
The director, the writer,

969
01:01:48,742 --> 01:01:51,751
the staff that worked hard
on the show,

970
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:53,481
and my co-stars.

971
01:01:54,282 --> 01:01:58,352
I stand here today
on behalf of the entire team.

972
01:01:58,861 --> 01:02:02,061
(Best Actress:
Park Do Ra in "Seoul Lady")

973
01:02:02,061 --> 01:02:04,292
Standing here...

974
01:02:05,262 --> 01:02:09,177
brings back all the memories
as an actress...

975
01:02:09,201 --> 01:02:12,501
since the time
I began my career at 12.

976
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:18,571
When I was young,

977
01:02:19,112 --> 01:02:20,611
our family had no money.

978
01:02:21,342 --> 01:02:23,042
And my mother...

979
01:02:23,282 --> 01:02:26,251
brought me into this life
to put food on the table.

980
01:02:27,882 --> 01:02:30,051
Dance!

981
01:02:30,992 --> 01:02:33,551
Dance too.

982
01:02:37,331 --> 01:02:39,292
But then it struck me...

983
01:02:40,132 --> 01:02:41,431
that acting...

984
01:02:41,431 --> 01:02:43,401
was my purpose of living.

985
01:02:46,501 --> 01:02:48,142
I fell deeply...

986
01:02:48,842 --> 01:02:50,642
in love with acting.

987
01:02:53,342 --> 01:02:54,742
When...

988
01:02:55,942 --> 01:02:57,981
I had lost everything...

989
01:02:58,451 --> 01:03:00,722
and was at death's doorstep,

990
01:03:02,652 --> 01:03:04,191
when I had lost my memory...

991
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:06,492
and couldn't remember who I was,

992
01:03:08,422 --> 01:03:11,461
and when my recent accident
left me suffering,

993
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:14,862
there was someone
who raised me up...

994
01:03:14,862 --> 01:03:17,231
without letting go of my hand.

995
01:03:19,572 --> 01:03:22,602
He's the reason
I stand here before you today.

996
01:03:24,041 --> 01:03:25,542
My love.

997
01:03:27,141 --> 01:03:29,042
I dedicate...

998
01:03:31,351 --> 01:03:34,481
all this glory
to Director Ko Pil Seung.

999
01:03:41,362 --> 01:03:42,861
Thanks.

1000
01:03:45,262 --> 01:03:46,992
Thank you,

1001
01:03:47,862 --> 01:03:49,501
Director Ko Pil Seung.

1002
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:19,831
("Seoul Lady")

1003
01:04:24,132 --> 01:04:27,641
Do Ra, please play Bun Hong...

1004
01:04:27,641 --> 01:04:30,017
in the second season
of "Seoul Lady."

1005
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:32,312
I wrote it with you in mind.

1006
01:04:32,612 --> 01:04:33,941
Really?

1007
01:04:34,911 --> 01:04:37,042
Thank you, Ms. Kim.

1008
01:04:37,552 --> 01:04:40,621
But Ms. Kim,
we're soon getting married...

1009
01:04:40,621 --> 01:04:41,952
on an auspicious day.

1010
01:04:42,351 --> 01:04:43,751
What?

1011
01:04:44,121 --> 01:04:46,992
How can you get married
when this is a love story?

1012
01:04:54,802 --> 01:04:57,802
The house has been empty
after Do Jun and Ma Ri...

1013
01:04:57,802 --> 01:04:59,331
moved to the US.

1014
01:04:59,331 --> 01:05:01,701
It's been a while,

1015
01:05:01,701 --> 01:05:05,141
but it feels nice and cozy
to have both families here.

1016
01:05:05,141 --> 01:05:06,472
Of course.

1017
01:05:06,811 --> 01:05:10,242
The new houses will be built
by next year,

1018
01:05:10,552 --> 01:05:13,211
and we'll all be living together.

1019
01:05:13,552 --> 01:05:16,682
I want nothing more
than for that day to come.

1020
01:05:16,992 --> 01:05:18,852
You're right.

1021
01:05:19,021 --> 01:05:21,622
I'm looking forward to that house
as well.

1022
01:05:22,192 --> 01:05:23,731
That being said,

1023
01:05:23,731 --> 01:05:26,691
have you been planning
their wedding?

1024
01:05:26,762 --> 01:05:28,501
Yes, of course.

1025
01:05:28,501 --> 01:05:30,731
I actually took the liberty
of checking...

1026
01:05:30,731 --> 01:05:34,442
- how compatible they were.
- What?

1027
01:05:34,442 --> 01:05:38,372
It turns out
that they are extremely compatible.

1028
01:05:38,472 --> 01:05:40,742
They are meant to be.

1029
01:05:41,512 --> 01:05:42,981
Mom, please.

1030
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:45,488
Who does that these days?

1031
01:05:45,512 --> 01:05:48,858
No fortune-teller has to tell us
how compatible they are.

1032
01:05:48,882 --> 01:05:51,251
He's right, Mom. Who asks
about things like that these days?

1033
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:53,391
Besides, what could you have done
if they said otherwise?

1034
01:05:53,391 --> 01:05:55,091
The fortune-teller said
they were compatible.

1035
01:05:55,992 --> 01:05:57,632
And while I was at it,

1036
01:05:57,632 --> 01:06:01,077
- I got them a wedding date.
- Did you?

1037
01:06:01,101 --> 01:06:02,977
- Here.
- My goodness.

1038
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:04,101
My gosh.

1039
01:06:04,101 --> 01:06:06,132
Here it is. Look.

1040
01:06:06,132 --> 01:06:07,402
Mother, please.

1041
01:06:07,402 --> 01:06:09,841
- This is...
- Ta-da.

1042
01:06:10,942 --> 01:06:13,048
Next month on the 25th.

1043
01:06:13,072 --> 01:06:16,742
- What?
- That's a great day for them.

1044
01:06:17,012 --> 01:06:18,282
It's an auspicious day.

1045
01:06:18,282 --> 01:06:20,282
- Next month on the 25th?
- Next month?

1046
01:06:20,282 --> 01:06:23,421
How can they get married next month?

1047
01:06:24,951 --> 01:06:26,352
I'm afraid...

1048
01:06:26,891 --> 01:06:28,562
we can't get married.

1049
01:06:29,992 --> 01:06:31,332
Pil Seung.

1050
01:06:31,692 --> 01:06:34,702
What are you saying?
Why can't you get married?

1051
01:06:34,831 --> 01:06:36,907
Hold on. Did you two argue?

1052
01:06:36,931 --> 01:06:39,332
- No.
- It's not that.

1053
01:06:39,672 --> 01:06:41,901
Do Ra has a drama series to film,

1054
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:44,272
and she can't get married
since it's a love story.

1055
01:06:44,572 --> 01:06:47,512
Writer Kim Oh Kyeong will kill us
if we get married.

1056
01:06:47,512 --> 01:06:50,812
What? What's the matter with her?

1057
01:06:51,081 --> 01:06:52,882
The director agrees though.

1058
01:06:52,882 --> 01:06:56,352
Which director is that?
Which riffraff is it?

1059
01:06:56,951 --> 01:06:58,422
- It's me.
- Goodness me.

1060
01:06:58,422 --> 01:07:00,891
- What?
- Unbelievable.

1061
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:03,292
I agree with Ms. Kim though.

1062
01:07:03,462 --> 01:07:05,791
It's the second season
of "Seoul Lady,"

1063
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:08,931
and people won't be able to relate
if Do Ra gets married.

1064
01:07:08,931 --> 01:07:10,032
But...

1065
01:07:10,032 --> 01:07:12,601
I thought
if you got married this year,

1066
01:07:12,601 --> 01:07:14,041
we'll be able to hear...

1067
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:16,747
a baby crying
in the new house we move into.

1068
01:07:16,771 --> 01:07:20,312
Are you going to put off
having a baby as well?

1069
01:07:20,581 --> 01:07:22,911
Grandma, don't worry.

1070
01:07:22,911 --> 01:07:24,751
Once we're done filming,

1071
01:07:24,751 --> 01:07:27,381
we'll put a baby in your arms.

1072
01:07:27,451 --> 01:07:29,481
- What?
- My goodness.

1073
01:07:30,152 --> 01:07:32,451
What will you do
if you have to film...

1074
01:07:32,451 --> 01:07:33,922
another series after that?

1075
01:07:33,922 --> 01:07:35,192
Will you put off the wedding again?

1076
01:07:35,192 --> 01:07:38,462
That's to decide
when the time comes.

1077
01:07:38,462 --> 01:07:40,362
Unbelievable.

1078
01:07:40,362 --> 01:07:43,101
My goodness. Pil Seung, come on.

1079
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:46,278
Why do you never do as you're told?

1080
01:07:46,302 --> 01:07:47,902
When we said you couldn't marry,

1081
01:07:47,902 --> 01:07:50,177
you insisted on getting married.

1082
01:07:50,201 --> 01:07:52,012
Now that we said yes,
you're putting it off?

1083
01:07:52,972 --> 01:07:54,941
I'm sorry, Mother.

1084
01:07:55,242 --> 01:07:56,711
- My gosh.
- Sorry.

1085
01:07:56,782 --> 01:07:58,512
Sorry.

1086
01:07:59,081 --> 01:08:00,611
Oh, my goodness.

1087
01:08:21,501 --> 01:08:24,341
No. It's not a dream.

1088
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:28,081
Ko Dae Chung is mine at last.

1089
01:08:28,812 --> 01:08:31,852
The wall
that was between us has gone.

1090
01:08:32,951 --> 01:08:35,621
Even the heavens bless us today.

1091
01:08:35,722 --> 01:08:38,568
The sky is clear,
the clouds are fluffy,

1092
01:08:38,592 --> 01:08:40,692
and there's a lovely breeze.

1093
01:08:41,592 --> 01:08:43,961
Our love is everywhere.

1094
01:09:08,121 --> 01:09:10,251
Cut, okay! That's great!

1095
01:09:10,852 --> 01:09:12,722
- Good job.
- Well done.

1096
01:09:12,722 --> 01:09:14,038
Great job, everyone.

1097
01:09:14,062 --> 01:09:16,337
- Good work.
- Thank you.

1098
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:18,262
Well done, guys.

1099
01:09:18,262 --> 01:09:20,032
It's over.

1100
01:09:31,412 --> 01:09:34,342
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1101
01:10:05,061 --> 01:10:07,012
(2 years later)

1102
01:10:07,012 --> 01:10:09,081
That lady.

1103
01:10:09,382 --> 01:10:12,051
She's been here for about two years.

1104
01:10:12,151 --> 01:10:14,282
I don't think she ever left.

1105
01:10:14,682 --> 01:10:16,722
And no one visits.

1106
01:10:17,722 --> 01:10:20,267
I asked her about that
and she told me...

1107
01:10:20,291 --> 01:10:22,022
she was all on her own.

1108
01:10:22,361 --> 01:10:23,661
She has no family...

1109
01:10:23,661 --> 01:10:25,932
- and no kids.
- I see.

1110
01:10:34,302 --> 01:10:36,001
- It's hot?
- Yes.

1111
01:10:38,472 --> 01:10:40,112
What should we eat?

1112
01:10:59,592 --> 01:11:01,232
Is that someone you know?

1113
01:11:02,701 --> 01:11:03,977
We're in-laws.

1114
01:11:04,001 --> 01:11:05,331
Let's go.

1115
01:11:15,482 --> 01:11:17,411
What is it? Do I need to apologize?

1116
01:11:17,411 --> 01:11:19,182
Oh, forget it.

1117
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:21,621
- Come on.
- Oh, dear.

1118
01:11:21,621 --> 01:11:23,081
My gosh.

1119
01:11:25,092 --> 01:11:27,462
- Can you stop fighting?
- Hello.

1120
01:11:27,462 --> 01:11:29,421
The twins are awake.

1121
01:11:30,291 --> 01:11:31,762
- Hey.
- My gosh.

1122
01:11:31,762 --> 01:11:33,961
- Goodness.
- They're so cute.

1123
01:11:34,132 --> 01:11:35,331
My goodness.

1124
01:11:35,331 --> 01:11:37,801
You're so pretty and cute.

1125
01:11:37,932 --> 01:11:39,248
Right, Do Jun?

1126
01:11:39,272 --> 01:11:41,942
Mom, I want to have
a baby like this.

1127
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:44,241
I want to have twins too.

1128
01:11:44,241 --> 01:11:46,211
A boy and a girl in one go.

1129
01:11:46,611 --> 01:11:49,741
Do Ra, Pil Seung. How did you do it?

1130
01:11:49,842 --> 01:11:51,711
- "How?"
- Well...

1131
01:11:53,812 --> 01:11:55,227
Good luck!

1132
01:11:55,251 --> 01:11:56,727
- Thanks.
- What?

1133
01:11:56,751 --> 01:11:58,551
You're hilarious.

1134
01:12:05,592 --> 01:12:07,091
They're so cute.

1135
01:12:15,642 --> 01:12:17,201
Hello.

1136
01:12:17,972 --> 01:12:19,411
They're smiling.

1137
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:23,911
Hello, sweetie.

1138
01:12:31,991 --> 01:12:35,319
(Thank you for watching
"Beauty and Mr. Romantic.")
