00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,412
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,572
Do Ra?

3
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:42,373
What the... My gosh.

4
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,913
(Episode 15)

5
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,042
Do Ra, what...

6
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:54,153
Do Ra, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry for causing this mess.

7
00:00:54,483 --> 00:00:56,822
My Do Ra...

8
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,752
Do Ra, my gosh.

9
00:00:58,752 --> 00:01:00,752
Do Ra.

10
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:03,663
This will be my last wish.

11
00:01:04,322 --> 00:01:06,492
Get back with Mr. Gong. Please?

12
00:01:07,492 --> 00:01:10,803
If you do, you won't have
to do this nude shoot.

13
00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:14,273
He told me...

14
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:16,973
he would help us out if you asked.

15
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:19,372
Getting two million dollars
for this job...

16
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:22,342
won't solve any of our problems.

17
00:01:22,943 --> 00:01:25,712
But Mr. Gong will make them go away.

18
00:01:26,383 --> 00:01:28,822
- Mom...
- Do Ra,

19
00:01:28,852 --> 00:01:32,693
we can't have
our lives end this way.

20
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:37,262
Do Ra, let's ask Mr. Gong for help.

21
00:01:37,262 --> 00:01:38,833
Let's do that, Do Ra.

22
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:42,863
Mom...

23
00:01:43,063 --> 00:01:45,033
Mom...

24
00:01:45,503 --> 00:01:47,943
I'm so sorry.

25
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,842
Your mom is sorry, Do Ra.

26
00:02:08,423 --> 00:02:09,423
Mr. Gong.

27
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:12,133
I apologize
for how I acted last time.

28
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:16,762
Would it be possible for me
to treat you to a meal?

29
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,022
It's an honor to have gotten
a dinner invitation, Ms. Park.

30
00:02:56,873 --> 00:02:57,873
Pil Seung.

31
00:02:59,672 --> 00:03:01,243
I'm getting two million dollars
for this.

32
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:03,743
Do you have that kind of money?

33
00:03:06,582 --> 00:03:07,612
Two million dollars?

34
00:03:10,253 --> 00:03:11,452
No, I don't.

35
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:15,892
Not two million dollars,

36
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,993
not 200,000 dollars,

37
00:03:19,862 --> 00:03:21,463
not even 20,000 dollars.

38
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:27,403
I guess I could offer 2,000 dollars.

39
00:03:29,973 --> 00:03:31,642
If I save up...

40
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,042
and scrape up everything I have,

41
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,653
I'll be able to offer 2,000 dollars.

42
00:03:48,693 --> 00:03:50,792
I can make two million dollars
after a few hours of a photo shoot.

43
00:03:51,463 --> 00:03:53,063
Can you give me that money instead?

44
00:03:53,063 --> 00:03:54,903
The mistake will be mine to regret,

45
00:03:54,903 --> 00:03:57,463
so shut it and get lost
unless you have two million dollars!

46
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:04,373
Seriously.

47
00:04:07,642 --> 00:04:10,142
The drinks
couldn't be sweeter today.

48
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,413
No way.

49
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:18,123
Ma'am, another bottle
of soju, please.

50
00:04:18,352 --> 00:04:19,352
Sure.

51
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:32,003
My gosh, Pil Seung.

52
00:04:33,103 --> 00:04:36,702
Hyun Chul, Sun Young,
get out here already.

53
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,272
- What?
- What is it?

54
00:04:38,272 --> 00:04:39,743
Pil Seung, my gosh.

55
00:04:39,743 --> 00:04:41,613
- Honey, help him up.
- Hey!

56
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:43,113
- Pil Seung, what on earth?
- Pil Seung?

57
00:04:43,113 --> 00:04:44,582
- What's wrong?
- Get up. Pull yourself together.

58
00:04:44,582 --> 00:04:46,113
- Goodness.
- What happened?

59
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,423
Hey.

60
00:04:50,053 --> 00:04:51,693
You see,

61
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:55,462
I was so ecstatic
that I had a few drinks.

62
00:04:55,923 --> 00:04:57,762
Goodness me.

63
00:04:57,762 --> 00:05:00,633
That doesn't mean you should
drink yourself into oblivion.

64
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,633
This is how accidents happen.

65
00:05:03,702 --> 00:05:05,772
I'm sorry about that. Victory!

66
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:07,402
- What?
- Goodness.

67
00:05:07,402 --> 00:05:08,503
My gosh.

68
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:11,743
I can't believe you.
You're too tall for this.

69
00:05:12,743 --> 00:05:14,472
He reeks of alcohol.

70
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:17,983
Where did he get wasted
this time around?

71
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:20,113
Gosh, he reeks.

72
00:05:23,753 --> 00:05:26,392
Hey. Here you go.

73
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:30,222
Gosh.

74
00:05:30,892 --> 00:05:31,892
Where did you drink so much?

75
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:35,633
Pil Seung, have some honey water
before going to bed.

76
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,003
Mom.

77
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:40,103
- Yes?
- Dad.

78
00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:43,803
All this time,

79
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,912
I never once regretted my choice...

80
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:50,983
to become a director
at a broadcasting station.

81
00:05:53,412 --> 00:05:55,652
But it's something I regret today.

82
00:05:58,993 --> 00:06:01,392
A profession that could
earn me a fortune.

83
00:06:02,123 --> 00:06:05,462
I should've chosen a profession
that earned me a fortune.

84
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,433
I regret that for sure today.

85
00:06:12,902 --> 00:06:14,902
Why is he mentioning money...

86
00:06:14,902 --> 00:06:17,873
after getting wasted like that?

87
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,572
What are you going on about?

88
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:24,883
Cut the nonsense and get some sleep.

89
00:06:26,313 --> 00:06:27,912
- Let's leave him be.
- Mom.

90
00:06:29,652 --> 00:06:32,053
I'd love nothing more
than to have two million dollars.

91
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:36,462
Two million.
Not a penny more, not a penny less.

92
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:38,662
Goodness.

93
00:06:38,662 --> 00:06:42,133
Pil Seung, just get
a good night's sleep.

94
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:43,863
Don't think about such nonsense
and go to bed.

95
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:45,972
Gosh.

96
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:53,412
Just two million dollars.

97
00:06:57,012 --> 00:06:58,253
Two million dollars.

98
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:03,152
With two million dollars,

99
00:07:04,683 --> 00:07:07,092
I'd be able to save Do Ra.

100
00:07:10,123 --> 00:07:12,993
He has lost his mind.

101
00:07:12,993 --> 00:07:15,733
Not 2,000 or 20,000 dollars but...

102
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:20,003
Ever since he started dating Do Ra,
he has lost his sense of reality.

103
00:07:20,402 --> 00:07:23,842
Two million dollars
isn't the name of someone's pet.

104
00:07:24,972 --> 00:07:26,772
This must be because
Do Ra has lost everything.

105
00:07:26,772 --> 00:07:27,972
He wants to help her.

106
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,282
Could they have argued over money?

107
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:33,753
That'd make him
even more of a lunatic.

108
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,082
Over two million dollars...

109
00:07:35,082 --> 00:07:36,822
which we never had the chance
to get a glimpse of?

110
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,353
You are my star,

111
00:08:12,522 --> 00:08:13,952
and I'm your moon.

112
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:17,762
Even if we face another difficulty,

113
00:08:18,392 --> 00:08:20,892
I want us to believe
and count on each other.

114
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:23,662
We should protect each other
like the moon and star here.

115
00:08:25,103 --> 00:08:26,832
You should never
let go of this hand, okay?

116
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:26,963
Do Ra.

117
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,963
I'm sorry about yesterday.

118
00:09:29,662 --> 00:09:31,103
For being angry with you.

119
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:34,703
You didn't do it
because you wanted to,

120
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:37,503
and I yelled at you
when I couldn't even help.

121
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:40,542
Do Ra.

122
00:09:41,142 --> 00:09:44,412
Even so, I love you.

123
00:10:31,392 --> 00:10:32,463
Do Ra.

124
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:35,932
Are you still angry?

125
00:10:38,103 --> 00:10:39,873
I didn't go ahead
with the nude shoot.

126
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:44,272
Is that true?

127
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:48,512
Do Ra.

128
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:56,883
Don't hug me anymore.

129
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:01,493
Why...

130
00:11:02,422 --> 00:11:03,593
What's going on?

131
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:09,363
I thought saying this to your face
was the right thing to do.

132
00:11:11,973 --> 00:11:14,772
I'm getting engaged
to CEO Gong Jin Dan.

133
00:11:20,243 --> 00:11:21,312
What?

134
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,083
We'll get engaged first,

135
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:27,052
then when my situation's
somewhat settled, we'll marry.

136
00:11:31,922 --> 00:11:33,022
Do Ra.

137
00:11:34,753 --> 00:11:36,562
What's this
about getting engaged and married?

138
00:11:37,593 --> 00:11:39,363
What are you talking about?

139
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:43,432
Are you saying this
because I caused a scene at the set?

140
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:46,373
I said I understood why you did it.

141
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:48,642
I'm sorry, Pil Seung.

142
00:11:52,073 --> 00:11:53,473
But that's how things worked out.

143
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,243
Let's end things...

144
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,853
and go our own ways.

145
00:12:03,353 --> 00:12:04,483
You're serious?

146
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:15,633
Is it...

147
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:17,932
because of the debt?

148
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,503
Did he offer to cover it?

149
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:25,743
Are you going to marry him
for money?

150
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:37,383
Is money more important to you
than our promise?

151
00:12:40,753 --> 00:12:43,823
How could you make such a choice
without even trying on your own?

152
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,892
How is this different
from selling yourself?

153
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:51,562
Do Ra. Please, get a grip.

154
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:54,603
Don't talk like that
when you know nothing.

155
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:58,172
You could never imagine
how I got to where I am now.

156
00:12:58,873 --> 00:13:01,613
Yes. Money's more important to me.

157
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:04,083
My blood, my sweat, and my tears.

158
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:07,282
I'm about to lose
everything I earned at that expense.

159
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:09,782
What could be more important
than money?

160
00:13:11,052 --> 00:13:12,753
Even if I have to die to avoid it,

161
00:13:13,123 --> 00:13:15,162
I don't want to go back
to my old life.

162
00:13:15,593 --> 00:13:17,792
I don't ever want to
go back to that.

163
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,733
Our promise?

164
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:24,363
What can a promise do for me?

165
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,873
What can love do for me?

166
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:34,213
What?

167
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:36,243
That means nothing at all.

168
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,983
Tell someone you love them
a thousand times.

169
00:13:41,753 --> 00:13:43,282
What good does that do?

170
00:13:44,753 --> 00:13:46,292
It's just a mirage.

171
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:49,323
It means nothing without money.

172
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:53,262
So let's call it quits.

173
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:03,473
Okay.

174
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,442
Let's end it.

175
00:14:09,012 --> 00:14:10,812
I didn't know
this was what you were like.

176
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:14,353
I regret the time...

177
00:14:15,323 --> 00:14:16,983
I spent liking you.

178
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:20,292
As you wish,

179
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:23,422
get engaged to and marry Mr. Gong,

180
00:14:24,392 --> 00:14:25,593
and have a great life.

181
00:14:27,463 --> 00:14:29,262
And the money you love so much?

182
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:33,932
I hope you drown in a hole of it.

183
00:14:54,223 --> 00:14:55,963
Don't cry, Park Do Ra.

184
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,432

189
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,083
There's both me
and your older brother.

190
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,993
How could you announce
an engagement without a word to us?

191
00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:01,593
What are you up to?

192
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:04,562
Were you aware of this?

193
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:06,892
No. I just found out as well.

194
00:16:07,963 --> 00:16:10,133
Gong Jin Dan. How could you do this?

195
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:12,233
Don't you care at all about Mom?

196
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:14,772
You'll get engaged
to Park Do Ra who everyone knows...

197
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:16,302
is in debt and almost bankrupt?

198
00:16:16,973 --> 00:16:19,312
Are you insane?
Are you thinking straight?

199
00:16:19,442 --> 00:16:23,012
I didn't tell any of you in advance
because I knew you'd be like this.

200
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,282
You're the CEO
of Angel Investment Corp.

201
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:28,483
That position
comes with social responsibility.

202
00:16:29,152 --> 00:16:30,522
You're going to get engaged...

203
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,723
to a woman whose mother
fell in debt by gambling?

204
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:34,593
Do you think that makes sense?

205
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,292
News about your engagement.

206
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:39,993
Get the press to say
it was a false report,

207
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,133
and reconsider the whole thing.

208
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:48,203
Yes.
Do as your brother says, Jin Dan.

209
00:16:50,902 --> 00:16:53,113
Do Ra's not the one
who gambled her money away.

210
00:16:54,243 --> 00:16:56,843
She did nothing wrong.

211
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:02,353
I won't let this harm APP Group,
so don't worry.

212
00:17:03,652 --> 00:17:06,453
This is a personal
and private issue.

213
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:10,223
How can you call this
personal and private?

214
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:13,892
It'll harm the image of your company
as well as the whole group.

215
00:17:13,892 --> 00:17:15,462
How much will it cost, exactly?

216
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,033
Tell me how much the loss will be
and I'll compensate you.

217
00:17:20,803 --> 00:17:22,242
Why do I need permission...

218
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,073
to marry someone at my age?

219
00:17:25,843 --> 00:17:28,212
I don't want any of you
to tell me what to do with my life.

220
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:31,583
- My gosh. You...
- Oh, gosh. He lost his mind.

221
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,083
I'm sorry, Chairman Gong.

222
00:17:34,482 --> 00:17:35,722
Sorry, Auntie.

223
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:36,922
Oh, dear.

224
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,162
This is why...

225
00:17:43,222 --> 00:17:45,263
I didn't want to give him
Angel Investment Corp. so soon.

226
00:17:47,492 --> 00:17:48,533
Goodness...

Sun Young. What happened?

231
00:17:57,303 --> 00:17:59,972
- Did Pil Seung and Do Ra break up?
- Gosh.

232
00:17:59,972 --> 00:18:03,212
Why would they break up
when they just started dating?

233
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:05,853
If they did break up,
he would've told us.

234
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:06,883
Then why would the article say...

235
00:18:06,883 --> 00:18:09,182
she got engaged to the second son
of APP Group?

236
00:18:09,182 --> 00:18:12,553
Isn't it that Do Ra, that brat,
dumped our Pil Seung?

237
00:18:12,922 --> 00:18:16,392
No wonder he's been
coming home late and drunk.

238
00:18:16,523 --> 00:18:17,623
I can't believe this.

239
00:18:18,392 --> 00:18:19,962
How is this even possible?

240
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:23,932
Park Do Ra, that vixen, was
playing around with Pil Seung.

241
00:18:23,932 --> 00:18:26,732
Just like how her mom,
that gold digger, messed with Mr. Kim,

242

with Pil Seung this time.

243
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:31,172
My gosh.

244
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:34,543
The gold digger blood
runs in the family, I must say.

245
00:18:36,343 --> 00:18:37,613
The thing is...

246
00:18:38,712 --> 00:18:40,353
I'm not sure
if it's okay to say this.

247
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:41,783

248
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:44,523
You know it was raining a lot
the other day.

249
00:18:44,952 --> 00:18:46,692
Pil Seung came home drunk
that night.

250
00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:50,593
Late in the night,
Pil Seung cried a lot.

251
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:52,333
What?

252
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,033
I didn't know what it was about,

253
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,732
but I guess that's when
Do Ra broke up with him.

254
00:18:57,962 --> 00:18:59,273
I'm not letting her
get away with this.

255
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:00,373
- Wait.
- Sun Young.

256
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,972
Wait, honey. Don't be like this.

257
00:19:01,972 --> 00:19:03,642
- Calm down.
- Sun Young, just let it slide.

258
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,672
After all, it may be for the best.

259
00:19:06,672 --> 00:19:08,013
How would I let this slide?

260
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,412
She made my Pil Seung cry!

261
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:11,783
That darn brat.

262
00:19:11,982 --> 00:19:14,113
- Just calm down, Sun Young.
- I have to do something.

263
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:16,783
- Sun Young, let it go.
- Still, you need to calm down.

264
00:19:16,783 --> 00:19:19,023
Hey, listen.

265
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:21,992
Apparently, she's drowning
in her mom's gambling debt.

266
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:25,162
So she chose a rich man
over Pil Seung.

267
00:19:25,263 --> 00:19:27,863
This is probably for the best.

268
00:19:27,863 --> 00:19:30,763
You don't want anything to do
with that crazy gold digger...

269
00:19:30,763 --> 00:19:32,202
who's addicted to gambling.

270
00:19:32,932 --> 00:19:35,603
Sun Young, let's just think...

271
00:19:35,603 --> 00:19:38,303
that Mr. Kim is watching out for us
from above.

272
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,972
She seduced him first
when he wasn't even interested,

273
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,942
and then she broke his heart.

274
00:19:43,343 --> 00:19:46,152
How could she
destroy him so brutally?

275
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:50,182
I was out of my mind.

276
00:19:51,353 --> 00:19:52,722
It's all my fault.

277
00:19:52,722 --> 00:19:55,023
- Sun Young.
- Gosh, Sun Young. Calm down.

278
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:56,462
- Be cool.
- It's okay.

279
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:57,763
- Sun Young.
- How can I...

280
00:20:13,073 --> 00:20:15,583
Do you not know
how to greet your elders, you punk?

281
00:20:19,712 --> 00:20:20,712
Hey.

282
00:20:22,652 --> 00:20:24,353
You know Do Ra is engaged.

283
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:28,053
Don't go shooting your mouth off.

284
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:30,922
If you say anything
about your relationship with Do Ra,

285
00:20:30,922 --> 00:20:33,033
I'll make you regret it.

286
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,732
Everything is coming up roses
for Do Ra now.

287
00:20:34,992 --> 00:20:38,202
Make sure not to stand in her way.
Do you understand?

288
00:20:40,402 --> 00:20:43,242
You disrespectful brat, why aren't
you answering my question?

289
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:44,972
Hey!

290
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,942
My gosh. You crazy witch!

291
00:20:49,942 --> 00:20:51,343
You darn wench.

292
00:20:51,343 --> 00:20:54,553
What did you just say
to my heartbroken son?

293
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:58,152
You stupid idiot! You witch!

294
00:20:58,152 --> 00:20:59,752
- My goodness.
- You scumbag.

295
00:20:59,752 --> 00:21:02,293
You crazy witch. My gosh.

296
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:04,023
You!

297
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:06,633
If you show your face here again,

298
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:08,263
I'm going to kill you!

299
00:21:08,263 --> 00:21:09,803
You darn witch!

300
00:21:12,002 --> 00:21:13,232
Pil Seung, go in.

301
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:15,573
She's even below contempt.

302
00:21:15,573 --> 00:21:16,803
Let's just go.

303
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:18,573
Darn you!

304
00:21:24,843 --> 00:21:27,252
That darn witch
grabbed my throat the other day,

305
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,583
and she even slapped me
in the face this time.

306
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:31,252
How dare she?

307
00:21:32,152 --> 00:21:35,523
I'm not letting her
get away with this.

308
00:21:38,323 --> 00:21:39,432
Gosh, seriously...

309
00:21:44,368 --> 00:21:46,838
How is Pil Seung? Is he okay?

310
00:21:47,969 --> 00:21:50,578
I told him to think
that he had a bad dream.

311
00:21:51,408 --> 00:21:53,638
And he says he's already over it
and he's fine.

312
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:57,479
Good for you, Pil Seung.

313
00:21:57,848 --> 00:22:00,588
You have to forget
all about that darn brat.

314
00:22:00,588 --> 00:22:02,549
It's a good call, Pil Seung.

315
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:08,128
Sun Young, why are you crying?

316
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,858
Pil Seung says he's okay.

317
00:22:09,858 --> 00:22:11,428
I'm not crying.

318
00:22:11,858 --> 00:22:13,898
Actually, I feel relieved.

319
00:22:14,469 --> 00:22:16,769
Right. This is a good thing.

320
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:18,868
Knowing that you slapped
that wench in the face...

321
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:20,668
took a load off my mind.

322
00:22:21,338 --> 00:22:23,138
If I was there with you,

323
00:22:23,138 --> 00:22:25,539
I would've pulled all her hair out.

324
00:22:31,578 --> 00:22:33,519
This dress is beautiful too.

325
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,888
You look gorgeous.

326
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,789
What do you think?

327
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:38,519
My gosh.

328
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:40,588
This is really nice too.

329
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,098
Everything is just too good.

330
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:46,598
Which one do you like, Do Ra?

331
00:22:47,729 --> 00:22:48,868
I like them all.

332
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,638
Pick whatever you want.

333
00:22:54,638 --> 00:22:57,378
Do Ra, we still have some time left.

334
00:22:57,678 --> 00:22:59,878
Why don't you try one more
before we make our decision?

335
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:02,848
Today is a big day.

336
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,319
I want you to look beautiful.

337
00:23:06,949 --> 00:23:07,949
Okay.

338
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:21,668
Mr. Gong.

339
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:25,368
Could you come in here for a minute?

340
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:35,608
Do Ra, what's wrong?

341
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:41,618
I'm sorry, Mr. Gong.

342
00:23:44,688 --> 00:23:46,188
I can't do this.

343
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:53,098
What do you mean you can't do this?

344
00:23:54,898 --> 00:23:57,469
I was in need of your help.

345
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:01,739
I didn't think I'd be able to
get back on my feet without your help.

346
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:04,608
That's why I decided to marry you.

347
00:24:06,838 --> 00:24:09,878
But I can't do this.
I don't think this is right.

348
00:24:11,078 --> 00:24:12,519
I'm sorry, Mr. Gong.

349
00:24:13,449 --> 00:24:14,519
I'm really sorry.

350
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:21,188
Get up.

351
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:35,168
Do Ra, we can stop trying on
the dresses if you are tired.

352
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,009
Let's just go
with the last one you tried.

353
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:41,178
I can't promise to marry you...

354
00:24:41,178 --> 00:24:44,618
when I don't even have
feelings for you.

355
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:49,219
This is a mean thing to do
even to you.

356
00:24:50,888 --> 00:24:52,888
I'm really sorry, Mr. Gong.

357
00:24:58,699 --> 00:24:59,999
I do have feelings for you.

358
00:25:00,628 --> 00:25:01,769
That's all that matters.

359
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:03,868
There's no problem.

360
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,779
I don't want to mess up
our engagement ceremony.

361
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:13,378
Just hurry and get ready.

362
00:25:15,908 --> 00:25:18,148
I can't do this, Mr. Gong.

363
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,229
Go back in there now.

364
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,269
Before I lose my temper.

365
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:36,668
I'm sorry, Mr. Gong.

366
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:39,338
Please let go of my hand.

367
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,638
Hey, Park Do Ra.

368
00:25:42,838 --> 00:25:45,779
You came to me on your own
and asked me for help.

369
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:46,838
That's why...

370
00:25:48,209 --> 00:25:50,348
I accepted you
with no strings attached...

371
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,019
when you had so many flaws.

372
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:54,489
And you are humiliating me...

373
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,888
after everything I've done for you?

374
00:26:00,688 --> 00:26:02,658
Do you think
you can get away with all this?

375
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,029
I can completely destroy you.

376
00:26:10,598 --> 00:26:12,499
Is there anything left for me...

377
00:26:14,469 --> 00:26:15,969
to be destroyed?

378
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:22,578
But I don't want to make
a bad choice that I will regret.

379
00:26:25,648 --> 00:26:26,979
I'm sorry, Mr. Gong.

380
00:26:28,489 --> 00:26:29,848
Then let me ask you...

381
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:33,519
one last question.

382
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:37,229
After you leave like this,

383
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:40,828
are you sure you won't regret it?

384
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:43,128
I'm sorry.

385
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:01,949
Why am I so nervous when
this isn't my engagement ceremony?

386
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,918
Mom, is this an engagement ceremony
or a gathering with his family?

387
00:27:07,688 --> 00:27:09,688
We're meeting his family
and enjoying her engagement.

388
00:27:10,388 --> 00:27:12,499
Will Mr. Gong
dig us out of this hole...

389
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:14,699
if she marries him?

390
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,469
Are you sure we'll be able
to keep the house and building?

391
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,368
That's what I said.

392
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,638
Do Sik, we've finally been saved.

393
00:27:22,168 --> 00:27:23,239
Let's go.

394
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,338
Sure, let's go.

395
00:27:28,378 --> 00:27:29,408
What...

396
00:27:32,348 --> 00:27:33,979
Do Ra, why are you here?

397
00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:38,489
Do Ra, we agreed to meet
at the engagement party venue,

398
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:40,959
so why did you come home
looking like this?

399
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:43,588
I'm not getting engaged, Mom.

400
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:45,799
I'm not going through with it.

401
00:27:47,358 --> 00:27:49,128
What do you mean
you're not getting engaged?

402
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:53,039
Do Ra, how can you not get engaged?

403
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:55,039
We'll lose our building
and everything.

404
00:27:55,938 --> 00:27:58,209
Will he help us out
even if you don't get engaged?

405
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:00,509
He'd have to be stupid
to make that offer.

406
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:02,148
Do Ra,

407
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:04,418
why are you suddenly being this way?

408
00:28:04,618 --> 00:28:07,789
Everything will be okay
once you get engaged,

409
00:28:07,918 --> 00:28:10,148
so why are you acting up again?

410
00:28:10,449 --> 00:28:11,459
I know.

411
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:14,658
That's why I was going
to go through with it.

412
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:16,388
I couldn't let my career
end this way.

413
00:28:17,499 --> 00:28:19,799
But by marrying someone
I don't love,

414
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,368
I'll be deceiving him too.

415
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:25,668
Mom, I don't think
I can live that way.

416
00:28:26,368 --> 00:28:27,398
So?

417
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:30,739
Did you call off the engagement?

418
00:28:31,908 --> 00:28:32,938
Yes.

419
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:37,178
Do Ra, no.

420
00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:41,019
Without this engagement,
I'll die and so will all of you.

421
00:28:42,648 --> 00:28:45,158
Let me take you to him right now.
Then it'll all be okay.

422
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,888
No, I'm not doing that.

423
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:50,588
Why must I marry
a man I don't like...

424
00:28:50,588 --> 00:28:52,729
just to dig you
out of your gambling debt?

425
00:28:53,828 --> 00:28:55,398
Why did any of this even happen?

426
00:28:55,729 --> 00:28:57,229
You caused all this mess,

427
00:28:57,229 --> 00:28:58,838
so you should clean it up.

428
00:28:59,569 --> 00:29:01,039
How can you only think
about taking advantage of me...

429
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,469
even at the last moment?

430
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:04,069
How?

431
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:08,108
Are you suggesting
that we all crash and burn?

432
00:29:09,578 --> 00:29:11,118
I'm going to start over.

433
00:29:11,949 --> 00:29:13,019
Mom.

434
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,388
Mom, let's start over.

435
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:19,289
Remember how we built my career
even when we had nothing?

436
00:29:19,688 --> 00:29:21,828
Mom, we can do it.

437
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:23,928
Let's start over.

438
00:29:25,328 --> 00:29:28,128
How can we start anew?

439
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:29,828
At least you were young back then.

440
00:29:29,828 --> 00:29:32,469
How can we start over
when you're on the older side now?

441
00:29:32,868 --> 00:29:34,209
We can start anew?

442
00:29:34,209 --> 00:29:36,539
Well, I can't.

443
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:39,078
I'm not going through
all that trouble again.

444
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:41,509
So please...

445
00:29:42,878 --> 00:29:44,348
Let's go to Mr. Gong.

446
00:29:45,148 --> 00:29:46,479
Get engaged to him.

447
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:50,549
No, I'm not doing it.
I won't go with you!

448
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,289
I'll die if you don't
get engaged to him.

449
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:54,688
I'll go to prison!

450
00:29:54,688 --> 00:29:56,289
You caused this mess.

451
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:58,199
You broke the law.

452
00:29:58,428 --> 00:30:01,199
Take responsibility
for what you have done!

453
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,868
Why you...

454
00:30:03,098 --> 00:30:06,539
How can you tell your own mother
to rot in prison?

455
00:30:06,668 --> 00:30:10,239
How could you, you crazy brat?

456
00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:17,148
Mom, I...

457
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:22,519
I hate the fact
that I was born your daughter.

458
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:32,799
Mom, seriously?

459
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:35,098
Do Ra, wait.

460
00:30:56,118 --> 00:30:57,188
Gong Jin Dan.

461
00:30:57,888 --> 00:30:59,418
Was the engagement called off...

462
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,688
because Park Do Ra
ran from the dress shop...

463
00:31:01,688 --> 00:31:03,358
saying she couldn't do it?

464
00:31:03,888 --> 00:31:05,628
It wasn't you
who had a change of heart.

465
00:31:06,428 --> 00:31:08,928
I talked to Ms. Choi
from the dress shop,

466
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:10,628
so don't think about lying to me.

467
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:13,499
We'll talk later.

468
00:31:14,668 --> 00:31:17,678
Did you push for this engagement...

469
00:31:17,678 --> 00:31:20,438
saying you'd cover
her mom's gambling debt?

470
00:31:20,938 --> 00:31:22,009
Is that true?

471
00:31:22,148 --> 00:31:24,148
But still, she dumped you?

472
00:31:24,209 --> 00:31:25,319
Mom, please!

473
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:27,549
We'll talk about it later.

474
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:29,989
You have no right
to raise your voice.

475
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:35,328
Were you going to marry her
in exchange for money?

476
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:37,358
Did you really think about
getting married like that?

477
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:39,398
You imbecile.

478
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:44,938
I'll start working on dinner.

479
00:31:45,668 --> 00:31:46,739
Unbelievable.

480
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,078
This is humiliating,
to say the least.

481
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:54,078
Call the PR Team and tell them...

482
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,408
to retract the news
about your engagement.

483
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:56,648
Right now!

484
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:00,449
Where on earth are you going?

485
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:05,418
Anyway, has this girl lost her mind?

486
00:32:06,088 --> 00:32:07,828
My son offered to help her.

487
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,489
I'd get it if he ran away,

488
00:32:09,489 --> 00:32:10,729
but who is she
to call it off herself?

489
00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:14,029
Unbelievable.
You've got to be kidding me.

490
00:32:24,739 --> 00:32:29,148
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

491
00:32:37,418 --> 00:32:39,918
Mr. Cha, I need something done.

492
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:47,328
I'd rather die than go to prison.

493
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:53,398
Maybe I should hide
somewhere overseas.

494
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:55,168
What?

495
00:32:58,078 --> 00:32:59,138
Who can it be?

496
00:33:02,979 --> 00:33:04,479
Hello? Who is this?

497
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:06,878
Yes, this is she.

498
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:09,848
A cosmetics commercial?

499
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,719
Yes, of course, she's available.

500
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:15,888
My secret to having good skin?

501
00:33:16,489 --> 00:33:18,898
Flush out toxins
and restore your energy...

502
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:20,428
with antioxidation
cicada larva juice.

503
00:33:20,428 --> 00:33:21,428
(Vitality Cicada Larva)

504
00:33:21,428 --> 00:33:23,368
Vitamins A, C, E, and K.

505
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,138
Enjoy them with Park Do Ra.

506
00:33:26,668 --> 00:33:28,239
Cut. Okay.

507
00:33:29,569 --> 00:33:31,039
- Good job, everyone.
- Thank you.

508
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:32,979
- Good job, everyone.
- Nicely done.

509
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:34,378
Thank you.

510
00:33:36,078 --> 00:33:38,648
When can I expect
the payment to be made?

511
00:33:39,648 --> 00:33:41,888
It will be wired within a week.

512
00:33:42,219 --> 00:33:43,249
A week?

513
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:48,158
I'm sorry,
but could I have it sooner?

514
00:33:48,628 --> 00:33:51,428
I see. If that's the case,

515
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:53,759
I'll try to get it sorted out
in the next few days.

516
00:33:55,398 --> 00:33:58,168
- Thank you so much.
- The pleasure was mine.

517
00:34:01,569 --> 00:34:03,469
Hey, Do Sik.
I just wrapped up filming.

518
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:04,809
You did great.

519
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:07,378
By the way, Do Ra...

520
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:09,848
A kimchi stew place just opened,

521
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,078
and it wants you
at its opening event.

522
00:34:11,078 --> 00:34:12,578
What should I do?

523
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,378
I should do what I can.
Tell them I'll be there.

524
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:16,848
- I'll take any job.
- Sure. Got it.

525
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,188
By the way,
a cosmetics commercial came in.

526
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:20,588
- A cosmetics commercial?
- Yes.

527
00:34:20,588 --> 00:34:22,259
I haven't heard of the brand before,

528
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:24,058
but it must be a new one
that's launching.

529
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:25,659
They offered a great deal.

530
00:34:26,228 --> 00:34:29,699
Anyway, head to Hanseo Hotel
this second.

531
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:31,438
They asked for a meeting.

532
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:33,398
Got it.
I'll head over there right away.

533
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,608
Sure.

534
00:34:50,319 --> 00:34:53,489
This is an odd place to meet
for a commercial contract deal.

535
00:35:13,038 --> 00:35:14,549
Welcome, Ms. Park.

536
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:20,478
Is this where we'll be discussing
the cosmetics ad campaign?

537
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:24,049
Come in for now.

538
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,018
We'll talk inside.

539
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,159
Sure.

540
00:35:41,569 --> 00:35:42,739
Why isn't anyone else here?

541
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:45,579
Sorry? Oh, that.

542
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,418
- Ms. Park.
- What do you think you're doing?

543
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,688
We'll talk about
the commercial deal later.

544
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:02,728
Since you're here,
enjoy a date with me.

545
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:06,128
You knew about this
when you agreed to come here.

546
00:36:07,429 --> 00:36:08,429
What?

547
00:36:08,429 --> 00:36:09,569
Have a seat.

548
00:36:09,728 --> 00:36:11,838
Let's sit and have a drink.

549
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,299
Let go of me.

550
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,168
Ms. Park!

551
00:36:18,808 --> 00:36:20,009
Do Sik, where are you?

552
00:36:21,009 --> 00:36:22,349
Where on earth are you?

553
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:24,478
I'm on my way.
I'll be there in ten minutes.

554
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,349
Forget that
and explain what this was.

555
00:36:27,049 --> 00:36:28,788
You said it was a deal
for a cosmetics ad campaign.

556
00:36:28,918 --> 00:36:30,248
It was supposed to be a meeting,

557
00:36:30,248 --> 00:36:32,058
so who was that creep of a man?

558
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:34,518
Do Ra, what do you mean by a creep?

559
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:36,759
Mom told us to be at the hotel.

560
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,429
Wasn't it a meeting
for a cosmetics ad campaign?

561
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:40,529
Was it Mom?

562
00:36:43,398 --> 00:36:44,699
Was Mom behind it again?

563
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:50,469
Our mom did this?

564
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:07,262
Mom, have you lost your mind?

565
00:37:07,631 --> 00:37:09,231
Are you insane?

566
00:37:10,031 --> 00:37:12,901
Park Do Ra, you... What now?

567
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:14,472
I get that we're in a deep hole,

568
00:37:14,772 --> 00:37:16,812
but how could you
offer me to a sponsor?

569
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:18,412
On top of everything you did,

570
00:37:18,412 --> 00:37:20,412
you were going to sell me
to a creep twice my age!

571
00:37:21,012 --> 00:37:24,111
How could my own mom
do this to me? How?

572
00:37:26,821 --> 00:37:29,051
Do Ra, what are you talking about?

573
00:37:29,051 --> 00:37:31,222
Do Sik, what has gotten into her?

574
00:37:31,222 --> 00:37:33,191
Speak up, will you?

575
00:37:33,662 --> 00:37:36,292
You accepted
the cosmetics ad campaign deal.

576
00:37:36,292 --> 00:37:38,191
She's talking about
the hotel you sent her to.

577
00:37:38,191 --> 00:37:41,662
I'm done considering you
as my mother.

578
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:45,671
As of this second,
you and I are done.

579
00:37:46,142 --> 00:37:47,441
I'm done with you!

580
00:38:00,022 --> 00:38:01,122
- Ms. Park.
- It's Park Do Ra.

581
00:38:01,122 --> 00:38:02,251
- It's Park Do Ra.
- Park Do Ra.

582
00:38:02,551 --> 00:38:03,751
- Ms. Park.
- Over here.

583
00:38:03,892 --> 00:38:06,522
That photo of you at Hanseo Hotel.
Were you with your sponsor?

584
00:38:06,591 --> 00:38:08,321
A sponsor?
What are you talking about?

585
00:38:08,321 --> 00:38:09,691
The nation is blowing up...

586
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:10,932
with articles
about you trading sexual favors.

587
00:38:10,932 --> 00:38:13,301
Don't tell me
you're going to deny it.

588
00:38:13,401 --> 00:38:14,702
Trading sexual favors?

589
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:17,272
Look here. Watch what you're saying.

590
00:38:17,372 --> 00:38:18,932
You were at Hanseo Hotel today.

591
00:38:18,932 --> 00:38:20,542
Why were you there?

592
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:22,171
Hanseo Hotel?

593
00:38:22,171 --> 00:38:23,912
It was for a cosmetics
commercial deal.

594
00:38:23,912 --> 00:38:25,542
Who discusses one in a hotel room?

595
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:27,441
Who goes to a meeting
without her agent?

596
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:29,182
Was it to pay off
your mother's gambling debt?

597
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,281
You're wrong about this.
I don't have a sponsor.

598
00:38:31,281 --> 00:38:32,452
- Ms. Park, wait.
- You're wrong.

599
00:38:32,452 --> 00:38:33,952
- Ms. Park, hold on.
- Please answer the question.

600
00:38:33,952 --> 00:38:36,151
- Ms. Park.
- Were you trading sexual favors?

601
00:38:36,151 --> 00:38:38,452
- Ms. Park, any words?
- Tell us if it's true.

602
00:38:38,452 --> 00:38:40,662
- Ms. Park.
- Ms. Park, talk to us.

603
00:38:40,662 --> 00:38:42,262
- Is it true?
- Over here.

604
00:38:42,262 --> 00:38:44,591
- Are you going to deny it?
- Were you at the hotel?

605
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:47,301
- Ms. Park, wait.
- Are the rumors true?

606
00:38:47,301 --> 00:38:49,062
- Ms. Park?
- Say a few words.

607
00:38:49,062 --> 00:38:52,102
- Were you at Hanseo Hotel?
- Is it true?

608
00:38:56,642 --> 00:38:59,142
- Ms. Park, wait.
- Just a second.

609
00:39:02,042 --> 00:39:05,082
- Ms. Park!
- Ms. Park, wait.

610
00:39:22,801 --> 00:39:25,031
(Park Do Ra)

611
00:39:25,801 --> 00:39:27,571
(Park Do Ra Agrees to Sponsorship
to Cover Her Mother's Debt?)

612
00:39:30,014 --> 00:39:30,293
(Park Do Ra Agrees to Sponsorship
to Cover Her Mother's Debt?)

613
00:39:37,082 --> 00:39:40,222
What... What on earth is this?

614
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:43,251
What is this?

615
00:39:46,022 --> 00:39:48,191
No, this can't be true.

616
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:51,231
This can't be true!

617
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:55,231
No, this can't be true.

618
00:39:57,472 --> 00:39:59,301
It can't be true.

619
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:03,441
This can't be true!

620
00:40:03,872 --> 00:40:04,941
Look here.

621
00:40:04,941 --> 00:40:07,711
How can you publish that article
without checking the facts?

622
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:10,852
Our Do Ra has never done
such a thing before.

623
00:40:10,852 --> 00:40:12,751
She's not that type of girl!

624
00:40:13,952 --> 00:40:14,952
The hotel?

625
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:19,151
We had no idea what was going
to happen at the hotel.

626
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:21,022
We were tricked into going there.

627
00:40:22,722 --> 00:40:25,591
Hello? Hey!

628
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:31,171
The number you have dialed...

629
00:40:31,171 --> 00:40:32,901
- does not exist.
- The number doesn't exist.

630
00:40:32,901 --> 00:40:34,071
Are you sure this is
the right number?

631
00:40:34,071 --> 00:40:36,071
Yes, it's the number
I got the call from.

632
00:40:36,872 --> 00:40:38,571
- The number you have dialed...
- Did it say it was an ad agency?

633
00:40:38,571 --> 00:40:39,781
Yes!

634
00:40:39,781 --> 00:40:42,082
Please check the number
and try again.

635
00:40:42,781 --> 00:40:46,111
Mom, I think someone
set a trap for us.

636
00:40:46,921 --> 00:40:48,921
What? A trap?

637
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:52,821
Could someone be coming at us
to get back at you for your debt?

638
00:40:53,762 --> 00:40:56,122
Mom, what about our Do Ra?

639
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:57,131
What...

640
00:40:58,162 --> 00:41:00,102
Who could have done this?

641
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:02,401
If they want me to pay them back,

642
00:41:02,401 --> 00:41:04,401
they shouldn't try
to strangle the life out of me.

643
00:41:06,202 --> 00:41:07,202
This is exactly why...

644
00:41:07,202 --> 00:41:08,872
Do Ra should've gotten engaged
to Mr. Gong.

645
00:41:08,872 --> 00:41:10,912
None of this would've happened
if she had gone through with it.

646
00:41:11,312 --> 00:41:14,341
Do Sik, what do we do?

647
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:16,042
We can't live in Korea anymore.

648
00:41:16,042 --> 00:41:17,852
How can we
after this shameful scandal?

649
00:41:18,082 --> 00:41:19,582
How are we supposed
to make a living?

650
00:41:19,582 --> 00:41:21,281
And prison is the last place
I'm going.

651
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:23,921
Do Sik, what do we do?

652
00:41:23,921 --> 00:41:27,392
Mom! How is
that the issue right now?

653
00:41:28,162 --> 00:41:29,591
What do we do about Do Ra?

654
00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:31,432
I can't reach her on her phone.

655
00:41:32,231 --> 00:41:36,162
What if Do Ra chooses
to do the unthinkable?

656
00:41:37,001 --> 00:41:39,742
Should I report her missing?

657
00:41:40,202 --> 00:41:41,272
Are you out of your mind?

658
00:41:41,272 --> 00:41:43,642
If we report that she's missing,
reporters will say she's dead.

659
00:41:43,642 --> 00:41:45,042
As if you don't know that.

660
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,512
Wait.

661
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:48,841
Text her right away
and tell her to come home.

662
00:41:48,841 --> 00:41:51,012
We need to hide somewhere overseas.

663
00:41:51,012 --> 00:41:53,251
We can't continue to live here!

664
00:41:54,682 --> 00:41:56,281
All right. Darn it.

00:42:09,332 --> 00:42:11,131
I bet she finally learned her place.

668
00:42:11,472 --> 00:42:13,341
She's nothing.

669
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:17,171
She'll soon come back to me...

670
00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:20,611
and ask that I save her life
by taking her back.

673
00:42:43,631 --> 00:42:45,131
The article is a lie.

674
00:42:51,812 --> 00:42:54,381
I've been a huge fan of yours
for ten years.

675
00:42:54,812 --> 00:42:57,452
I've been the chairman
of your fan club...

676
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:58,582
for almost ten years now.

677
00:42:58,952 --> 00:42:59,952

678
00:43:00,251 --> 00:43:02,751
The news about your mom
being in a pile of debt?

680
00:43:03,952 --> 00:43:07,022
We backed you up online
day and night.

681
00:43:07,022 --> 00:43:08,361
None of that was your fault.

682
00:43:08,821 --> 00:43:09,932
But now this?

683
00:43:09,932 --> 00:43:12,162
Since I was a fan for ten years,

684
00:43:12,162 --> 00:43:13,961
I'll be a hater
for the same amount of time.

685
00:43:13,961 --> 00:43:15,932
No, I'll forever be a hater!

686
00:43:16,231 --> 00:43:19,731

687

I'm going
to have a press conference.

688
00:43:23,972 --> 00:43:27,082
Guys, please believe me.

689
00:43:27,082 --> 00:43:28,642
- If you believe in me, I'll...
- Don't make excuses!

690
00:43:28,642 --> 00:43:29,981
You make us sick.

Director, is that true?

710
00:44:27,602 --> 00:44:29,501
Cancel the meeting we agreed to.

711
00:44:30,272 --> 00:44:33,912
I've been fond of Do Ra for years,

712
00:44:33,912 --> 00:44:36,012
"Straightforward Romance"
was a hit thanks to her,

713
00:44:36,012 --> 00:44:37,711
and she always works hard,

714
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:39,381
so I wanted to give her a chance...

715
00:44:39,381 --> 00:44:42,352
despite the issue
with her mom's gambling debt.

716
00:44:43,082 --> 00:44:45,321
But now, there's nothing we can do.

717
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:48,122
Right. I got it.

718
00:44:48,492 --> 00:44:50,961
How can she stoop this low?

719
00:44:51,461 --> 00:44:53,662
I know she's struggling
with her mom losing all her money...

720
00:44:53,662 --> 00:44:55,501
and the debt her mom's in,

721
00:44:55,501 --> 00:44:56,501
but a sponsor...

722
00:44:58,102 --> 00:45:00,941
That's just wrong, darn it.

723
00:45:06,781 --> 00:45:07,781
Jin Gu.

724
00:45:08,742 --> 00:45:10,952
What is he talking about?

725
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,122
What is he saying about Park Do Ra?

726
00:45:15,122 --> 00:45:16,651
Haven't you read the articles?

727
00:45:17,792 --> 00:45:19,852
You won't believe
what's going on with her.

728
00:45:21,992 --> 00:45:25,231
Is that why her engagement
to Mr. Gong was called off?

729
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:27,801
(Park Do Ra Agrees to Sponsorship
to Cover Her Mother's Debt?)

730
00:45:27,801 --> 00:45:29,531
There's no coming back from this.

731
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:31,772
Her career is over.

732
00:45:32,702 --> 00:45:33,702
Gosh.

733
00:45:34,642 --> 00:45:35,671
Goodness.

734
00:45:41,012 --> 00:45:42,481
(Ms. Park Do Ra)

735
00:45:44,281 --> 00:45:47,151
Pil Seung, can we meet?

736
00:45:48,082 --> 00:45:49,781
I have one last thing to say to you.

737
00:45:58,031 --> 00:45:59,031
Pil Seung.

738
00:46:03,531 --> 00:46:04,801
Why are you here?

739
00:46:07,001 --> 00:46:09,142
There's something I must tell you.

740
00:46:09,872 --> 00:46:12,071
But you didn't reply to my text.

741
00:46:14,341 --> 00:46:15,481
What about?

742
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:18,182
You and I
don't need to meet anymore.

743
00:46:19,082 --> 00:46:20,182
Pil Seung.

744
00:46:21,551 --> 00:46:23,122
You read the news, didn't you?

745
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:26,492
It's not true.

746
00:46:28,222 --> 00:46:30,531
I don't care
what other people think,

747
00:46:30,731 --> 00:46:33,662
but I don't want you
to get the wrong idea about me.

748
00:46:34,361 --> 00:46:36,031
None of that is true.

749
00:46:36,731 --> 00:46:38,272
It was all made up.

750
00:46:39,932 --> 00:46:41,642
I came here...

751
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:45,542
to tell you that.

752
00:46:51,682 --> 00:46:53,251
What about the photos
taken at the hotel?

753
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:55,082
They were...

754
00:46:56,421 --> 00:46:59,821
I was there to attend a meeting
about a cosmetics commercial.

755
00:47:00,022 --> 00:47:01,022
Park Do Ra.

756
00:47:02,622 --> 00:47:04,792
I didn't think you'd go that low.

757
00:47:06,662 --> 00:47:07,901
You chose money over me...

758
00:47:07,901 --> 00:47:09,531
and decided to marry a rich guy.

759
00:47:10,231 --> 00:47:13,472
Yes. I knew the situation
you were in,

760
00:47:14,202 --> 00:47:16,401
and tried to understand
because I couldn't help.

761
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:17,412
But...

762
00:47:18,742 --> 00:47:20,341
however crazy you are about money,

763
00:47:22,781 --> 00:47:24,151
there are things you shouldn't do.

764
00:47:27,481 --> 00:47:28,522
Pil Seung.

765
00:47:28,881 --> 00:47:31,122
How much were you offered
that you did something like that?

766
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:33,762
Why do you live like this?

767
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:37,031
What kind of life
did you lead so far?

768
00:47:43,262 --> 00:47:44,272
Forget it.

769
00:47:45,602 --> 00:47:47,542
Why should I care how you live?

770
00:47:49,372 --> 00:47:50,571
Do whatever you want.

771
00:47:51,042 --> 00:47:52,142
But...

772
00:47:53,611 --> 00:47:55,042
don't show yourself again.

773
00:49:03,142 --> 00:49:05,182
Dad. Don't die.

774
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:07,651
You won't die, will you?

775
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:09,921
Do Ra.

776
00:49:11,452 --> 00:49:12,821
Later on,

777
00:49:14,522 --> 00:49:16,321
we'll meet again.

778
00:49:17,191 --> 00:49:18,932
Later when?

779
00:49:20,602 --> 00:49:23,432
Don't die, Dad. Don't die.

780
00:49:23,432 --> 00:49:24,432
Do Ra.

781
00:49:26,272 --> 00:49:27,972
Can you do something for me?

782
00:49:30,272 --> 00:49:31,671
Do what?

783
00:49:32,171 --> 00:49:33,441
Your mom,

784
00:49:34,341 --> 00:49:36,182
Do Sik, and Do Jun.

785
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:40,582
Look after them for me.

786
00:49:42,452 --> 00:49:43,952
Dad.

787
00:49:45,892 --> 00:49:47,022
Dad.

788
00:49:47,492 --> 00:49:48,722
I'm asking...

789
00:49:50,691 --> 00:49:52,662
something so big...

790
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:54,961
from such a young girl.

791
00:49:58,631 --> 00:49:59,702
I'm sorry for that.

792
00:50:01,472 --> 00:50:03,341
No. It's okay.

793
00:50:03,841 --> 00:50:05,042
It's okay, Dad.

794
00:50:05,242 --> 00:50:07,312
Don't worry at all.

795
00:50:15,122 --> 00:50:16,151
Dad.

796
00:50:18,651 --> 00:50:19,751
Dad.

797
00:50:20,722 --> 00:50:21,762
Dad.

798
00:50:22,262 --> 00:50:24,091
Dad. No.

799
00:50:24,461 --> 00:50:26,762
Take me with you!

800
00:50:26,762 --> 00:50:29,531
- Dad. No.
- No!

801
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:31,131
- Wake up.
- Step aside.

802
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:32,501
- Help my dad!
- Let us through.

803
00:50:32,501 --> 00:50:34,702
- Dad.
- We'll do CPR.

804
00:50:34,702 --> 00:50:35,742
Dad.

805
00:50:43,481 --> 00:50:44,512
Dad.

806
00:50:48,981 --> 00:50:50,691
I did the best I could.

807
00:50:52,892 --> 00:50:54,321
You know that, don't you?

808
00:50:58,731 --> 00:51:01,602
I tried to be the good girl
you asked me to be.

809
00:51:04,972 --> 00:51:06,372
You know that, right?

810
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:15,042
But the whole world says
I didn't do that.

811
00:51:18,981 --> 00:51:20,421
They call me dirty.

812
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:23,122
They don't like me.

813
00:51:27,321 --> 00:51:28,392
Dad.

814
00:51:31,731 --> 00:51:33,131
I don't think...

815
00:51:36,231 --> 00:51:39,702
I can go on living as Park Do Ra.

816
00:51:43,242 --> 00:51:44,472
Dad.

817
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:49,481
Dad, I...

818
00:51:53,082 --> 00:51:56,751
I don't have the hope to go on now.

819
00:52:02,191 --> 00:52:04,861
You still understand,
don't you, Dad?

820
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:10,372
Dad.

821
00:52:17,142 --> 00:52:18,441
Dad...

822
00:52:38,631 --> 00:52:39,691
Do Sik.

823
00:52:40,631 --> 00:52:42,762
I'll go to be with Dad.

824
00:52:43,932 --> 00:52:45,531
Take good care of Do Jun.

825
00:52:47,202 --> 00:52:49,501
Do Ra, what are you saying?

826
00:52:49,671 --> 00:52:51,171
Mom.

827
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:53,812
Mom! Wake up.

828
00:52:53,812 --> 00:52:56,512
Mom...

829
00:52:56,512 --> 00:52:58,452
Oh, gosh. What?

830
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:13,262
I shouldn't get the wrong idea?

831
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:16,401
About what?

832
00:53:18,671 --> 00:53:19,932
What a joke.

833
00:53:21,671 --> 00:53:22,872
That's stupid.

834
00:53:28,781 --> 00:53:30,182
Does she think so little of me?

835
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:35,321
Why did she come over?

836
00:53:48,832 --> 00:53:51,171

837
00:54:31,671 --> 00:54:33,441

but I don't want you
to get the wrong idea about me.

842
00:55:37,441 --> 00:55:40,042
Hey. I'm glad you're here.

843
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:41,812
Call Do Ra's manager.

844
00:55:41,981 --> 00:55:43,981
Tell him to get her to call me.

845
00:55:44,111 --> 00:55:45,452
She won't take my calls,

846
00:55:45,452 --> 00:55:46,751
and she isn't reading her texts.

847
00:55:48,022 --> 00:55:49,222
Why do you want to talk to her?

848
00:55:49,222 --> 00:55:51,821
I think someone
set this whole thing up...

849
00:55:51,992 --> 00:55:54,961
with the purpose
of bringing her down.

850
00:55:56,321 --> 00:55:58,231
What do you mean?

851
00:55:58,531 --> 00:56:00,332
About that guy she met at the hotel.

852
00:56:00,631 --> 00:56:02,631
I heard something
from a director I know.

853
00:56:02,631 --> 00:56:03,901
Apparently,
he's a reenactment actor.

854
00:56:04,301 --> 00:56:05,571
He was pretty sure...

855
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,472
that he used to work with the guy.

856
00:56:08,441 --> 00:56:09,472
Is that true?

857
00:56:09,472 --> 00:56:10,472
Yes.

858
00:56:10,472 --> 00:56:12,441
So I asked Reporter Kim Chul Soo...

859
00:56:12,441 --> 00:56:13,642
to look into it.

860
00:56:13,642 --> 00:56:15,812
I want to tell Do Ra about all this,

861
00:56:15,812 --> 00:56:17,352
but I can't reach her.

862
00:56:17,852 --> 00:56:20,751
Gosh, something doesn't feel right.

863
00:56:20,852 --> 00:56:24,722
I'm just afraid
Do Ra might end up...

864
00:56:24,722 --> 00:56:25,852
making a wrong choice.

865
00:56:26,691 --> 00:56:28,762
Gosh, whatever.

866
00:56:29,622 --> 00:56:30,762
Oh, dear.

867
00:56:39,702 --> 00:56:40,702
Pil Seung,

868
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:44,412
I lied about having feelings
for you. It was all a lie.

869
00:56:45,472 --> 00:56:47,841
I played around with you
out of boredom,

870
00:56:48,642 --> 00:56:50,481
so forget about this cruel witch.

871
00:56:51,452 --> 00:56:52,582
I wish you happiness, Pil Seung.

872
00:56:54,082 --> 00:56:55,082
What...

873
00:56:56,452 --> 00:56:59,492
What is this supposed to mean?

874
00:57:06,662 --> 00:57:08,832
The phone is turned off.

875
00:57:08,832 --> 00:57:12,031
Please leave a message
after the tone.

876
00:57:12,472 --> 00:57:13,832
After the tone...

877
00:57:15,202 --> 00:57:18,242
Jae Dong, how long
has Do Ra been out of touch?

878
00:57:18,711 --> 00:57:21,142
She sent me a strange message,
but I couldn't reach her.

879
00:57:21,142 --> 00:57:24,012
So our vice president
reported her missing.

880
00:57:25,381 --> 00:57:28,421
Jae Dong, if you hear from Do Ra,

881
00:57:28,421 --> 00:57:30,122
make sure to call me.

00:58:21,242 --> 00:58:22,472
It is true.

894
00:58:22,501 --> 00:58:26,312
She was caught on CCTV
when she jumped into the sea.

895
00:58:26,312 --> 00:58:27,542
And her suicide note has been found.

896
00:58:30,481 --> 00:58:31,551
What?

897
00:58:32,012 --> 00:58:33,812
Her body hasn't been found yet.

898
00:58:33,812 --> 00:58:35,881
They stopped searching for her
because of a high seas watch.

899
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:41,062
If her body hasn't been discovered,
that means she could be alive.

900
00:58:42,292 --> 00:58:44,591
But why are they
reporting her death?

901
00:58:47,602 --> 00:58:48,662
No.

902
00:58:49,602 --> 00:58:50,772
Do Ra isn't dead.

903
00:58:52,131 --> 00:58:53,171
She's not dead.

904
00:58:54,742 --> 00:58:56,301
There's no way she's dead.

905
00:59:02,711 --> 00:59:04,042
Do Ra!

906
00:59:07,251 --> 00:59:08,421
Do Ra!

907
00:59:12,522 --> 00:59:13,551
Do Ra.

908
00:59:16,691 --> 00:59:18,731
Stop kidding around and show up.

909
00:59:22,102 --> 00:59:23,762
I believe you.

910
00:59:25,772 --> 00:59:28,441
Even if no one in this world
doesn't believe you,

911
00:59:30,772 --> 00:59:32,412
I do believe you.

912
00:59:35,012 --> 00:59:36,682
So come back.

913
00:59:39,651 --> 00:59:40,751
I'm sorry.

914
00:59:42,651 --> 00:59:44,122
It's all my fault.

915
00:59:46,392 --> 00:59:48,622
I didn't mean what I said.

916
00:59:51,691 --> 00:59:53,961
So please come back now.

917
00:59:56,702 --> 00:59:57,972
Do Ra!

918
01:00:00,432 --> 01:00:02,202
Do Ra!

919
01:00:03,272 --> 01:00:04,611
Please.

920
01:00:06,772 --> 01:00:09,242
Please come back!

921
01:00:12,251 --> 01:00:14,151
Do Ra!

922
01:00:19,051 --> 01:00:22,222
Park Do Ra!

923
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:27,262
Do Ra...

924
01:01:16,281 --> 01:01:18,412
Are you making dumplings?

925
01:01:19,111 --> 01:01:20,111
Yes.

926
01:01:20,611 --> 01:01:22,722
Pil Seung is not eating anything.

927
01:01:22,722 --> 01:01:25,892
I see. We should make dumplings
so he can eat something.

928
01:01:25,892 --> 01:01:28,262
Otherwise, he might
end up passing out.

929
01:01:28,792 --> 01:01:31,492
Though it's for Pil Seung,
we can also eat some dumplings.

930
01:01:31,591 --> 01:01:32,961
You should help.

931
01:01:35,102 --> 01:01:36,432
By the way,

932
01:01:36,432 --> 01:01:39,472
I'm glad that she died
after she broke up with Pil Seung.

933
01:01:39,472 --> 01:01:41,071
It would've been horrible...

934
01:01:41,071 --> 01:01:42,401
if she died while they were dating.

935
01:01:43,042 --> 01:01:46,671
I must say that darn lady
brought the punishment on herself.

936
01:01:47,781 --> 01:01:50,012
After losing her precious child,

937
01:01:50,441 --> 01:01:53,312
I wonder if she can possibly
swallow any food.

938
01:01:54,682 --> 01:01:57,952
And about the sponsor thing.

939
01:01:58,051 --> 01:02:00,792
I'm sure that was her mom's doing.

940
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:02,022
Because of her gambling debt.

941
01:02:02,961 --> 01:02:05,531
I understand the situation
they were in was tough,

942
01:02:05,531 --> 01:02:07,731
but how could she make
her child do such a thing?

943
01:02:07,731 --> 01:02:09,731
Please stop talking about it,
Mother.

944
01:02:09,861 --> 01:02:11,631
Pil Seung might hear you.

945
01:02:12,202 --> 01:02:13,202
All right.

946
01:02:16,071 --> 01:02:18,171
The guy she met at the hotel.

947
01:02:18,171 --> 01:02:20,171
I heard something
from a director I know.

948
01:02:20,171 --> 01:02:21,312
Apparently,
he's a reenactment actor.

949
01:02:21,841 --> 01:02:23,082
He was pretty sure...

950
01:02:23,082 --> 01:02:25,012
that he used to work with the guy.

951
01:02:38,631 --> 01:02:39,932
What's the deal with you?

952
01:02:40,861 --> 01:02:43,432
What made you do such a thing?

953
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:45,801
A woman killed herself
because of you.

954
01:02:46,202 --> 01:02:48,742
She was faced
with disgraceful death.

955
01:02:49,772 --> 01:02:51,312
Though it's too late,
you have to reveal the truth.

956
01:02:51,472 --> 01:02:53,272
Tell people what you've done!

957
01:02:54,611 --> 01:02:57,111
I just did as I was told
to get paid!

958
01:03:01,481 --> 01:03:04,222
I was told
I'd get 2,000 dollars a day.

959
01:03:05,651 --> 01:03:09,022
I just did it as a part-time job.

960
01:03:12,031 --> 01:03:13,461
Who made you do that?

961
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:25,042
Oh, dear.

962
01:03:25,111 --> 01:03:29,082
I wonder
when Ji Young is coming back.

963
01:03:29,711 --> 01:03:32,852
Does she not know
that her grandma is waiting here?

964
01:03:33,711 --> 01:03:38,352
Where is she
and what is she doing now?

965
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,292
Ji Young.

966
01:03:42,191 --> 01:03:43,392
Ji Young.

967
01:03:44,122 --> 01:03:48,031
My dear baby. Ji Young!

968
01:03:48,731 --> 01:03:50,062
Oh, dear.

969
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:58,312
My goodness. What's that?

970
01:04:00,972 --> 01:04:02,012
Is that...

971
01:04:02,812 --> 01:04:05,111
Is that my Ji Young?

972
01:04:05,111 --> 01:04:07,452
Ji Young!

973
01:04:07,611 --> 01:04:10,551
Oh, dear. Ji Young!

974
01:04:12,651 --> 01:04:15,361
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

975
01:04:47,722 --> 01:04:49,722
This is just wrong.

976
01:04:49,821 --> 01:04:52,662
How can I live with you gone?

977
01:04:53,792 --> 01:04:56,262
Put your hand on your heart
and ask yourself...

978
01:04:56,262 --> 01:04:59,202
why I'm wandering around here
to haunt you.

979
01:04:59,231 --> 01:05:01,772
I'm Do Ra. Park Do Ra.

980
01:05:01,941 --> 01:05:04,542
Do Ra was killed by the whole world.

981
01:05:04,742 --> 01:05:08,082
People in this world
drove her over the edge.

982
01:05:08,211 --> 01:05:10,341
After Do Ra died,

983
01:05:10,341 --> 01:05:12,481
Pil Seung buried himself
in his work like crazy.

984
01:05:12,481 --> 01:05:14,151
And he's finally made
something of himself.

985
01:05:14,481 --> 01:05:15,481
Do Ra.

986
01:05:16,321 --> 01:05:17,352
Are you all right?

987
01:05:17,952 --> 01:05:19,122
Are you doing well?

988
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:24,289
