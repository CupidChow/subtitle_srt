1
00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:07,492
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:13,408 --> 00:00:14,448
Do Ra!

3
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:17,377
Are you all right?

4
00:00:17,647 --> 00:00:19,778
What's going on? Is something up?

5
00:00:20,078 --> 00:00:21,348
- It's nothing.
- It's nothing.

6
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:24,187
Why did you choose
a cold day to film?

7
00:00:24,187 --> 00:00:25,487
Do something about this weather.

8
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,057
Hey, I'm fine. Get going.

9
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:31,557
- I'll talk to him and catch up.
- Sure.

10
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:32,958
- I'll get going.
- I'm fine.

11
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:42,567
Unbelievable. This darn twig...

12
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:44,438
almost had me crossing
to the underworld.

13
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:47,847
It's dangerous to run in the woods.

14
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:49,877
Why do you think they say
we should be humble...

15
00:00:50,078 --> 00:00:51,118
when we're out in the woods?

16
00:00:53,618 --> 00:00:54,648
Right.

17
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:57,817
Anyway, thanks.

18
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:01,788
You saved me yet again.

19
00:01:03,427 --> 00:01:06,527
What was it you wanted to ask
for you to run like that?

20
00:01:06,698 --> 00:01:08,868
Oh, that. Right.

21
00:01:09,497 --> 00:01:11,637
Your family name is Ko.

22
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:13,538
You're Assistant Director
Ko Pil Seung.

23
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:16,607
Do you have a relative
called Ko Dae Chung?

24
00:01:22,448 --> 00:01:23,478
What?

25
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:28,788
"Ko Dae Chung?" Why?

26
00:01:28,848 --> 00:01:32,318
Ko Dae Chung was a guy I knew
when I was a kid.

27
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:35,887
For some strange reason,
I think of him when I see you.

28
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:39,758
You have the same surname,
and you both have curly hair.

29
00:01:40,258 --> 00:01:41,898
So I wondered if you were related.

30
00:01:46,137 --> 00:01:49,907
No relative of mine has that name.

31
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:55,747
What kind of a name is Ko Dae Chung?
That's hilarious.

32
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,878
Was he named that
so he'd take life easy?

33
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:05,088
Sorry. I've never,
not even once, met anyone...

34
00:02:05,088 --> 00:02:06,618
with that name.

35
00:02:09,887 --> 00:02:10,887
I guess,

36
00:02:11,228 --> 00:02:13,758
having the same surname
doesn't mean everyone is related.

37
00:02:14,628 --> 00:02:17,667
That's right.
There are so many Kos out there.

38
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:20,667
So,

39
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:23,468
I guess that guy was
that memorable...

40
00:02:23,737 --> 00:02:25,008
if you keep thinking of him.

41
00:02:28,207 --> 00:02:31,278
The truth is, he followed me around
saying he had a crush on me.

42
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:34,147
What?

43
00:02:34,448 --> 00:02:36,147
I'm his first love.

44
00:02:36,517 --> 00:02:39,818
In school, he insisted on giving me
a ride on his bike...

45
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:41,887
and followed me around
to buy me tteokbokki.

46
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:45,857
Anyway, that's what he did.

47
00:02:47,128 --> 00:02:50,198
Right. I see.

48
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,607
From now on,
don't think of him when you see me.

49
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:55,867
I don't know him at all.

50
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:57,867
And walk slowly.

51
00:02:58,038 --> 00:03:00,038
I have to set things up
for the shoot.

52
00:03:04,848 --> 00:03:05,848
Right.

53
00:03:06,278 --> 00:03:08,448
Dae Chung won't have relatives
that look like him.

54
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,147
He wasn't Ms. Kim's biological son.

55
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:18,327
But why am I
reminded of Dae Chung...

56
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:20,897
whenever I see
the Curly-haired Assistant Director?

57
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,098
I don't get it.

58
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:28,408
Do I miss him?

59
00:03:31,538 --> 00:03:32,837
No way.

60
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:35,448
I'm losing my mind.

61
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:37,478
That's just stupid.

62
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:40,917
My heart almost dropped.

63
00:03:42,748 --> 00:03:43,848
Did Park Do Ra...

64
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:46,658
ask me that knowing I was Dae Chung?

65
00:03:47,617 --> 00:03:49,327
No, it didn't seem like it.

66
00:03:50,457 --> 00:03:52,397
It's the darned curly hair.

67
00:03:52,758 --> 00:03:53,897
Should I get it straightened?

68
00:03:54,698 --> 00:03:56,767
No. She might suspect something.

69
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,397
I said it wasn't me.
She'll take my word for it.

70
00:04:03,737 --> 00:04:04,808
Wait.

71
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:07,508
When did I follow her around?

72
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,107
She had a crush on me,
and she followed me around.

73
00:04:11,448 --> 00:04:12,878
This is unbelievable.

74
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:16,848
When the stuntwoman comes this way,
you go up that way.

75
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:19,517
Do Ra,
check the stuntwoman's last pose.

76
00:04:19,517 --> 00:04:21,728
- Okay.
- That will be your starting pose.

77
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,857
- I'll check.
- Okay.

78
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:25,258
Director, I have bad news.

79
00:04:25,657 --> 00:04:27,558
The stuntwoman
was in a fender-bender.

80
00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:29,168
What?

81
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:31,438
It wasn't a serious accident,

82
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,868
but she fractured a rib or something
and couldn't move.

83
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:35,668
She called to say she was on her way
to the hospital and couldn't come.

84
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:39,837
We're already way behind schedule.

85
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:41,647
This is terrible.

86
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:44,977
Director. I'll do it myself.

87
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,448
You can't.

88
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:53,587
I mean...

89
00:04:53,717 --> 00:04:56,157
It's too dangerous
for her to do it herself.

90
00:04:56,657 --> 00:04:58,157
Yes, it is.

91
00:04:58,628 --> 00:05:01,698
We can't ask an actress
to roll down a dirty slope.

92
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:03,467
It will be worse if you get hurt too.

93
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:05,837
We'll look for another solution.

94
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,207
Don't you worry, Ms. Park.
Take a break.

95
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:09,767
Another solution?

96
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:12,308
If we don't have a stuntwoman,
one of us can do it.

97
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:17,048
Me?

98
00:05:18,178 --> 00:05:19,318
You want me to do it?

99
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:21,147
You have boot camp experience.

100
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:22,517
Who else can do it?

101
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:26,188
Right.

102
00:05:26,758 --> 00:05:29,287
Of course, it should be me.
I'll do it.

103
00:05:30,827 --> 00:05:32,157
Are you serious?

104
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:34,227
Wardrobe Team!
Do you have extra clothes?

105
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:46,837
- What the heck?
- Let's see.

106
00:05:48,077 --> 00:05:49,477
You look pretty good.

107
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:51,948
- Great. Let's do it.
- Wait.

108
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:53,717
Mr. Ko.

109
00:05:54,277 --> 00:05:55,587
Maybe I should just do it.

110
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:56,918
No, it's fine.

111
00:05:58,048 --> 00:05:59,387
I'll do it.

112
00:06:00,758 --> 00:06:02,258
Do your best, Pil Seung.

113
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:03,657
Action!

114
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:08,827
Cut! We can't use it.

115
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,298
Pil Seung!

116
00:06:10,597 --> 00:06:13,438
It might feel weird,
but run more femininely.

117
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,568
Try it again!

118
00:06:26,217 --> 00:06:27,748
Cut! No way.

119
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,748
Do something about the wig.

120
00:06:34,157 --> 00:06:35,558
Oh, no.

121
00:06:35,758 --> 00:06:37,087
Cameras rolling and action!

122
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:39,498
Cut! Not good enough.

123
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:41,897
Hey, wait for my cue!

124
00:06:41,897 --> 00:06:44,168
Cut! You rolled four times!

125
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:45,798
Five times!

126
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:47,798
Five times!

127
00:06:50,738 --> 00:06:52,678
Hye Soo!

128
00:06:52,837 --> 00:06:54,537
Cut. No good.

129
00:06:54,878 --> 00:06:56,878
We saw too much of your face.

130
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:02,818
Hye Soo!

131
00:07:03,618 --> 00:07:04,748
- Hye Soo.
- No good!

132
00:07:05,787 --> 00:07:06,787
Pil Seung.

133
00:07:07,118 --> 00:07:08,887
Roll five times!

134
00:07:09,327 --> 00:07:11,287
- It seems just fine.
- Cameras, action!

135
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:18,798
Hye Soo!

136
00:07:18,798 --> 00:07:20,568
- Cut, okay! That's it!
- My gosh.

137
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:22,907
Get my jacket!

138
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:25,238
Darn it.

139
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:29,707
This is killing me.

140
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:30,847
Good job.

141
00:07:31,448 --> 00:07:32,448
Next scene!

142
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:40,957
Your legs.

143
00:07:49,397 --> 00:07:50,397
My gosh.

144
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,668
You can't run away again.

145
00:07:52,668 --> 00:07:54,168
Will you let go of me?

146
00:07:54,198 --> 00:07:55,308
No way.

147
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,537
So you can run off like you did
at the department store?

148
00:07:59,137 --> 00:08:01,977
You must know
you did something dreadfully wrong.

149
00:08:01,977 --> 00:08:03,707
What did I do wrong? I never ran off.

150
00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:05,448
Why are you doing this to me?

151
00:08:05,448 --> 00:08:08,077
Forget the excuses.
Hand over the money.

152
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:11,618
The money you took from Mr. Kim
by seducing him.

153
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,418
Hand it over with interest
for the past 15 years.

154
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:17,827
Are you out of your mind?
Who seduced whom?

155
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:19,928
How dare you say such a thing?

156
00:08:20,058 --> 00:08:22,897
I hear your daughter is
very popular now.

157
00:08:22,897 --> 00:08:24,938
She's in TV dramas and commercials.

158
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:27,438
She's raking in
all the money there is.

159
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:29,467
And yet you never paid us back.

160
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:31,207
How could you?

161
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:35,508
So, 30,000 dollars in those days
is about 50,000 dollars now.

162
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:38,878
If we count the interest,
you owe us over 100,000 dollars.

163
00:08:39,717 --> 00:08:41,888
What? 100,000 dollars?

164
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,457
Lady. Do you think that much money
just falls out of the sky?

165
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:49,087
And the money Mr. Kim gave me then,

166
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:51,388
he gave it to me
with no strings attached.

167
00:08:51,388 --> 00:08:52,727
It was a gift.

168
00:08:52,997 --> 00:08:56,327
Are you the old man's wife
or something?

169
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,898
Who are you to demand I pay you back?

170
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:02,668
From now on,
don't come looking for me again.

171
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:05,877
If you do, I'll take action, okay?

172
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:07,308
Fine!

173
00:09:07,707 --> 00:09:09,247
I'll just go
to the broadcasting station, then.

174
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:13,577
I'll tell everyone Park Do Ra's mom
took our money and ran.

175
00:09:14,617 --> 00:09:15,747
What?

176
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:18,658
That Park Do Ra's mom
seduced my daughter-in-law's dad...

177
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,087
and took his money.

178
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:22,757
Because of Park Do Ra's mom,
the poor old man died.

179
00:09:22,757 --> 00:09:25,428
I'll go and tell everyone!

180
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:27,627
My gosh. You mad woman.

181
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:30,727
What the heck? You're insane.

182
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,038
Goodness.

183
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:38,007
Oh, gosh.

184
00:09:42,678 --> 00:09:44,408
- Hyun Chul.
- Mom. I'm heading out.

185
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:46,148
- Where are you going?
- What?

186
00:09:46,347 --> 00:09:50,487
You don't go out on a motorcycle...

187
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:52,288
to deliver stuff, do you?

188
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:54,918
Don't do that, okay?

189
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:58,928
If you go out on a motorcycle,
which is so dangerous,

190
00:09:58,928 --> 00:10:00,827
I really can't stand it.

191
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:02,898
I'd rather starve
than make you do that.

192
00:10:03,127 --> 00:10:05,768
Okay. I'm just meeting someone
in the neighborhood.

193
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:07,398
- See you.
- Hyun Chul.

194
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,438
What?

195
00:10:09,107 --> 00:10:10,308
Be patient.

196
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:14,207
I'll get you some money
to start the business.

197
00:10:14,877 --> 00:10:16,347
Maybe not 200,000 dollars,

198
00:10:16,377 --> 00:10:19,077
but I'm sure I can
get 100,000 dollars somehow.

199
00:10:20,678 --> 00:10:21,688
You, get 100,000 dollars?

200
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:23,847
How would you do that?

201
00:10:24,648 --> 00:10:26,888
- See you later.
- Come on.

202
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:30,428
Just you wait.
I'll get you the money.

203
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:34,857
So don't feel intimidated
or shy, okay?

204
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:37,367
Okay, sure. I won't.

205
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:38,898
A hundred grand?

206
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:40,438
See you later.

207
00:10:48,808 --> 00:10:51,107
When the geotjeori's done,
make some green onion kimchi too.

208
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:53,318
We sold out already.

209
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:56,347
Already? Okay.

210
00:10:56,987 --> 00:10:59,558
Everyone's talking about
how great your kimchi is.

211
00:11:00,318 --> 00:11:01,757
I'm glad to hear that.

212
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:05,757
Ms. Jang, Mr. Kang is here.

213
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:08,928
I was going to drive myself.

214
00:11:09,898 --> 00:11:11,867
- Okay. I'll see you later.
- Yes.

215
00:11:11,867 --> 00:11:12,898
Oh, right.

216
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:15,237
Does the soy sauce
marinated crab taste good?

217
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:16,367
Yes.

218
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:18,607
It's perfectly seasoned.
They will love it.

219
00:11:18,607 --> 00:11:19,638
Please don't worry.

220
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,377
Are you going to the airport now?

221
00:11:23,107 --> 00:11:24,278
I'm coming with you.

222
00:11:25,577 --> 00:11:27,617
I don't mind going alone.

223
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:29,648
You don't have to come.

224
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,688
I'm not
in Auntie's good books already.

225
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:33,857
Not going to the airport
will only make it worse.

226
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:36,058
You must be happy...

227
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:38,158
that you put yourself
in her good books.

228
00:11:56,178 --> 00:11:57,178
Honey.

229
00:11:58,077 --> 00:11:59,477
Isn't Auntie out yet?

230
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:02,617
Why are you here?
You have a meeting to attend.

231
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,888
I canceled it.

232
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:06,018
Auntie is coming to visit
after a long time,

233
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,818
so I can't concentrate on my work.

234
00:12:08,257 --> 00:12:09,388
Look at you.

235
00:12:10,158 --> 00:12:11,798
Are you happy that she's coming?

236
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:14,398
You look like a little kid
waiting for his mom.

237
00:12:15,327 --> 00:12:16,327
Do I?

238
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:19,367
There she is.

239
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:21,467
Auntie.

240
00:12:21,837 --> 00:12:24,367
Hey, Jin Taek.

241
00:12:25,707 --> 00:12:26,737
My gosh.

242
00:12:26,737 --> 00:12:28,377
You must be exhausted
after a long flight.

243
00:12:28,377 --> 00:12:29,877
It wasn't so bad.

244
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:32,877
And now that I see you,
I'm feeling a lot better.

245
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:33,948
You are?

246
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:37,717
Look at you, Jin Taek.
You haven't changed at all.

247
00:12:37,717 --> 00:12:39,658
And you haven't changed either.

248
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,518
Actually, you've got younger
since I saw you last.

249
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:43,587
I know you're lying.

250
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:45,658
I'm serious, Auntie.

251
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:48,257
To me, you always look the same.

252
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,227
Thank you for saying that.

253
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:52,737
Auntie.

254
00:12:52,798 --> 00:12:54,737
Thank you for coming
all the way here.

255
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:58,237
Hey, Soo Yeon.
I didn't know you were here.

256
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,308
Have you been doing well?

257
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:00,607
Yes, Auntie.

258
00:13:01,237 --> 00:13:03,077
I'm so glad that you look well.

259
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:04,948
Hello.

260
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:08,048
Hey, Ae Kyo. You're here too.

261
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,747
Why did you all come here
when you were so busy?

262
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:15,058
I had to come to meet you
no matter how busy I was.

263
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,587
- Thank you...
- Let's go, Auntie.

264
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,757
Okay. Let's go, Jin Taek.

265
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,698
- Come here, Soo Yeon.
- Okay.

266
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,398
- It's so good to see you.
- All right.

267
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:29,607
They look so happy without me.

268
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:33,507
I understand
how Auntie and Chairman Gong are feeling.

269
00:13:34,308 --> 00:13:36,247
But how could that brat Soo Yeon
be doing this to me?

270
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:40,418
Would it kill her to turn around
and tell me to join them?

271
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,388
That darn brat.

272
00:13:43,117 --> 00:13:45,717
They are treating me
like a third wheel.

273
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:52,028
- Do you like the soup?
- Yes, it's refreshing.

274
00:13:52,357 --> 00:13:54,127
You're back after a long time.

275
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:56,398
Just make yourself at home
and stay as long as you like.

276
00:13:56,398 --> 00:13:58,168
You should meet your friends too.

277
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:01,097
Okay. That's my plan.

278
00:14:01,097 --> 00:14:02,808
I have some business to take care of.

279
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,337
I'll stay long
spending a lot of time with you.

280
00:14:05,337 --> 00:14:06,638
Do you really mean that?

281
00:14:07,207 --> 00:14:09,448
I don't want you to leave soon
just like you did the last time.

282
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,847
You promised me.

283
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:12,877
Okay. I get it.

284
00:14:14,117 --> 00:14:16,388
I'm just happy and comfortable
to be around my family...

285
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:17,918
after a long time,

286
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:19,888
but Soo Yeon,

287
00:14:19,888 --> 00:14:22,487
you must be feeling uncomfortable
because of me.

288
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,257
That's not true, Auntie.

289
00:14:24,788 --> 00:14:27,127
I'll take good care of you
while you're staying with us.

290
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,298
Please make yourself at home.

291
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,398
Okay. Thanks.

292
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:33,967
Oh, right.

293
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:36,438
Jin Dan, I heard you worked
at Angel Investments.

294
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:37,967
Is everything going well?

295
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:39,808
Yes. I'm working hard.

296
00:14:40,038 --> 00:14:42,548
Working hard isn't enough
to run an investment company.

297
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,007
You should be competent.

298
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:45,617
You shouldn't be distracted
from your work.

299
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:48,247
I believe
you're already well aware of that.

300
00:14:48,717 --> 00:14:49,818
Of course.

301
00:14:50,318 --> 00:14:52,288
He's doing things very well.

302
00:14:52,288 --> 00:14:54,418
All he cares about is the company.

303
00:14:54,418 --> 00:14:55,587
Of course, he should.

304
00:14:55,987 --> 00:14:59,158
You know how hard my brother worked
to grow APP Group.

305
00:14:59,257 --> 00:15:00,398
He should do well.

306
00:15:01,257 --> 00:15:02,698
Though I live in the States,

307
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:04,698
my heart always stays here.

308
00:15:05,497 --> 00:15:08,707
Whenever I think of the company
that my brother devoted himself to...

309
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,367
and the future of the Gong family,

310
00:15:11,507 --> 00:15:12,977
I can't fall asleep.

311
00:15:13,107 --> 00:15:14,178
Great Auntie.

312
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:16,577
You know
our company and our family...

313
00:15:16,577 --> 00:15:17,847
have me.

314
00:15:17,847 --> 00:15:20,617
So you should sleep well
without worrying about them.

315
00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:23,587
Insomnia isn't good for your health.

316
00:15:25,247 --> 00:15:27,058
Okay, Ma Ri.

317
00:15:27,518 --> 00:15:30,457
I wonder what lucky man
will marry our sweet Ma Ri.

318
00:15:30,457 --> 00:15:33,658
I hope he's like a handsome prince.

319
00:15:34,398 --> 00:15:36,827
I'm an independent woman,

320
00:15:36,827 --> 00:15:39,198
so I'm not waiting
for a prince to find me.

321
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:40,497
I will find my prince...

322
00:15:40,497 --> 00:15:43,007
and bring him here myself.

323
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:45,837
You know what?

324
00:15:45,837 --> 00:15:48,707
The dried croaker aged in barley
tastes really good.

325
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:50,648
You like the dried croaker, right?

326
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:52,448
- Here.
- No, I want you to eat it.

327
00:15:52,448 --> 00:15:54,018
You should eat a lot.

328
00:15:54,018 --> 00:15:56,318
My gosh. All right. Let's eat.

329
00:15:56,318 --> 00:15:57,418
Okay.

330
00:15:58,987 --> 00:16:00,288
Here. Have some.

331
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:17,908
What's that?

332
00:16:18,168 --> 00:16:19,207
Sikhye.

333
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,607
It's nice and cold.
It will help your digestion.

334
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:26,577
I felt so uncomfortable
during the meal.

335
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,747
I took digestive medicine,
but it's not helping.

336
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:31,987
It feels like something stuck here.

337
00:16:33,388 --> 00:16:36,528
I guess your old auntie is
going to stay for long.

338
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:38,957
This is driving me crazy.

339
00:16:40,528 --> 00:16:42,727
You should eat alone
while Auntie is staying.

340
00:16:43,428 --> 00:16:44,798
And try to avoid her
as much as you can.

341
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:47,837
Jin Dan.

342
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:51,068
You should focus on your work
while she stays here.

343
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:52,737
Make sure
not to get on the wrong side of her.

344
00:16:52,737 --> 00:16:55,077
You know how obedient
your brother is to her.

345
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:58,048
So just lay low until she leaves.

346
00:16:59,747 --> 00:17:00,778
Okay.

347
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:03,617
You don't need to tell me
what to do.

348
00:17:05,418 --> 00:17:07,487
How much longer
do we have to live like this?

349
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:12,658
I would've stopped putting up
with all this and moved out...

350
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:14,527
if it weren't for Angel Investments.

351
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:19,037
I'm sorry, Jin Dan.

352
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:21,567
That you were born as my son.

353
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:26,408
Mom.

354
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:28,977
Do you want
to move out of this house?

355
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:31,948
If you're okay with it,

356
00:17:31,948 --> 00:17:33,618
I can give up
on everything right away.

357
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:35,888
No, I don't want to.

358
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,688
Why would you give up on everything?
Are you crazy?

359
00:17:41,257 --> 00:17:42,257
I knew it.

360
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:45,227
Don't worry, Mom.

361
00:17:45,928 --> 00:17:48,158
I will never let them
take what I deserve from me.

362
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,727
I don't mind what I'm going through.

363
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:53,497
So don't ever say
that you'll give up on everything.

364
00:17:53,598 --> 00:17:54,638
Okay?

365
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:56,108
I understand.

366
00:17:58,168 --> 00:18:00,807
What makes me the happiest is...

367
00:18:00,807 --> 00:18:02,277
that I was born as your son.

368
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:04,777
That's my son.

369
00:18:04,777 --> 00:18:07,418
No wonder
why women are crazy about you.

370
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:10,148
My sweet son.

371
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:25,428
That Park Do Ra's mom
seduced my daughter-in-law's dad...

372
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:26,767
and took his money.

373
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:29,537
Because of Park Do Ra's mom,
the poor old man died.

374
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:33,207
I'll go and tell everyone!

375
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:38,578
Mom, is something wrong?

376
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:40,317
You aren't you eating?

377
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:42,888
What? Nothing's wrong.

378
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,918
I don't feel like eating
because I've been snacking.

379
00:18:46,588 --> 00:18:49,688
What's with Jeon Baek Jo?

380
00:18:49,688 --> 00:18:51,088
There's an article
about her unsettled debt.

381
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,828
Her debt? Really?

382
00:18:52,828 --> 00:18:54,098
Yes. Goodness.

383
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:55,727
She borrowed 50,000 dollars
before her debut.

384
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:57,328
Why did she not pay it back?

385
00:18:58,227 --> 00:19:00,537
It was reported
when her career just took off.

386
00:19:01,138 --> 00:19:03,967
She's done for good.

387
00:19:04,037 --> 00:19:06,638
Why would she let
such petty money ruin her career?

388
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:09,108
Mom.

389
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:12,418
We don't have
any unsettled debts, do we?

390
00:19:12,977 --> 00:19:15,247
Of course not.

391
00:19:15,247 --> 00:19:17,987
It would've been a mess
if we had anything like that.

392
00:19:18,317 --> 00:19:19,317
I guess you're right.

393
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:23,358
What?

394
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:29,767
Why aren't you saying anything?

395
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:32,438
Do you want me to go
to the broadcasting station tomorrow?

396
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,838
You know what?

397
00:19:35,497 --> 00:19:37,668
I've been snacking all day,
so I have no appetite.

398
00:19:37,668 --> 00:19:39,707
- You guys go ahead and eat.
- What?

399
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:41,777
Why aren't you eating?
This is delicious.

400
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:45,648
It tastes good.

401
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:47,418
She didn't even eat much.

402
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:51,948
This darn old lady
is driving me crazy.

403
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:53,757
What am I supposed to do?

404
00:19:54,257 --> 00:19:55,317
My gosh.

405
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:03,227
Please give me some time.

406
00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:05,428
I'll contact you soon.

407
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:09,567
My goodness. Seriously...

408
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:14,378
By the way,
why isn't Do Ra's pay being wired?

409
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:18,477
What if that crazy lady
goes to the broadcasting station?

410
00:20:18,747 --> 00:20:20,717
My goodness.

411
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:29,027
Did my muscles go into spasms
when I rolled earlier?

412
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,727
Why am I so stiff and sore?

413
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:34,957
When will "Straightforward Romance"
be finished?

414
00:20:34,997 --> 00:20:36,428
The shooting is killing me.

415
00:20:38,668 --> 00:20:41,668
No, that's not the problem.

416
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,567
It should go well
so I can make my debut.

417
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,237
Right.

418
00:20:48,438 --> 00:20:50,707
I should think only about
my first two-part series.

419
00:20:55,517 --> 00:20:56,648
Gosh, it hurts.

420
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,727
The truth is, he followed me around
saying he had a crush on me.

421
00:21:04,588 --> 00:21:05,628
What?

422
00:21:06,128 --> 00:21:07,698
I'm his first love.

423
00:21:07,928 --> 00:21:11,198
In school, he insisted on giving me
a ride on his bike...

424
00:21:11,198 --> 00:21:13,297
and followed me around
to buy me tteokbokki.

425
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:17,207
Anyway, that's what he did.

426
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:19,237
What?

427
00:21:19,707 --> 00:21:21,638
I had a crush on her
and followed her around?

428
00:21:22,277 --> 00:21:24,178
You've got to be kidding me.

429
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:27,717
Park Do Ra, you brat.

430
00:21:34,457 --> 00:21:35,658
I'll do it.

431
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:40,757
Cut! No way.

432
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,997
Can he be any cuter?

433
00:21:49,668 --> 00:21:52,168
Thinking about him
just makes me laugh.

434
00:21:52,807 --> 00:21:53,908
Unbelievable.

435
00:21:59,547 --> 00:22:00,578
My gosh.

436
00:22:16,598 --> 00:22:19,567
What the...
Anyway, that was a bit weird.

437
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:21,438
I felt like I was being electrified.

438
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:24,467
Does static electricity occur
in the woods as well?

439
00:22:30,178 --> 00:22:33,348
Why is that Curly-haired
Assistant Director so funny?

440
00:22:33,678 --> 00:22:35,618
How can you be that adorable?

441
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:37,348
He's so adorable.

442
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,539
My gosh. What has gotten into you?

443
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:51,408
You seem to be in a good mood today.

444
00:22:51,408 --> 00:22:54,408
Aren't you tired
from all the extensive filming?

445
00:22:54,878 --> 00:22:57,208
I'm a little fatigued, but I'm fine.

446
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,948
Should I make a fuss
and ease your filming schedule?

447
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:01,848
I'm worried
this will take a toll on you.

448
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:04,348
It'll be bad
if you faint from exhaustion.

449
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:06,089
No, Mom. I'm good.

450
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,219
I love being on set these days,

451
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:09,858
and work has been fun.
It's all good.

452
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:11,529
Gosh. Really?

453
00:23:11,688 --> 00:23:14,059
You've been sick and tired
of your work lately,

454
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,729
and that had me worried.

455
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:19,368
I love being on set these days,

456
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:22,598
and this show
has brought the fun back.

457
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,309
So don't worry.

458
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:27,239
Goodness. I'm glad to hear that.

459
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:29,408
Still, let me know if you get tired.

460
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:33,108
I'll talk to the director
and adjust your filming schedule.

461
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,878
You need to be healthy...

462
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:37,589
so that you can work
on your next project.

463
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:39,618
Why do you say that?

464
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,158
Are you worried
I won't be well enough to work?

465
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:42,918
Then, I won't be making money.

466
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,789
Why on earth
would you put it that way?

467
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:48,398
I'm worried
you might overexert yourself.

468
00:23:48,698 --> 00:23:50,628
Gosh, you brat.

469
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:54,168
Anyway, take this.
Drink it while on set.

470
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:55,698
It's jujube and ginger tea.

471
00:23:55,898 --> 00:23:58,539
The weather is chilly,
and you can't have a soar throat.

472
00:23:58,569 --> 00:24:02,009
I brewed it with love
since last night.

473
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:03,948
Got it. Thanks.

474
00:24:04,108 --> 00:24:05,779
You're the best, Mom.

475
00:24:07,918 --> 00:24:11,089
Mom, hold on.
Do you have more of this?

476
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,019
Yes, I do. Why?

477
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:14,358
Then get me an extra bottle of it.

478
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,918
Sure. Hold on.

479
00:24:16,618 --> 00:24:18,958
Let me see. Here.

480
00:24:19,188 --> 00:24:21,759
Here. I already had
another bottle of it packed.

481
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,329
Is it for the director?

482
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:24,529
What?

483
00:24:25,428 --> 00:24:26,469
Yes.

484
00:24:27,168 --> 00:24:28,969
- I'll get going, then.
- Sure.

485
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:30,969
- Thanks for this.
- No problem. Have a good one.

486
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:31,969
Got it.

487
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:35,839
For a while, she has been
sick and tired of her work.

488
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:40,178
Hold on. Could there be something
going on with her and Cha Bong Soo?

489
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:44,188
Gosh, no. No way.

490
00:24:50,928 --> 00:24:52,158
Why haven't you been in touch?

491
00:24:52,989 --> 00:24:54,499
Until when do I have to wait?

492
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:55,799
Goodness...

493
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:59,299
What am I going to do
with this crazy old bat?

494
00:25:00,168 --> 00:25:02,668
I need to pay back the loan I own...

495
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,509
and pay this old bat to shut up.

496
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:07,239
So why isn't the head
of the production house...

497
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,608
sending me the money?

498
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,279
Shouldn't one keep their promise?

499
00:25:10,878 --> 00:25:12,908
Gosh. What do I do?

500
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,378
What now?

501
00:25:15,148 --> 00:25:18,418
Should I ask Mr. Gong
for the money directly?

502
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:22,559
No way. That's just wrong.

503
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:28,128
Gosh.

504
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,999
Her entire pay
was actually sent my way in full.

505
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:36,598
The main investor...

506
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:39,868
had to sign off on it
for the money to have been paid.

507
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:44,648
I heard Mr. Gong was the second son
of APP Group's late chairman.

508
00:25:44,648 --> 00:25:47,049
Boy, that young man
can pull some strings.

509
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:50,019
Goodness me.

510
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:57,628
The current chairman of APP Group...

511
00:25:58,158 --> 00:26:00,628
only has a daughter who's ill.

512
00:26:00,658 --> 00:26:02,529
So although...

513
00:26:03,928 --> 00:26:06,098
CEO Gong Jin Dan
may be the mistress' son,

514
00:26:06,428 --> 00:26:08,269
the actual person...

515
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,239
to take over APP Group someday...

516
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:14,339
Only Mr. Gong fits the bill.

517
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:16,938
On top of that,

518
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:19,479
he's an unmarried single man.

519
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:22,219
Mr. Gong, it's nothing big.

520
00:26:22,219 --> 00:26:25,049
I'm sure you have everything
the world can offer,

521
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:27,918
but one wears a different necktie
every day.

522
00:26:28,358 --> 00:26:30,388
This seemed to suit you
which is why Do Ra and I...

523
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,858
picked it out together.

524
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:34,999
Gosh. Really?
Ms. Park picked it out?

525
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:35,999
That's right.

526
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:38,128
She wanted to come with me
to see you today,

527
00:26:38,128 --> 00:26:39,898
but she couldn't get away
from the set.

528
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,769
I came on her behalf.

529
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:45,809
Mr. Gong, thank you so much.

530
00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:48,539
You had Do Ra's pay
made out in advance.

531
00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:51,208
I'm well aware
that you signed off on it...

532
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:52,608
to make it happen.

533
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:54,279
Gosh, that was nothing.

534
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:56,219
It's like I said.

535
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,019
While Ms. Park
is filming this series,

536
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:00,759
I won't let her be bothered
by anything else.

537
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:04,059
She'll be able to stay focused
solely on her work.

538
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,628
My gosh, Mr. Gong.
You are an impressive man.

539
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:09,198
Thank you so much.

540
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:12,928
- Please excuse me.
- Sure.

541
00:27:16,438 --> 00:27:18,668
I can't wait any longer.

542
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,938
I'm getting ready
to head to the broadcasting station.

543
00:27:21,178 --> 00:27:22,309
What will it be?

544
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,208
What's wrong? Is something up?

545
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:29,519
Gosh, no. It's nothing.

546
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:31,448
My daughter being a celebrity...

547
00:27:31,448 --> 00:27:34,688
leads to all kinds of flies
swarming around us.

548
00:27:34,918 --> 00:27:37,958
Please let me know
if there's anything I can do.

549
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:41,898
We can't have flies
swarming around Ms. Park.

550
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:46,168
Your offer to help alone
has my heart filled with gratitude.

551
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:51,208
That crazy old bat.
Should I just kill you?

552
00:27:51,438 --> 00:27:53,168
You have another thing coming.

553
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:57,579
What was that? 40,000 dollars?

554
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:00,309
Did you just say 40,000 dollars?

555
00:28:01,678 --> 00:28:04,448
It's as I explained the other day.

556
00:28:04,448 --> 00:28:06,719
I didn't borrow
the 30,000 dollars from him.

557
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:09,888
Mr. Kim gave it to me to spend.

558
00:28:10,628 --> 00:28:13,329
So technically,
I don't have to pay anyone back.

559
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,198
However, to save Do Ra's face,

560
00:28:16,198 --> 00:28:19,198
I am extending a generous offer...

561
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,638
by adding 10,000 dollars
in interest.

562
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:21,698
Look here.

563
00:28:21,698 --> 00:28:24,039
My daughter-in-law's father died
because of you,

564
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:27,279
and she has been heartbroken
ever since.

565
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,509
My gosh.

566
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:32,509
But rather than paying more
as compensation, you...

567
00:28:34,948 --> 00:28:36,648
Fine. Then,

568
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:40,289
I'll settle for twice the principal
which is 60,000 dollars.

569
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:45,589
I never took you as one,
but you are a conniving thief.

570
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:50,729
If you keep this up,
I'll report you for blackmailing.

571
00:28:50,868 --> 00:28:53,329
Go ahead
and tell people I owe you money.

572
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:54,938
What? Fine.

573
00:28:55,469 --> 00:28:58,638
We'll meet each other halfway.

574
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:04,708
How about 50,000 dollars?
Is that good enough?

575
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,549
Fine.

576
00:29:14,158 --> 00:29:16,089
Then, here...

577
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,888
You will write
a memorandum in exchange.

578
00:29:20,128 --> 00:29:21,428
A memorandum?

579
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:23,628
I can't have you harassing me again.

580
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:25,598
We should end it right here.

581
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:28,299
Write the memorandum,

582
00:29:28,598 --> 00:29:30,198
and I'll wire the money
straight away.

583
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:32,269
Fine.

584
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:34,138
I'll write one.

585
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:37,448
Write down what I say.

586
00:29:37,678 --> 00:29:40,178
Start with your name.

587
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,848
(Memorandum, So Geum Ja)

588
00:29:46,848 --> 00:29:49,888
I, So Geum Ja,
promise to uphold the following...

589
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,658
in exchange for receiving
the 30,000 dollars...

590
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:55,759
Baek Mi Ja once received
from Kim Jun Sub 15 years ago...

591
00:29:55,999 --> 00:29:59,398
plus an interest of 20,000 dollars.

592
00:30:00,329 --> 00:30:01,339
One.

593
00:30:01,698 --> 00:30:05,809
I will never appear before
Baek Mi Ja and Park Do Ra again.

594
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:10,608
I will never speak of the incident
involving Baek Mi Ja.

595
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,648
If I do not uphold the following,

596
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:15,918
I will pay back
triple the amount of 50,000 dollars.

597
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,049
Also,

598
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:20,249
I will compensate...

599
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:23,458
for any damages
suffered by Park Do Ra...

600
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:25,259
because of the words I spill.

601
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,930
(Pureun Bank)

602
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,270
- Are you all right?
- Gosh.

603
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,801
- I'm fine.
- But...

604
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:43,670
- I'm fine.
- I'm sorry.

605
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:53,010
- Get in here.
- What is it, Mom?

606
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:59,503
Hold on.
What are you locking the door for?

607
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,361
- Gosh.
- Sit down.

608
00:31:02,391 --> 00:31:03,420
Hyun Chul.

609
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,430
You...

610
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:06,490
Don't be startled.

611
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,160
What is this about?

612
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,170
Check this out.

613
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,871
This is 50,000 dollars in total.

614
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,381
Gosh. Mom, what's with this money?

615
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,041
Where did you get this?

616
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:24,281
Quiet.

617
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:27,210
I got it from that hag Do Ra's mom.

618
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,091
That gold-gigger
paid me the 30,000 dollars...

619
00:31:31,091 --> 00:31:32,750
she coaxed
out of your father-in-law...

620
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,291
plus 20,000 dollars in interest.

621
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:37,930
In total, I received
50,000 dollars from her.

622
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,960
What the...

623
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,101
Did she easily give up the money?

624
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,930
Come on.

625
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,331
She tried to talk her way out of it,

626
00:31:47,331 --> 00:31:48,871
but I said I'd go
to the broadcasting station...

627
00:31:48,871 --> 00:31:50,541
and tell people
that Do Ra owed us money...

628
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,240
in hopes of tanking her career.

629
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:54,710
She caved into my threats.

630
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:56,541
Mom, please.

631
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:57,881
What's so wrong about it?

632
00:31:57,881 --> 00:32:00,851
I got the job done,
so who cares how I got it?

633
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:02,750
Mom, come on.

634
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,520
Why did you bring it home in cash
when this can be dangerous?

635
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,190
If I wire you the money,

636
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,861
your wife might find out.

637
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:13,160
Also, money like this
should be spent in cash.

638
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,730
Depositing it in a bank...

639
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,061
will lead to it being traced.

640
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,730
I guess.

641
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:20,970
Hyun Chul.

642
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:24,841
I'm telling you to use this money...

643
00:32:24,841 --> 00:32:26,670
to get settled down.

644
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,980
Start a lucrative business.

645
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:33,510
That way, you'll be able
to be a proud husband.

646
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,220
Mom...

647
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,690
Don't make any mistakes this time...

648
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,160
and test every bridge
before crossing it.

649
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:43,791
Got it, Mom.

650
00:32:44,831 --> 00:32:46,291
But this...

651
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:49,031
Sun Young will throw a fit
when she finds out about it.

652
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:52,470
How will she know
if we don't tell her?

653
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,970
We will take this to our graves.

654
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,270
- It's our secret.
- I'm home.

655
00:32:58,841 --> 00:33:00,141
What...

656
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:01,581
- Is no one home?
- What?

657
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:03,841
- Hey.
- Honey?

658
00:33:05,051 --> 00:33:06,051
- What?
- Gosh.

659
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,781
But his shoes are by the door.

660
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,281
What's going on?

661
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,450
Honey?

662
00:33:12,151 --> 00:33:13,151
Mother?

663
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,190
- What...
- Why is this door locked?

664
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,230
Honey? Mother?
Honey, are you in here?

665
00:33:22,361 --> 00:33:24,331
- Yes. What is it?
- What's up?

666
00:33:24,331 --> 00:33:26,571
Why is this door locked?

667
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,770
What? Is the door locked?

668
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,270
Yes, Mother.

669
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,710
Open it.

670
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,410
- Here.
- Hey.

671
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:37,611
Mom.

672
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,480
- What is it?
- Well...

673
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:43,081
Honey, you're home.

674
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,490
What...

675
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:47,250
Why was the door locked?

676
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,861
What were you two up to?

677
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:51,690
Gosh. Was the door locked?

678
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:54,601
That must be due
to the house being rusty.

679
00:33:54,601 --> 00:33:56,901
We should renovate sometime.

680
00:33:56,901 --> 00:34:00,770
The door locks on its own
every now and again.

681
00:34:00,871 --> 00:34:03,101
- Yes, that happens.
- Right.

682
00:34:03,101 --> 00:34:04,811
- We should renovate.
- I see.

683
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,841
Right.

684
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,821
What were they up to
behind that locked door?

685
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,761
I don't care though.

686
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:25,261
I can't let him take out
more loans against this house.

687
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,861
Never.

688
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:32,431
Okay, good.

689
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,140
I got it.

690
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:50,151
Have it gift-wrapped.

691
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,321
- Make it look pretty.
- Sure.

692
00:34:57,321 --> 00:35:00,361
Of course.
Every woman loves diamonds.

693
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:04,330
This will be enough
to charm Park Do Ra's pants off.

694
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:07,971
I wonder if she's filming.

695
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:10,971
Hold on.

696
00:35:12,071 --> 00:35:13,540
If I approach her too suddenly,

697
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,611
she might think of me
as a crazy person.

698
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,011
She's a precious soul,
and I should be respectful.

699
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,651
Gradually,

700
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,321
like a light drizzle
that goes unnoticed.

701
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,690
I'll have her become
head over heels for me.

702
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,261
Diamonds it is.

703
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,131
How could you do this to me?

704
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,870
You punk. Yesterday, you...

705
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,210
Oh, no.

706
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,781
I'm sorry. I forgot my lines.

707
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,250
Bong Soo, I'm sorry.
Are you all right?

708
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,250
Cut. No good.

709
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,681
I'm fine.

710
00:35:54,681 --> 00:35:56,951
I'm really sorry.

711
00:35:57,051 --> 00:35:58,520
Bong Soo, I'm sorry.

712
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,750
It can happen.

713
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,821
- Yoon Jung!
- Gosh.

714
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:03,661
Let's get the scene done this time.

715
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:05,361
Please get ready.

716
00:36:05,361 --> 00:36:06,631
Sure.

717
00:36:08,261 --> 00:36:09,330
Ready.

718
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:12,301
One, two, ready. Action.

719
00:36:13,301 --> 00:36:15,201
How could you do this to me?

720
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,210
You punk. Yesterday, you...

721
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,140
Cut. No good.

722
00:36:22,741 --> 00:36:23,841
What the...

723
00:36:24,911 --> 00:36:26,051
Snark Do Ra.

724
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:29,651
That hurt more than
getting hit with a fly swatter!

725
00:36:29,651 --> 00:36:31,690
I was trying to make it work
in one go.

726
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,350
Gosh. Bong Soo, does it hurt badly?

727
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,591
I'm fine.

728
00:36:34,591 --> 00:36:36,960
It only happened because
she was immersed in her character,

729
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,031
- so please be understanding.
- Sure.

730
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,491
I'm sorry.

731
00:36:41,091 --> 00:36:42,761
Are you all right?

732
00:36:42,761 --> 00:36:43,761
- Yes.
- Is everything good?

733
00:36:43,761 --> 00:36:45,431
Yes, just a second.

734
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:48,040
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

735
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,870
One, two, ready. Action.

736
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,210
How could you do this to me?

737
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,310
You punk.

738
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,850
My nose.

739
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,810
Cut. No good!

740
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,321
Snark Do Ra.

741
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:03,951
You did that on purpose
to mess with me.

742
00:37:03,951 --> 00:37:05,850
- Get over here.
- Not this again.

743
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,520
Bong Soo, you're wrong.

744
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,120
Mr. Cha, that wasn't it.
She said so herself.

745
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,661
- Please let it go.
- As if.

746
00:37:11,661 --> 00:37:14,161
That cow did it on purpose!

747
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:16,531
- Ms. Park...
- Did you just call me a cow?

748
00:37:16,531 --> 00:37:19,201
As if you're anything else!
Get back here.

749
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:21,131
Guys, we'll take a short break.

750
00:37:21,301 --> 00:37:24,940
Why did the writer
have to put in such a scene?

751
00:37:25,341 --> 00:37:27,741
I blame the writer, you know.

752
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,540
I'll tell the writer
not to add scenes...

753
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,051
that involve throwing water,

754
00:37:32,051 --> 00:37:33,310
so please calm down.

755
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,120
On American TV shows,

756
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:38,051
they shoot people
rather than throw water.

757
00:37:38,321 --> 00:37:39,350
Bang.

758
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,261
I can't work with Bong Soo.

759
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:46,991
I didn't do it on purpose.

760
00:37:46,991 --> 00:37:48,230
That was me
trying to get it in one take.

761
00:37:48,761 --> 00:37:51,701
Bong Soo isn't just foul-mouthed.
He has a temper too.

762
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,870
I wonder if his fans know
about his nasty temper.

763
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,670
Besides, it was plain water
without any ice.

764
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,111
How can it hurt more
than being swatted like a fly?

765
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:04,411
You see, Bong Soo
must have felt that way...

766
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:07,051
because he got doused five times.

767
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:09,620
Also, there was that incident
from a few days ago.

768
00:38:09,681 --> 00:38:12,551
That must've been him
releasing his anger.

769
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,620
Curly-haired Assistant Director.

770
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:18,261
Did you take his side
in my presence?

771
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,100
Gosh, no. Of course not.

772
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:24,571
You saw how it was earlier.

773
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:26,730
When Mr. Cha moved toward you
in a threatening manner,

774
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,040
I threw myself between you two
to block him.

775
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,071
I guess. I really appreciate that.

776
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,111
You're the only one here
that has my back.

777
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:44,221
There are so many people
working on this project that I hate.

778
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,920
I hope you know
I'm only doing this series...

779
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,960
for your sake.

780
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:50,460
Of course I know that.

781
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,431
I truly appreciate that.

782
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:54,560
So until we wrap up this project,

783
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,761
you will always take my side.

784
00:38:55,761 --> 00:38:57,301
Of course. Absolutely.

785
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:58,500
Promise me that.

786
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,500
I promise.

787
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,040
Ms. Park.

788
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:05,540
Have some spicy tteokbokki
and lighten up.

789
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,571
I bought it at the market.

790
00:39:08,241 --> 00:39:10,140
They sell the best tteokbokki.

791
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,881
Here. Have some while it's warm.

792
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:14,850
Thank you.

793
00:39:23,821 --> 00:39:26,631
No way. This is to die for.

794
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,201
Right? Isn't it good?

795
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,170
Seeing you enjoy it
makes the trip worthwhile.

796
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:35,071
Hold on a second.

797
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,201
Here it is.

798
00:39:37,741 --> 00:39:38,741
Ta-da.

799
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:42,681
Here.

800
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,480
Try this.
It's jujube and ginger tea.

801
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:50,250
It smells incredible.

802
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,591
Gosh. No way.

803
00:39:56,591 --> 00:39:57,591
Isn't it good?

804
00:39:57,591 --> 00:40:00,591
It tastes like
the jujube and ginger...

805
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,901
don't clash with the other flavor,

806
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:04,401
and they mesh well together.

807
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:10,401
I got up early this morning
and made it myself.

808
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:12,040
For you, Mr. Ko.

809
00:40:12,471 --> 00:40:15,140
So drink it all. Every single drop.

810
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,810
It's really good for you.

811
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,911
Gosh. This is an honor. Thank you.

812
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,850
Goodness. It warms me up.

813
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,120
The tteokbokki's amazing.

814
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,431
How did it go, Pil Seung?

815
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:34,361
Did you do damage control?

816
00:40:36,631 --> 00:40:38,401
I soothed Park Do Ra
with tteokbokki.

817
00:40:39,531 --> 00:40:41,270
Fried chicken for Cha Bong Soo.

818
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,701
You know,

819
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:47,370
Working with the grumpy actors...

820
00:40:47,471 --> 00:40:48,681
is just killing me.

821
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,651
Pil Seung.
What would I have done without you?

822
00:40:53,881 --> 00:40:55,551
You will make a great director.

823
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,321
Your praise doesn't console me.

824
00:40:59,951 --> 00:41:00,951
Pil Seung.

825
00:41:01,821 --> 00:41:03,721
I need this drama to succeed.

826
00:41:03,991 --> 00:41:05,761
I want to do a really good job.

827
00:41:06,591 --> 00:41:08,761
But if those grumps
fight once more,

828
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,431
the shock might kill me.

829
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:13,600
So, Pil Seung.

830
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:16,270
Don't run away.

831
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:19,071
Stay right by my side and help me.

832
00:41:19,071 --> 00:41:21,170
If this drama does well,
it won't just benefit me.

833
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,381
It'll benefit you too.

834
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,151
Jin Gu. Don't worry.

835
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:29,051
Whatever it takes, I'll see to it...

836
00:41:29,881 --> 00:41:30,951
that we finish the project.

837
00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:32,620
Okay.

838
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:34,861
I believe in you.

839
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,571
This is for you.

840
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,940
Goodness.

841
00:41:52,841 --> 00:41:55,710
Curly-haired Director.
What are the flowers for?

842
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:57,911
I was so grateful
for the jujube and ginger tea.

843
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,181
It was nothing at all.

844
00:42:01,181 --> 00:42:02,520
It wasn't nothing.

845
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,290
Who could dream of having
jujube and ginger tea you made?

846
00:42:06,451 --> 00:42:07,551
You're right.

847
00:42:08,161 --> 00:42:11,261
Despite the difficult situations
and problems,

848
00:42:11,261 --> 00:42:14,031
you work so hard out of love
and care for our project.

849
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,201
I'm so thankful.

850
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,730
You even held back
when Bong Soo had an outburst.

851
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:19,131
And you trusted me.

852
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:22,670
Compared to the gratitude I feel,
these flowers are a small gesture.

853
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,170
Not at all.

854
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:27,571
I'm so moved.

855
00:42:27,571 --> 00:42:28,980
Thanks so much.

856
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:33,051
From now on, even if Bong Soo
loses his mind, I won't react.

857
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,850
I'll think of the flowers.

858
00:42:36,881 --> 00:42:37,881
Thank you.

859
00:42:38,951 --> 00:42:40,620
Since taking on this project,

860
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,361
I've learned a lot.

861
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,531
Come on.

862
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,690
You're welcome.

863
00:42:49,631 --> 00:42:51,801
If you cast me
in your directorial debut,

864
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:54,301
I'll take the role
without any conditions or demands.

865
00:42:54,301 --> 00:42:55,600
I swear.

866
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:57,640
- You will?
- Yes.

867
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:59,770
That's an honor. Thank you.

868
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,681
You have just one more scene today.
Get ready to film.

869
00:43:03,111 --> 00:43:04,111
Okay.

870
00:43:05,551 --> 00:43:06,681
They're beautiful.

871
00:43:10,109 --> 00:43:12,038
Goodness. Son.

872
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:14,948
I haven't seen you
in a suit in a while.

873
00:43:14,948 --> 00:43:16,978
You look amazing.

874
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,448
Honey.

875
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,719
Why are you in a suit?

876
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:24,388
Who are you meeting?

877
00:43:25,058 --> 00:43:27,529
I'll tell you some other time.

878
00:43:28,529 --> 00:43:31,228
Who are you meeting
that you'll tell me another time?

879
00:43:31,928 --> 00:43:35,098
They're not weirdos who want you
to start a business, are they?

880
00:43:35,169 --> 00:43:36,169
No.

881
00:43:36,469 --> 00:43:37,638
Hey, Sun Young.

882
00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:40,069
Why would you say that?

883
00:43:40,509 --> 00:43:42,209
My Hyun Chul isn't a fool.

884
00:43:42,209 --> 00:43:44,178
He wouldn't go around meeting weirdos.

885
00:43:45,678 --> 00:43:49,319
The man of the house wore a suit
for the first time in a while.

886
00:43:49,478 --> 00:43:52,649
You should just say,
"You look great. Have a nice day."

887
00:43:55,919 --> 00:43:57,118
Ko Myung Dong.

888
00:43:57,859 --> 00:44:00,689
Did you spend the night elsewhere?

889
00:44:00,928 --> 00:44:02,828
Why are you doing stuff
you never did before?

890
00:44:03,299 --> 00:44:05,029
Come here. Did you drink last night?

891
00:44:05,029 --> 00:44:06,328
- Leave her alone.
- Hey.

892
00:44:06,969 --> 00:44:10,399
You know her friend Jang Mi.

893
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:14,138
She's been having a terrible time
since she got divorced.

894
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:15,978
Myung Dong wanted to be with her.

895
00:44:15,978 --> 00:44:19,678
I told you to spend
a few nights with her.

896
00:44:20,009 --> 00:44:21,279
So...

897
00:44:22,748 --> 00:44:25,678
Is Jang Mi feeling better now?

898
00:44:26,448 --> 00:44:27,448
What?

899
00:44:29,049 --> 00:44:31,359
Yes. I guess?

900
00:44:31,819 --> 00:44:33,058
Goodness.

901
00:44:33,529 --> 00:44:37,399
Still, you should sleep
in your own bed.

902
00:44:38,029 --> 00:44:40,799
- See you later. I'm off, Mom.
- But...

903
00:44:46,169 --> 00:44:48,868
(Park Do Sik)

904
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:53,908
Let's meet.

905
00:44:54,308 --> 00:44:55,509
I have something to say.

906
00:44:55,748 --> 00:44:57,879
It's not right to end it like this.

907
00:44:58,419 --> 00:44:59,989
This woman, honestly...

908
00:45:01,489 --> 00:45:02,859
Is she a leech or what?

909
00:45:04,689 --> 00:45:08,029
What does she want to talk about?
She's driving me insane.

910
00:45:09,799 --> 00:45:11,129
What did you want to say?

911
00:45:12,868 --> 00:45:14,899
I waited for a long time,

912
00:45:16,368 --> 00:45:18,739
but now I'm too impatient to wait.

913
00:45:20,209 --> 00:45:21,339
For what?

914
00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:24,908
Do you still have a regular period?

915
00:45:26,448 --> 00:45:27,478
What?

916
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:30,719
You're getting older too.

917
00:45:31,578 --> 00:45:34,049
So how about you see a doctor...

918
00:45:34,049 --> 00:45:36,089
and get some medical help?

919
00:45:36,189 --> 00:45:37,388
Before it's too late.

920
00:45:38,589 --> 00:45:42,489
What are you talking about, Auntie?

921
00:45:42,629 --> 00:45:44,129
I'm talking about a child.

922
00:45:46,768 --> 00:45:49,098
A son would be great,
but a daughter's okay too.

923
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:51,899
You know Ma Ri's state.

924
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:54,908
Before it's too late,
you must have a child...

925
00:45:55,138 --> 00:45:57,209
to carry on the family and company.

926
00:45:58,678 --> 00:46:00,709
You're still young and healthy.

927
00:46:02,609 --> 00:46:06,018
Auntie. I turn 60 soon.

928
00:46:06,919 --> 00:46:08,689
I don't have periods anymore.

929
00:46:09,018 --> 00:46:10,158
I haven't for a while.

930
00:46:11,259 --> 00:46:13,359
Why are you telling me that now?

931
00:46:14,089 --> 00:46:15,089
What?

932
00:46:15,228 --> 00:46:17,828
I thought you could still do
your womanly duty.

933
00:46:18,598 --> 00:46:19,629
What?

934
00:46:25,969 --> 00:46:27,469
What's up with her?

935
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:30,839
Was she waiting for me
to get pregnant all this time?

936
00:46:31,138 --> 00:46:32,779
My goodness.

937
00:46:33,149 --> 00:46:35,709
At my age? That's nonsense.

938
00:46:38,448 --> 00:46:39,888
Oh, gosh.

939
00:46:40,049 --> 00:46:42,348
Where's the housekeeper? Ma'am?

940
00:46:42,348 --> 00:46:44,158
Yes? I'm here.

941
00:46:44,158 --> 00:46:45,189
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

942
00:46:45,189 --> 00:46:47,428
I asked you to change my sheets.
Why are they the same?

943
00:46:47,828 --> 00:46:49,189
You didn't clean my bathroom either.

944
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:51,998
Sorry. I'll do that tomorrow.

945
00:46:51,998 --> 00:46:54,198
Ma'am. What are you thinking?

946
00:46:54,569 --> 00:46:56,268
Who says
you can decide to do it tomorrow?

947
00:46:57,498 --> 00:46:59,299
Are you belittling me too now?

948
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:01,609
Why would I belittle you?

949
00:47:02,109 --> 00:47:03,509
It's not that.

950
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:06,038
Madam Jang told me
to clean Madam Gong's bathroom...

951
00:47:06,038 --> 00:47:07,649
and Ma Ri's room first,

952
00:47:07,649 --> 00:47:09,578
and if I didn't have the time
to clean the second madam's room,

953
00:47:09,578 --> 00:47:11,248
I could do it tomorrow.

954
00:47:11,248 --> 00:47:13,319
What? I'm the second madam?

955
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,888
Who says you can call me that?

956
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:18,989
Who told you
to call me "second madam?"

957
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:21,928
Hong Ae Kyo. What are you doing?

958
00:47:22,629 --> 00:47:25,098
Why are you shouting at Ms. Yeoju?

959
00:47:25,098 --> 00:47:28,598
Jang Soo Yeon.
How dare you call me by name?

960
00:47:28,799 --> 00:47:31,239
She looks down on me
because you're like this.

961
00:47:31,339 --> 00:47:33,138
What's going on here?

962
00:47:38,209 --> 00:47:39,879
What's the matter?

963
00:47:40,908 --> 00:47:42,748
What are you arguing about now?

964
00:47:43,748 --> 00:47:46,419
Yes. I'm a mistress.

965
00:47:47,419 --> 00:47:50,919
But I bore the late chairman a son.

966
00:47:51,689 --> 00:47:53,459
On his death bed,
he acknowledged me...

967
00:47:53,759 --> 00:47:55,959
as the mother of his son.

968
00:47:56,899 --> 00:47:58,728
But she looks down on me.

969
00:47:59,328 --> 00:48:01,598
So much so that
even the hired help belittles me.

970
00:48:02,268 --> 00:48:04,138
Any culture would say this is wrong.

971
00:48:05,198 --> 00:48:07,768
I know you were friends
who went to high school together,

972
00:48:07,939 --> 00:48:09,578
but a mother-in-law
and daughter-in-law...

973
00:48:09,578 --> 00:48:11,839
shouldn't fight and call each other
by name.

974
00:48:12,408 --> 00:48:13,848
What kind of mess is this?

975
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:16,149
Chairman Gong.

976
00:48:16,549 --> 00:48:19,448
Is our family
that uneducated and low-class?

977
00:48:26,888 --> 00:48:30,558
When I heard my older brother
had had a child with a woman...

978
00:48:30,558 --> 00:48:32,228
young enough to be his daughter,

979
00:48:32,899 --> 00:48:34,228
I didn't get it.

980
00:48:35,598 --> 00:48:37,299
I was embarrassed, and I hated it.

981
00:48:39,198 --> 00:48:42,169
Jin Taek, your late mother.

982
00:48:42,609 --> 00:48:45,609
I felt so sorry and guilty for her.

983
00:48:46,379 --> 00:48:48,078
I was that ashamed.

984
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:50,448
However,

985
00:48:51,149 --> 00:48:53,618
even though our family
did some unorthodox things,

986
00:48:53,618 --> 00:48:55,018
we can't be like this.

987
00:48:56,689 --> 00:48:58,359
She was your father's wife.

988
00:48:58,788 --> 00:49:00,888
She even gave birth
to your father's son, after all.

989
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,029
She should be treated
with due respect.

990
00:49:04,029 --> 00:49:05,598
What kind of mess is this?

991
00:49:07,469 --> 00:49:10,138
Listen, Jin Taek and Soo Yeon.

992
00:49:11,469 --> 00:49:13,908
From this moment forward,
you will call her Mother.

993
00:49:15,368 --> 00:49:16,808
Auntie.

994
00:49:16,808 --> 00:49:18,279
I understand it's awkward...

995
00:49:18,279 --> 00:49:19,649
since you went
to high school together.

996
00:49:20,678 --> 00:49:23,549
But this is just wrong.

997
00:49:25,279 --> 00:49:28,919
Once Jin Dan and Ma Ri get married,
we will have new family members.

998
00:49:29,689 --> 00:49:31,388
I don't want you...

999
00:49:31,589 --> 00:49:34,189
to call each other by name
and fight like this around them.

1000
00:49:35,728 --> 00:49:38,598
Our family isn't so ignorant.

1001
00:49:39,498 --> 00:49:42,328
Even if she was younger than you,

1002
00:49:42,899 --> 00:49:44,969
you should've called her Mother.

1003
00:49:46,469 --> 00:49:47,569
Don't you think so?

1004
00:49:51,339 --> 00:49:52,578
Okay.

1005
00:49:53,509 --> 00:49:55,009
We will do as you say.

1006
00:49:58,879 --> 00:49:59,948
I'm sorry...

1007
00:50:02,219 --> 00:50:03,589
for everything.

1008
00:50:07,328 --> 00:50:08,759
Mother.

1009
00:50:14,129 --> 00:50:15,198
Ma Ri.

1010
00:50:15,669 --> 00:50:17,399
Yes, Great Auntie.

1011
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:20,839
You should call her Grandmother now.

1012
00:50:20,908 --> 00:50:21,908
Okay?

1013
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:24,538
She doesn't like it
when I call her Grandmother.

1014
00:50:24,739 --> 00:50:27,509
No, I don't mind it.
You can call me Grandmother.

1015
00:50:29,549 --> 00:50:30,578
Ms. Yeoju.

1016
00:50:30,848 --> 00:50:32,219
Yes, Madam Gong.

1017
00:50:32,219 --> 00:50:35,419
You should think of her
as the first madam...

1018
00:50:35,419 --> 00:50:38,189
and Ma Ri's mom as the second.

1019
00:50:41,859 --> 00:50:43,129
Please do as you're told.

1020
00:50:44,859 --> 00:50:46,728
Yes, I understand.

1021
00:50:54,109 --> 00:50:57,178
Auntie has no right
to tell us what to do in the house.

1022
00:50:59,279 --> 00:51:01,549
She's the oldest member
of our family.

1023
00:51:02,078 --> 00:51:03,478
She's an aunt,

1024
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,319
but she's like my mother to me.

1025
00:51:08,189 --> 00:51:11,518
She raised me
when my mother was ill in bed.

1026
00:51:12,759 --> 00:51:16,828
If she hadn't given me her liver
when I was little,

1027
00:51:16,959 --> 00:51:18,728
I wouldn't have made it this far.

1028
00:51:18,728 --> 00:51:20,498
And you know that.

1029
00:51:20,629 --> 00:51:22,598
Still, this is unacceptable.

1030
00:51:22,998 --> 00:51:25,799
Why do you always do as she says?

1031
00:51:25,998 --> 00:51:29,138
It's not like I do as she says.
That's just the right thing to do.

1032
00:51:32,609 --> 00:51:34,478
It's true that I was wrong.

1033
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:37,719
Like Auntie said,

1034
00:51:37,848 --> 00:51:40,448
even if she was younger than you,

1035
00:51:44,189 --> 00:51:46,259
we should call her Mother.

1036
00:51:48,259 --> 00:51:49,428
I can't.

1037
00:51:50,959 --> 00:51:52,158
You can't?

1038
00:51:53,169 --> 00:51:55,228
Then what are you going to do?

1039
00:51:55,598 --> 00:51:57,569
Do you think this is easy for me?

1040
00:52:01,908 --> 00:52:02,939
Honey.

1041
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:18,618
Yes, Ae Kyo.

1042
00:52:21,689 --> 00:52:22,689
Hey.

1043
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,498
Ae Kyo, what brings you here?

1044
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:32,069
I'll treat you as my sister-in-law
from now on.

1045
00:52:33,339 --> 00:52:34,339
What?

1046
00:52:35,868 --> 00:52:37,078
Wait.

1047
00:52:37,078 --> 00:52:39,638
Ae Kyo, what are you doing?
Get up this instant.

1048
00:52:40,509 --> 00:52:41,549
Dae Sook.

1049
00:52:42,908 --> 00:52:46,248
Thank you for clearing things up
about how we address each other.

1050
00:52:48,189 --> 00:52:50,489
I met the late chairman
when I was 21.

1051
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,428
He's the only man
I've ever been with.

1052
00:52:56,428 --> 00:52:58,399
And I had a son with him.

1053
00:52:59,158 --> 00:53:01,529
I've spent my whole life
trying to raise my son,

1054
00:53:01,529 --> 00:53:03,339
Gong Jin Dan well.

1055
00:53:06,439 --> 00:53:08,368
The only thing I did wrong...

1056
00:53:10,138 --> 00:53:13,549
is that I met the late chairman
knowing he was married...

1057
00:53:16,649 --> 00:53:18,649
and that I had his son.

1058
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,919
Yes, I know I'm a sinner.

1059
00:53:26,759 --> 00:53:29,058
And yet you accepted me...

1060
00:53:29,689 --> 00:53:32,029
and covered for me
despite what I did.

1061
00:53:32,828 --> 00:53:35,029
I'm really grateful to you.

1062
00:53:37,799 --> 00:53:39,239
I will do...

1063
00:53:40,469 --> 00:53:43,379
whatever you tell me to do now.

1064
00:53:45,078 --> 00:53:47,149
You helped me resolve
my deep sorrow.

1065
00:53:48,879 --> 00:53:51,149
I can even use my hair
to make straw shoes for you.

1066
00:53:52,018 --> 00:53:54,518
I'll make sure
to repay your kindness.

1067
00:53:56,388 --> 00:53:57,459
Dae Sook.

1068
00:53:58,788 --> 00:54:01,288
I hope you live
a long and healthy life.

1069
00:54:02,859 --> 00:54:05,759
All right. I know what you mean.
That's enough.

1070
00:54:05,759 --> 00:54:07,629
Come on. Get up now.

1071
00:54:09,169 --> 00:54:10,469
My gosh.

1072
00:54:10,868 --> 00:54:12,538
Dae Sook...

1073
00:54:12,598 --> 00:54:13,609
All right.

1074
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:16,339
Dae Sook.

1075
00:54:23,448 --> 00:54:25,279
I know how you're feeling.

1076
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,319
That's enough. Stop crying.

1077
00:54:28,618 --> 00:54:29,888
I understand.

1078
00:54:30,859 --> 00:54:32,189
Thank you.

1079
00:54:35,928 --> 00:54:36,928
What?

1080
00:54:41,598 --> 00:54:43,899
The Curly-haired Assistant Director
always wears a backpack.

1081
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:45,899
This must look good on him.

1082
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:48,209
Are you buying a backpack?

1083
00:54:48,509 --> 00:54:49,509
Yes.

1084
00:54:49,739 --> 00:54:50,808
Hey, do you think...

1085
00:54:50,808 --> 00:54:53,138
the Curly-haired Assistant Director
will like this?

1086
00:54:54,149 --> 00:54:55,279
Do Ra.

1087
00:54:55,279 --> 00:54:57,848
Are you buying this designer bag
for the assistant director?

1088
00:54:57,848 --> 00:54:58,919
Yes.

1089
00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:01,919
He's given me many things,
so I want to thank him.

1090
00:55:01,989 --> 00:55:02,989
Come on.

1091
00:55:02,989 --> 00:55:05,359
You just got some tteokbokki
and two-dollar ice cream.

1092
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:07,489
Don't you think
a designer bag is too much?

1093
00:55:08,959 --> 00:55:10,698
- You think so?
- Yes.

1094
00:55:10,698 --> 00:55:13,669
And you should get one
for Director Hong as well.

1095
00:55:13,669 --> 00:55:16,029
I'm sure
Director Hong will be upset...

1096
00:55:16,029 --> 00:55:18,138
if he finds out that
only Assistant Director Ko got this.

1097
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:19,939
- Really?
- Yes.

1098
00:55:19,939 --> 00:55:22,239
If you want to get him something,

1099
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:24,779
what about a hat like this?

1100
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,709
Just go with this hat.

1101
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:33,719
Come on.

1102
00:55:47,828 --> 00:55:49,328
I hope this navy hat...

1103
00:55:49,828 --> 00:55:51,939
will look good
on Curly-haired Assistant Director.

1104
00:55:56,439 --> 00:55:58,239
Should I give him this
in this shopping bag?

1105
00:55:58,239 --> 00:55:59,978
Or should I put this on his head?

1106
00:56:03,549 --> 00:56:05,578
Gosh, no.

1107
00:56:05,578 --> 00:56:09,049
If I put this on him,
he might get the wrong idea.

1108
00:56:09,049 --> 00:56:11,359
I should give him this in the bag.

1109
00:56:14,558 --> 00:56:15,558
What?

1110
00:56:18,859 --> 00:56:19,959
Gosh.

1111
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:22,828
Oh, dear.

1112
00:56:24,939 --> 00:56:25,969
What's wrong?

1113
00:56:26,098 --> 00:56:27,839
Do Ra, listen.

1114
00:56:28,439 --> 00:56:31,109
I don't want you to give this hat
to the Curly-haired Assistant Director.

1115
00:56:31,109 --> 00:56:32,209
Why not?

1116
00:56:32,209 --> 00:56:34,978
That Curly-haired Assistant Director
is a lot worse than I thought.

1117
00:56:34,978 --> 00:56:37,649
He keeps switching sides like a bat.

1118
00:56:38,149 --> 00:56:39,978
A bat? What do you mean?

1119
00:56:39,978 --> 00:56:43,319
The Curly-haired Assistant Director
is talking behind your back...

1120
00:56:44,788 --> 00:56:46,558
with Cha Bong Soo,
the garlic pervert.

1121
00:56:49,189 --> 00:56:50,328
Hey.

1122
00:56:50,629 --> 00:56:53,299
That's just ridiculous.

1123
00:56:54,669 --> 00:56:57,439
That's the last thing
Assistant Director Ko would do.

1124
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:58,939
Who told you that?

1125
00:56:58,939 --> 00:57:01,469
Even now, they are
criticizing you behind your back.

1126
00:57:01,908 --> 00:57:04,308
While he got you
five-dollar tteokbokki,

1127
00:57:04,308 --> 00:57:07,178
he bought Cha Bong Soo
chicken, pizza, and beer.

1128
00:57:07,178 --> 00:57:09,078
Yesterday, he even went
to a fish market...

1129
00:57:09,078 --> 00:57:11,779
and bought raw fish
for Cha Bong Soo to flatter him.

1130
00:57:11,779 --> 00:57:12,848
Lee Jae Dong.

1131
00:57:12,848 --> 00:57:15,288
Curly-haired Assistant Director
isn't that kind of person.

1132
00:57:15,819 --> 00:57:18,419
I think someone just made it up.

1133
00:57:18,419 --> 00:57:19,759
Don't listen to them.

1134
00:57:19,759 --> 00:57:21,888
And do you not remember
what I told you?

1135
00:57:21,888 --> 00:57:25,259
You should cover your eyes and ears
while you're at work.

1136
00:57:25,629 --> 00:57:26,728
Just keep your mouth shut.

1137
00:57:27,129 --> 00:57:29,969
Don't you ever say anything silly
like that again, okay?

1138
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:31,498
- But from what I heard...
- Shush.

1139
00:57:33,198 --> 00:57:34,339
Okay.

1140
00:57:51,219 --> 00:57:52,788
Is spring coming?

1141
00:57:53,759 --> 00:57:55,359
The weather is crazy.

1142
00:57:56,489 --> 00:57:57,928
It's insane.

1143
00:58:16,009 --> 00:58:17,948
Doesn't she have her own hands?

1144
00:58:18,518 --> 00:58:20,618
Why would she let him tidy her hair?

1145
00:58:24,288 --> 00:58:25,319
No.

1146
00:58:26,589 --> 00:58:29,828
This is all about romance.

1147
00:58:30,899 --> 00:58:34,129
I have my own hands,
but I let him tidy my hair.

1148
00:58:37,868 --> 00:58:39,038
I'm jealous.

1149
00:58:48,379 --> 00:58:51,078
All right. I'll do it one last time.

1150
00:58:51,748 --> 00:58:53,319
I'll call him one last time.

1151
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:55,618
My pride doesn't matter now.

1152
00:58:57,189 --> 00:58:58,919
(The Wednesday Man)

1153
00:59:00,489 --> 00:59:02,959
The number you have dialed
does not exist.

1154
00:59:03,388 --> 00:59:04,658
- Please check the number...
- What?

1155
00:59:04,658 --> 00:59:05,658
and call again.

1156
00:59:05,658 --> 00:59:08,569
Did he change his number
just to avoid me?

1157
00:59:11,098 --> 00:59:13,569
How could he do that?

1158
00:59:20,709 --> 00:59:22,178
How could you...

1159
00:59:22,678 --> 00:59:23,719
Hey.

1160
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:25,248
We should talk.

1161
00:59:25,578 --> 00:59:26,649
Hey!

1162
00:59:28,419 --> 00:59:31,189
You darn punk, stop right there!

1163
00:59:32,219 --> 00:59:33,288
Darn.

1164
00:59:34,259 --> 00:59:35,259
Gosh.

1165
00:59:40,698 --> 00:59:42,428
This is humiliating.

1166
00:59:46,399 --> 00:59:49,339
This is driving me nuts.

1167
00:59:54,709 --> 00:59:55,748
What...

1168
01:00:07,888 --> 01:00:10,359
Sure. Let's talk.

1169
01:00:13,799 --> 01:00:15,799
You keep calling it a mistake,

1170
01:00:17,939 --> 01:00:19,469
but it wasn't for me.

1171
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:23,408
It was short and lasted one night,

1172
01:00:24,739 --> 01:00:26,709
but I let you in my heart.

1173
01:00:28,178 --> 01:00:29,509
I developed feelings for you.

1174
01:00:30,848 --> 01:00:33,518
Ma'am, come on.

1175
01:00:33,518 --> 01:00:36,219
Please don't be like this.
I'm begging you.

1176
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:37,658
That night...

1177
01:00:37,658 --> 01:00:39,759
- was a drunken mistake.
- Did he call me "ma'am?"

1178
01:00:40,018 --> 01:00:41,089
Ma'am,

1179
01:00:42,259 --> 01:00:43,859
please forget about me.

1180
01:00:44,498 --> 01:00:46,399
If we bump into each other
on the street,

1181
01:00:46,399 --> 01:00:48,469
act like you don't know me
and keep walking. Please.

1182
01:00:51,899 --> 01:00:54,969
It wasn't even Ms. Ko.
He called me "ma'am."

1183
01:00:56,339 --> 01:00:57,379
Me?

1184
01:01:01,248 --> 01:01:02,808
One, two, three.

1185
01:01:03,009 --> 01:01:04,618
Cut. Okay, that was great.

1186
01:01:05,518 --> 01:01:06,819
- That's a wrap.
- Good job.

1187
01:01:06,819 --> 01:01:08,288
- Good job, everyone.
- Let's wrap this up.

1188
01:01:08,288 --> 01:01:09,989
- Good job, guys.
- Thank you.

1189
01:01:09,989 --> 01:01:12,089
Good job. You did great.

1190
01:01:12,189 --> 01:01:13,288
Right.

1191
01:01:13,828 --> 01:01:15,129
- Mr. Ko...
- Pil Seung!

1192
01:01:15,728 --> 01:01:17,029
- Ko Pil Seung.
- Right.

1193
01:01:18,098 --> 01:01:20,129
- Unbelievable.
- What will we be filming tomorrow?

1194
01:01:20,368 --> 01:01:21,629
You should stay warm.

1195
01:01:22,268 --> 01:01:23,739
Did you give her a hand warmer?

1196
01:01:23,739 --> 01:01:24,739
- I did.
- Good job today.

1197
01:01:28,408 --> 01:01:31,038
Mr. Ko, would you like
to join me for dinner today?

1198
01:01:31,339 --> 01:01:32,678
I have something to give you.

1199
01:01:42,348 --> 01:01:43,719
I feel terrible,

1200
01:01:43,989 --> 01:01:45,788
but I have important plans today.

1201
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:50,799
What can you do, right?

1202
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:52,658
There are other days.

1203
01:01:54,129 --> 01:01:55,228
I'll give it to him tomorrow.

1204
01:01:59,399 --> 01:02:00,408
Gosh.

1205
01:02:01,538 --> 01:02:04,279
Jae Dong, let's get some sushi.

1206
01:02:05,509 --> 01:02:08,379
- Sounds good.
- Let's get some sushi.

1207
01:02:08,379 --> 01:02:09,709
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1208
01:02:13,478 --> 01:02:16,848
Seriously.
If it hadn't been for you,

1209
01:02:16,848 --> 01:02:19,319
I would've already
dropped out of this series.

1210
01:02:19,558 --> 01:02:22,428
You take my side on set,

1211
01:02:22,428 --> 01:02:25,158
join me for drinks after work,

1212
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,728
and listen to me rant.

1213
01:02:26,728 --> 01:02:28,498
That's what keeps me going.

1214
01:02:31,098 --> 01:02:32,098
I mean it.

1215
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:34,339
During the 15 years of my career,

1216
01:02:34,339 --> 01:02:36,038
there hasn't been a project
that was this hard.

1217
01:02:36,038 --> 01:02:38,739
Yesterday, you saw Snark Do Ra
throw water at my face.

1218
01:02:39,078 --> 01:02:41,149
She didn't spray the water.
She slapped me with it.

1219
01:02:41,149 --> 01:02:43,408
How can water hurt that much?

1220
01:02:43,748 --> 01:02:45,978
She must've thrown it with anger...

1221
01:02:45,978 --> 01:02:48,118
for it to have felt like
being slapped.

1222
01:02:48,118 --> 01:02:51,058
Tell me about it.
She was a bit harsh.

1223
01:02:51,158 --> 01:02:52,558
Even your skin turned red.

1224
01:02:52,558 --> 01:02:53,859
Exactly!

1225
01:02:54,029 --> 01:02:55,828
Even now, I hate looking at water...

1226
01:02:55,828 --> 01:02:59,399
because it reminds me
of her slapping me with it.

1227
01:03:03,169 --> 01:03:04,399
Because of Snark Do Ra,

1228
01:03:05,368 --> 01:03:07,868
I broke my beloved Bi Bi's heart.

1229
01:03:08,709 --> 01:03:10,509
But I have to play out
romantic scenes...

1230
01:03:10,509 --> 01:03:11,939
with all this anger
brewing inside me.

1231
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:15,448
I mean... I... Truly...

1232
01:03:15,948 --> 01:03:17,719
Pil Seung, this is killing me.

1233
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:19,919
Gosh. Of course
it's taking a toll on you.

1234
01:03:20,049 --> 01:03:21,919
I get how you feel.

1235
01:03:23,888 --> 01:03:25,158
That being said...

1236
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:28,788
Tomorrow, we're filming a scene
where she slaps me while I'm kneeling.

1237
01:03:29,928 --> 01:03:31,129
I don't think I can do it.

1238
01:03:31,759 --> 01:03:34,669
Snark Do Ra might slap me
until my neck snaps.

1239
01:03:35,598 --> 01:03:38,939
Could you perhaps ask the writer...

1240
01:03:39,439 --> 01:03:41,839
to change the script?

1241
01:03:44,439 --> 01:03:45,538
I'm afraid I can't.

1242
01:03:47,478 --> 01:03:49,609
Bong Soo.

1243
01:03:50,978 --> 01:03:53,118
Snark Do Ra is making
my life miserable as well.

1244
01:03:53,448 --> 01:03:56,089
Right, of course.
It can't be easy for you either.

1245
01:03:59,558 --> 01:04:00,589
You.

1246
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:03,489
Didn't you buy her
ice cream, tteokbokki,

1247
01:04:04,328 --> 01:04:05,799
and even flowers?

1248
01:04:07,728 --> 01:04:08,768
Are you playing...

1249
01:04:09,629 --> 01:04:10,669
both sides?

1250
01:04:12,698 --> 01:04:14,669
Bong Soo, come on.

1251
01:04:15,509 --> 01:04:17,379
I didn't do it because I wanted to.

1252
01:04:17,879 --> 01:04:19,538
It was to make your life easier.

1253
01:04:19,678 --> 01:04:22,379
Catering to her every whim
will make things easier for you.

1254
01:04:22,379 --> 01:04:23,779
That's why I'm doing it.

1255
01:04:24,178 --> 01:04:26,819
But putting up with her
isn't a stroll in the park.

1256
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:29,089
I now get
why people call her Snark Do Ra.

1257
01:04:29,089 --> 01:04:31,558
I lose my mind
dozens of times a day!

1258
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:52,129
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1259
01:05:24,429 --> 01:05:26,790
I sent a food truck
to support you on set,

1260
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:28,230
but I thought I should
support you in person too.

1261
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:30,259
Mr. Gong, how sweet of you.

1262
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,199
I feel bad to always be
on the receiving end.

1263
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:33,629
Treat me to a meal next time, then.

1264
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:35,299
Stay out of my sight.

1265
01:05:35,299 --> 01:05:36,739
If I ever catch a glimpse of you,

1266
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,910
I'll kill you!

1267
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:41,279
What is it that I just saw?

1268
01:05:41,279 --> 01:05:42,839
Just wait till your mom finds out...

1269
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:44,210
how you've been
letting her treat you.

1270
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:46,009
Your mom will faint from the shock.

1271
01:05:46,009 --> 01:05:47,250
It's never the work that's hard.

1272
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,580
It's the people around me.

1273
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,319
Has someone been making
your life miserable?

1274
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:51,489
Who is it?

1275
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:52,790
I'll knock some sense
into whoever that is.

1276
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:55,190
From this day forward,
we'll never see each other again.

1277
01:05:55,942 --> 01:05:58,052
