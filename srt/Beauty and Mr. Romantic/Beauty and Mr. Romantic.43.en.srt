(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:13,661
Ko Pil Seung!

3
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:19,161
Pil Seung!

4
00:00:22,932 --> 00:00:24,377
Who do you think you are?

5
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:26,571
Who are you
to steal everything I have?

6
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:29,517
What now?
What is the meaning of this?

7
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:30,942
Move.

8
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,841
Do Ra!

9
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:47,192
You punk!

10
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,134
(Episode 43)

11
00:01:03,572 --> 00:01:06,011
Jin Dan, why are you here?

12
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:08,481
- Gosh, what happened to your face?
- My goodness.

13
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:11,051
Pil Seung, was it you
who punched him?

14
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:13,552
Who are you to throw punches at him?

15
00:01:13,552 --> 00:01:15,391
Please stay put.

16
00:01:17,692 --> 00:01:18,968
What happened?

17
00:01:18,992 --> 00:01:22,291
It was a one-way assault
by Mr. Gong.

18
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,861
- What?
- What?

19
00:01:24,632 --> 00:01:26,561
I'm not the only one
who threw punches.

20
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:28,332
Just look at my face.

21
00:01:28,332 --> 00:01:30,572
But you threw the first punch.

22
00:01:30,832 --> 00:01:33,102
All the witnesses
said the same thing.

23
00:01:36,742 --> 00:01:37,957
There they are.

24
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:40,081
Pil Seung, my gosh.

25
00:01:40,582 --> 00:01:42,412
- Pil Seung!
- Hey.

26
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:44,481
- Are you all right?
- Goodness.

27
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:45,822
I'm fine.

28
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:47,652
- Hello, Chairman Gong.
- Hello.

29
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:51,251
What on earth happened?

30
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:55,462
Why did a fight occur
between Ma Ri's uncle and Pil Seung?

31
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,232
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:57,531 --> 00:02:00,162
My brother was out of line.

33
00:02:05,472 --> 00:02:08,912
Going around throwing punches
like some neighborhood thug?

34
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:12,082
Jin Dan, you're a member
of the Gong family...

35
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:14,081
who will eventually lead us.

36
00:02:14,382 --> 00:02:17,512
So how dare you go around
acting like some common goon?

37
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:19,621
Was I supposed to do nothing...

38
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:22,322
when he would soon take
everything from me?

39
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:23,751
You saw how Jin Taek was.

40
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:25,667
He couldn't care less about me.

41
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:29,808
Auntie, you can imagine
how frustrated he must've been.

42
00:02:29,832 --> 00:02:31,377
This is too upsetting.

43
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,047
Jin Dan, you listen to me carefully.

44
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,671
The fight isn't over.

45
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:39,942
What? What do you mean by that?

46
00:02:40,142 --> 00:02:42,542
We all have skeletons in our closet.

47
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:46,241
Find anything you can
on Ko Pil Seung to discredit him.

48
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:48,711
With that,
I'll have the adoption canceled.

49
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:52,352
I refuse to hand over what we have
to the Ko family.

50
00:02:56,821 --> 00:03:00,421
Hey. I called to ask
how Pil Seung was doing.

51
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:02,592
He's resting in his room.

52
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:07,202
I never knew Ma Ri's uncle
would once again attack Pil Seung...

53
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:09,072
like this.

54
00:03:09,471 --> 00:03:12,977
I know he's a hothead
and that he has a temper,

55
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,701
but this is wrong.

56
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:17,942
Ma Ri's dad gave him an earful.

57
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:20,212
It won't happen again,

58
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:23,352
so don't worry too much. All right?

59
00:03:25,022 --> 00:03:28,521
Sure, Sun Young,
we'll talk in person.

60
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:31,561
You're having a field day,
aren't you?

61
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:32,892
Why did you hang up?

62
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:34,931
You should've talked more smack
about my son.

63
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,692
No one spoke ill of him.

64
00:03:38,332 --> 00:03:40,131
Besides, he misbehaved.

65
00:03:40,131 --> 00:03:41,877
His actions are justified.

66
00:03:41,901 --> 00:03:44,271
Should he sit idly by
and let you take everything from him?

67
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:47,472
Are you condoning the assault?

68
00:03:47,672 --> 00:03:51,111
Violence can never be justified.

69
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:53,787
Jang Soo Yeon.

70
00:03:53,811 --> 00:03:57,111
You really have it all, don't you?

71
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,121
You're inspiring.

72
00:04:00,582 --> 00:04:01,621
What was that?

73
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:04,327
You must be thrilled...

74
00:04:04,351 --> 00:04:06,192
to be able to adopt your son.

75
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:10,331
Never have I come across
a vixen as cunning as you.

76
00:04:10,892 --> 00:04:12,602
Let me ask you this.

77
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:15,931
I bet it was always your plan...

78
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:18,901
to eventually adopt your son.

79
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,442
- Hong Ae Kyo!
- You! The skies have eyes,

80
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:24,811
and one shouldn't live
her life this way.

81
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:27,557
For making me shed tears of blood,

82
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:29,881
you'll shed just as many
down the road.

83
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:32,121
Have you even thought about
how Jin Dan must feel?

84
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:35,551
You should've talked your husband
out of adopting Pil Seung.

85
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:38,621
How could you jump on the bandwagon
and make this mess?

86
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:42,361
Jin Dan has always been fond of you.

87
00:04:42,831 --> 00:04:46,162
Just you wait and see.
You'll pay for this.

88
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:52,801
Pil Seung, are you all right?

89
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,111
Yes, I'm fine.

90
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:57,388
I bet the ordeal startled you.

91
00:04:57,412 --> 00:04:59,381
I'm good,

92
00:05:00,282 --> 00:05:02,352
but Mr. Gong keeps coming after you,

93
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:04,412
and I don't know what to do.

94
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:07,381
I didn't go with you
to the police station...

95
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:10,352
because you told me
to head home, but...

96
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:14,092
Was it all right without me there?

97
00:05:15,092 --> 00:05:16,561
Everything was fine.

98
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:18,802
Besides, you're an actress...

99
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:20,532
and shouldn't get mixed up
in such scandals.

100
00:05:21,032 --> 00:05:24,402
You will continue to stay out of it
no matter what happens...

101
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:25,972
between me and Mr. Gong.

102
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:29,042
How can I when this is my fault?

103
00:05:29,172 --> 00:05:30,671
It's not.

104
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:33,441
There's another issue between us.

105
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:35,311
I'll explain it some other time.

106
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,551
Also,

107
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:40,421
I'll solve it all one by one,

108
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:44,522
so don't worry about anything.
Got it?

109
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:48,962
Sure. I got it.

110
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:53,702
Thanks, Pil Seung.

111
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,501
Don't be silly.

112
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:59,801
I told you to put your trust in me.

113
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:05,842
Pil Seung.

114
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:10,111
Now that I remember who I was,

115
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:15,491
I've been worried about
being outed as Do Ra,

116
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:19,522
and the thought of people
recognizing me has been terrifying.

117
00:06:21,162 --> 00:06:22,592
But on the other hand,

118
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:25,261
it's nice to be able
to talk to you...

119
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:27,131
about such things.

120
00:06:29,902 --> 00:06:31,272
Do Ra.

121
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:34,301
I mean, Ji Young.

122
00:06:36,511 --> 00:06:38,542
You have me by your side now.

123
00:06:39,912 --> 00:06:43,111
So don't be scared. All right?

124
00:06:44,982 --> 00:06:46,282
Sure.

125
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,321
You know what?

126
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:52,092
Even when it's just the two of us,

127
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:53,991
I won't call you "Do Ra."

128
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:55,931
Ji Young.

129
00:06:56,992 --> 00:06:59,162
You're Ji Young, not Do Ra.

130
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:02,001
You're Ji Young,
so nothing bad will happen.

131
00:07:03,102 --> 00:07:04,472
Okay?

132
00:07:05,602 --> 00:07:07,241
Okay, Pil Seung.

133
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:20,921
Yes.

134
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:23,121
Auntie's right.

135
00:07:23,891 --> 00:07:26,592
He can't beat me. I'm a Gong.

136
00:07:33,032 --> 00:07:34,402
Yes.

137
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:37,801
Everyone has a dirty secret or two.

138
00:07:38,742 --> 00:07:41,542
I'll do whatever it takes
to find his.

139
00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:44,542
It's not over until it's over.

140
00:07:50,612 --> 00:07:52,852
Darn it. My pretty face.

141
00:07:53,652 --> 00:07:56,321
How many times has he punched me?

142
00:07:57,121 --> 00:07:59,592
How should I crush him?

143
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:06,902
Do Ra!

144
00:08:10,102 --> 00:08:11,501
Hang on.

145
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:14,801
When Pil Seung yelled at Ji Young,

146
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:18,642
he said something like "Do Ra."

147
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:24,528
What am I thinking?

148
00:08:24,552 --> 00:08:26,352
He wouldn't call her "Do Ra."

149
00:08:28,052 --> 00:08:32,861
Hang on,
Ji Young never called me by my name.

150
00:08:33,461 --> 00:08:35,832
But she calls Pil Seung by his.

151
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:40,102
The more I think about it,
the more annoying it is.

152
00:08:41,432 --> 00:08:42,771
Shoot.

153
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:49,741
How was I booked for a beverage ad?

154
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:52,041
Tell me about it. Isn't it great?

155
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,187
You're being offered
a lot of money too.

156
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:57,052
- For real?
- Yes.

157
00:08:57,512 --> 00:08:58,852
They'll pay you well.

158
00:09:01,522 --> 00:09:03,291
What's taking them so long?

159
00:09:05,662 --> 00:09:08,261
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

160
00:09:08,961 --> 00:09:10,332
Hello.

161
00:09:23,912 --> 00:09:26,618
Mr. Gong. What are you doing here?

162
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:28,111
This is my company.

163
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:31,511
I suggested we hire Ms. Kim
to model our product.

164
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:33,557
Yes, that's right.

165
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:35,528
We work with Mr. Gong,

166
00:09:35,552 --> 00:09:37,967
and we called you
because he insisted on...

167
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:39,661
working with Ms. Kim.

168
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:42,661
I apologize.

169
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:46,031
I'm grateful for the offer,
but I can't accept it.

170
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:48,232
Goodbye.

171
00:09:53,002 --> 00:09:55,741
We had no idea
this was Mr. Gong's company.

172
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:59,518
You made things awkward by releasing
a one-sided engagement announcement.

173
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:01,712
It wouldn't be right
to shoot an ad with you.

174
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:06,052
I have no choice
but to support my actress's wishes.

175
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:08,822
Goodbye.

176
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:19,501
Kim Ji Young.

177
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:20,807
Let me ask you something.

178
00:10:20,831 --> 00:10:23,572
Mr. Gong.
What do you think you're doing?

179
00:10:25,272 --> 00:10:28,602
Hey. Stay out of it, punk.

180
00:10:29,571 --> 00:10:30,911
What?

181
00:10:31,372 --> 00:10:34,881
Mr. Lee. Wait in the car.
I'll be right out.

182
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:37,982
Are you sure about that?

183
00:10:40,152 --> 00:10:41,781
I'll be watching you.

184
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:44,651
Sure. Watch all you want.

185
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:46,722
Keep watching.

186
00:10:47,321 --> 00:10:48,661
Darn you.

187
00:10:56,971 --> 00:10:58,778
Do you have more to say to me?

188
00:10:58,802 --> 00:11:01,472
Yes. I have a lot more to say.

189
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:04,717
You wanted us to work things out.

190
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:07,488
You wanted to get back with me,

191
00:11:07,512 --> 00:11:09,427
and then you wanted out.

192
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:12,021
Why do you always
want things done your way?

193
00:11:12,152 --> 00:11:14,852
Go and ask any good psychiatrist.

194
00:11:15,122 --> 00:11:16,998
When ending a relationship,

195
00:11:17,022 --> 00:11:19,361
one needs time to get closure.

196
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:23,738
So even if you want
to end things with me,

197
00:11:23,762 --> 00:11:27,261
you need to give me the time
to get over you, right?

198
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:31,917
I need to be with you
while I try to move on.

199
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,401
I can't do that.

200
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:34,741
Why not?

201
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:36,842
I'm dating Director Ko Pil Seung.

202
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:44,582
How can you be so shameless?

203
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:46,422
Why?

204
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:47,752
Did you fall for him...

205
00:11:47,752 --> 00:11:49,628
because you heard
APP Group's chairman...

206
00:11:49,652 --> 00:11:51,922
would adopt him
and make him his heir?

207
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:54,998
Because you think
he'll inherit the company?

208
00:11:55,022 --> 00:11:58,562
Wake up, Ji Young.
You're going after the wrong guy.

209
00:11:58,662 --> 00:12:01,932
Pil Seung is a Ko. I'm a true Gong.

210
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:03,571
As long as I exist,

211
00:12:03,571 --> 00:12:07,271
Pil Seung will never take over
APP Group.

212
00:12:07,341 --> 00:12:09,317
The company belongs to me.

213
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:12,682
Come back to me
while I give you the chance to.

214
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,482
I'll take you back.

215
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:18,712
I can't believe
the nonsense I'm hearing.

216
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:22,192
What? "Nonsense?"

217
00:12:23,152 --> 00:12:25,291
- Did you talk down to me?
- What about it?

218
00:12:25,422 --> 00:12:28,092
Am I not allowed to talk the way
you speak to me?

219
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:31,161
Hey...

220
00:12:31,591 --> 00:12:32,861
Why are you acting like this to me?

221
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:36,832
Put a hand on your heart
and think why I'm doing this to you.

222
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:39,041
Think hard.

223
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:51,511
What am I to think?

224
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:55,791
What did I do to her?

225
00:12:59,491 --> 00:13:00,861
Darn it.

226
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:04,962
Is she the same Ji Young?

227
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:09,102
She dropped the dialect
and got a makeover, but...

228
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:14,501
I don't think
she's the Ji Young I once knew.

229
00:13:15,172 --> 00:13:16,942
She's totally different.

230
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,842
Why do I have the chills?

231
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:26,521
Why did you ask to see me in public?

232
00:13:26,882 --> 00:13:29,368
What if Jin Dan catches us together?

233
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,398
He has no time to mind us.

234
00:13:31,422 --> 00:13:35,121
He has a lot on his plate
and can't care about us.

235
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:39,161
Sang Gu. I need you to move
somewhere else right away.

236
00:13:39,231 --> 00:13:42,348
Why? Sun Young's a great cook,

237
00:13:42,372 --> 00:13:44,177
and I often drink with Hyun Chul.

238
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:45,871
I like how comfy the place is.

239
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:48,072
You can't care about food and drink.

240
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:49,911
Do you know who they are?

241
00:13:49,971 --> 00:13:51,911
They're our sworn enemies.

242
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:55,611
Their son stole Jin Dan's spot
as the chairman's adopted son.

243
00:13:55,782 --> 00:13:59,651
He's the biological brother
of our brainless Ma Ri.

244
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:01,852
Who? Hyun Chul's son?

245
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:04,822
How can his son be Ma Ri's brother?

246
00:14:05,991 --> 00:14:08,692
Then did Sun Young have a fling...

247
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:11,207
with Chairman Gong Jin Taek?

248
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:12,638
No.

249
00:14:12,662 --> 00:14:16,232
Ma Ri's mom abandoned him
at their door after giving birth.

250
00:14:16,632 --> 00:14:18,001
What?

251
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:21,672
The son
Chairman Gong's wife kept hidden...

252
00:14:21,672 --> 00:14:22,988
is Hyun Chul's son?

253
00:14:23,012 --> 00:14:25,881
Yes.
That's why you need to move out.

254
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:27,957
When they caught us together,

255
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:30,482
I managed to say we were cousins.

256
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:33,952
I don't think they bought it.

257
00:14:34,422 --> 00:14:37,728
Things will get really bad
if people realize we're dating.

258
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,462
You need to leave that place.

259
00:14:50,532 --> 00:14:51,871
Goodness.

260
00:14:53,971 --> 00:14:55,771
Sang Gu.

261
00:14:56,971 --> 00:14:59,611
Sang Gu. Are you in?

262
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,712
Hey.

263
00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:06,151
You're in.

264
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:08,667
My wife cooked a pot...

265
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:11,598
of delicious spicy rockfish stew.

266
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:13,868
Let's have some soju. Come on over.

267
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:17,932
No, thanks. I'm not in the mood
to have spicy stew with you.

268
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:21,361
Why not? Is something wrong?

269
00:15:21,662 --> 00:15:24,932
Hyun Chul.
I never pegged you as such a man.

270
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:26,872
I don't care
how hungry for money you are.

271
00:15:26,872 --> 00:15:28,771
How could you take advantage
of your own son?

272
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:32,011
What are you talking about?

273
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:33,741
I heard all about it.

274
00:15:34,211 --> 00:15:37,712
You allowed the APP Group family
to adopt your son.

275
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:39,182
How could you...

276
00:15:39,182 --> 00:15:41,682
send him to the woman
who kept him a secret for 30 years?

277
00:15:41,951 --> 00:15:44,398
Don't you have pride?
Do you love money that much?

278
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:47,898
So, how much did the family offer?

279
00:15:47,922 --> 00:15:49,537
What are you talking about?

280
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:51,691
You can't go and say
whatever you like.

281
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:53,201
Do you have a death wish?

282
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:55,001
- You punk...
- Get your hands off me.

283
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:57,972
You punk.

284
00:16:04,241 --> 00:16:05,641
What?

285
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,728
He said
that you took advantage of your son?

286
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:11,351
Yes. He said I had no pride
for sending him...

287
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:13,297
to the woman who left him with us.

288
00:16:13,321 --> 00:16:15,297
He said I did it for money.

289
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:17,622
I don't believe it.
Did he really say that?

290
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:20,238
My goodness.
Is that man out of his mind?

291
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:21,662
I hate him so much.

292
00:16:21,662 --> 00:16:23,591
- I hated him from the start.
- Right?

293
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:25,561
Why would Sang Gu...

294
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:28,478
make such a fuss over Mr. Gong
when he isn't even his son?

295
00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:30,932
Is he siding with them...

296
00:16:30,932 --> 00:16:32,172
because Ae Kyo's his cousin?

297
00:16:32,172 --> 00:16:35,618
Goodness. You'd think
Mr. Gong was actually his son.

298
00:16:35,642 --> 00:16:37,611
What? Cousins?

299
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:40,682
Sang Gu and Mr. Gong's mom
are cousins?

300
00:16:40,741 --> 00:16:44,482
Yes, apparently,
but I don't think so.

301
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:47,358
Sun Young and I caught them...

302
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,252
eating ramyeon together.

303
00:16:49,252 --> 00:16:51,628
I asked if they were first loves.

304
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:54,268
They both strongly denied it.

305
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:55,892
Sun Young.
You heard that too, right?

306
00:16:55,892 --> 00:16:58,561
Mr. Gong's mom
suddenly started stuttering.

307
00:16:58,561 --> 00:17:00,402
At first, she called him
"Honey, Sang Gu."

308
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:02,071
Then she said he was her cousin.

309
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:04,778
I mean,
who calls their cousin "honey?"

310
00:17:04,802 --> 00:17:07,941
Goodness. In my opinion,
they're definitely dating.

311
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:10,541
Yes, I agree. Cousin, my foot.

312
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:12,281
Goodness. Who cares?

313
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,852
I see. Now, I understand
why Sang Gu lashed out at you.

314
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:17,551
That must've been why.

315
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:21,652
If Sang Gu ends up marrying
Mr. Gong's mom later on,

316
00:17:21,652 --> 00:17:24,392
Mr. Gong will become his son.

317
00:17:24,622 --> 00:17:26,021
Is that why he did it?

318
00:17:26,491 --> 00:17:29,507
Mom, that makes total sense.
That must be it!

319
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:30,932
My goodness.

320
00:17:30,932 --> 00:17:32,432
If that's really true...

321
00:17:32,432 --> 00:17:35,301
I'm so baffled
that I don't even know what to say!

322
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:38,402
Oh, boy. I should tell Sang Gu
to move out.

323
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,201
I can't believe
he said I took advantage of my son.

324
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:44,517
How dare he run his mouth
like that? Gosh.

325
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,841
How much time does he have
until his lease expires?

326
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:48,828
Two years.

327
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:50,811
What? Two years?

328
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:53,451
Does that mean I have no choice
but to see him every day...

329
00:17:53,451 --> 00:17:56,521
for the next two years until
he moves out of his own accord?

330
00:17:56,822 --> 00:17:59,261
Darn it! My gosh.

331
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:02,791
Oh, boy. My goodness.

332
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:05,331
What happened?

333
00:18:05,362 --> 00:18:07,961
I swear, I put them here.

334
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,271
Did a ghost take them or what?

335
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:13,642
Where did they all go?

336
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:15,142
Oh, gosh.

337
00:18:15,741 --> 00:18:19,281
I was planning to use them...

338
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:21,088
to buy Ji Young...

339
00:18:21,112 --> 00:18:24,882
a ring, a necklace, a bracelet,

340
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:28,551
a fridge, and even a TV
when she got married.

341
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:31,791
That's why I collected them
one by one.

342
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,862
Did they suddenly get feet
and walk away?

343
00:18:34,862 --> 00:18:37,261
Or did they suddenly get wheels
and disappear? Oh, dear.

344
00:18:37,261 --> 00:18:38,691
- Hey.
- What?

345
00:18:38,691 --> 00:18:41,301
Are you sure
Grandma really had gold?

346
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:42,677
Maybe it was just her imagination.

347
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:45,571
My goodness.
I'm wondering the same thing.

348
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:49,001
No. I swear I had them.
I really did!

349
00:18:49,112 --> 00:18:50,818
Yes, she did.

350
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:53,541
I saw her take them out
to clean them once in a while.

351
00:18:54,241 --> 00:18:55,642
Oh, right.

352
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:59,382
I took a picture of them
a while ago just in case.

353
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:02,952
Here.

354
00:19:03,652 --> 00:19:05,192
Hey, is this real?

355
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:07,962
This much gold
would cost quite a bit.

356
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:10,962
Why did she have to
take a picture of them?

357
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:13,761
They won't suspect me, right?

358
00:19:14,132 --> 00:19:17,801
If I get caught,
I really will get kicked out.

359
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:20,102
Where could they be?

360
00:19:20,102 --> 00:19:22,672
We've searched through
the entire house.

361
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:25,372
Yes, that's right.

362
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,811
I was worried a thief might sneak in
at night and steal them,

363
00:19:28,882 --> 00:19:33,128
so I wrapped them carefully
in a black plastic bag.

364
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:34,658
I swear.

365
00:19:34,682 --> 00:19:38,122
- A black plastic bag?
- Yes.

366
00:19:38,122 --> 00:19:41,422
My goodness. Did you perhaps think
it was garbage...

367
00:19:41,422 --> 00:19:43,908
and throw it out?

368
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:47,162
What? I did take out the garbage
yesterday.

369
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,571
Oh, no!

370
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:53,971
That black plastic bag. I think
I threw it out with the trash.

371
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:55,812
Move! Oh, no!

372
00:19:55,812 --> 00:19:58,471
- For real? My gosh.
- Grandma!

373
00:19:58,471 --> 00:20:01,788
What do I do? This is crazy!

374
00:20:01,812 --> 00:20:05,511
I already checked every bag.
It's not here. Oh, no...

375
00:20:08,882 --> 00:20:10,991
It's not here. It really isn't here.

376
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:13,061
This is our trash.

377
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:16,432
Hey, leave it. I'll tidy up.

378
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:19,732
Gosh, it stinks. This is crazy.

379
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,301
Oh, dear. It stinks.

380
00:20:21,632 --> 00:20:22,972
Hand it over.

381
00:20:24,872 --> 00:20:26,172
You!

382
00:20:26,572 --> 00:20:29,511
It was you, wasn't it?
I bet it was you.

383
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:31,912
Gosh, Mom.
Why are you being like this?

384
00:20:31,912 --> 00:20:35,241
When I was admiring my gold,
you came into my room...

385
00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:37,682
and were like,
"My gosh. Is this gold?"

386
00:20:37,682 --> 00:20:39,781
"Is this real gold?"
Then you tried biting them...

387
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,927
and asked me to just give you one.

388
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,822
Mom, when?
When did I say such a thing?

389
00:20:44,822 --> 00:20:47,991
I've never seen any gold here!

390
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:52,908
You've never even seen it?
So, it wasn't you?

391
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:54,062
No!

392
00:20:54,062 --> 00:20:56,201
How could I throw out gold
that I haven't even seen?

393
00:20:56,201 --> 00:21:00,247
Besides, why would I throw out
real gold?

394
00:21:00,271 --> 00:21:01,702
Oh, dear.

395
00:21:01,842 --> 00:21:03,241
Then...

396
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,642
Then I must've thrown them out.

397
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:10,281
Oh, no. What do I do now?

398
00:21:16,462 --> 00:21:17,762
You can do it!

399
00:21:18,272 --> 00:21:19,572
I'll give it a go.

400
00:21:22,172 --> 00:21:23,648
How is it? Are you all right?

401
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:24,972
Yes, of course.

402
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:32,812
Amazing!
How will you come down though?

403
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,373
Amazing.

404
00:21:38,373 --> 00:21:39,802
- What do you think?
- You're good.

405
00:21:39,802 --> 00:21:42,173
- Right? Aren't I cool?
- Yes, that was awesome.

406
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:44,419
- What?
- Are you crying?

407
00:21:44,443 --> 00:21:46,404
Hey, why would I cry? It's just...

408
00:21:46,404 --> 00:21:48,513
I'm just sweating.
It wasn't even scary.

409
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,184
Do Jun, I had so much fun today.

410
00:21:55,384 --> 00:21:57,114
I had a great time too.

411
00:21:57,753 --> 00:22:00,224
You must be tired.
You should go inside.

412
00:22:01,193 --> 00:22:02,593
What?

413
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:04,924
Just go inside, like this?

414
00:22:05,693 --> 00:22:08,634
What? Aren't you tired?

415
00:22:09,164 --> 00:22:12,003
Don't you remember what today is?

416
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:17,574
What is today?

417
00:22:17,574 --> 00:22:19,003
You really don't remember?

418
00:22:19,174 --> 00:22:22,843
It's our 30th day as a couple.

419
00:22:24,783 --> 00:22:28,083
Hey, you actually keep track
of these things?

420
00:22:28,554 --> 00:22:30,154
Yes, and I'll keep doing it...

421
00:22:30,314 --> 00:22:32,723
because every day with you
is so precious...

422
00:22:32,723 --> 00:22:34,323
and feels like a miracle.

423
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,124
Ma Ri.

424
00:22:45,104 --> 00:22:47,003
That was a kiss
to celebrate our 30th day!

425
00:22:56,973 --> 00:22:58,384
Really?

426
00:23:01,654 --> 00:23:02,790
This is good.

427
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,753
Anyway, why did you suddenly
call us here, Ma Ri?

428
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,884
Oh, right.

429
00:23:08,094 --> 00:23:09,793
I have an important announcement
to make.

430
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:13,924
What? You have
an important announcement to make?

431
00:23:13,924 --> 00:23:17,840
Yes. Pil Seung really is going
to become my brother now.

432
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:20,003
I mean, he was already my brother,

433
00:23:20,003 --> 00:23:22,404
but now that he's becoming
your son on paper too,

434
00:23:22,404 --> 00:23:24,203
I feel like
he's wholly my brother now...

435
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,773
and that we've become a family.

436
00:23:25,773 --> 00:23:28,773
It makes me very happy,
so I wanted to celebrate it.

437
00:23:29,144 --> 00:23:31,183
And I have an important announcement
to make,

438
00:23:31,183 --> 00:23:32,384
so I wanted to treat
all of you today,

439
00:23:32,384 --> 00:23:35,253
but how come Dad isn't here?
It's such a bummer.

440
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:38,429
He suddenly had a client arrive
from overseas.

441
00:23:38,453 --> 00:23:40,253
Ma Ri, what is
this important announcement?

442
00:23:40,624 --> 00:23:43,823
Have you got a boyfriend?

443
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,969
Pil Seung, how did you know?

444
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:50,233
How did I know? Ma Ri, I know you
like the back of my hand.

445
00:23:50,493 --> 00:23:53,634
So, tell us everything about him.
Don't leave anything out.

446
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:57,204
Okay. That's why
I called you here anyway.

447
00:23:57,404 --> 00:24:00,444
Ma Ri, is this really true?

448
00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:04,714
Yes, we've been dating
for over 30 days now.

449
00:24:05,013 --> 00:24:07,790
What? It's been 30 days?

450
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:10,683
Hey, how come you didn't tell me?

451
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:13,854
Well, I really wanted to tell you
but held myself back.

452
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:16,924
They say you shouldn't pop
the champagne too soon.

453
00:24:18,193 --> 00:24:20,194
What? You know that saying?

454
00:24:20,894 --> 00:24:22,364
Anyway, what's he like?

455
00:24:23,394 --> 00:24:24,763
Hey.

456
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:27,604
Other than Mr. Park, you don't
really have any guy friends.

457
00:24:27,604 --> 00:24:30,934
Mr. Park told me
you weren't seeing anyone.

458
00:24:31,773 --> 00:24:35,573
The truth is, it is Mr. Park.
It's Do Jun.

459
00:24:38,783 --> 00:24:41,513
What? It's Mr. Park?

460
00:24:42,783 --> 00:24:46,454
Mr. Park? You mean,
your driver and bodyguard?

461
00:24:47,824 --> 00:24:49,753
But I think you like him more
than he likes you.

462
00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:52,669
That's right. I like him more.

463
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:53,693
Is it that obvious?

464
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,293
Yes, it's so obvious.

465
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:58,503
Hey, Ma Ri. You're blushing now.

466
00:24:58,503 --> 00:24:59,864
Hey, stop.

467
00:25:14,314 --> 00:25:18,724
What? Why are Ma Ri and Mr. Park
holding hands?

468
00:25:24,124 --> 00:25:25,523
What did you say?

469
00:25:25,664 --> 00:25:28,464
Honey, so you knew about it?

470
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:31,063
I only found out about it today.

471
00:25:31,193 --> 00:25:32,763
They've been dating for 30 days.

472
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:36,110
Honey, what have you been doing?

473
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,973
She's been seeing Mr. Park
for 30 days,

474
00:25:37,973 --> 00:25:39,573
and you had no idea?

475
00:25:40,304 --> 00:25:42,614
As a driver,
Do Jun does his job well,

476
00:25:42,614 --> 00:25:44,043
and he's a good guy.

477
00:25:44,174 --> 00:25:46,560
But I've never considered him
as Ma Ri's future husband.

478
00:25:46,584 --> 00:25:48,414
At first, I was surprised too.

479
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,713
But, honey.
Let's look on the bright side...

480
00:25:50,713 --> 00:25:52,684
for Ma Ri's sake.

481
00:25:53,483 --> 00:25:55,924
I was wondering
why she had been in a good mood,

482
00:25:55,924 --> 00:25:58,424
and it must be because of Do Jun.

483
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:03,009
If you think about it,
he truly cares for her.

484
00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:06,704
Do Jun told her
he'd protect her forever.

485
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:11,204
Men will say anything
to seduce women.

486
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:13,444
Honey, please.

487
00:26:13,743 --> 00:26:15,614
Have you already forgotten?

488
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:18,259
They first met
because Do Jun showed up...

489
00:26:18,283 --> 00:26:20,414
to protect her.

490
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:26,224
But on top of everything,
Ma Ri likes him and is happy.

491
00:26:26,354 --> 00:26:29,793
I'm thrilled to know
that she has a boyfriend.

492
00:26:29,793 --> 00:26:31,354
Aren't you?

493
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,394
I'm also excited to know
she's seeing someone.

494
00:26:35,564 --> 00:26:38,704
But why did it have to be
Mr. Park of all people?

495
00:26:39,404 --> 00:26:42,104
I would've found
a nice young man for her.

496
00:26:42,374 --> 00:26:43,650
Honey.

497
00:26:43,674 --> 00:26:47,174
We went out of our way
to find someone for her,

498
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:49,013
but it hasn't been easy.

499
00:26:50,414 --> 00:26:53,543
Mr. Park only works for us
because of his financial situation.

500
00:26:53,543 --> 00:26:56,384
He used to study abroad
and is courteous,

501
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,384
smart, and kind.

502
00:26:58,953 --> 00:27:00,824
I believe
he's a diamond in the rough...

503
00:27:00,824 --> 00:27:02,993
with a lot of potential.

504
00:27:05,064 --> 00:27:08,194
I get it for now.
We'll let it play out.

505
00:27:08,634 --> 00:27:12,479
Still, be absolutely clear
with Ma Ri,

506
00:27:12,503 --> 00:27:14,303
and don't let the feelings deepen.

507
00:27:14,463 --> 00:27:16,080
She's only allowed
to hold hands with him.

508
00:27:16,104 --> 00:27:18,280
Also... No, wait.

509
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:22,374
I'll need to sit down with Mr. Park
and tell him myself.

510
00:27:24,614 --> 00:27:26,344
I know you're biased
when it comes to your daughter,

511
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,054
but this is wrong.

512
00:27:28,054 --> 00:27:29,854
One would laugh at you right now.

513
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:34,624
Unbelievable. Why did it
have to be him of all people?

514
00:27:47,304 --> 00:27:48,974
My gosh!

515
00:27:50,273 --> 00:27:54,050
What kind of a nightmare was that?
I had dung fall on me from the sky.

516
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:55,773
Did it have to land on my face?

517
00:27:59,114 --> 00:28:01,083
Hold on.
Doesn't that symbolize a jackpot?

518
00:28:01,384 --> 00:28:04,583
Seeing yellow dung in your dream
means you'll be hit with money.

519
00:28:07,384 --> 00:28:10,194
But what good would the dream do
when I can't do anything about it?

520
00:28:11,624 --> 00:28:14,223
Darn. This is a day
to sit at the table,

521
00:28:14,223 --> 00:28:16,993
but I don't have the money for it.

522
00:28:27,503 --> 00:28:31,043
That's right. There's her.

523
00:28:35,354 --> 00:28:37,290
Do you mean that?

524
00:28:37,314 --> 00:28:40,154
You won't be against me
dating Do Jun?

525
00:28:40,253 --> 00:28:43,870
That's right.
I was wrong to think that way.

526
00:28:43,894 --> 00:28:46,463
You and Do Jun
are head over heels for each other,

527
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:48,469
and I shouldn't disapprove.

528
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,610
You have my blessing to date him,

529
00:28:50,634 --> 00:28:52,209
so have fun.

530
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:55,033
I asked you here to tell you that.

531
00:28:55,104 --> 00:28:57,404
Really? Thank you so much...

532
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:59,874
for giving me your approval
when I lack in many ways.

533
00:29:00,104 --> 00:29:02,919
Mother, I'll only do better.

534
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:05,944
I'll love Do Jun
the best that I can.

535
00:29:06,384 --> 00:29:09,583
What does she mean by doing
the best she can to love him?

536
00:29:09,683 --> 00:29:11,083
She's giving me a headache.

537
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:18,823
Anyway, I...

538
00:29:19,664 --> 00:29:23,164
I approved of you two dating,

539
00:29:24,094 --> 00:29:26,934
but I am so sorry to you...

540
00:29:27,104 --> 00:29:30,273
because our family
has nothing to show for itself.

541
00:29:30,904 --> 00:29:33,303
Why? Why would you
say sorry for that?

542
00:29:33,344 --> 00:29:34,773
It's fine by me.

543
00:29:35,243 --> 00:29:38,743
How can I get this rolling
when she doesn't catch my drift?

544
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:41,114
You've got to be kidding me.

545
00:29:42,054 --> 00:29:45,583
You see, back in the day,

546
00:29:45,753 --> 00:29:49,523
we used to be well off
but then we lost everything.

547
00:29:50,654 --> 00:29:53,223
I'm trying to get the family
back on its feet,

548
00:29:53,223 --> 00:29:55,763
but it's easier said than done.

549
00:29:55,763 --> 00:29:57,293
I'll need money...

550
00:29:57,293 --> 00:29:59,239
to send Do Jun abroad
to study again...

551
00:29:59,263 --> 00:30:02,803
and later on pay
for his wedding and such.

552
00:30:03,074 --> 00:30:04,580
I see.

553
00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:07,604
Mother, don't worry
about things like that.

554
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,320
I can pay
for Do Jun's education abroad,

555
00:30:10,344 --> 00:30:11,914
and the wedding
will be taken care of...

556
00:30:11,914 --> 00:30:13,783
should he want to marry me.

557
00:30:17,513 --> 00:30:19,823
That being said,
could I borrow some money?

558
00:30:20,154 --> 00:30:23,354
I'm trying to open
a side dish store,

559
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:25,593
but I don't have the money.

560
00:30:26,263 --> 00:30:27,563
What?

561
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:29,993
You don't have any money?

562
00:30:30,334 --> 00:30:31,634
That's right.

563
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:37,303
My gosh.

564
00:30:46,683 --> 00:30:48,783
She actually wired the money!

565
00:30:50,814 --> 00:30:51,824
I had nothing to lose...

566
00:30:51,824 --> 00:30:53,454
and said 200,000 dollars
instead of 100,000,

567
00:30:53,523 --> 00:30:55,229
which she gave me.

568
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:58,239
If I had asked for 300,000 dollars,
that's what I would've gotten.

569
00:30:58,263 --> 00:30:59,593
My gosh.

570
00:31:00,164 --> 00:31:03,763
No, stop. Don't get greedy.

571
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:08,164
I can open my business
with just 150,000 dollars alone.

572
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:12,644
Then I have 50,000 dollars to spare!

573
00:31:19,114 --> 00:31:20,414
What?

574
00:31:20,844 --> 00:31:23,360
Ma Ri wired 200,000 dollars
out of her account?

575
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:25,854
Yes, sir.
This has never happened before,

576
00:31:26,283 --> 00:31:29,023
so I was wondering
if she was phished.

577
00:31:29,793 --> 00:31:32,323
All right. You're dismissed.

578
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:35,746
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

579
00:31:44,134 --> 00:31:46,003
Ma Ri,

580
00:31:46,473 --> 00:31:49,543
you wired 200,000 dollars
from your account.

581
00:31:49,713 --> 00:31:52,013
What did you spend it on?

582
00:31:52,513 --> 00:31:53,884
Why do you ask?

583
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:56,753
You know
how people are phished these days.

584
00:31:56,753 --> 00:31:58,283
I know that wasn't the case,

585
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:00,954
but I was worried.

586
00:32:01,324 --> 00:32:04,654
Dad, I'm not stupid
and will never fall victim to that.

587
00:32:04,753 --> 00:32:06,194
I...

588
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:11,263
I invested the money with someone
who is precious to me.

589
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,563
An investment?

590
00:32:14,404 --> 00:32:16,003
What kind of an investment?

591
00:32:16,273 --> 00:32:17,780
You don't have to know, Dad.

592
00:32:17,804 --> 00:32:19,743
Anyway, don't worry.

593
00:32:24,914 --> 00:32:27,483
Yes, Mr. Kim. It's me.

594
00:32:27,743 --> 00:32:29,253
Find out
who Ma Ri wired the money to...

595
00:32:29,253 --> 00:32:31,053
and do a background check.

596
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:33,954
That's right.

597
00:32:35,624 --> 00:32:36,954
Sure.

598
00:32:46,404 --> 00:32:47,864
I'm the first player so...

599
00:32:49,104 --> 00:32:51,273
- Lastly...
- I'm on a roll today.

600
00:32:51,674 --> 00:32:54,120
All in, guys.

601
00:32:54,144 --> 00:32:55,513
Gosh.

602
00:32:56,543 --> 00:32:59,184
- I'll fold. It's your turn.
- Ms. Kim, what's wrong?

603
00:32:59,414 --> 00:33:01,114
- Bring it.
- Same here.

604
00:33:01,443 --> 00:33:04,053
Ms. Kim, why did you fold?

605
00:33:32,084 --> 00:33:33,414
Honey.

606
00:33:34,644 --> 00:33:36,854
Maybe I should come to you.

607
00:33:40,584 --> 00:33:43,523
I should've joined you
when you died.

608
00:33:46,394 --> 00:33:47,763
Or maybe...

609
00:33:48,564 --> 00:33:50,493
I should cut off my hand.

610
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,404
Honey, cut my hand off by the wrist.

611
00:33:59,243 --> 00:34:01,273
I can't possibly call myself human.

612
00:34:01,743 --> 00:34:04,343
How could I have gambled away
all that money?

613
00:34:06,513 --> 00:34:07,914
No.

614
00:34:08,453 --> 00:34:10,114
It can't just be my hand.

615
00:34:11,354 --> 00:34:13,124
I'd be better off dead.

616
00:34:13,983 --> 00:34:15,323
That's right.

617
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:19,463
I'll die right here.

618
00:34:19,764 --> 00:34:22,533
I'll die.

619
00:34:23,293 --> 00:34:27,233
Die, darn it. Why bother living?

620
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:31,734
Honey, take me to where you are.

621
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:35,673
Take me to where you are.

622
00:34:35,744 --> 00:34:39,584
Take me to where you are.

623
00:34:41,143 --> 00:34:43,513
Honey, take me to where you are...

624
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:56,463
You should go inside.

625
00:34:57,063 --> 00:34:58,394
Sure.

626
00:35:05,844 --> 00:35:09,119
Hold on.
Why is Do Jun entering Dad's study?

627
00:35:09,143 --> 00:35:12,443
Ma Ri, you should head upstairs.

628
00:35:13,413 --> 00:35:15,559
Why? Did something happen?

629
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:17,713
Is this why you came to work here?

630
00:35:17,813 --> 00:35:20,224
To rob Ma Ri of her money?

631
00:35:21,523 --> 00:35:24,300
Mom, is Dad yelling at Do Jun?

632
00:35:24,324 --> 00:35:25,700
What's wrong with him?

633
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,524
You didn't know?

634
00:35:27,594 --> 00:35:29,463
Do you expect me to believe that?

635
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:31,234
Mr. Gong,

636
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,604
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

637
00:35:34,163 --> 00:35:36,234
It wasn't me.

638
00:35:38,943 --> 00:35:40,904
Dad, why are you yelling at him?

639
00:35:40,904 --> 00:35:42,974
Ma Ri, we should leave.

640
00:35:43,014 --> 00:35:45,990
Dad, why are you yelling at Do Jun?

641
00:35:46,014 --> 00:35:49,084
Park Do Jun's mom
took 200,000 dollars from you,

642
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,059
and he was in on it.

643
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,954
He has been dating you
to gain access to your money.

644
00:35:53,954 --> 00:35:55,854
He's a con artist!

645
00:35:56,623 --> 00:35:59,793
Dad, that's not it.
Do Jun's not like that.

646
00:35:59,793 --> 00:36:04,309
I gave his mother the money
out of the goodness of my heart.

647
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,664
She said she was opening
a side dish store.

648
00:36:07,704 --> 00:36:09,004
Ma Ri,

649
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:13,144
did you really give money to my mom?

650
00:36:14,603 --> 00:36:17,274
Yes, I did.

651
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:21,684
She said she needed some.

652
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,689
Mr. Park, you are fired as of today.

653
00:36:24,713 --> 00:36:27,354
Get out of my house this instant!

654
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:30,024
I'm sorry.

655
00:36:31,193 --> 00:36:32,624
I'm sorry, sir.

656
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:34,369
Do Jun!

657
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:36,093
Ma Ri, you can't!

658
00:36:50,261 --> 00:36:53,371
Park Do Jun's mom
took 200,000 dollars from you,

659
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,777
and he was in on it.

660
00:36:55,801 --> 00:36:58,646
He has been dating you
to gain access to your money.

661
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,441
He's a con artist!

662
00:37:12,091 --> 00:37:13,420
Do Jun.

663
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,061
Is it true?

664
00:37:16,261 --> 00:37:19,191
Did you and your mom
target me for my money?

665
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,661
Did you date me...

666
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:24,731
and tell me you'd protect me...

667
00:37:25,571 --> 00:37:27,271
because I was rich?

668
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,711
You didn't, right?

669
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,840
Tell me you didn't.

670
00:37:35,141 --> 00:37:36,480
- Ma Ri...
- Do Jun,

671
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,110
I know you're not
that kind of person.

672
00:37:39,611 --> 00:37:41,781
So please tell me
it's a misunderstanding.

673
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:43,920
You're not a bad person.

674
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,990
Right.

675
00:37:48,761 --> 00:37:50,090
I wasn't in on it.

676
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,090
I didn't deceive you.

677
00:37:53,261 --> 00:37:55,001
I didn't date you for your money.

678
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,601
But...

679
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,431
it's true that my mom scammed you
out of your money,

680
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,941
which is why
I can't be with you anymore.

681
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,280
Why should we break up
if you didn't do anything wrong?

682
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,050
Do Jun, what did I just hear?

683
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,981
- Do Sik.
- Answer me!

684
00:38:22,721 --> 00:38:24,561
Well, I...

685
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:27,630
What do you mean
I scammed her out of her money?

686
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,070
Gosh, Do Jun. You have it all wrong.
I just borrowed the money from her.

687
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,241
Your sister cut me off
from managing her money,

688
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:39,270
and all I could be was an old woman
who mooched off her family.

689
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,281
I briefly borrowed the money
to start my own business.

690
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:46,450
It was a way
to stand on my own two feet.

691
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,820
At the risk of his reputation?

692
00:38:49,281 --> 00:38:51,250
Her family called him
a scam artist too.

693
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,697
They accused him
of running a con with you!

694
00:38:53,721 --> 00:38:57,061
Those people are impossible.
No one conned anyone.

695
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,361
She voluntarily gave me the money.

696
00:39:00,361 --> 00:39:01,661
Mom!

697
00:39:01,661 --> 00:39:03,200
Do Jun, please.

698
00:39:03,661 --> 00:39:05,700
Ms. Baek,
where's the 200,000 dollars?

699
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,600
We'll believe everything you say,

700
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,041
so give us the 200,000 dollars
you borrowed from her.

701
00:39:14,781 --> 00:39:16,211
I don't have it.

702
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,911
It's all gone.

703
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,650
Mom.

704
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,621
What do you mean
the 200,000 dollars is gone?

705
00:39:26,221 --> 00:39:30,090
Mom, did you perhaps
gamble away that money?

706
00:39:30,591 --> 00:39:31,931
Don't say it's true.

707
00:39:32,591 --> 00:39:34,331
Please don't say it's true.

708
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,730
Mom, I need to pay that money back.

709
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,531
So please,
give me the money right now.

710
00:39:40,531 --> 00:39:42,846
Give it to me!

711
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,170
Do Jun.

712
00:39:44,911 --> 00:39:47,141
Do Jun, I'm sorry.

713
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,711
I had money on my hands
and wanted to double it.

714
00:39:52,051 --> 00:39:53,411
I mean,

715
00:39:53,781 --> 00:39:56,451
I wanted the 200,000 dollars
to become 300,000 dollars...

716
00:39:56,451 --> 00:39:58,691
but lost all of it.

717
00:39:59,551 --> 00:40:03,237
Afterwards, I went to the Han River
to fall in and die.

718
00:40:03,261 --> 00:40:06,407
I mean it.
I was really on that bridge.

719
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:09,031
Do Jun, Ji Young, Do Sik,
please forgive me.

720
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:12,201
You know, I...

721
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:16,241
I'll earn the money
and pay it all back.

722
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:18,170
Do Jun, Ji Young, Do Sik,

723
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:21,887
please forgive your mother.

724
00:40:21,911 --> 00:40:24,010
How could you do this?

725
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:27,510
How could you do this?

726
00:40:29,781 --> 00:40:31,291
It's the police!

727
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,820
Right. Just a second.

728
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,731
Please come in.

729
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:39,991
What is this about?

730
00:40:39,991 --> 00:40:41,900
You reported gold that was missing.

731
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,000
Yes, I filed the report.

732
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,400
We looked into stolen goods...

733
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,131
and found the gold
that was reported.

734
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:49,501
It was Ms. Baek Mi Ja
who pawned them off.

735
00:40:52,971 --> 00:40:54,241
Hold on a second.

736
00:40:54,241 --> 00:40:56,940
Did you sell Grandma's gold?

737
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,581
Is that it?

738
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,520
Gosh, I'm sorry.

739
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,891
I'm terribly sorry.

740
00:41:04,891 --> 00:41:07,560
I'm sorry!

741
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,161
I'm sorry.

742
00:41:11,631 --> 00:41:14,630
I'm so sorry.

743
00:41:14,701 --> 00:41:17,900
I'm sorry...

744
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:21,170
I'm sorry... My goodness.

745
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:24,441
I'm so sorry.

746
00:41:25,741 --> 00:41:29,411
I'm sorry!

747
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,661
Mom.

748
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,001
I was willing to look past
what you did to Do Ra.

749
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,871
But from this moment on,
I'm done with you.

750
00:41:58,971 --> 00:42:00,911
Do Sik, don't say that.

751
00:42:00,911 --> 00:42:04,711
I told you I was sorry!

752
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:10,380
Our baby brother,
who you love and cherish.

753
00:42:11,051 --> 00:42:13,050
Look at what you did to him.

754
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:18,431
Our family was ruined overnight,

755
00:42:18,761 --> 00:42:22,561
but our baby brother lived his life
holding his head up high.

756
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,371
He was finally at a place
to be in love and be happy,

757
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,170
but you...

758
00:42:29,201 --> 00:42:31,740
made him look like
a shameless gold digger.

759
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,380
Do Sik, I'm sorry.

760
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:40,581
Please forgive me this once.

761
00:42:41,721 --> 00:42:45,190
I couldn't possibly live
without you.

762
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,051
Please don't abandon me.

763
00:42:47,051 --> 00:42:50,621
Please forgive me.

764
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:55,161
Do Sik, please. I mean it.

765
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,330
If I ever gamble again,

766
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:00,670
I'll cut off my hand by the wrist.

767
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:04,670
Do Sik, please forgive me.

768
00:43:04,741 --> 00:43:07,411
Do Sik, no! Don't go.

769
00:43:07,411 --> 00:43:10,681
Don't go, Do Sik. Take me with you.

770
00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:13,611
Take me with you.
I can't live without you.

771
00:43:13,611 --> 00:43:15,580
I can't live without you, Do Sik.

772
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,920
Do Sik!

773
00:43:32,131 --> 00:43:34,101
Hey, Ji Young.

774
00:43:37,971 --> 00:43:39,311
Do Sik.

775
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:48,950
Do Sik.

776
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:51,391
It's 200,000 dollars.

777
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,691
Pay the family back.

778
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,590
Where did you even get
this kind of money?

779
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,531
I received payment...

780
00:44:00,531 --> 00:44:02,260
for the episodes I did
and the ad campaign.

781
00:44:08,801 --> 00:44:10,170
I'm sorry about this.

782
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,340
As your brother,
this burden should fall on me.

783
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,950
No, Do Sik.

784
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:22,450
That's not true.

785
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,550
Please don't say that.

786
00:44:51,611 --> 00:44:55,981
This is the money my mother,
Baek Mi Ja, took from your daughter.

787
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,251
I apologize instead. I'm so sorry.

788
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,661
Thanks. You can go now.

789
00:45:08,031 --> 00:45:09,360
Sir.

790
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,501
My mother...

791
00:45:12,971 --> 00:45:16,041
wronged your daughter terribly.

792
00:45:17,741 --> 00:45:21,541
I'm deeply ashamed and truly sorry.

793
00:45:23,241 --> 00:45:24,610
But...

794
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,450
Do Jun didn't know anything.

795
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,050
He's innocent.

796
00:45:33,491 --> 00:45:34,996
You can put him anywhere...

797
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,461
and he won't stray
from the right path.

798
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:40,530
Do Jun didn't do
anything bad or wrong.

799
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:45,800
What I mean is...

800
00:45:47,201 --> 00:45:50,041
I hope you believe me.

801
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,481
If that's all, you can leave.

802
00:46:11,531 --> 00:46:12,860
You know,

803
00:46:14,361 --> 00:46:16,061
I felt sorry for our mom.

804
00:46:19,031 --> 00:46:20,701
When Dad died,

805
00:46:20,701 --> 00:46:23,471
she was in her mid-30s,

806
00:46:23,471 --> 00:46:25,811
so around my age right now.

807
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:31,081
She was a young woman
with three young kids.

808
00:46:31,551 --> 00:46:34,610
She had to struggle
and suffer on her own.

809
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:37,251
It was tough.

810
00:46:39,991 --> 00:46:41,690
Do Jun, you were too young then,

811
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:44,831
so you wouldn't remember
what Mom was like then.

812
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,231
She wasn't like this at first.

813
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,331
She sold apples and Korean melons
in a market...

814
00:46:52,701 --> 00:46:54,501
and washed dishes at diners.

815
00:46:55,971 --> 00:46:58,141
She had a really hard time.

816
00:46:58,741 --> 00:47:00,340
I saw it all.

817
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,311
I don't know since when,

818
00:47:06,111 --> 00:47:09,751
but Mom started to play cards
with people at the market.

819
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:14,121
I couldn't tell her...

820
00:47:15,821 --> 00:47:17,760
to stop what she was doing.

821
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:22,161
I thought it was the only joy
in her dreary life.

822
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,170
Even when Do Ra fell into the sea,

823
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,371
I couldn't leave Mom.

824
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:37,711
I knew she'd done terribly wrong,
but I couldn't leave her. Why not?

825
00:47:38,681 --> 00:47:40,181
Because...

826
00:47:41,181 --> 00:47:42,681
she was our mom.

827
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,720
I couldn't leave her.

828
00:47:49,591 --> 00:47:50,721
If I had then,

829
00:47:50,721 --> 00:47:53,090
your lives now wouldn't be
as tough as they are.

830
00:47:54,701 --> 00:47:56,731
I dragged you down with me.

831
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,670
I'm sorry. It's all on me.

832
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,871
No, Do Sik.

833
00:48:03,141 --> 00:48:04,441
It's not on you.

834
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:11,811
We no longer have a mom.

835
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,657
I'll pretend Mom died too
when Do Ra did.

836
00:48:15,681 --> 00:48:17,681
That's what I'll think from now on.

837
00:48:17,891 --> 00:48:20,191
You should do the same.

838
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:23,461
Do Jun.

839
00:48:25,991 --> 00:48:27,331
Do Ra.

840
00:48:28,201 --> 00:48:29,530
I'm sorry.

841
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:32,200
I'm so sorry.

Congratulations.

849

- Well done.
- Congratulations.

850

Stop it, everyone.

851
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:10,890
I'm too embarrassed.

852
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:14,496
I owe it all to every one of you
who worked hard in the summer heat.

All you actors
and the crew members as well.

Let's do it.

- Hey.
- What's that?

860
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:32,980
Who sent that?

861
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,325
- A truck?
- Free snacks?

862
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:37,249
I wasn't told about this.

863
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:44,190
Thank you, everyone.

864
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,790
- Darn it.
- Not him again.

865
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:46,889
I made a lot...

866
00:49:46,889 --> 00:49:48,790
because "Seoul Lady" was a hit
from the start.

867
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:50,066
I rented this truck...

868
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:52,899
so you can have
all the coffee you want.

869
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:56,069
I even brought along some gelato
I had shipped from Italy,

870
00:49:56,069 --> 00:49:59,770
so have some and cool down, okay?

Ji Young,
are you really engaged to him?

873
00:50:04,779 --> 00:50:06,980
It was in the news then it wasn't,

874
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:10,249
then a correction was released,
so I thought it was just a rumor.

875
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,695
Are you seeing him again?

876
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:14,519
I'm not. There's nothing between us.

877
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,396
Bring out the panel.

878
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:19,390
Bring it over here,

00:50:33,299 --> 00:50:34,700
Let's talk.

885
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,070
Okay. Let's.

886
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:47,980
(In support of Actress Kim Ji Young)

887
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:53,959
Mr. Gong. Why are you doing this?

888
00:50:53,989 --> 00:50:56,689
Why do you keep asking me
why I'm doing this?

889
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:59,399
How much more must I explain?

890
00:51:00,299 --> 00:51:02,229
I told you last time.

891
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:04,869
I need time to get over you.

892
00:51:05,799 --> 00:51:09,309
I'm not yet ready to let you go.

893
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:12,580
Ji Young. As a fan,

894
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,279
I'm here to congratulate you
on the hit...

895
00:51:15,279 --> 00:51:16,849
and help you look good.

896
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:19,250
Why don't you accept
my sincere intentions?

897
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,896
Even if
your intentions are innocent,

898
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,490
forcing yourself onto someone
is the definition of abuse.

899
00:51:24,819 --> 00:51:26,566
I don't want it.

900
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,505
Why keep doing what I don't want?

901
00:51:28,529 --> 00:51:31,590
What will people think of me
when they see what you do?

902
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,405
I don't want to be misunderstood
because of you.

903
00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:38,000
So please stop it.

904
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,470
I can't stop it.

905
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,999
I told you...

906
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:43,345
that I'm not done with you.

907
00:51:43,369 --> 00:51:45,510
You'll keep this up, then?

908
00:51:46,179 --> 00:51:49,050
Okay. You give me no choice.

909
00:51:49,409 --> 00:51:53,079
I wasn't going to do this
for the sake of your reputation.

910
00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:55,795
I'll report you for stalking me...

911
00:51:55,819 --> 00:51:57,849
and get a restraining order.

912
00:51:58,989 --> 00:52:01,160
Wait. You'll do what?

913
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,760
I'm a stalker?

914
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:05,729
You'll report me?

915
00:52:06,429 --> 00:52:09,500
Hey. I didn't hit you, lock you up,

916
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,669
or call you hundreds of times.

917
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,869
What did I do that you'd report me?

918
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:17,345
I'm just an innocent fan of yours.

919
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:18,980
I'm a fan.

920
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,709
Hey, you, Gong Jin Dan!

921
00:52:22,779 --> 00:52:24,180
My gosh.

922
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,220
What did you just say?

923
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:30,689
"Hey, you, Gong Jin Dan?"

924
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:33,420
How dare you talk to me like that?

925
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,130
I'm years older than you.

926
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:36,730
Are you on something?

927
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:38,800
You must be on something.

928
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:40,729
You don't take me seriously.

929
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:43,599
Stop this
before I turn really nasty.

930
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:47,800
If you act like a lunatic again,
I'll report you right away!

931
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:50,640
This is your last warning.

932
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,289
That's not Kim Ji Young.

933
00:53:04,219 --> 00:53:07,760
She still has Ji Young's face,

934
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,590
but her mind has changed.

935
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,300
She's possessed by someone else.

936
00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:17,800
Mr. Gong tried to sign her
to appear in an ad?

937
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:22,809
Yes. He keeps spending money
to throw himself at Ji Young.

938
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:24,939
He's just wasting it.

939
00:53:25,409 --> 00:53:27,380
I don't know what he's up to.

940
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:31,579
So, what happened?

941
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:33,925
Ji Young walked out
saying she wouldn't do it.

942
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:36,189
She doesn't care about him at all.

943
00:53:36,489 --> 00:53:39,160
So now, he rented a coffee truck.

944
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,706
What should we do about him?

945
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:46,399
I'll take care of it,
so it doesn't happen again.

946
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:49,505
I'm sorry
to stress you out like this.

947
00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:51,300
I should handle it on my end.

948
00:53:52,139 --> 00:53:54,140
It's fine. Thanks for telling me.

949
00:53:54,739 --> 00:53:56,070
Okay.

950
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,440
I'll go now, then.

951
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,715
Yes.

952
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:01,110
Thank you.

953
00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:12,059
Kim Ji Young is getting engaged.

954
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:13,720
Here's the article.

955
00:54:15,727 --> 00:54:17,598
(Gong Jin Dan and Kim Ji Young
Engaged After Dating for 1 Year)

956
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,499
We published a correction...

957
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:23,876
saying that
the engagement wasn't true.

958
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,800
But the articles keep
getting put down.

959
00:54:26,699 --> 00:54:29,086
And we asked them to delete
the articles about my engagement,

960
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:31,309
but they just kept going viral
on social media.

961
00:54:32,779 --> 00:54:34,680
Mr. Gong locked me...

962
00:54:36,849 --> 00:54:38,249
in the vacation home.

963
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:44,890
I want to get away from him.

964
00:54:47,219 --> 00:54:50,430
I'm so miserable around him.

965
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:54,499
He's already giving me a hard time,

966
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:57,000
so if he finds out that I'm Do Ra,

967
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,769
I don't even know what he will do.
It really scares me.

968
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,160
Ji Young.

969
00:55:31,639 --> 00:55:34,999
Hey. You owe me an apology
about something, don't you?

970
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,369
You've been on pins and needles.

971
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:40,340
You've been acting weird today.

972
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:43,010
Give me your hand.

973
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,380
My hand?

974
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:01,630
Ji Young.

975
00:56:04,469 --> 00:56:05,999
Marry me.

976
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:20,619
Marry you?

977
00:56:22,819 --> 00:56:24,450
What are you talking about?

978
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:31,760
Once the drama "Seoul Lady" is over,

979
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:34,160
let's get married.

980
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,329
Since the moment I found out
that you were Do Ra,

981
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,169
I've been wanting to marry you.

982
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,209
That is absurd.

983
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:45,640
How can I marry you?

984
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:47,780
What's absurd about it?

985
00:56:48,509 --> 00:56:50,309
We met again after many hurdles,

986
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:52,280
and we love each other.

987
00:56:53,849 --> 00:56:55,590
Besides, I feel like...

988
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:58,720
we must get married
so I can protect you.

989
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:08,899
Pil Seung.

990
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:12,340
You know I'm Park Do Ra.

991
00:57:13,299 --> 00:57:14,999
I am dead.

992
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,840
If everyone finds out
that I'm actually Park Do Ra,

993
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,380
then you're doomed too.

994
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,649
I can't marry you
and expose you to such danger.

995
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,360
I'd gladly follow you
into purgatory...

996
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,360
to be with you.

997
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,059
I told you.

998
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:43,300
I'd never let your hand go again.

999
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:46,999
And for me to protect you,

1000
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,669
we have to get married.

1001
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,309
So I can make sure
no one can hurt you.

1002
00:57:54,909 --> 00:57:56,610
I will not let anyone...

1003
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,149
mistreat you again.

1004
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,999
Thanks for telling me how you feel.

1005
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:18,130
Really, thank you so much.

1006
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:23,039
But I can't expose you
to danger too.

1007
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,410
All right.

1008
00:58:30,349 --> 00:58:33,119
We will get married, but not now.

1009
00:58:33,549 --> 00:58:34,980
Once I clear my name...

1010
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,890
and can appear as Park Do Ra again
without feeling ashamed.

1011
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,189
We'll revisit this conversation
then.

1012
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,329
Okay?

1013
00:58:43,259 --> 00:58:45,899
Whether you are
Kim Ji Young or Park Do Ra,

1014
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:47,499
it doesn't matter to me.

1015
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:51,869
I will always stay by your side
no matter who you are.

1016
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,340
I'll never leave you alone
and make you lonely.

1017
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:57,610
When you're in danger,

1018
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:00,140
I'll be right by your side,

1019
00:59:01,849 --> 00:59:03,550
holding your hand.

1020
00:59:06,349 --> 00:59:07,979
So, let's get married.

1021
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:10,689
Why are you so dumb?

1022
00:59:11,449 --> 00:59:14,519
Because of me, you might get pushed
to the edge of a cliff too.

1023
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:16,690
Because of me, you might also...

1024
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,090
Just answer this question.

1025
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:20,899
Do you love me or not?

1026
00:59:29,569 --> 00:59:31,140
I do.

1027
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:38,919
I love you.

1028
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:43,519
I love you.

1029
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,490
Then we're good.

1030
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,930
It's all good, then.

1031
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:54,999
Just trust me...

1032
00:59:57,029 --> 00:59:58,630
and follow my lead.

1033
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:06,010
Don't worry about a thing.

1034
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:18,477
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

1035
01:00:18,501 --> 01:00:20,700
(Jin Taek)

1036
01:00:20,725 --> 01:00:25,895
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

1037
01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:33,939
Hi. What's up, Jin Taek?
You never call me first.

1038
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,439
You want to grab a drink with me?

1039
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:43,550
Yes.

1040
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:47,249
All right. Sure.

1041
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:56,390
What's going on?
I don't believe this.

1042
01:00:57,889 --> 01:01:01,030
Jin Taek called me to suggest
we grab a drink together?

1043
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:04,200
What is this now?

1044
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:06,869
Does he feel bad
he's adopting Ko Pil Seung?

1045
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,910
So he wants to give me
a few more subsidiaries?

1046
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:16,110
Jin Taek!

1047
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:20,179
There you are. Have a seat.

1048
01:01:20,179 --> 01:01:21,479
Okay.

1049
01:01:27,219 --> 01:01:28,889
Anyway, what's up?

1050
01:01:28,889 --> 01:01:30,890
I'm surprised you wanted
to grab a drink with me.

1051
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:43,910
Mr. Ko, you're here.
You can sit here.

1052
01:01:44,509 --> 01:01:46,510
Sure.

1053
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:59,260
Jin Taek, what is this?

1054
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,660
I thought it was going to be
just the two of us.

1055
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,999
You called me here to join you
and this jerk, Ko Pil Seung?

1056
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,399
Jin Taek.

1057
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:11,200
I refuse...

1058
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,970
to have a drink with this punk,

1059
01:02:14,069 --> 01:02:16,969
so the two of you can play
pat-a-cake and have fun.

1060
01:02:16,969 --> 01:02:18,809
Drink up and enjoy yourselves.

1061
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,740
Sit down!

1062
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:37,430
All right, let's drink.

1063
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:53,880
Once Mr. Ko becomes my adopted son,

1064
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:57,380
you two will become family.

1065
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,450
Jin Dan, you'll be his uncle.

1066
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:02,819
If you and your nephew ended up
at the police station again,

1067
01:03:02,819 --> 01:03:05,760
it wouldn't look good at all.
It shouldn't happen, you know?

1068
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,289
So...

1069
01:03:07,489 --> 01:03:10,630
if there are any misunderstandings
or grudges between you two,

1070
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,729
I thought
you guys should talk it out.

1071
01:03:16,369 --> 01:03:17,929
That's why I called you both here.

1072
01:03:17,929 --> 01:03:19,470
He and I are family?

1073
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,070
Jin Taek,
let me make this clear to you.

1074
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,910
This punk, Ko Pil Seung,
becoming your adopted son.

1075
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,409
I absolutely cannot accept it.

1076
01:03:28,409 --> 01:03:31,910
You have no say in it,
so it doesn't matter.

1077
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,079
It's already been decided.

1078
01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:38,220
And once it happens,
you'll become Mr. Ko's uncle,

1079
01:03:38,489 --> 01:03:40,066
so be mature about it.

1080
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:41,889
How dare you run your mouth
like that?

1081
01:03:41,889 --> 01:03:44,635
Who are you to force me
into becoming this jerk's family?

1082
01:03:44,659 --> 01:03:47,599
I don't want to be his family!

1083
01:03:56,409 --> 01:03:57,740
Mr. Ko.

1084
01:03:58,239 --> 01:03:59,610
I'm sorry.

1085
01:03:59,639 --> 01:04:02,010
I guess this was a bad idea.

1086
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:06,519
No, it's okay.

1087
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:08,550
Fine.

1088
01:04:09,389 --> 01:04:10,720
Then...

1089
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,919
I will do as you say...

1090
01:04:15,259 --> 01:04:16,760
on one condition.

1091
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,099
And what might that be? Tell me.

1092
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,530
My ex-girlfriend, Kim Ji Young.

1093
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:26,470
If he ends things with her for good,

1094
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:30,610
I will think about whether or not
I can accept him...

1095
01:04:31,139 --> 01:04:32,740
as a member of my family.

1096
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:40,749
Break up with Kim Ji Young.

1097
01:04:41,279 --> 01:04:42,950
Then I'll think about it...

1098
01:04:43,849 --> 01:04:45,820
since Jin Taek is asking me
so earnestly.

1099
01:04:48,659 --> 01:04:50,189
I...

1100
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:53,200
I have no intention
of breaking up with her.

1101
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:56,470
Also, I'm thinking...

1102
01:04:57,099 --> 01:04:58,899
about marrying her.

1103
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:04,669
What? You'll marry her?

1104
01:05:06,139 --> 01:05:08,209
Says who?

1105
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:18,449
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1106
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:52,759
You'll marry Kim Ji Young?

1107
01:05:52,759 --> 01:05:56,730
Ko Pil Seung, that punk, is the one
who drove you to your death!

1108
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:59,159
Enough with the darn lies!

1109
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:01,099
If that's how it's going to be,

1110
01:06:01,099 --> 01:06:03,170
I'll tell the whole world
that she's Do Ra.

1111
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:05,675
Kim Ji Young is Park Do Ra!

1112
01:06:05,699 --> 01:06:07,999
I don't want to waver,

1113
01:06:08,069 --> 01:06:10,269
but I feel like I'm wronging you.

1114
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:13,985
A marriage should be blessed,
but because of me...

1115
01:06:14,009 --> 01:06:17,025
No matter what people say
and no matter what happens,

1116
01:06:17,049 --> 01:06:19,095
the two of us will stay strong.

1117
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:20,619
If I can't have you,

1118
01:06:20,619 --> 01:06:22,519
Ko Pil Seung won't have you either.
