00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:07,441
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:09,599
I wanted to study,

3
00:00:09,623 --> 00:00:10,205
(Episode 47)

4
00:00:10,229 --> 00:00:11,469
but I couldn't afford to.

5
00:00:12,074 --> 00:00:14,243
I did it for the money.

6
00:00:15,044 --> 00:00:16,814
I did what the guy told me to.

7
00:00:17,954 --> 00:00:19,283
"The guy?"

8
00:00:20,413 --> 00:00:21,824
Who is that guy?

9
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:23,853
Who told you to do it?

10
00:00:25,223 --> 00:00:28,164
Jin Sang Gu. He told me to do it.

11
00:00:28,623 --> 00:00:29,993
Jin Sang Gu?

12
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,833
Who's Jin Sang Gu?

13
00:00:33,864 --> 00:00:35,164
Mom.

14
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:37,903
What are you saying?

15
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:40,233
Who are you calling my dad?

16
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,674
How could he be my dad?

17
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:44,750
Are you out of your mind?

18
00:00:44,774 --> 00:00:46,113
Jin Dan.

19
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,283
He's really your dad.

20
00:00:48,283 --> 00:00:50,719
He's your birth dad.
He gave you life.

21
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:52,454
So stop hitting him.

22
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:54,054
Don't assault him.

23
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,053
Don't, Jin Dan.

24
00:00:58,154 --> 00:00:59,454
Mom.

25
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:03,964
How can you say something
so crazy so calmly?

26
00:01:05,363 --> 00:01:06,733
No, right?

27
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:08,964
It's not true, is it?

28
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:12,304
What kind of nonsense is this?

29
00:01:12,804 --> 00:01:15,504
This is because you assaulted him
like that.

30
00:01:15,504 --> 00:01:17,203
Why would you when he's your dad?

31
00:01:18,174 --> 00:01:19,543
She's right, Jin Dan.

32
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:22,343
I'm your biological father.

33
00:01:35,623 --> 00:01:37,293
Jin Dan!

34
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:55,643
Jin Dan, are you all right?

35
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:00,184
Don't you say my name.

36
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:02,184
Jin Dan.

37
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:04,753
I don't want to look at you...

38
00:02:05,323 --> 00:02:07,224
or call you my mom.

39
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:11,634
Who's my dad?

40
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,434
That riffraff is my birth father?

41
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,133
How can I have
a different father overnight?

42
00:02:17,363 --> 00:02:18,704
Is this a joke?

43
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:21,943
Who are you to tarnish my name?

44
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:24,573
I'm sorry, Jin Dan.

45
00:02:24,773 --> 00:02:26,544
It's all my fault.

46
00:02:27,784 --> 00:02:29,114
Mom.

47
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:31,653
Were you always this scary a person?

48
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,853
How could you deceive everyone...

49
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:38,693
and pretend
the late chairman was my father?

50
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:42,264
Was everything a sham?

51
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,663
No, Jin Dan.

52
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:46,864
I didn't know either.

53
00:02:47,694 --> 00:02:49,403
I didn't lie on purpose.

54
00:02:50,863 --> 00:02:53,003
I found out not long ago.

55
00:02:53,703 --> 00:02:57,403
I never dreamed
you'd be Sang Gu's son.

56
00:02:58,273 --> 00:02:59,943
But then Sang Gu said...

57
00:03:00,143 --> 00:03:03,184
he thought you were his.

58
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:06,929
So I compared
your DNA with his and...

59
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,623
Stop talking such nonsense!

60
00:03:10,154 --> 00:03:12,853
How can a loser like that
be my father?

61
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:16,723
My father is Chairman Gong Dae Gil.

62
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,494
I'm...

63
00:03:18,694 --> 00:03:20,239
Gong Jin Dan.

64
00:03:20,263 --> 00:03:23,204
Gong Jin Dan is my name!

65
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:26,350
The dipping sauces are nice too,
so take your pick.

66
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:28,873
- Call if you need anything.
- Okay.

67
00:03:29,603 --> 00:03:33,944
Pil Seung. Stop this and go home.

68
00:03:33,944 --> 00:03:35,313
Why, Dad?

69
00:03:35,444 --> 00:03:37,559
You don't want to waste money
paying me?

70
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,059
My gosh.

71
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:43,059
It's not that.
I feel bad watching you work here.

72
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,200
It's not that hard.

73
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:49,440
Dad, I think I'm cut out for this.

74
00:03:49,464 --> 00:03:51,470
- What?
- You saw...

75
00:03:51,494 --> 00:03:54,563
the customers
give my meat the thumbs up.

76
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:56,309
Can we order two more portions?

77
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,063
Coming right up.

78
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:02,544
I'm really sorry, Do Ra.

79
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,920
I was your fan for a long time,

80
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:07,514
and your name is cleared,

81
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,843
so I asked to meet
to discuss a project.

82
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:16,084
But the public sentiment
is still negative,

83
00:04:16,784 --> 00:04:19,294
and the production company
is strongly against casting you.

84
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,864
I told my assistant director
to explain the situation,

85
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,664
but I guess he couldn't reach you.

86
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,503
I'm really sorry.

87
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:33,373
It's fine.

88
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:38,244
I'm grateful
you thought enough of me to call.

89
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:41,213
I'll call you with another job
when I can.

90
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,744
Okay. Thank you.

91
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:48,924
I feel a bit bad for Park Do Ra.

92
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:50,854
She was a good actress.

93
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:55,224
How did the Queen of Romance
end up being an outcast?

94
00:04:55,263 --> 00:04:59,664
Why would you feel bad for her?
She has a poor sense of reality.

95
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:03,563
She should be lying low.
Why is she trying to work already?

96
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:07,273
Even if she was framed to look like
she had a sponsor,

97
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:09,643
that's a scarlet letter
to an actress.

98
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,073
It's crazy of her
to even think of acting again.

99
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:15,744
You can never shake off that image
once you're stuck with it.

100
00:05:16,944 --> 00:05:18,383
Yes, hey.

101
00:05:20,213 --> 00:05:22,123
It's fine. I can talk.

102
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:26,453
Director Yoon?

103
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:33,263
I see.

104
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:37,734
Okay. I'll be in touch. Thanks.

105
00:05:45,314 --> 00:05:48,273
She must know how things work
as she acted since she was young.

106
00:05:48,684 --> 00:05:51,684
The fact that she came here proves
she doesn't know her place.

107
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,883
Actresses are all about their image.
Who would hire Park Do Ra now?

108
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:58,623
I don't think she can come back.

109
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:18,844
Do Ra.

110
00:06:33,054 --> 00:06:36,763
Why did you scare me like that?

111
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:39,133
You got me good.

112
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:41,804
That was so childish.

113
00:06:41,804 --> 00:06:43,333
I knew you'd laugh.

114
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:46,034
That's what I wanted.
Mission accomplished.

115
00:06:48,473 --> 00:06:50,073
Darn you.

116
00:06:54,984 --> 00:06:56,484
Thanks, Pil Seung.

117
00:06:58,783 --> 00:07:01,513
I was in a really foul mood.

118
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,753
But you made me laugh.

119
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:08,023
I can still laugh, I guess.

120
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,304
I heard.

121
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:19,573
You met Director Yoon today.

122
00:07:23,473 --> 00:07:24,773
Yes.

123
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:33,784
I was really upset earlier,

124
00:07:34,713 --> 00:07:38,753
and I was angry
because people still hated me.

125
00:07:40,953 --> 00:07:42,364
But...

126
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:46,794
now that I think about it,
this is all too right and normal.

127
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:50,734
I didn't do it on purpose but...

128
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,873
It's a true fact that I lied...

129
00:07:57,104 --> 00:07:58,674
and deceived everyone.

130
00:07:59,674 --> 00:08:02,044
It's natural for them...

131
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:05,583
to think ill of me and not like me.

132
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:16,164
Do Ra.

133
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:19,934
Let's take a break.

134
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,364
When you were Do Ra and as Ji Young,

135
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,804
you worked too hard.

136
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:30,143
For a while,
let's do what you want...

137
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:32,313
and eat nice food.

138
00:08:33,174 --> 00:08:35,744
We can visit nice places too.

139
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,713
And go on many dates.

140
00:08:41,824 --> 00:08:43,884
Let's rest while we're down.

141
00:08:44,783 --> 00:08:48,124
How about
we consider this a holiday?

142
00:08:49,494 --> 00:08:50,823
A holiday?

143
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:55,333
Okay.

144
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:57,504
I like the sound of that.

145
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:02,843
I did nothing but work so far.

146
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:07,073
I need a holiday, don't I?

147
00:09:07,574 --> 00:09:08,983
You do.

148
00:09:12,954 --> 00:09:14,853
They say when one door closes,

149
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:17,453
another opens.

150
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:23,993
Not being able to act
won't be the end of my life.

151
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:30,233
As you said, I'll take a break
and enjoy my holiday.

152
00:09:31,263 --> 00:09:34,934
I should also think about
what I should do next.

153
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:38,774
Yes.

154
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:44,083
Is Jin Dan in shock
because someone like me is his dad?

155
00:09:45,354 --> 00:09:47,083
What's he doing?

156
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:48,930
Is he very upset?

157
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:51,129
Yes, I think so.

158
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:52,800
He won't take my calls.

159
00:09:52,824 --> 00:09:54,693
Why did you tell him?

160
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:57,323
You should've let him beat me up.

161
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,464
Why tell him now...

162
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:01,493
when we kept it a secret
for so long?

163
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:06,103
Seeing my own son cry...

164
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:09,174
broke my heart.

165
00:10:10,704 --> 00:10:13,644
What should we do
about our Jin Dan, Ae Kyo?

166
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:18,654
Oh, my goodness. Good grief.

167
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:22,054
What was all that I heard?

168
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,024
"Our Jin Dan?"

169
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:27,154
"My son?"

170
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:29,063
Then...

171
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:32,863
Then Mr. Gong the CEO...

172
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,863
He's Jin Sang Gu's son?

173
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,174
My gosh.

174
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:40,874
Oh, dear.

175
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,703
My goodness.

176
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:47,014
What's the matter?

177
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:49,514
Did a strange guy chase you home?

178
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:53,853
So...

179
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:56,624
You know...

180
00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:58,499
You're killing me.

181
00:10:58,523 --> 00:11:01,124
Spit it out, Mom.

182
00:11:04,393 --> 00:11:06,493
Mr. Gong the CEO.

183
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,203
He is Jin Sang Gu's son.

184
00:11:10,464 --> 00:11:12,774
What? Mother.

185
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:15,374
Why are you saying that again?

186
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:19,914
Mom. Did you eat something weird?
Saying that can get you in trouble.

187
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,090
This is madness.

188
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:25,529
Why did I even watch that?

189
00:11:25,553 --> 00:11:27,183
I was coming back
from the bathhouse,

190
00:11:27,183 --> 00:11:30,084
and I saw Jin Sang Gu
crying into his phone.

191
00:11:30,084 --> 00:11:32,769
I followed to find out
what it was about.

192
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,669
This is what he said.

193
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:38,563
"Ae Kyo. Why did you tell Jin Dan
I was his dad?"

194
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:39,933
He cried and sniffled...

195
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,733
in the middle of the street.

196
00:11:43,004 --> 00:11:44,634
- No way.
- Oh, gosh.

197
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:50,573
You must've misheard him, Mother.

198
00:11:50,874 --> 00:11:53,573
What? I'm not deaf yet.

199
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:56,789
And how could I make up something
like that?

200
00:11:56,813 --> 00:12:00,254
The deities would punish me
if I even tried.

201
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:03,023
Yes, this isn't the kind of story
you'd make up...

202
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,129
unless you were crazy, Mom.

203
00:12:05,153 --> 00:12:06,723
Darn you.

204
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:11,399
Listen, Sang Gu said last time
that he reunited...

205
00:12:11,423 --> 00:12:14,610
with his first love
and they had a son.

206
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,603
And then he denied it.

207
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:20,103
All this makes sense now.

208
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:23,343
Sun Young.

209
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:28,044
Shouldn't we tell Chairman Gong
about this?

210
00:12:28,484 --> 00:12:29,843
Gosh, Mother.

211
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:33,113
How can we tell him that
when we don't have any evidence?

212
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:38,323
It is serious enough to turn
the whole family upside down.

213
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,784
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

214
00:12:52,704 --> 00:12:54,004
Right.

215
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:58,274
That jerk can't be my father.

216
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:01,144
No way.

217
00:13:02,143 --> 00:13:03,583
It's impossible.

218
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:10,926
(Sang Soon)

219
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:13,924
Hey, it's me.

220
00:13:13,954 --> 00:13:15,993
Ae Kyo, we have a problem.

221
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:18,363
Why? What's wrong?

222
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:21,470
Jin Dan wants to see me
near the river.

223
00:13:21,494 --> 00:13:23,863
It's in the middle of nowhere,
far away from everyone.

224
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:26,249
Ae Kyo, I'm scared.

225
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:29,343
What if Jin Dan does something to me
in a fit of anger?

226
00:13:29,773 --> 00:13:33,014
Sang Gu, where are you meeting him?

227
00:13:52,594 --> 00:13:53,963
Hey.

228
00:13:56,364 --> 00:13:58,703
You must've been shocked
because of me.

229
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:03,144
I'm not here to have some lame chat
with you.

230
00:14:04,374 --> 00:14:06,914
Park your things
and leave Korea immediately.

231
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:08,914
And don't show up...

232
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,313
in front of me and my mom
ever again.

233
00:14:12,053 --> 00:14:14,483
You shouldn't have come to see us
in the first place.

234
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:17,023
I didn't come to you on purpose.

235
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,529
Did your mom not tell you?

236
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:20,093
I also found out only recently.

237
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,423
I was drawn to you for no reason,
so I asked your mom.

238
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:25,264
We ordered a DNA test,
and that's how I found out.

239
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:27,833
You know,

240
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:32,034
I'm really happy
that you are my son.

241
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:37,743
I swear I won't do anything
to hold you back in life.

242
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,673
So, Jin Dan,

243
00:14:39,673 --> 00:14:42,073
let's just get together
once in a while.

244
00:14:42,543 --> 00:14:44,514
I'm your father, after all.

245
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:46,853
How dare you say such a thing?

246
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:48,853
How are you my father?

247
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:51,629
What nonsense are you talking about?

248
00:14:51,653 --> 00:14:53,223
Jin Dan.

249
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:55,353
Are you saying
you don't want to leave?

250
00:14:56,793 --> 00:14:58,823
Do you want to leech off me anyway?

251
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:02,433
Stop it, Jin Dan. Don't hit him.

252
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:04,134
Please don't hit him.

253
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:07,034
All you do is ask my mom for money.

254
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,704
And you call yourself my father?

255
00:15:08,704 --> 00:15:10,504
Jin Dan, let go of him.

256
00:15:10,504 --> 00:15:12,573
We can talk this out.

257
00:15:12,974 --> 00:15:16,184
Fine. I will leave.

258
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,024
Leave this instant.

259
00:15:24,584 --> 00:15:25,993
Right away!

260
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:28,493
Okay. I will.

261
00:15:29,523 --> 00:15:31,294
Stop being so mad, Jin Dan.

262
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:36,904
I'm sorry that I'm your father.

263
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,073
I will leave.

264
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:47,574
Hey, don't you think
you're being too harsh?

265
00:15:47,574 --> 00:15:49,643
You always take him by the collar
and try to punch him.

266
00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:51,784
But he is still your father.

267
00:15:54,183 --> 00:15:56,323
Pull yourself together, Mom!

268
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,953
How is he my father?

269
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:02,563
He asks you for money all the time.
How is that a father?

270
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:06,193
No. He only spent the money for you.

271
00:16:06,234 --> 00:16:08,494
Do you know
what Sang Gu did for you?

272
00:16:08,494 --> 00:16:09,864
About Ma Ri's accident.

273
00:16:09,864 --> 00:16:11,204
If he didn't know you were his son,

274
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,473
he wouldn't have done such a thing.

275
00:16:18,913 --> 00:16:21,374
What are you talking about?

276
00:16:23,143 --> 00:16:24,884
Ma Ri's accident?

277
00:16:25,513 --> 00:16:26,813
Well...

278
00:16:27,313 --> 00:16:28,813
Say that again.

279
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,483
Ma Ri's accident.

280
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:35,124
Was it his doing?

281
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:37,264
Is that it?

282
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:51,903
I told him
you suffered ill-treatment...

283
00:16:51,903 --> 00:16:53,374
living with the Gong family.

284
00:16:53,374 --> 00:16:55,384
He didn't want you to live that way.

285
00:16:55,384 --> 00:16:57,884
If Ma Ri was gone,
you'd be the heir in the family.

286
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,659
So he thought
no one would be hard on you then.

287
00:17:00,683 --> 00:17:02,884
He said
he wanted to do anything for you.

288
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:36,330
Grandma and Do Sik,
what are you doing?

289
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:37,654
We're making kalguksu.

290
00:17:38,054 --> 00:17:40,024
I just can't get
enough of Mom's kalguksu,

291
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:42,723
so I asked her to make me some.

292
00:17:43,193 --> 00:17:46,963
Seriously, it is too good to keep it
to ourselves.

293
00:17:48,463 --> 00:17:51,934
Do Sik, why don't we open
a kalguksu place then?

294
00:17:52,134 --> 00:17:53,510
A kalguksu place?

295
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:56,173
I'm in! I want to do business!

296
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:58,874
What are you talking about?
It's just so sudden.

297
00:17:58,874 --> 00:18:01,114
You should focus on acting.

298
00:18:01,743 --> 00:18:03,084
Do Sik.

299
00:18:04,243 --> 00:18:05,584
I don't think...

300
00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:09,124
I can continue my career
for the time being.

301
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:11,453
You know what things are like
for me now.

302
00:18:11,683 --> 00:18:13,453
Things aren't so good,

303
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:16,523
and people aren't ready
to embrace me yet.

304
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,733
Oh, right.

305
00:18:20,493 --> 00:18:23,104
We can't just sit around
and suck our fingers.

306
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,904
We need to make a living somehow.

307
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:28,874
And we shouldn't let
Grandma's recipe go to waste.

308
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:29,874
Right.

309
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:31,473
Let's give it a go.

310
00:18:31,473 --> 00:18:33,514
She's right. I love the idea.

311
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:36,414
- Geum Dong, let's do it.
- Right.

312
00:18:38,143 --> 00:18:40,983
Fine. Let's give it a try then.
Let's do it, Mom!

313
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:44,253
- Great! Yes!
- Yes!

314
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,424
This is so exciting!

315
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:55,763
Are you sure you'll be all right?

316
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,834
You've been acting
since you were 13.

317
00:18:57,834 --> 00:18:59,733
Are you sure you can stop acting?

318
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:03,574
That's the very reason
why I want to try something else.

319
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,743
Actually, I helped out
at Grandma's kalguksu restaurant...

320
00:19:06,743 --> 00:19:08,644
for two years.

321
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,943
I was really happy
and had a lot of fun back then.

322
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,153
Do Sik,

323
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,624
let's sell kalguksu
and achieve huge success.

324
00:19:17,683 --> 00:19:18,824
Okay. Let's do it.

325
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,124
Yes.

326
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:23,864
But we have no money
to start a restaurant.

327
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,693
Let's start with a small diner.

328
00:19:27,264 --> 00:19:29,040
It doesn't have to be
a fancy restaurant.

329
00:19:29,064 --> 00:19:31,664
As long as the food is good,
people will come.

330
00:19:31,864 --> 00:19:33,003
I guess you're right.

331
00:19:33,003 --> 00:19:35,473
People travel across the country
to try good food.

332
00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:36,844
Exactly.

333
00:19:42,443 --> 00:19:43,844
Do Sik and Do Ra.

334
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:45,983
I have 20,000 dollars.

335
00:19:46,114 --> 00:19:47,614
- What?
- I can pitch in.

336
00:19:49,284 --> 00:19:51,684
How do you have that kind of money?

337
00:19:51,784 --> 00:19:54,023
I've worked and saved some money.

338
00:19:55,923 --> 00:19:58,263
Do Jun, you little brat.

339
00:19:58,423 --> 00:20:00,064
- Come here, you rascal.
- Gosh.

340
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:02,264
Once I make some money,
I'll pay you back first.

341
00:20:02,264 --> 00:20:04,003
- It's okay.
- How sweet you are.

342
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:06,233
- My gosh. That's disgusting.
- My sweet boy.

343
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:08,604
Come here, you silly thing.

344
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:26,924
All right.

345
00:20:27,054 --> 00:20:29,594
I'll finish things up and leave.

346
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:31,963
I'm all packed now.

347
00:20:40,304 --> 00:20:41,904
The money is ready.

348
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:46,174
Okay. I'll be right there.

349
00:20:55,604 --> 00:20:57,043
Mr. Jin Sang Gu?

350
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:01,283
Let go of me! Let go!

351
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:02,283
Mr. Jin Sang Gu.

352
00:21:02,283 --> 00:21:04,114
You are under arrest
for instigating murder.

353
00:21:04,114 --> 00:21:05,684
You have the right
to consult an attorney...

354
00:21:05,684 --> 00:21:06,783
and defend yourself.

355
00:21:06,783 --> 00:21:08,283
You have the right
to refuse to answer questions...

356
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:10,724
and request a review
of the legality of confinement.

357
00:21:10,954 --> 00:21:12,023
Take him.

358
00:21:12,023 --> 00:21:13,524
I'm sorry.

359
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,063
I'm so sorry.

360
00:21:24,474 --> 00:21:26,873
This is him. Jin Sang Gu.

361
00:21:30,644 --> 00:21:32,514
Why did you attack my daughter?

362
00:21:33,214 --> 00:21:35,244
Tell me why you did it.

363
00:21:35,843 --> 00:21:37,244
I'm sorry.

364
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:39,360
I lost everything
in the Philippines,

365
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:41,160
so when I heard about
your gullible daughter,

366
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:43,823
I thought I'd kidnap her for ransom.
That's all.

367
00:21:44,593 --> 00:21:45,954
Don't lie to me!

368
00:21:46,093 --> 00:21:47,623
You tried to run her over.

369
00:21:47,823 --> 00:21:49,640
You were trying to kill her!

370
00:21:49,664 --> 00:21:51,410
I wasn't trying to kill her.

371
00:21:51,434 --> 00:21:53,434
That's the truth. Please believe me.

372
00:21:53,894 --> 00:21:57,164
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

373
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:04,620
Someone told me to do it.

374
00:22:04,644 --> 00:22:06,573
He offered to pay me
to kill your daughter.

375
00:22:08,264 --> 00:22:11,635
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

376
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:13,447
I wasn't trying to kill her.

377
00:22:13,471 --> 00:22:15,442
That's the truth. Please believe me.

378
00:22:16,382 --> 00:22:19,612
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

379
00:22:21,822 --> 00:22:23,581
Who's telling the truth?

380
00:22:24,182 --> 00:22:25,491
However,

381
00:22:26,191 --> 00:22:29,021
He definitely wanted Ma Ri dead.

382
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,761
What for?

383
00:22:36,801 --> 00:22:39,832
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

384
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:49,257
Sun Young!

385
00:22:49,281 --> 00:22:51,251
You will not believe this.

386
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:53,858
Check this out.
Our tenant Jin Sang Gu...

387
00:22:53,882 --> 00:22:56,422
He ran away.

388
00:22:56,521 --> 00:22:58,352
He ran away?

389
00:22:58,352 --> 00:23:00,967
Yes, I went over there
and the place was empty.

390
00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:03,962
Jin Sang Gu packed and left
without us knowing.

391
00:23:04,221 --> 00:23:07,368
How could he leave
without saying a word?

392
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:09,602
Not long ago,
we gave him back his deposit...

393
00:23:09,602 --> 00:23:11,578
since he was in urgent need of cash.

394
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:14,417
We believed he wouldn't rip us off
since he's Hyun Chul's friend.

395
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:17,402
But he took off
with his deposit money...

396
00:23:17,402 --> 00:23:19,441
without paying his rent
that was due.

397
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,971
He didn't even leave us a letter.

398
00:23:20,971 --> 00:23:24,382
I called him just now,
but he didn't pick up.

399
00:23:24,382 --> 00:23:26,128
I told Hyun Chul about this...

400
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:28,582
and he didn't even leave
a single text for Hyun Chul.

401
00:23:28,582 --> 00:23:32,291
My goodness.
How can one be this selfish?

402
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,122
My gosh!

403
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:37,892
Jin Sang Gu, that punk.
What a nuisance.

404
00:23:38,731 --> 00:23:42,531
Your friend, Hong Ae Kyo.
CEO Gong's mother.

405
00:23:43,031 --> 00:23:47,301
How did she end up
with a riffraff like him?

406
00:23:47,332 --> 00:23:48,872
- Goodness.
- Unbelievable.

407
00:23:48,872 --> 00:23:52,388
Anyway, how am I
going to collect his rent?

408
00:23:52,412 --> 00:23:54,072
For annoying me deeply,

409
00:23:54,072 --> 00:23:56,041
I'll chase him
to the ends of the earth...

410
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:58,311
to collect that money.

411
00:23:59,711 --> 00:24:01,081
Of course.

412
00:24:02,582 --> 00:24:04,581
That's what I can do.

413
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,662
I'm here to see Ms. Hong Ae Kyo.

414
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:16,561
I'm Ko Pil Seung's grandmother.

415
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:19,101
I'm afraid Ms. Hong isn't home.

416
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:21,942
She isn't home?

417
00:24:22,301 --> 00:24:23,702
But...

418
00:24:24,812 --> 00:24:26,212
Thanks anyway.

419
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:30,741
Maybe I should've called in advance.

420
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:34,922
I guess there will be other days.

421
00:24:35,382 --> 00:24:38,051
Either way,
I'm collecting this money.

422
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,722
Unbelievable.

423
00:24:40,422 --> 00:24:41,791
Goodness.

424
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:45,862
- Hello.
- My gosh.

425
00:24:45,862 --> 00:24:47,761
You're Pil Seung's grandmother.
How are you?

426
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:50,078
- Hello, Chairman Gong.
- Hi.

427
00:24:50,102 --> 00:24:51,831
What brings you to our house?

428
00:24:52,072 --> 00:24:53,771
Why are you out here?

429
00:24:53,771 --> 00:24:56,801
I mean, CEO Gong's mother...

430
00:24:57,172 --> 00:24:59,612
I had business with Hong Ae Kyo,

431
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,588
but I hear she isn't home.

432
00:25:01,612 --> 00:25:03,211
Why don't you wait inside?

433
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:05,687
There's hardly any need for that.

434
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:07,687
I'll get going.

435
00:25:07,711 --> 00:25:09,281
- Then let my driver take you home.
- What?

436
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:11,868
- Mr. Kim, would you...
- That's all right.

437
00:25:11,892 --> 00:25:14,267
I'm fine walking home.

438
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:15,638
Thanks anyway.

439
00:25:15,662 --> 00:25:16,991
Right.

440
00:25:22,162 --> 00:25:24,702
By the way, Chairman Gong.

441
00:25:24,971 --> 00:25:26,531
Yes?

442
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:29,578
You see, I...

443
00:25:29,602 --> 00:25:33,071
I feel guilty
just leaving like this.

444
00:25:33,872 --> 00:25:38,412
I'm confused as to whether or not
I should tell you this.

445
00:25:40,652 --> 00:25:42,622
What is this about?

446
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:50,521
I don't know what this is about,
but please speak freely.

447
00:25:53,062 --> 00:25:55,462
Well, you see...

448
00:25:56,332 --> 00:25:58,402
There's this man...

449
00:25:58,832 --> 00:26:02,341
who was renting our spare unit.
He's my son's middle school junior.

450
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:07,341
Unfortunately, he took off
without paying his rent.

451
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,241
I came here to your house today...

452
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:12,851
to collect that rent
from Hong Ae Kyo...

453
00:26:13,082 --> 00:26:16,051
since the situation called for it.

454
00:26:16,622 --> 00:26:21,422
Why would you ask Hong Ae Kyo
for that rent money?

455
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:26,732
Well, CEO Gong's mother,
Hong Ae Kyo,

456
00:26:26,862 --> 00:26:30,831
and our tenant are
in a relationship.

457
00:26:34,872 --> 00:26:35,947
What was that?

458
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:39,511
They're together
in the romantic sense.

459
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:44,358
At first, they were adamant
about only being cousins,

460
00:26:44,382 --> 00:26:47,912
but I caught them
in a compromising position.

461
00:26:48,382 --> 00:26:52,192
From what I heard,
they were each other's first love.

462
00:26:57,422 --> 00:27:00,162
Why are you telling me this though?

463
00:27:00,991 --> 00:27:03,261
Well...

464
00:27:04,362 --> 00:27:08,541
The reason I'm giving you
the whole story is that...

465
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:11,301
Should I even say this?

466
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:13,072
Because if I'm right,

467
00:27:13,072 --> 00:27:15,212
I'll be throwing a bomb
at your family.

468
00:27:15,382 --> 00:27:18,882
But if I'm wrong,
you'll think I'm crazy.

469
00:27:19,412 --> 00:27:22,982
That's why
I can't get myself to say it.

470
00:27:26,852 --> 00:27:30,122
Please don't feel burdened
and speak freely.

471
00:27:30,221 --> 00:27:33,362
If it's not important,
I'll forget I heard anything.

472
00:27:42,801 --> 00:27:45,511
Hong Ae Kyo's son, CEO Gong Jin Dan.

473
00:27:48,182 --> 00:27:52,251
Hong Ae Kyo and Jin Sang Gu
are his biological parents.

474
00:27:52,312 --> 00:27:54,212
He's not part of the Gong family.

475
00:28:00,652 --> 00:28:02,038
What?

476
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:04,838
I don't have proof to back it up,

477
00:28:04,862 --> 00:28:07,467
but I clearly heard Jin Sang Gu...

478
00:28:07,491 --> 00:28:10,308
on the phone saying that he was...

479
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:12,872
CEO Gong's father.

480
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:17,048
Also, he talked about
reconnecting with his first love...

481
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:20,872
and finding out that he had a son.

482
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:23,581
Is...

483
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:27,851
Is this true?

484
00:28:28,422 --> 00:28:30,652
You should be sure,

485
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:33,051
so run a DNA test.

486
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:36,437
If the DNA test proves otherwise,

487
00:28:36,461 --> 00:28:39,638
you can forget about what I said
and think of me...

488
00:28:39,662 --> 00:28:41,831
as a crazy lady running her mouth.

489
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:44,362
Hold on.

490
00:28:45,701 --> 00:28:47,831
What did you say...

491
00:28:48,842 --> 00:28:50,271
his name was?

492
00:28:50,971 --> 00:28:54,142
It's Jin Sang Gu.

493
00:28:55,612 --> 00:28:56,912
Why?

494
00:28:57,441 --> 00:29:00,081
Do you perhaps know him?

495
00:29:00,852 --> 00:29:02,222
Jin Sang Gu.

496
00:29:07,885 --> 00:29:10,554
(Flour)

497
00:29:17,961 --> 00:29:19,271
Here we go.

498
00:29:28,572 --> 00:29:31,652
(Soonjung Kalguksu)

499
00:29:32,682 --> 00:29:34,182
We're ready to open, guys.

500
00:29:34,182 --> 00:29:35,898
Let's do the chant before we begin.

501
00:29:35,922 --> 00:29:38,081
- Ms. Lee.
- Of course.

502
00:29:39,922 --> 00:29:41,822
Let's do this.

503
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,192
All right.

504
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:45,061
- Three times.
- Three times.

505
00:29:46,461 --> 00:29:47,538
And go.

506
00:29:47,562 --> 00:29:50,601
- Soonjung, Soonjung, Soonjung, yes!
- Soonjung, Soonjung, Soonjung, yes!

507
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:54,501
- Let's do this.
- Good luck to us.

508
00:29:54,602 --> 00:29:55,801
Are you open?

509
00:29:55,801 --> 00:29:57,342
Yes, we are.

510
00:29:57,342 --> 00:29:58,771
- Please come in.
- Welcome!

511
00:29:58,771 --> 00:30:01,412
- This way.
- Get the water.

512
00:30:01,711 --> 00:30:03,811
Welcome. A table for two?

513
00:30:06,352 --> 00:30:08,281
Some people have no conscience.

514
00:30:08,281 --> 00:30:09,622
Ma'am?

515
00:30:10,822 --> 00:30:13,798
Do Sik, you're here.
Get these out of here this second.

516
00:30:13,822 --> 00:30:15,662
What's going on?

517
00:30:15,892 --> 00:30:17,267
As if you need to ask?

518
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:19,967
Your mom came to me two weeks ago...

519
00:30:19,991 --> 00:30:22,308
for the deposit back
saying she was moving out.

520
00:30:22,332 --> 00:30:24,202
I urgently gave her the money,

521
00:30:24,231 --> 00:30:26,801
but she hasn't cleared out
her things,

522
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:28,747
hasn't moved out,
and isn't answering her phone.

523
00:30:28,771 --> 00:30:31,001
Are you kidding me?

524
00:30:31,271 --> 00:30:34,588
A new tenant
will be moving in tomorrow,

525
00:30:34,612 --> 00:30:36,182
so get this stuff out of here.

526
00:30:36,412 --> 00:30:39,281
Ma'am, where is my mom right now?

527
00:30:39,352 --> 00:30:40,751
How should I know?

528
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:42,852
Why are you asking me
when she's your mom?

529
00:30:42,852 --> 00:30:44,152
- Unbelievable.
- But...

530
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:51,892
Darn it.

531
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:00,408
What?

532
00:31:00,432 --> 00:31:01,732
Where are you?

533
00:31:01,941 --> 00:31:02,977
I'm home.

534
00:31:03,001 --> 00:31:04,601
I'm at the unit, darn it!

535
00:31:05,971 --> 00:31:08,441
You took the deposit
saying you were moving out.

536
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:09,741
The landlady told me
to move out your things.

537
00:31:09,741 --> 00:31:11,341
Where on earth are you?

538
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:13,227
You don't need to know.

539
00:31:13,251 --> 00:31:15,481
Move my stuff to your place.

540
00:31:15,481 --> 00:31:17,882
I'll soon come by for them. Got it?

541
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,961
All right. Here's your coffee.

542
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:31,731
Here you go.

543
00:31:31,731 --> 00:31:33,007
Here's your tip.

544
00:31:33,031 --> 00:31:34,702
Gosh, thank you.

545
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:41,211
Hey, lady. Get me some ramyeon.

546
00:31:41,211 --> 00:31:43,081
Right, of course.

547
00:31:48,422 --> 00:31:49,751
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

548
00:31:55,592 --> 00:31:56,892
Come in.

549
00:32:01,092 --> 00:32:04,061
Sir, a courier
just dropped this off.

550
00:32:04,461 --> 00:32:06,571
All right. Leave it with me.

551
00:32:11,575 --> 00:32:13,672
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

552
00:32:15,182 --> 00:32:16,682
Yes, Mr. Gu.

553
00:32:16,981 --> 00:32:18,828
A courier just dropped it off.

554
00:32:18,852 --> 00:32:21,158
They're what you requested.

555
00:32:21,182 --> 00:32:23,521
The flash drive
from Hong Ae Kyo's dashcam...

556
00:32:23,521 --> 00:32:27,152
and the DNA test report
between you and CEO Gong.

557
00:32:28,092 --> 00:32:29,521
Thank you.

558
00:32:46,914 --> 00:32:49,698
(Gong Jin Taek and Gong Jin Dan
cannot be biological siblings.)

559
00:32:51,781 --> 00:32:53,152
My gosh.

560
00:32:54,511 --> 00:32:55,882
Jin Dan...

561
00:32:56,551 --> 00:32:58,622
wasn't my father's son.

562
00:33:19,771 --> 00:33:22,612
What? You met with Chairman Gong?

563
00:33:22,842 --> 00:33:24,712
Chairman Gong Jin Taek?

564
00:33:24,842 --> 00:33:26,182
Yes.

565
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:28,852
He came by the police station
the day I was arrested.

566
00:33:28,852 --> 00:33:31,182
Gosh, what do we do?

567
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,051
What now? What do we do?

568
00:33:34,051 --> 00:33:36,822
Ae Kyo,
Chairman Gong is still clueless.

569
00:33:36,822 --> 00:33:38,761
I'll handle things on my end,
so don't worry.

570
00:33:38,761 --> 00:33:40,568
Tell Jin Dan that as well.

571
00:33:40,592 --> 00:33:43,432
Why come to Korea
only to make a mess of things?

572
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:46,801
None of this would've happened
if you had stayed away.

573
00:33:46,872 --> 00:33:50,101
What about our Jin Dan?

574
00:33:59,652 --> 00:34:00,952
Jin Sang Gu.

575
00:34:01,312 --> 00:34:03,251
Listen to me carefully.

576
00:34:04,082 --> 00:34:07,392
If you ever talk about
Jin Dan again,

577
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:09,291
I won't forgive you
even after I'm dead.

578
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:12,632
So, keep your mouth shut
and take this to the grave.

579
00:34:13,132 --> 00:34:15,362
Also, I won't see you ever again.

580
00:34:16,362 --> 00:34:18,571
As of today,
you will erase me and Jin Dan...

581
00:34:18,571 --> 00:34:19,901
from your mind.

582
00:34:19,901 --> 00:34:21,771
I'll erase you from my mind as well.

583
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:25,041
That's the only way
for our Jin Dan to live.

584
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:28,612
I won't visit you in prison either,
so know that.

585
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:30,842
Ae Kyo.

586
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,512
Ae Kyo!

587
00:34:50,932 --> 00:34:54,271
That's right.
This is where it should end.

588
00:34:54,671 --> 00:34:57,141
That is how I can protect Jin Dan.

589
00:34:57,602 --> 00:34:59,012
Jin Sang Gu.

590
00:34:59,372 --> 00:35:01,471
He is a stranger to me now.

591
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,198
(Chairman Gong)

592
00:35:08,622 --> 00:35:10,021
It's me, Chairman Gong.

593
00:35:11,582 --> 00:35:12,951
To the office?

594
00:35:13,721 --> 00:35:15,561
Sure thing.

595
00:35:18,692 --> 00:35:21,262
Why would he want me
at the office at this hour?

596
00:35:22,061 --> 00:35:25,870
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

597
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:30,041
(Gong Jin Taek and Gong Jin Dan
cannot be biological siblings.)

598
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:32,834
(Secret fund accounts
and transaction history)

599
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:42,906
Why did you call me here this late?

600
00:35:43,245 --> 00:35:45,076
The secretaries are all off work.

601
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:53,085
You asked my mom here as well.

602
00:35:53,456 --> 00:35:55,602
Why did you ask her here too?

603
00:35:55,626 --> 00:35:57,156
What is this about?

604
00:36:07,436 --> 00:36:08,736
Jin Taek.

605
00:36:09,566 --> 00:36:11,506
What on earth was that?

606
00:36:12,675 --> 00:36:16,176
Why are you on my case again?
What now?

607
00:36:16,506 --> 00:36:20,315
Your mother Hong Ae Kyo,
your biological father Jin Sang Gu,

608
00:36:20,475 --> 00:36:24,285
and you. You three colluded...

609
00:36:24,285 --> 00:36:26,085
in the attempted murder of Ma Ri.

610
00:36:26,316 --> 00:36:28,716
Do you think I'll let this slide?

611
00:36:29,526 --> 00:36:33,525
What on earth...
What on earth are you saying?

612
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:37,071
Why would I kill Ma Ri?
Why would I hurt her?

613
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:40,035
And Jin Taek,
that Jin Sang Gu isn't my father!

614
00:36:40,035 --> 00:36:42,936
He's a leech
from my mom's hometown...

615
00:36:42,936 --> 00:36:45,775
who's been getting her
to take out insurance policies.

616
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:51,176
What's this?

617
00:36:51,506 --> 00:36:53,145
How could this be?

618
00:36:53,816 --> 00:36:56,486
Jin Dan is really Sang Gu's son?

619
00:36:57,345 --> 00:37:00,516
What do I do now?
What should I do about this?

620
00:37:03,626 --> 00:37:05,296
I don't have to do anything.

621
00:37:05,296 --> 00:37:06,855
No one knows.

622
00:37:07,126 --> 00:37:08,855
I just have to keep quiet.

623
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:15,595
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

624
00:37:17,265 --> 00:37:18,665
This is wrong.

625
00:37:19,436 --> 00:37:20,736
Jin Taek.

626
00:37:21,975 --> 00:37:24,576
I'm your brother, Jin Taek.

627
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,375
Our father was
Chairman Gong Dae Gil!

628
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,216
You're not my brother.

629
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:32,386
You're not my father's son.

630
00:37:34,256 --> 00:37:35,855
This is the DNA test...

631
00:37:36,186 --> 00:37:38,355
that compared us to each other.

632
00:37:38,555 --> 00:37:42,225
How dare you deny it?

633
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:49,635
Jin Taek.

634
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:52,881
I know nothing
about this Jin Sang Gu person,

635
00:37:52,905 --> 00:37:56,075
and I didn't even harm
a strand on Ma Ri's head.

636
00:37:56,075 --> 00:37:58,546
I mean it, Jin Taek.
Please believe me.

637
00:37:58,546 --> 00:38:00,975
Please believe me, Jin Taek.
That's the truth.

638
00:38:03,816 --> 00:38:05,216
You want me to believe you?

639
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:07,656
Believe you?

640
00:38:08,015 --> 00:38:11,062
You've been embezzling money
from the company for years...

641
00:38:11,086 --> 00:38:12,495
to build a slush fund.

642
00:38:12,495 --> 00:38:14,096
On top of that,

643
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,901
you lied about your bloodline...

644
00:38:16,925 --> 00:38:20,196
and tried to kill Ma Ri
who you've lived with all your life.

645
00:38:20,695 --> 00:38:22,466
I can't forgive any of you people.

646
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:26,205
You three will go to jail
for attempted murder.

647
00:38:28,236 --> 00:38:30,006
You'll be the first to go to jail...

648
00:38:30,376 --> 00:38:32,205
for embezzlement!

649
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:34,916
Jin Taek, please.

650
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:37,346
I know I did wrong,
but please forgive me.

651
00:38:37,586 --> 00:38:38,986
I never tried to hurt Ma Ri.

652
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:41,716
So, please...
Please sweep this under the rug.

653
00:38:41,716 --> 00:38:42,785
Please, Jin Taek!

654
00:38:42,785 --> 00:38:44,355
You punk!

655
00:38:49,725 --> 00:38:52,795
Jin Taek, if this comes to light,

656
00:38:53,035 --> 00:38:54,935
I'll go to jail for sure.

657
00:38:55,635 --> 00:38:57,406
I'll be ruined!

658
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,975
So, please turn a blind eye
this once.

659
00:38:59,975 --> 00:39:01,712
Cut me some slack!

660
00:39:01,736 --> 00:39:02,776
Let go!

661
00:39:02,776 --> 00:39:04,205
Come on!

662
00:39:20,896 --> 00:39:22,525
Jin Taek.

663
00:39:25,066 --> 00:39:26,366
Jin Taek?

664
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:33,536
Jin Taek.

665
00:40:15,523 --> 00:40:16,924
Darn it.

666

(Invalid username or password)

667
00:40:26,096 --> 00:40:28,236
Why won't it go through?

668
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:30,836
Why can't I make a transfer?

669
00:40:32,907 --> 00:40:34,307
What's going on?

670
00:40:35,843 --> 00:40:37,444
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

671
00:40:39,584 --> 00:40:41,484
Did Jin Taek block me already?

672
00:40:42,254 --> 00:40:43,753
He cut me off?

673
00:40:44,854 --> 00:40:48,223
How could he do this? How?

674
00:40:54,294 --> 00:40:55,594
Enter the code.

675
00:40:55,794 --> 00:40:57,563
The door is open.

676
00:41:14,783 --> 00:41:16,714
Chairman Gong, I'm here.

677
00:41:17,484 --> 00:41:20,154
Did he go out for a bit?

678
00:41:20,624 --> 00:41:23,554
Where did he go
when he asked to see me?

679
00:41:30,593 --> 00:41:33,203
Chairman Gong...

680
00:41:33,903 --> 00:41:36,203
Chairman Gong. Oh, no.

681
00:41:36,403 --> 00:41:38,503
What happened to him?

682
00:41:39,073 --> 00:41:41,873
Mr. Kim! Is anyone there?

683
00:41:41,973 --> 00:41:43,373
Oh, my gosh.

684
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,723
What do I do?

685
00:41:52,823 --> 00:41:55,723
What should I do about this?

686
00:42:07,464 --> 00:42:08,904
Hello?

687
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:10,703
Is this the emergency service?

688
00:42:10,803 --> 00:42:12,750
I found someone passed out.

689
00:42:12,774 --> 00:42:14,143
Get here quick.

690
00:42:15,073 --> 00:42:16,413
Oh, dear.

691
00:42:17,714 --> 00:42:19,014
My gosh.

692
00:42:21,814 --> 00:42:24,583
The poor thing...

693
00:42:28,194 --> 00:42:31,623
Soo Yeon. What did Doctor Kim say?

694
00:42:33,763 --> 00:42:36,594
The results show it's not serious,
fortunately.

695
00:42:37,194 --> 00:42:41,234
But he's in a coma
due to a concussion.

696
00:42:41,903 --> 00:42:44,643
What? He's in a coma?

697
00:42:45,573 --> 00:42:49,944
He's not asleep
because of the medication?

698
00:42:50,144 --> 00:42:52,614
He's unconscious?

699
00:42:53,383 --> 00:42:54,714
Yes.

700
00:42:55,084 --> 00:42:59,723
It looks like
he hit his head hard when he fell.

701
00:43:00,383 --> 00:43:02,799
When will he wake up?

702
00:43:02,823 --> 00:43:04,694
When will that be?

703
00:43:05,194 --> 00:43:06,824
He doesn't know.

704
00:43:07,363 --> 00:43:09,064
We must wait and see.

705
00:43:09,064 --> 00:43:13,310
Oh, no. What if he never wakes up?

706
00:43:13,334 --> 00:43:15,109
- Oh, no.
- Oh, dear.

707
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:17,779
- Auntie.
- Hold on.

708
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,343
Wake up, Chairman Gong. Jin Taek.

709
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:21,674
Ae Kyo.

710
00:43:22,073 --> 00:43:23,913
What happened?

711
00:43:23,973 --> 00:43:26,920
Chairman Gong said
he wanted to talk.

712
00:43:26,944 --> 00:43:28,759
He told me to come to his office.

713
00:43:28,783 --> 00:43:32,029
I went thinking he was reconsidering
adopting Jin Dan,

714
00:43:32,053 --> 00:43:33,460
but he was on the floor.

715
00:43:33,484 --> 00:43:35,493
I called an ambulance
in total shock,

716
00:43:35,493 --> 00:43:38,293
and I don't know what's going on.

717
00:43:40,593 --> 00:43:42,793
- Pil Seung.
- Ma Ri.

718
00:43:43,064 --> 00:43:46,764
Soo Yeon. What on earth happened?

719
00:43:47,874 --> 00:43:49,203
Sun Young.

720
00:43:49,973 --> 00:43:52,703
My dad passed out in his office.

721
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,219
My second grandma found him.

722
00:43:55,243 --> 00:43:57,873
No one knows when he'll wake up.

723
00:43:58,084 --> 00:44:00,913
What if Dad doesn't wake up?

724
00:44:02,584 --> 00:44:05,529
No, Ma Ri.
The chairman will be fine.

725
00:44:05,553 --> 00:44:08,093
He will wake up.

726
00:44:08,093 --> 00:44:12,293
I can't believe what's going on.

727
00:44:12,493 --> 00:44:15,969
Why would someone
who was so healthy suddenly...

728
00:44:15,993 --> 00:44:17,393
Oh, my gosh.

729
00:44:24,334 --> 00:44:26,719
- Get home safely.
- No, wait.

730
00:44:26,743 --> 00:44:28,674
I must...

731
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:32,714
I have something to tell you.

732
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:35,054
Something to tell me?

733
00:44:35,584 --> 00:44:40,324
I think I know
why the chairman passed out.

734
00:44:41,394 --> 00:44:44,864
I think it's because of me.

735
00:44:45,664 --> 00:44:48,563
What do you mean
he passed out because of you, Mom?

736
00:44:49,194 --> 00:44:53,563
I told him about it. That story.

737
00:44:53,964 --> 00:44:58,750
Mother. Did you actually tell him?

738
00:44:58,774 --> 00:45:00,279
Tell him what?

739
00:45:00,303 --> 00:45:02,049
Sun Young, what's this about?

740
00:45:02,073 --> 00:45:04,890
Well, the thing is...

741
00:45:04,914 --> 00:45:07,384
Ma Ri's uncle, CEO Gong Jin Dan.

742
00:45:07,984 --> 00:45:10,913
He's not a true Gong descendant.

743
00:45:11,283 --> 00:45:15,293
His father is Jin Sang Gu,
the man who was our tenant.

744
00:45:15,923 --> 00:45:18,994
What? What did you say?

745
00:45:20,263 --> 00:45:23,364
I told the chairman that,

746
00:45:23,593 --> 00:45:26,764
and I think
he passed out with shock.

747
00:45:26,934 --> 00:45:30,033
What should I do about this?

748
00:45:30,033 --> 00:45:31,404
Ms. So!

749
00:45:31,673 --> 00:45:33,744
How could you say such a thing?

750
00:45:34,914 --> 00:45:36,589
You said what?

751
00:45:36,613 --> 00:45:39,413
My son is whose son?

752
00:45:40,283 --> 00:45:43,160
How could you say such nonsense?

753
00:45:43,184 --> 00:45:45,183
Are you senile?

754
00:45:45,453 --> 00:45:47,324
I'm not senile.

755
00:45:47,624 --> 00:45:49,523
I heard it clearly.

756
00:45:50,194 --> 00:45:53,093
Your lover, Jin Sang Gu,
who was our tenant...

757
00:45:53,093 --> 00:45:56,764
was on the phone with you
and he said "our son Jin Dan."

758
00:45:56,964 --> 00:45:58,779
You had that conversation,
didn't you?

759
00:45:58,803 --> 00:46:01,250
My gosh. That's nonsense.

760
00:46:01,274 --> 00:46:03,509
Do you look down on me
because I was a mistress?

761
00:46:03,533 --> 00:46:05,574
You can't do this to others.

762
00:46:05,604 --> 00:46:07,744
I'm too disgusted to even be here.

763
00:46:08,314 --> 00:46:10,274
- Wait, Ae Kyo.
- If I'm wrong,

764
00:46:10,274 --> 00:46:11,414
sue me.

765
00:46:11,414 --> 00:46:13,214
Sue me for making things up.

766
00:46:13,214 --> 00:46:16,859
- Mother, stop it.
- See? Did you see that?

767
00:46:16,883 --> 00:46:18,984
If it weren't true,
she'd be screaming...

768
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,830
and cursing about suing me.

769
00:46:20,854 --> 00:46:21,894
Mom.

770
00:46:21,894 --> 00:46:25,464
You can't tell people such things
without proof.

771
00:46:25,823 --> 00:46:28,634
I'm sure it's true.

772
00:46:29,434 --> 00:46:30,764
Wait.

773
00:46:31,934 --> 00:46:35,350
Chairman Gong seemed to know...

774
00:46:35,374 --> 00:46:37,534
who Jin Sang Gu was.

775
00:46:39,203 --> 00:46:42,043
Chairman Gong knew Jin Sang Gu?

776
00:46:42,343 --> 00:46:44,574
Yes, he did.

777
00:46:45,814 --> 00:46:48,883
If the chairman passed out
because of what I told him,

778
00:46:48,883 --> 00:46:50,584
what should I do?

779
00:46:50,584 --> 00:46:52,154
Oh, my gosh.

780
00:46:52,283 --> 00:46:53,623
Oh, no.

781
00:46:57,694 --> 00:46:59,823
The phone is turned off.

782
00:46:59,823 --> 00:47:03,393
Please leave a message
after the tone.

783
00:47:03,593 --> 00:47:05,004
You will be charged...

784
00:47:05,004 --> 00:47:08,433
Why did Jin Dan turn off his phone?

785
00:47:09,573 --> 00:47:11,074
What should I do now?

786
00:47:12,173 --> 00:47:15,344
Did Chairman Gong really faint
because of what he heard?

787
00:47:15,973 --> 00:47:19,214
What happens to us when he wakes up?

788
00:47:22,283 --> 00:47:24,853
I don't know this number. Who is it?

789
00:47:28,493 --> 00:47:29,853
Hello?

790
00:47:30,894 --> 00:47:32,223
Mom, it's me.

791
00:47:32,464 --> 00:47:33,824
Jin Dan.

792
00:47:34,964 --> 00:47:36,093
What's this number?

793
00:47:36,093 --> 00:47:38,864
I threw away my phone
in case it gets tracked.

794
00:47:38,964 --> 00:47:41,834
What do you mean
your phone will be tracked?

795
00:47:41,834 --> 00:47:43,379
Mom. What happened to Jin Taek?

796
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:45,003
He's not dead, is he?

797
00:47:45,473 --> 00:47:48,273
Jin Dan.
How do you know he was hurt?

798
00:47:48,644 --> 00:47:52,384
Did he pass out because of you?
Did you do something?

799
00:47:52,684 --> 00:47:55,484
Mom. He knows everything.

800
00:47:55,754 --> 00:47:57,684
You tearing up the DNA report.

801
00:47:57,684 --> 00:48:01,270
He got a video of that
from your dashcam.

802
00:48:01,294 --> 00:48:02,994
He also knows...

803
00:48:03,194 --> 00:48:04,969
Jin Sang Gu is my birth father.

804
00:48:04,993 --> 00:48:08,363
Jin Taek even knows
the dirtbag tried to kill Ma Ri.

805
00:48:08,363 --> 00:48:10,663
Oh, my gosh...

806
00:48:13,004 --> 00:48:16,174
That's not all. He also knows
I embezzled from the company...

807
00:48:16,203 --> 00:48:18,273
and have a slush fund.

808
00:48:19,403 --> 00:48:21,203
We fought about it and...

809
00:48:22,374 --> 00:48:25,114
Mom. What should I do now?

810
00:48:26,684 --> 00:48:29,683
Jin Dan. Get a hold of yourself.

811
00:48:29,714 --> 00:48:31,253
Your brother isn't dead.

812
00:48:31,584 --> 00:48:33,554
He's still unconscious,

813
00:48:33,754 --> 00:48:35,330
but it's not life-threatening.

814
00:48:35,354 --> 00:48:37,924
So, don't think of doing
anything stupid.

815
00:48:38,493 --> 00:48:39,493
Mom.

816
00:48:39,493 --> 00:48:43,569
He froze all my accounts
and blocked online transfers.

817
00:48:43,593 --> 00:48:46,764
He got a travel ban on me
so I can't even flee.

818
00:48:47,004 --> 00:48:49,503
He did what?

819
00:48:49,903 --> 00:48:52,879
Mom. You need to leave that house...

820
00:48:52,903 --> 00:48:54,989
before Jin Taek wakes up.

821
00:48:55,013 --> 00:48:56,873
I'm trying to stow away.

822
00:48:56,944 --> 00:49:00,989
I'll call you once I settle
in Hong Kong or somewhere else.

823
00:49:01,013 --> 00:49:05,554
Mom. You must hang in there
until then, okay?

824
00:49:05,823 --> 00:49:07,654
No, Jin Dan.

825
00:49:08,653 --> 00:49:10,853
I can't live without you.

826
00:49:11,624 --> 00:49:13,739
I can't survive.

827
00:49:13,763 --> 00:49:16,739
We must live or die together.

828
00:49:16,763 --> 00:49:20,464
Jin Dan. I'll come with you.
Take me too.

829
00:49:22,133 --> 00:49:24,603
What should we do? Jin Dan.

830
00:49:46,464 --> 00:49:47,824
Jin Dan.

831
00:49:48,263 --> 00:49:49,770
What's this ratty car?

832
00:49:49,794 --> 00:49:52,264
Where's yours?
Why are you driving this?

833
00:49:53,763 --> 00:49:55,904
Everyone knows what I drove.

834
00:49:56,274 --> 00:49:58,744
- Get in the car.
- Okay.

835
00:50:09,714 --> 00:50:11,054
Jin Dan.

836
00:50:11,783 --> 00:50:14,784
Can we really manage
once we get to China?

837
00:50:16,553 --> 00:50:21,509
Yes. I stashed away some money
in Hong Kong.

838
00:50:21,533 --> 00:50:23,333
In a few paper companies.

839
00:50:23,394 --> 00:50:26,410
All we have to do is get to China
then into Hong Kong.

840
00:50:26,434 --> 00:50:28,133
We will get the money there...

841
00:50:28,133 --> 00:50:31,603
and go to any country we want
like the US or Switzerland.

842
00:50:32,274 --> 00:50:33,744
That's it, Mom.

843
00:50:34,343 --> 00:50:35,813
But, Jin Dan,

844
00:50:37,473 --> 00:50:39,543
once we stow away and leave,

845
00:50:39,814 --> 00:50:42,214
who will send money
to your dad in prison?

846
00:50:44,153 --> 00:50:45,723
Come on.

847
00:50:45,984 --> 00:50:47,723
Then you should stay here...

848
00:50:47,723 --> 00:50:50,053
and send money to that man in prison
for the rest of your life.

849
00:50:50,053 --> 00:50:52,263
No, that's not what I meant.
I'm sorry.

850
00:50:52,263 --> 00:50:54,694
Okay. We should just go now.

851
00:50:54,694 --> 00:50:56,663
Seriously...

852
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,563
Hey.

853
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:09,250
I'll give you the other half
I promised once I get to China.

854
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,744
All right.

855
00:51:29,093 --> 00:51:33,109
Mom, this is all the money we have.

856
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:34,403
Don't put this down
even for a moment.

857
00:51:34,403 --> 00:51:35,434
- Okay.
- Do you understand?

858
00:51:35,434 --> 00:51:36,804
Sure. I get it.

859
00:51:37,533 --> 00:51:40,543
I'll get all my stuff
and be right there.

860
00:51:40,774 --> 00:51:43,850
Make sure to keep this with you
and wait on the boat.

861
00:51:43,874 --> 00:51:46,844
- Okay?
- All right.

862
00:51:49,584 --> 00:51:51,054
Go.

863
00:52:06,564 --> 00:52:08,134
Hurry and come on.

864
00:52:13,274 --> 00:52:14,603
My gosh.

865
00:52:16,013 --> 00:52:18,584
Hey, hold my hand.

866
00:52:18,584 --> 00:52:20,014
Oh, no.

867
00:52:20,084 --> 00:52:22,084
- Go ahead and hold my hand.
- Darn it.

868
00:52:22,084 --> 00:52:23,884
- What are you waiting for?
- What do I do?

869
00:52:27,383 --> 00:52:29,824
Here. Trust me and come here.

870
00:52:30,093 --> 00:52:32,394
Come on. Good.

871
00:52:32,394 --> 00:52:34,994
- Hold my hand.
- There you go.

872
00:52:35,263 --> 00:52:37,163
All right. Come here.

873
00:52:41,004 --> 00:52:43,703
No! What do I do? Stop right there!

874
00:52:44,173 --> 00:52:46,674
- Start the boat.
- Wait!

875
00:52:46,743 --> 00:52:49,673
Jin Dan!

876
00:52:49,673 --> 00:52:51,643
What do I do with them?

877
00:52:51,814 --> 00:52:53,744
- Those thieves!
- Hey!

878
00:52:54,084 --> 00:52:55,214
Jin Dan!

879
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:58,654
Hey! Stop right there!
What do we do?

880
00:52:58,923 --> 00:53:00,754
Jin Dan, what should we do?

881
00:53:00,754 --> 00:53:03,623
You jerks! Stop right there!

882
00:53:06,964 --> 00:53:09,640
You jerks! Stop the boat now!

883
00:53:09,664 --> 00:53:11,163
Darn it!

884
00:53:11,863 --> 00:53:15,134
Stop right there! Come back!

885
00:53:15,633 --> 00:53:18,304
You darn jerks!

886
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:29,284
Dad, did you just make a noise?

887
00:53:32,323 --> 00:53:34,529
Ma Ri, what's wrong?

888
00:53:34,553 --> 00:53:37,123
I think
Chairman Gong is coming around.

889
00:53:37,394 --> 00:53:39,294
Mom, Dad just moved.

890
00:53:39,294 --> 00:53:41,024
And he groaned a little.

891
00:53:41,024 --> 00:53:42,364
What?

892
00:53:43,763 --> 00:53:44,980
Honey.

893
00:53:45,004 --> 00:53:46,934
My goodness. Are you sure?

894
00:53:46,934 --> 00:53:48,064
- Yes.
- Honey.

895
00:53:48,064 --> 00:53:50,334
Mom, is Dad up?

896
00:53:50,334 --> 00:53:51,874
He's conscious, right?

897
00:53:51,874 --> 00:53:55,003
Honey, open your eyes.

898
00:53:55,144 --> 00:53:58,583
Honey, wake up. Honey!

899
00:54:15,164 --> 00:54:16,793
Mom, we're here.

900
00:54:17,263 --> 00:54:18,663
Get off.

901
00:54:18,863 --> 00:54:20,163
Okay.

902
00:54:35,184 --> 00:54:37,489
What? We're home?

903
00:54:37,513 --> 00:54:39,723
Why did you come here?

904
00:54:40,484 --> 00:54:41,853
Mom.

905
00:54:42,093 --> 00:54:43,793
We don't have money now.

906
00:54:44,153 --> 00:54:46,424
You will only have a hard time
when you're with me.

907
00:54:47,024 --> 00:54:48,994
Just stay here and hang in there.

908
00:54:49,133 --> 00:54:52,503
No, Jin Dan. I'm coming with you.

909
00:54:53,234 --> 00:54:54,534
Mom.

910
00:54:55,033 --> 00:54:57,274
It's already hard enough
to go on the run by myself.

911
00:54:57,274 --> 00:54:58,944
We might end up
getting caught together.

912
00:54:59,073 --> 00:55:01,743
I'll make sure to get to Hong Kong,

913
00:55:01,743 --> 00:55:03,714
take the money out, and call you.

914
00:55:04,044 --> 00:55:06,313
Just wait until then. Okay?

915
00:55:06,613 --> 00:55:09,583
Jin Dan, I don't want to go home.

916
00:55:09,883 --> 00:55:11,884
I'm sure they will kick me out.

917
00:55:12,124 --> 00:55:14,824
I'll be too scared there
without you.

918
00:55:15,754 --> 00:55:18,640
Don't worry, Mom.

919
00:55:18,664 --> 00:55:21,994
You are
Chairman Gong Dae Gil's wife.

920
00:55:22,234 --> 00:55:24,534
They can't kick you around.

921
00:55:25,164 --> 00:55:28,264
So, don't worry about it
and go home.

922
00:55:28,734 --> 00:55:30,434
Jin Dan.

923
00:55:30,434 --> 00:55:32,643
Just go home already!

924
00:55:32,703 --> 00:55:34,744
I said I'd call you!

925
00:55:35,004 --> 00:55:37,344
Okay. I will.

926
00:55:37,414 --> 00:55:40,643
But you have to call me
once you get to Hong Kong.

927
00:55:41,144 --> 00:55:43,654
Make sure to call me often. Okay?

928
00:55:43,953 --> 00:55:46,753
Sure. I'll do that.

929
00:55:47,184 --> 00:55:48,223
Go in.

930
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,223
Okay.

931
00:55:49,223 --> 00:55:50,554
Go.

932
00:55:50,624 --> 00:55:52,523
Jin Dan.

933
00:55:53,894 --> 00:55:56,293
- Jin Dan.
- Go ahead.

934
00:55:58,703 --> 00:56:00,063
What do I do?

935
00:56:02,374 --> 00:56:04,810
What should I do?

936
00:56:04,834 --> 00:56:11,074
Jin Dan...

937
00:56:21,553 --> 00:56:23,194
I'm sorry, Mom.

938
00:56:24,024 --> 00:56:25,663
I'll be back soon.

939
00:56:26,493 --> 00:56:27,864
Darn it.

940
00:56:30,964 --> 00:56:32,304
What?

941
00:56:32,664 --> 00:56:34,663
Who is here?

942
00:56:36,934 --> 00:56:38,273
Auntie.

943
00:56:40,743 --> 00:56:42,844
You darn witch!

944
00:56:43,613 --> 00:56:45,489
How dare you show up here?

945
00:56:45,513 --> 00:56:47,813
How dare you set foot in this house?

946
00:56:47,914 --> 00:56:50,013
You're worse than a brute.

947
00:56:50,013 --> 00:56:52,223
You deserve to die!

948
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:55,084
Get out this instant. Get lost!

949
00:56:55,084 --> 00:56:58,424
Get out! Go!

950
00:56:59,524 --> 00:57:00,864
What...

951
00:57:01,493 --> 00:57:05,163
I'm sorry, Auntie.
Please forgive me.

952
00:57:05,903 --> 00:57:08,203
I swear I didn't know.

953
00:57:09,073 --> 00:57:13,203
I really thought
Jin Dan was Chairman Gong's son.

954
00:57:14,004 --> 00:57:15,873
I'm serious.

955
00:57:16,073 --> 00:57:17,674
Jin Taek.

956
00:57:19,013 --> 00:57:21,414
I swear I'm telling you the truth.

957
00:57:21,414 --> 00:57:24,684
Please believe me this once.

958
00:57:24,684 --> 00:57:26,153
Mr. Kim and Ms. Yeoju.

959
00:57:26,153 --> 00:57:28,153
- Yes.
- Let her out.

960
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,654
And don't let her in ever again.

961
00:57:30,723 --> 00:57:32,324
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

962
00:57:33,694 --> 00:57:35,763
- How...
- No. I'm not leaving.

963
00:57:35,763 --> 00:57:37,764
I can't leave!

964
00:57:37,794 --> 00:57:40,734
I'm Chairman Gong Dae Gil's wife.

965
00:57:40,903 --> 00:57:43,603
I'm your mother!

966
00:57:43,734 --> 00:57:46,244
Chairman Gong.

967
00:57:46,473 --> 00:57:49,089
Jin Taek is trying to kick me out.

968
00:57:49,113 --> 00:57:51,414
Auntie wants me out!

969
00:57:51,414 --> 00:57:54,313
- Get out this instant!
- My gosh.

970
00:57:54,414 --> 00:57:56,484
Get lost.

971
00:57:56,553 --> 00:57:58,924
Don't ever come
near this house again.

972
00:57:59,423 --> 00:58:02,194
You evil witch. You scumbag.

973
00:58:16,274 --> 00:58:17,934
- Thank you.
- We enjoyed the food.

974
00:58:17,934 --> 00:58:19,203
- Please come again.
- Okay.

975
00:58:19,203 --> 00:58:20,403
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

976
00:58:20,403 --> 00:58:21,843
- Bye.
- Bye.

977
00:58:21,843 --> 00:58:23,644
- Hello.
- Welcome.

978
00:58:23,644 --> 00:58:26,484
Is this Park Do Ra's kalguksu diner?

979
00:58:29,414 --> 00:58:31,453
Yes, it is.

980
00:58:31,453 --> 00:58:34,259
It's so good to see you.
I'm a big fan of you.

981
00:58:34,283 --> 00:58:36,154
This is it. Let's sit.

982
00:58:36,254 --> 00:58:37,453
Thank you.

983
00:58:37,453 --> 00:58:40,464
We will have kalguksu
for three people.

984
00:58:40,464 --> 00:58:41,464
Okay.

985
00:58:41,464 --> 00:58:42,633
The sponsorship actress.

986
00:58:42,633 --> 00:58:45,334
I wonder how good
Park Do Ra's kalguksu will be.

987
00:58:45,334 --> 00:58:46,804
Let's try it and find out.

988
00:58:47,303 --> 00:58:50,049
If the food is good,
I will be generous with the tip.

989
00:58:50,073 --> 00:58:53,574
Park Do Ra must be crazy about tips.

990
00:58:54,803 --> 00:58:58,044
If you hang out with me,
I'll give you all the money I have.

991
00:58:58,044 --> 00:59:00,759
- I brought a lot of cash. See?
- My gosh.

992
00:59:00,783 --> 00:59:02,083
Excuse me.

993
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:06,484
The sponsorship rumor
turned out not to be true.

994
00:59:07,354 --> 00:59:10,024
Did you not see the articles?
It's not true.

995
00:59:10,024 --> 00:59:11,823
It must be a put-up job.

996
00:59:11,823 --> 00:59:14,764
Who would believe that?
We're not fools.

997
00:59:16,263 --> 00:59:17,663
I'd like you to leave.

998
00:59:17,863 --> 00:59:20,003
We're not selling kalguksu
to people like you.

999
00:59:20,763 --> 00:59:21,763
Go.

1000
00:59:21,763 --> 00:59:24,573
You can't treat customers like this.

1001
00:59:24,573 --> 00:59:26,643
How dare you glare at us like that?

1002
00:59:26,903 --> 00:59:29,843
I see. He must be the guy.

1003
00:59:29,843 --> 00:59:31,613
The director who covered
for the sponsorship actress.

1004
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:33,319
- I guess you're right.
- Yes.

1005
00:59:33,343 --> 00:59:34,613
So,

1006
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:36,513
what was dating Park Do Ra like?

1007
00:59:36,513 --> 00:59:39,123
You're saying it nicely.

1008
00:59:40,084 --> 00:59:41,084
- Get out.
- What?

1009
00:59:41,084 --> 00:59:43,423
- I'm not selling food to you.
- Hey. I'm a customer.

1010
00:59:43,423 --> 00:59:44,553
Just get out!

1011
00:59:44,553 --> 00:59:46,000
How dare you push me?

1012
00:59:46,024 --> 00:59:47,894
- Do Sik!
- My gosh.

1013
00:59:47,894 --> 00:59:50,894
How dare you mess with
your customer?

1014
00:59:50,894 --> 00:59:51,964
You jerk!

1015
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:55,334
- What did you just say?
- You scumbags.

1016
00:59:55,334 --> 00:59:57,303
- Get off me!
- Darn it!

1017
00:59:57,303 --> 01:00:00,203
Why are you doing this to me?

1018
01:00:07,783 --> 01:00:10,683
What have I done so wrong to you?

1019
01:00:12,084 --> 01:00:13,723
That's not true.

1020
01:00:14,223 --> 01:00:16,094
It's not true at all!

1021
01:00:16,593 --> 01:00:19,094
Why are you being like this to me?

1022
01:00:20,124 --> 01:00:22,994
Do you think
I should've died back then?

1023
01:00:24,664 --> 01:00:26,964
Don't you have mothers?

1024
01:00:27,133 --> 01:00:29,703
What about daughters or sisters?

1025
01:00:30,504 --> 01:00:33,043
Why are you doing this to me?

1026
01:00:34,703 --> 01:00:37,489
What makes you think
you can treat me this way?

1027
01:00:37,513 --> 01:00:39,784
Is it because I'm an actress?

1028
01:00:39,843 --> 01:00:43,413
Should people be allowed
to treat actresses like dirt?

1029
01:00:44,613 --> 01:00:48,453
I'm just trying to live a quiet life
running a kalguksu diner.

1030
01:00:50,524 --> 01:00:55,424
Am I not even allowed that?

1031
01:00:57,033 --> 01:00:58,980
- Come on.
- Let's go.

1032
01:00:59,004 --> 01:01:00,334
What rotten luck.

1033
01:01:00,334 --> 01:01:01,933
I'm tanking the review
of this place.

1034
01:01:02,434 --> 01:01:03,804
Darn it.

1035
01:01:37,133 --> 01:01:40,080
We didn't get to serve lunch today,

1036
01:01:40,104 --> 01:01:41,779
and we can't skip out on dinner too.

1037
01:01:41,803 --> 01:01:43,614
Let's get ready for the dinner rush.

1038
01:01:46,314 --> 01:01:48,813
Sure. You're right, Pil Seung.

1039
01:01:49,584 --> 01:01:51,384
We should get ready to serve dinner.

1040
01:01:53,917 --> 01:01:56,053
(Soonjung Kalguksu)

1041
01:01:57,394 --> 01:01:59,293
Get back in there
and let me handle this.

1042
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:19,859
(Soonjung Kalguksu)

1043
01:02:38,593 --> 01:02:40,003
What the...

1044
01:02:40,834 --> 01:02:43,074
Did I startle you? Sorry.

1045
01:02:43,403 --> 01:02:44,773
Of course not.

1046
01:02:45,673 --> 01:02:47,304
Just stay like this.

1047
01:02:50,113 --> 01:02:51,973
It's nice to have...

1048
01:02:52,783 --> 01:02:54,183
your arms around me.

1049
01:02:59,524 --> 01:03:01,654
It was rough today, wasn't it?

1050
01:03:03,124 --> 01:03:04,494
I'm sorry.

1051
01:03:05,993 --> 01:03:10,094
You shouldn't have come.
I told you not to.

1052
01:03:13,703 --> 01:03:15,364
You should get going now.

1053
01:03:19,374 --> 01:03:20,674
No way.

1054
01:03:20,703 --> 01:03:23,574
I'm going to stick to you
like a piece of gum.

1055
01:03:24,013 --> 01:03:25,313
Stick!

1056
01:03:25,883 --> 01:03:28,014
Besides, who else
can make the kalguksu dough?

1057
01:03:28,184 --> 01:03:32,154
To be honest,
mine is better than Do Sik's.

1058
01:03:32,723 --> 01:03:35,353
You're such an idiot.

1059
01:03:35,754 --> 01:03:37,223
You dumb-dumb.

1060
01:03:37,854 --> 01:03:39,270
Sure, I'm an idiot.

1061
01:03:39,294 --> 01:03:42,194
But I'll be a fool
who only has eyes for you.

1062
01:03:42,593 --> 01:03:43,994
A handsome idiot.

1063
01:03:45,234 --> 01:03:47,563
My gosh, that's so cheesy.

1064
01:03:48,164 --> 01:03:50,250
What if someone sees you?

1065
01:03:50,274 --> 01:03:51,609
This is embarrassing.

1066
01:03:51,633 --> 01:03:54,674
What's wrong with that
when I'm saying I love you?

1067
01:04:00,444 --> 01:04:01,944
Look at you sweating.

1068
01:04:05,653 --> 01:04:07,083
What now?

1069
01:04:11,323 --> 01:04:12,623
Baby chick.

1070
01:04:16,734 --> 01:04:18,163
Chirp.

1071
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,614
Baby chick.

1072
01:04:34,184 --> 01:04:35,514
Chirp.

1073
01:04:39,184 --> 01:04:40,623
That suits you.

1074
01:04:41,584 --> 01:04:44,293
From now on,
that should be your line.

1075
01:04:52,564 --> 01:04:55,403
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1076
01:05:27,803 --> 01:05:29,934
Chairman Gong,
an important business?

1077
01:05:29,934 --> 01:05:31,203
What is this about?

1078
01:05:31,203 --> 01:05:32,903
Dad, tell them already.

1079
01:05:32,903 --> 01:05:33,944
Is it good news?

1080
01:05:33,944 --> 01:05:36,113
Congratulations. I'm happy for you!

1081
01:05:36,113 --> 01:05:37,774
What? Please stop saying...

1082
01:05:37,774 --> 01:05:39,684
that you can't live without me.

1083
01:05:39,684 --> 01:05:41,790
You need to stay strong...

1084
01:05:41,814 --> 01:05:43,414
for me to leave with ease.

1085
01:05:43,414 --> 01:05:44,584
Head inside first, then.

1086
01:05:44,584 --> 01:05:46,199
But we're outside my place.

1087
01:05:46,223 --> 01:05:48,730
I'll only be at ease
once I see you get going.

1088
01:05:48,754 --> 01:05:50,054
Park Do Ra!
