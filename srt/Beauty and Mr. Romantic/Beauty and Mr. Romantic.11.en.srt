00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,470
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:11,128
- Do Ra.
- Do Ra, can I get your autograph?

3
00:00:11,128 --> 00:00:13,798
- Please take a photo with us.
- Do Ra...

4
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:17,099
- Do Ra?
- Where did she go?

5
00:00:59,031 --> 00:01:00,031
What...

6
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:03,801
What do you think you're doing?

7
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,771
What did you do to my lips?

8
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,211
As if you need to ask.

9
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:12,251
There's no need to embarrass me.

10
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,730
(Episode 11)

11
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:30,361
How could you come at me like that?
I could sue you, you know.

12
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:33,670
Fine. Sue me if you want.

13
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,741
However, the charges won't stick.

14
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:38,711
I didn't do this alone.
We were in it together.

15
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,441
What do you mean we did it together?

16
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,881
You're quite the trouble,
aren't you?

17
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:45,211
I was standing in my place...

18
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:46,881
but you came at me.

19
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:49,721
What? You were just standing there?

20
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:51,450
You leaned in...

21
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,420
one millimeter at a time
as if you were going to kiss me.

22
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,891
- Unbelievable.
- What...

23
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:59,760
You're like a turtle.

24
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,530
You were moving too slowly,

25
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,200
so I closed the gap.

26
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,131
You should be grateful.

27
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,370
What did you just say?

28
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:11,941
You're now making things up
saying things I didn't do.

29
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,310
What do you mean I slowly leaned in?

30
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,310
When did I do that?

31
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,250
Pil Seung, be honest with yourself.

32
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,180
Your heart skipped a beat
at the sight of me just now.

33
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,220
You have no idea
how loudly your heart beat just now.

34
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,821
And what about the burning gaze...

35
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:27,421
that almost burned
a hole through me?

36
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:29,891
What was that about?

37
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:32,731
Look who's calling the kettle black?

38
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:34,060
Are you pinning the kiss on me...

39
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,400
when you were the one
who stole one from me?

40
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,970
What? I looked at you
with a burning look in my eyes?

41
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,831
Why would I look at you that way?

42
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:41,201
Whatever.

43
00:02:41,571 --> 00:02:43,870
I'm only letting this slide...

44
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,041
because I can't have trouble
while we're filming the series.

45
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,910
But plant another kiss on me...

46
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,410
and I won't care about what happens
to "Straightforward Romance."

47
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,321
Until when will you
deny your feelings?

48
00:02:57,021 --> 00:02:59,021
You came to see me today.

49
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,991
Because I was with Mr. Gong.

50
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:03,720
Me being with another man
made you jealous.

51
00:03:03,991 --> 00:03:05,160
It's because you like me.

52
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:08,301
I clearly said that wasn't the case.

53
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:10,301
My work brought me
to this neighborhood,

54
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:12,171
so stop being delusional.

55
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,100
You were here regarding your work?

56
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:20,271
As if.
Why would I ever believe that?

57
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:23,810
I got to know for sure today.

58
00:03:24,711 --> 00:03:26,410
You have feelings for me, Pil Seung.

59
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:47,671
What the...

60
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:50,171
What kind of a dream was that?

61
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,970
Why would I dream
of something like that?

62
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,141
Was Do Ra right?

63
00:03:58,451 --> 00:03:59,951
Did I lean in for the kiss as well?

64
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:05,051
No way. I wouldn't have done that.

65
00:04:14,361 --> 00:04:15,761
Get your act together, Pil Seung.

66
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,900
What are you thinking about?

67
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,671
This isn't right.

68
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,641
Of course.

69
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:27,011
I can't let her faze me like this.

70
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,240
Not anymore.

71
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:40,050
Jin Dan,

72
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:44,420
do you remember what you said...

73
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,290
while drunk last night?

74
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,170
Yes, I recall everything.

75
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:57,641
And since I do, I'll speak my mind.

76
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:03,540
Sure. Go ahead.

77
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,381
Over the years,

78
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:09,181
I've been upset with you.

79
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:12,821
I never asked for what you own.

80
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,650
I asked...

81
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:18,160
for Angel Investment Corp.
which is what Father gave me.

82
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:20,360
Why haven't you
transferred its ownership to me?

83
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:24,300
Until when must I walk
on eggshells around you...

84
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,800
wondering when you'll give it to me?

85
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:29,170
Why must I do that...

86
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,670
when the company should be mine?

87
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,711
I never said you couldn't have it.

88
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,381
I should know I can trust you
before I can hand it over.

89
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:42,920
When will you trust me, then?

90
00:05:43,581 --> 00:05:44,790
When?

91
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,391
As if you don't know.

92
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:48,090
What happened
to the construction company...

93
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,360
I handed over?

94
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:51,790
I said it wasn't going to work,

95
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,831
but you tried
to start a condo business...

96
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:54,860
in Vietnam and Myanmar...

97
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:56,360
which turned out to be a flop.

98
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,600
That project of yours
almost cost us the entire group.

99
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:02,571
So how could I trust you enough...

100
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,340
to hand over the rights
to Angel Investment Corp.?

101
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:08,181
Be a little more patient.

102
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:12,280
I can't. I can't wait.

103
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,610
It's time you handed it over.

104
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,650
What?

105
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,321
How dare you request that?

106
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:24,321
Hand it over to Jin Dan.

107
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:28,961
Angel Investment Corp. is Jin Dan's.

108
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:32,631
Whether he burns it to the ground
or sells it is his business,

109
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:35,300
so who are you to keep it from him?

110
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:37,100
- Auntie...
- Why?

111
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,141
Did your wife tell you
to keep it from him?

112
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,441
Auntie, come on.

113
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,610
Why would you bring her up...

114
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,350
when we're discussing
Jin Dan's matter?

115
00:06:45,881 --> 00:06:47,381
What has gotten into you?

116
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:49,121
Just look at
how this family is functioning.

117
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:52,290
I'm frustrated and annoyed
to say the least.

118
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,821
First Ma Ri and then Jin Dan.

119
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:58,191
Keeping the company from him
won't solve any of these issues.

120
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:01,230
Hand it over to him
and wrap things up on your end.

121
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,240
You're handing
Angel Investment Corp. over to him?

122
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,771
Are you sure about this?

123
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,110
Now that I think about it,
my aunt has a point.

124
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:21,480
Angel Investment Corp.

125
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,021
I can't run that subsidiary forever.

126
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,691
If Angel Investment Corp. flops,

127
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:33,360
it will harm the other subsidiaries.

128
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,160
We own part of it too.

129
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,230
I have no choice now.
It's out of my control.

130
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,871
All I can do is trust Jin Dan
and watch how he does.

131
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,441
Fighting over something like this...

132
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:51,181
doesn't look good either.

133
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:55,050
It's best to handle the issue now
when it came up.

134
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:59,420
Okay. I understand.

135
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:03,521
I'm off to work.

136
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:12,900
Are you sure?
Jin Taek said he'd give it to you?

137
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:15,641
Yes. He'll see to it right away.

138
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,211
Now I'm the actual CEO
of Angel Investment Corp.

139
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,470
My gosh, Jin Dan.

140
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:24,280
I don't believe this.
It feels like I'm dreaming.

141
00:08:25,681 --> 00:08:27,381
Will he really give you the company?

142
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:29,581
What if he changes his mind?

143
00:08:30,181 --> 00:08:31,280
Come on, Mom.

144
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,220
Jin Taek's not the type
to go against his word.

145
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:35,860
That's true.

146
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:38,561
The day has come at last.

147
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:42,031
Jin Dan. Let's move out.

148
00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:44,600
Let's live on our own and be free.

149
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,500
What are you talking about?

150
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:49,301
Why would we move out?

151
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:53,911
Do you think I lived here
just to get Angel Investment Corp.?

152
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:57,181
APP Group has no heir.

153
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:59,781
The successor position
is still up for grabs.

154
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,620
Someone might hear you.
Lower your voice when you say that.

155
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,390
So, Mom. Don't dream of moving out.

156
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,791
We're just getting started.

157
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:11,760
Okay, then. We'll stay here.

158
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,831
I had no idea
you had such grand plans.

159
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,831
Jin Dan. I trust and rely on you
for everything now.

160
00:09:20,331 --> 00:09:21,470
You always trusted me.

161
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,140
I'm off to work now.

162
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,140
My handsome son.

163
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,041
CEO Gong. Have a nice day.

164
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,181
Mom.

165
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,211
Look after Auntie well.

166
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,750
I will. I get what you mean.

167
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:44,691
Thank you so much, Auntie.

168
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:47,360
You helped Jin Dan
get Angel Investment Corp.

169
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:50,431
I won't forget it.

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,600
I'll think of you as my mother.

171
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,270
If you say blue is red,

172
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:02,140
I'll pretend blue is red,

173
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,110
and serve you indefinitely.

174
00:10:05,411 --> 00:10:08,081
Wait. Why didn't I think of that?

175
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,220
She went to high school
with Ma Ri's mom.

176
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:17,691
Do you mean what you just said?

177
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,831
You'll think of me as your mother?

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,331
And believe blue is red if I say so?

179
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,770
Yes, Auntie. I meant that.

180
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,911
You changed my life and Jin Dan's.

181
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:33,311
What wouldn't I do for you?

182
00:10:34,211 --> 00:10:36,510
I'll live my life for you now.

183
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,451
Then sit down.

184
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:45,821
I have something secret to discuss.

185
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:48,250
A secret?

186
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,691
I'm listening, Auntie.

187
00:10:53,061 --> 00:10:55,161
A secret between
a mother and daughter...

188
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,061
should never be shared.
You know that, right?

189
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,500
I do.

190
00:11:00,431 --> 00:11:03,301
Anything you tell me
as a mother to a daughter...

191
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,171
will stay within these walls
and I'll take it to my grave.

192
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,140
Then...

193
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:14,380
look into Soo Yeon's past for me.

194
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,350
What was she up to
before she married Jin Taek?

195
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,020
What?

196
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,490
Ma Ri's mom?

197
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,161
You want to know Soo Yeon's past?

198
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,370
I'm home.

199
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,640
Welcome back.

200
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,681
What's in that box?

201
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,551
I got Hyun Chul some tonic.

202
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,281
I told him to rest, but he won't.

203
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,151
I'm worried the labor...

204
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:52,791
will take its toll
as he's not exactly young.

205
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:56,661
I'm pleased you got him a tonic,

206
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,360
but don't you worry about me at all?

207
00:12:00,331 --> 00:12:02,000
This work of sticking...

208
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,730
three hundred eyeballs a day
into plush toys.

209
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,571
It's not easy work.

210
00:12:06,571 --> 00:12:08,901
My eyes and shoulders hurt,

211
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:11,340
and I practically ache all over.

212
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:12,811
Honestly,

213
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:15,240
I had no idea
that sticking eyes on toys...

214
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,781
was such a tough job.

215
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:19,711
Oh, gosh.

216
00:12:20,151 --> 00:12:22,581
I felt sorry for my son Hyun Chul,

217
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,250
so I wanted to do
whatever I could to help.

218
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,750
Sticking 300 eyes a day on toys...

219
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,490
I'll get you some tonic next time.

220
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,561
The darn thing.

221
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:37,760
She always says
she'll get mine next time.

222
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:42,041
Who is it?

223
00:12:45,911 --> 00:12:47,311
Gosh, Ae Kyo.

224
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,510
What brings you by my place?

225
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:52,681
Hi.

226
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,281
Ae Kyo.

227
00:12:56,421 --> 00:12:59,291
Why would you suddenly visit me?

228
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:03,360
I was passing by
and I thought of you.

229
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,691
Am I not allowed to visit?

230
00:13:06,961 --> 00:13:08,831
Of course you are.

231
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,561
I just got curious
because you dropped by...

232
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:12,970
without even a call.

233
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:15,301
You used to be...

234
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:17,340
my best friend
when we were in school.

235
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:21,370
Then you ended up
caring more about Soo Yeon.

236
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,581
I felt hurt and left out, you know.

237
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,110
Gosh. Did you really?

238
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,520
We drifted apart
because we'd lost touch...

239
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,990
for a while,

240
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,321
but I feel dreadful
to hear you say that.

241
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,990
I didn't mean anything.

242
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,561
I know you didn't.

243
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,031
Oh, right.

244
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:46,970
I got you some cosmetics...

245
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,701
while getting some for myself.

246
00:13:48,901 --> 00:13:50,770
Try the line. It's really nice.

247
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:53,211
Gosh, Ae Kyo.

248
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:57,211
This is so expensive.
You didn't have to get me anything.

249
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,411
Can't you just take a gift
from a rich friend?

250
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:04,220
At our age,
we need to care about our skin more,

251
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,850
or we age just like that.

252
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,461
Okay, thanks. I'll use it with care.

253
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,191
My skin's about to get spoiled,
thanks to you.

254
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:19,531
I must be getting old.
I think of my friends a lot.

255
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,630
And our old memories.

256
00:14:22,671 --> 00:14:24,740
Do you remember
when you, me, and Ji Hye...

257
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:26,740
went to Wolmido together?

258
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,840
Yes, of course I remember.

259
00:14:30,781 --> 00:14:34,350
We got to see the ocean
and hang out at an amusement park.

260
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:38,451
We got drunk on rice wine
and pajeon that day,

261
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:40,451
and barely managed to get home.

262
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:42,461
Yes, we did.

263
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,220
The three of us were closest.

264
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,230
Soo Yeon was haughty
and had an assemblyman dad,

265
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:50,801
so we didn't dare hang out with her.

266
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,230
So,

267
00:14:55,201 --> 00:14:57,671
when did you and Soo Yeon get close?

268
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,411
After I gave birth to Pil Seung,

269
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,541
I happened to see her
in the neighborhood.

270
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:08,211
A member of her family
seemed to live nearby.

271
00:15:09,421 --> 00:15:11,421
She said she couldn't get pregnant,

272
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:13,990
and wouldn't stop
cooing about Pil Seung.

273
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,620
She came by often after that.

274
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,760
That's how we got close.

275
00:15:19,661 --> 00:15:21,031
What do you mean?

276
00:15:21,931 --> 00:15:23,500
Didn't you say you had no mom,

277
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,331
so Soo Yeon helped you recover
after giving birth?

278
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,270
Why would you say you met by chance
after you gave birth?

279
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,470
No, it's not that.

280
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:34,911
We're talking about years ago.

281
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,411
We met by chance...

282
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:40,850
when I was pregnant with Pil Seung.

283
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,321
Soo Yeon visited often
when I was pregnant.

284
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,951
She did a lot for me then.

285
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:51,890
And she helped me recover
after childbirth.

286
00:15:51,921 --> 00:15:53,490
Did she?

287
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:58,360
Who was Soo Yeon's
closest friend in school?

288
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:02,840
Was she close to Eun Ju back then?

289
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,970
I think that's it.

290
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,711
She was always with Eun Ju.

291
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,581
Oh, Kang Eun Ju?

292
00:16:09,811 --> 00:16:12,110
She married a Busan guy
and moved there.

293
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:13,610
That's right.

294
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:16,321
I think I remember
the two of them together.

295
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,850
Yes.

296
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,770
When Sun Young had her baby,

297
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:34,600
because her mom had died,

298
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,000
I took her to hospital,

299
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,801
and I looked after her after birth.

300
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:40,671
After I gave birth to Pil Seung,

301
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:43,610
I happened to see her
in the neighborhood.

302
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,340
No, it's not that.

303
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,610
We're talking about years ago.

304
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,051
We met by chance...

305
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:53,590
when I was pregnant with Pil Seung.

306
00:16:54,151 --> 00:16:55,860
Why don't her stories add up?

307
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,421
How odd.

308
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,230
No, I have no time for this.

309
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,130
Kang Eun Ju.

310
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:06,270
Here it is.

311
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:10,470
Hey, Eun Ju.

312
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:12,371
It's Ae Kyo.

313
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:14,611
Yes, it's been a while.

314
00:17:15,341 --> 00:17:16,411
How are you?

315
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,351
I'm doing great. Why did you call?

316
00:17:19,351 --> 00:17:22,681
You were friends with Soo Yeon
back in high school.

317
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:25,280
Did you meet her after graduation?

318
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,790
Soo Yeon went to study abroad
after graduating from high school.

319
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:30,790
After that, we called each other
once every now and then.

320
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:32,391
By the way, why do you ask?

321
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:34,691
What? Well, that's...

322
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,201
A reporter wanted to cover
Soo Yeon's younger years,

323
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:39,401
so I wanted to help out.

324
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,101
Then, perhaps,

325
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:45,171
was there anyone who Soo Yeon was
close to when she studied abroad?

326
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,740
Who?

327
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,580
Oh, Kim Jae Kyung?
She studied abroad too, right?

328
00:17:52,611 --> 00:17:54,050
Okay, thanks.

329
00:17:54,411 --> 00:17:57,520
By the way, Eun Ju. Be sure
to call me when you come to Seoul.

330
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,990
Bye.

331
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:05,560
But what about Soo Yeon's past
do I have to look into?

332
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,290
I'm looking into...

333
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,401
Soo Yeon's close friends
from her past right now.

334
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:12,901
But what is it
that you want to know?

335
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,040
I felt at a loss
for what I should look into.

336
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,800
What on earth is this about?

337
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,770
Well...

338
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:24,181
Then...

339
00:18:25,111 --> 00:18:27,780
Focus on finding out
about how Soo Yeon lived...

340
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,080
while she was studying abroad.

341
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:32,080
While she was studying abroad?

342
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:36,891
I actually got the phone number of
a friend she studied abroad with.

343
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,830
But Auntie, please just tell me
what this is about.

344
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,131
Even if I meet her friend
from when she was studying abroad,

345
00:18:43,131 --> 00:18:45,500
I have to know what to ask her
to get the right information.

346
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,601
Are you perhaps...

347
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,770
curious about whether Soo Yeon
had a boyfriend there?

348
00:18:52,371 --> 00:18:55,270
What... But how did you know that?

349
00:18:55,371 --> 00:18:56,941
Oh, my. So I was right.

350
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,211
Usually, when people wonder
about someone's past,

351
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:00,411
that's what it's about.

352
00:19:03,381 --> 00:19:04,720
I have to find...

353
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:08,250
the man Soo Yeon dated
while she was studying abroad.

354
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,560
My family's fate depends on this.

355
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:15,760
So, find out discreetly
without anyone knowing.

356
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,300
You get what I mean, right?

357
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,970
Oh, my. So,

358
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,030
you mean there really was
a man Soo Yeon dated back then?

359
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:42,861
Assistant Director Ko.
Which of these two should we go with?

360
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,230
Let's go with this one.

361
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,760
- We'll use these earphones.
- Okay.

362
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,841
Hello.

363
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,611
Park Do Ra?

364
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,951
Why did she dress up so much today?

365
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:10,921
Who is she trying to look good for?

366
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:22,500
Well...

367
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,401
I know, right?

368
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:27,631
I'm sure there's something going on
between her and Cha Bong Soo.

369
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,570
Pil Seung, you know this, don't you?
I have a very good hunch.

370
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,570
What?

371
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,080
Gosh, Park Do Ra really is
an actress, indeed.

372
00:20:37,441 --> 00:20:39,181
She sure is pretty.

373
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:40,881
Her looks don't get old
even when I see her every day.

374
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,320
Don't you think so?

375
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:45,121
Oh, right. Sure.

376
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:47,621
Since she's so pretty,
it's so easy to forgive her...

377
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,320
although she has a nasty temper
and makes you so mad.

378
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,891
- Director Hong.
- What?

379
00:20:51,891 --> 00:20:53,230
Can you please check this?

380
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,861
Oh, okay.

381
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Pil Seung.

382
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,841
Ms. Park.

383
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,010
I told you not to call me
by my name while on set.

384
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,381
Fine.

385
00:21:11,911 --> 00:21:13,411
Then, my dear Pil Seung.

386
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,951
My gosh.

387
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,851
Forget it.
It's not worth the trouble.

388
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,591
Pil Seung, what are you doing
today after the shoot?

389
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:23,161
- Why?
- Let's go eat shabu-shabu after.

390
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:26,161
Why would I eat shabu-shabu
with you after work?

391
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:27,631
What is there between us?

392
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:29,461
What do you mean,
what is there between us?

393
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:31,361
We even kissed.

394
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,101
Then, doesn't that mean
we're dating as of yesterday?

395
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:38,641
Hey, Park Do Ra.
Don't you ever bring that up again.

396
00:21:38,941 --> 00:21:41,310
I'm holding myself back
from wanting to sue you.

397
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,681
Pil Seung. I'll wait in the parking lot
of the tteokbokki place later.

398
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,211
I'm going to wait until you come.

399
00:21:47,211 --> 00:21:49,121
I made myself clear. I'm not coming.

400
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,220
So, don't do anything useless.

401
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,050
I also made myself clear.

402
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,921
I'm going to wait until you come.

403
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:57,861
I'm going to wait all night long.

404
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:05,976
(Gong Jin Taek, Gong Jin Dan)

405
00:22:07,677 --> 00:22:09,446
(Gong Jin Taek, Gong Jin Dan)

406
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:13,147
There you go.

407
00:22:17,857 --> 00:22:19,486
It's all done now, Chairman Gong.

408
00:22:25,226 --> 00:22:27,766
Now, Angel Investment Corp.
is yours.

409
00:22:28,996 --> 00:22:30,127
Be sure to protect it well.

410
00:22:32,496 --> 00:22:34,637
Yes, I understand.

411
00:22:35,236 --> 00:22:36,466
Thank you, Jin Taek.

412
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:40,806
Mom, here comes that guy.

413
00:22:41,377 --> 00:22:42,607
Over here.

414
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:47,917
Mom, I didn't realize back then
because things were so hectic,

415
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:51,016
but seeing him again today,
he looks kind of cute.

416
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:52,857
Ma Ri.

417
00:22:54,657 --> 00:22:56,986
Okay, I'll behave myself.

418
00:22:56,986 --> 00:22:58,496
I won't act like that
in front of him.

419
00:22:59,897 --> 00:23:00,927
Hello.

420
00:23:01,097 --> 00:23:03,226
Yes, welcome. Have a seat.

421
00:23:03,226 --> 00:23:04,266
All right.

422
00:23:11,036 --> 00:23:13,946
I asked to see you today
because I was so grateful for last time.

423
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:16,206
I hope I didn't take up
too much time from your busy schedule.

424
00:23:16,206 --> 00:23:18,577
Did you perhaps come
during your workday?

425
00:23:18,716 --> 00:23:20,687
No, I'm a student.

426
00:23:20,887 --> 00:23:22,387
I'm studying in New York,

427
00:23:22,387 --> 00:23:24,917
but I came back to Korea for a while
during spring break.

428
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:27,486
Is that so? You're still a student.

429
00:23:27,726 --> 00:23:29,986
Oh, I was in the US too.

430
00:23:30,226 --> 00:23:32,556
Then, how old are you, Do Jun?

431
00:23:33,256 --> 00:23:35,427
I'm 24 years old.

432
00:23:36,097 --> 00:23:38,937
Oh, then you're younger than me.

433
00:23:38,937 --> 00:23:41,407
Do Jun, just call me by my name.

434
00:23:41,407 --> 00:23:43,036
I'm 26 years old.

435
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:46,236
Ma Ri, you shouldn't do that.
That's impolite.

436
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:48,276
No, it's fine.

437
00:23:48,276 --> 00:23:49,647
You can speak casually.

438
00:23:49,647 --> 00:23:52,647
Mom, Do Jun said to speak casually.

439
00:23:53,986 --> 00:23:55,446
Do Jun, then,

440
00:23:56,187 --> 00:23:57,417
give me your phone number.

441
00:23:57,417 --> 00:23:59,016
I'll call you in New York.

442
00:23:59,016 --> 00:24:00,556
Let's meet up in New York too.

443
00:24:01,327 --> 00:24:03,887
I'll buy you lots of good food.

444
00:24:04,796 --> 00:24:05,796
Okay.

445
00:24:05,857 --> 00:24:08,827
Mom, I'm so happy that I have
a cute younger friend.

446
00:24:10,526 --> 00:24:11,536
Here.

447
00:24:13,496 --> 00:24:14,837
Mom, I'm going to the restroom.

448
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:16,937
Excuse me for a while.

449
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:18,107
All right.

450
00:24:23,577 --> 00:24:24,677
Do Jun.

451
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:28,786
When Ma Ri was young,
she was in an accident.

452
00:24:30,317 --> 00:24:31,956
Her body may be an adult,

453
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,526
but her mental age is
about 12 years old.

454
00:24:35,687 --> 00:24:38,157
Oh, I see.

455
00:24:38,597 --> 00:24:41,726
Please understand
even if she behaves impolitely.

456
00:24:42,567 --> 00:24:43,726
That's fine.

457
00:24:44,437 --> 00:24:48,107
I thought your daughter was honest
and innocent.

458
00:24:48,466 --> 00:24:49,806
But now, I understand everything.

459
00:24:50,567 --> 00:24:52,276
Thank you for thinking of her
in a positive way.

460
00:24:56,506 --> 00:24:57,677
Oh, this is...

461
00:24:58,377 --> 00:25:00,147
I was just so grateful
for last time.

462
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:02,546
No, please don't do this.
I'm really fine.

463
00:25:02,986 --> 00:25:04,387
Don't feel too burdened.

464
00:25:04,387 --> 00:25:05,786
Just spend it on having a good meal
with your friends.

465
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,187
Last time,

466
00:25:09,187 --> 00:25:11,456
if it hadn't been for you,
Ma Ri would have really...

467
00:25:13,627 --> 00:25:15,266
I don't even want to
think about that.

468
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:20,337
We're so deeply indebted to you.

469
00:25:21,206 --> 00:25:22,266
Thank you.

470
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:24,407
Don't mention it.

471
00:25:24,407 --> 00:25:26,476
Anyone would've helped out
in that situation.

472
00:25:28,077 --> 00:25:29,276
Thank you so much.

473
00:25:31,147 --> 00:25:33,877
Go back when I'm letting you go.

474
00:25:34,286 --> 00:25:36,617
I just want to go straight to you.

475
00:25:43,187 --> 00:25:44,726
I also made myself clear.

476
00:25:44,726 --> 00:25:46,696
I'm going to wait until you come.

477
00:25:46,927 --> 00:25:49,667
I'm going to wait all night long.

478
00:25:53,937 --> 00:25:54,966
Why should I go?

479
00:25:54,966 --> 00:25:57,367
What does it matter to me
whether or not she waits?

480
00:26:01,077 --> 00:26:02,407
I mean, but still,

481
00:26:03,206 --> 00:26:04,877
I could eat with her.

482
00:26:04,877 --> 00:26:06,377
I have to eat dinner anyway.

483
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,246
And I am a bit hungry.

484
00:26:09,786 --> 00:26:10,857
No.

485
00:26:11,087 --> 00:26:14,387
I should never eat
with that girl, Do Ra.

486
00:26:17,157 --> 00:26:18,327
Why is it so cluttered?

487
00:26:22,397 --> 00:26:23,397
Hello?

488
00:26:23,496 --> 00:26:25,437
Pil Seung, where are you?
Are you on your way?

489
00:26:25,466 --> 00:26:28,337
I told you earlier
that I wouldn't be there.

490
00:26:28,536 --> 00:26:30,367
I won't have shabu-shabu with you.

491
00:26:30,607 --> 00:26:33,137
So don't wait for me and head home.

492
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,587
- I'm not going.
- Pil Seung, please.

493
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:49,187
Help me.

494
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:53,056
Do Ra, what's going on?

495
00:26:53,857 --> 00:26:55,667
Park Do Ra!

496
00:27:01,107 --> 00:27:02,966
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

497
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:05,236
Please leave a message
after the tone.

498
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:17,617
Do Ra!

499
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:19,917
Park Do Ra!

500
00:27:21,857 --> 00:27:22,956
Park Do Ra!

501
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:32,196
Pil Seung.

502
00:27:33,937 --> 00:27:36,667
Do Ra, are you okay?

503
00:27:36,937 --> 00:27:38,577
What happened? What was it?

504
00:27:39,177 --> 00:27:42,107
I bet you were worried
that I was in trouble.

505
00:27:42,907 --> 00:27:45,716
But that was me being delighted
over the delicious snack.

506
00:27:47,746 --> 00:27:50,956
What? You were delighted
over a delicious snack?

507
00:27:53,087 --> 00:27:56,026
Are you kidding me?

508
00:27:56,226 --> 00:27:59,157
Why? Did my acting seem too real?

509
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:02,927
Do Ra, are you kidding me?
Do you think I'm a joke?

510
00:28:02,927 --> 00:28:06,496
Pil Seung, I'm not scared
when you raise your voice anymore.

511
00:28:06,996 --> 00:28:10,437
Actually, you look adorable
when you get angry.

512
00:28:10,536 --> 00:28:12,506
What?

513
00:28:12,506 --> 00:28:14,347
Why didn't you come to see me...

514
00:28:14,347 --> 00:28:16,046
when I told you to come?

515
00:28:16,407 --> 00:28:18,677
You should've come
without hesitating.

516
00:28:19,516 --> 00:28:21,917
Pil Seung, I'm hungry,
so let's hurry.

517
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,617
We have a lot to do
besides eating shabu-shabu.

518
00:28:23,847 --> 00:28:25,716
I said I wouldn't have
shabu-shabu with you.

519
00:28:25,716 --> 00:28:26,716
But...

520
00:28:28,127 --> 00:28:30,927
Can't you let me have my way today?

521
00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:33,657
Come on.

522
00:28:34,327 --> 00:28:36,327
Just think you're doing a favor...

523
00:28:36,327 --> 00:28:38,766
for the little girl
who used to live at your house.

524
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:42,506
Come on.

525
00:28:43,206 --> 00:28:44,877
Fine, but...

526
00:28:45,276 --> 00:28:46,706
Don't talk nonsense about...

527
00:28:46,706 --> 00:28:48,147
this being
our first date or anything.

528
00:28:48,847 --> 00:28:49,946
Fine.

529
00:28:50,046 --> 00:28:52,377
Off we go. Let's go!

530
00:28:52,546 --> 00:28:54,286
Hey, stop that.

531
00:28:54,286 --> 00:28:56,317
What if someone recognizes you?

532
00:28:56,716 --> 00:28:58,556
Pil Seung, look at how I'm dressed.

533
00:28:58,657 --> 00:29:01,556
I'm wearing a hoodie,
a mask, and a tracksuit.

534
00:29:01,556 --> 00:29:03,087
No one will think I'm Park Do Ra.

535
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:05,796
No one will recognize me.
Don't you worry.

536
00:29:06,256 --> 00:29:07,427
Where are we going?

537
00:29:07,966 --> 00:29:10,226
Pil Seung,
don't ask any questions...

538
00:29:10,597 --> 00:29:13,137
and just follow my lead.

539
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:17,167
What the...

540
00:29:24,046 --> 00:29:26,347
Pil Seung, that isn't necessary.

541
00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:29,087
See? No one knows it's me.

542
00:29:30,016 --> 00:29:33,286
Besides, people these days
aren't interested in others.

543
00:29:33,486 --> 00:29:35,087
They're all busy on their phones.

544
00:29:35,087 --> 00:29:36,756
Keep it down. Stop talking.

545
00:29:36,756 --> 00:29:37,956
You'll get caught at that rate.

546
00:29:40,827 --> 00:29:41,897
Quiet.

547
00:30:19,696 --> 00:30:21,337
Aren't you too old for this?

548
00:30:21,637 --> 00:30:23,607
Come on. This brings back
childhood memories.

549
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:25,577
Wait.

550
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:26,637
What the...

551
00:30:35,187 --> 00:30:36,716
- I'm Park Do Ra!
- Hey!

552
00:30:56,506 --> 00:30:59,506
Pil Seung, seeing them
brings back old memories.

553
00:31:00,476 --> 00:31:01,546
As in what?

554
00:31:01,976 --> 00:31:03,006
Come on.

555
00:31:03,006 --> 00:31:05,476
I wanted to look nice
for you as a girl,

556
00:31:05,476 --> 00:31:07,117
so I put on makeup...

557
00:31:07,246 --> 00:31:10,046
and placed socks in my bra,
and we met at an amusement park.

558
00:31:10,046 --> 00:31:11,046
Don't you remember that?

559
00:31:11,216 --> 00:31:12,817
How could I forget that?

560
00:31:12,986 --> 00:31:14,986
You were impossible back then.

561
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:18,327
How are you still that same
12-year-old girl?

562
00:31:18,327 --> 00:31:20,756
Look how you dragged me
all the way here.

563
00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:23,526
But we had fun today, didn't we?

564
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:28,067
Pil Seung, coming here with you...

565
00:31:28,607 --> 00:31:30,437
took me back in time.

566
00:31:30,437 --> 00:31:31,607
I'm having so much fun.

567
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,536
Isn't that Park Do Ra?

568
00:31:33,536 --> 00:31:34,907
Aren't you Park Do Ra?

569
00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:36,706
No, I'm not.

570
00:31:46,956 --> 00:31:48,286
- I'm Park Do Ra!
- Hey!

571
00:31:50,526 --> 00:31:52,256
Are you kidding me?

572
00:32:16,246 --> 00:32:18,986
Pil Seung, thanks to you,
I had so much fun today.

573
00:32:19,486 --> 00:32:21,927
It's always a joy to be with you.

574
00:32:22,157 --> 00:32:24,256
I want it to be tomorrow
so that we can hang out again.

575
00:32:26,726 --> 00:32:29,496
I had fun today as well.
It brought back old memories.

576
00:32:30,597 --> 00:32:31,736
See you tomorrow.

577
00:32:31,736 --> 00:32:33,011
(See you tomorrow.)

578
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:39,177
(Ms. Park Do Ra)

579
00:32:41,036 --> 00:32:42,046
Pil Seung.

580
00:32:43,577 --> 00:32:45,016
What do you think you're doing?

581
00:32:46,446 --> 00:32:48,147
You've lost your mind.

582
00:32:49,486 --> 00:32:52,117
Why did you go
to an amusement park with her?

583
00:32:56,026 --> 00:32:57,827
I let her take control today.

584
00:33:00,296 --> 00:33:02,266
But this is the last time
I'll let myself waver.

585
00:33:10,107 --> 00:33:11,167
Thank you.

586
00:33:25,857 --> 00:33:27,786
Mr. Gong, what brings you by?

587
00:33:28,556 --> 00:33:30,627
Ms. Park, we should talk.

588
00:33:31,456 --> 00:33:33,657
I have nothing to say to you.

589
00:33:34,157 --> 00:33:37,097
I was rash the last time we met
which led me to make a mistake.

590
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:41,266
I wanted to apologize
and say something important to you.

591
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:43,367
Why don't we get in my car?

592
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:45,937
Let's go to a coffee shop nearby.

593
00:33:46,206 --> 00:33:47,236
No.

594
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,776
You can talk here.

595
00:33:50,976 --> 00:33:52,177
Well...

596
00:33:53,577 --> 00:33:55,817
Sure. I'll talk out here.

597
00:33:57,016 --> 00:33:59,087
Ms. Park, I...

598
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:03,627
I finally became the true CEO
of Angel Investment Corp.

599
00:34:04,286 --> 00:34:07,657
I'm now the true owner
of the company.

600
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:09,996
I was given all the shares
I was promised.

601
00:34:11,796 --> 00:34:15,137
I see. Congratulations.

602
00:34:15,907 --> 00:34:16,966
Ms. Park,

603
00:34:17,866 --> 00:34:19,636
I don't lack in any way.

604
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:23,676
I am finally worthy
of someone like you,

605
00:34:24,406 --> 00:34:26,377
so please give me one last chance.

606
00:34:27,277 --> 00:34:28,346
I almost forgot.

607
00:34:33,386 --> 00:34:34,826
Mr. Gong, please don't do this.

608
00:34:37,386 --> 00:34:38,397
Ms. Park.

609
00:34:39,297 --> 00:34:42,027
I'll wait patiently for you,

610
00:34:42,627 --> 00:34:44,266
so please give me another chance.

611
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:47,937
You're interested in me...

612
00:34:47,937 --> 00:34:49,866
but you're avoiding me
because of my mom...

613
00:34:49,866 --> 00:34:51,337
according to your mother.

614
00:34:52,277 --> 00:34:53,737
If you're worried about my mom,

615
00:34:53,737 --> 00:34:55,607
I assure you
that she won't be a problem.

616
00:34:56,176 --> 00:34:57,306
Mr. Gong!

617
00:34:58,217 --> 00:35:00,817
I clearly spoke my mind
the last time we met,

618
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:02,147
so why are you being like this?

619
00:35:02,717 --> 00:35:04,346
This isn't because of your mother.

620
00:35:04,346 --> 00:35:06,857
I'm not interested
in dating you at all.

621
00:35:07,487 --> 00:35:09,156
So stop coming at me like this.

622
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:16,726
What's your reason?

623
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:19,397
Why are you rejecting me?

624
00:35:20,967 --> 00:35:22,667
In what way do I lack?

625
00:35:23,906 --> 00:35:26,607
What did I do wrong to you?

626
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:29,176
Let go of me!

627
00:35:30,306 --> 00:35:32,176
This is you treating me poorly.

628
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:34,047
Why can't you accept
that I don't want to be with you?

629
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:56,607
Park Do Ra.

630
00:35:57,806 --> 00:35:59,277
You're seeing someone.

631
00:36:00,406 --> 00:36:01,906
I'm sure of it.

632
00:36:14,056 --> 00:36:15,056
It's me.

633
00:36:16,226 --> 00:36:17,286
Look into Park Do Ra...

634
00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:20,496
and see if she began to date...

635
00:36:21,897 --> 00:36:23,127
someone new.

636
00:36:25,297 --> 00:36:26,866
Goodness. Are you just getting in?

637
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:28,766
Filming ended early today,

638
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:30,067
so where were you...

639
00:36:30,067 --> 00:36:32,806
until this late hour
after sending Jae Dong home?

640
00:36:32,937 --> 00:36:34,007
Mom,

641
00:36:34,237 --> 00:36:36,846
what have you been telling Mr. Gong?

642
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:39,246
What could've driven him
to wait outside the building?

643
00:36:39,476 --> 00:36:42,616
Goodness.
Did he come to see you again?

644
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:45,456
That's right.
At the restaurant the other day,

645
00:36:45,456 --> 00:36:46,656
he took me in his arms...

646
00:36:46,656 --> 00:36:47,857
even when I expressed
my lack of interest in him.

647
00:36:48,326 --> 00:36:50,786
Today, he held me by the arm...

648
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:53,656
and told me
not to worry about his mom.

649
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:57,667
Why is he being this way
when I'm not interested?

650
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:00,096
What did you say to him
that could encourage this?

651
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:02,737
I didn't say a thing.

652
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:05,277
I hate that man,

653
00:37:05,576 --> 00:37:08,746
so don't even talk to him again.

654
00:37:08,746 --> 00:37:09,777
Got it?

655
00:37:10,306 --> 00:37:11,346
- Sure.
- Darn it.

656
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:16,417
That brat.

657
00:37:17,147 --> 00:37:20,156
Couldn't she have
accepted his advances?

658
00:37:20,217 --> 00:37:21,826
This is bad.

659
00:37:22,027 --> 00:37:25,226
What if he tells me
to pay back the 500,000 dollars?

660
00:37:25,297 --> 00:37:27,656
What do I do?

661
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:33,036
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

662
00:37:33,036 --> 00:37:34,237
Oh, no.

663
00:37:37,536 --> 00:37:40,136
What do I do? My gosh.

664
00:37:40,706 --> 00:37:41,947
What if he tells me
to pay back the money?

665
00:37:41,947 --> 00:37:43,447
What do I do?

666
00:37:52,614 --> 00:37:53,692
Pil Seung.

667
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,699
Why did you ask me to see you
when we'll see each other on set?

668
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,029
What is it?

669
00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:05,270
Couldn't you wait until then?

670
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,070
Do Ra.

671
00:38:08,699 --> 00:38:10,610
I asked you here
because I had something to say.

672
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,880
What could it be about
that has you sounding serious?

673
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,110
Do Ra, it's true.

674
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:22,050
You're right about
my feelings for you.

675
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,219
Right?

676
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,889
You have feelings for me too, right?

677
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,659
Thanks, Pil Seung.

678
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:31,290
Thanks for finally
being honest with me.

679
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,929
Can I like you
as much as I want, then?

680
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:36,929
Hold on.

681
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,869
Are we a couple from here on out?

682
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:42,570
Can I see you whenever I want...

683
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,409
and spend birthdays
and Christmases together?

684
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,040
Just thinking about it
makes me smile.

685
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,949
I'm sorry, Do Ra.

686
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:56,250
But...

687
00:38:56,989 --> 00:38:58,750
that's not something I want.

688
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,259
I can't do it.

689
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,889
What do you mean by that?

690
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:08,159
Didn't you just say
you had feelings for me?

691
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:12,500
You're an actress
with a successful career,

692
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,500
and I'm an assistant director...

693
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,840
who is beginning
to build his career.

694
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,509
We're not a good match.

695
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,840
But...

696
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,440
I don't care about that at all.

697
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,250
I'm fine with it.

698
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:26,520
How can it be a problem
when we like each other?

699
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:28,550
I'm not okay with it.

700
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,119
What if people find out about us?

701
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:33,790
What do you think will happen?

702
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:37,559
Reporters will be stationed
outside my house...

703
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:39,259
and everyone
will dig into my life...

704
00:39:39,259 --> 00:39:41,500
as well as the lives
of my family members.

705
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,699
I don't want to go through that.

706
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,570
What?

707
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:48,639
I told you before...

708
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,540
that I wanted a successful career
as a director.

709
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:53,579
I wish to film a series
that moves people.

710
00:39:55,179 --> 00:39:57,409
So the last thing I want
is to be gossiped about...

711
00:39:57,409 --> 00:39:58,880
for something
that isn't my success as a director.

712
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:02,679
Do Ra.

713
00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:06,420
Before our feelings grow...

714
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,960
and it becomes harder on us,

715
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,429
let's put a stop to it.

716
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:14,630
I'm not someone
who can handle your fame.

717
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,529
So find someone
who is a better fit for you.

718
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,340
I'll do the same.

719
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:22,940
We'll leave it at that.

720
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,110
Pil Seung, can't we...

721
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,380
date in secret?

722
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,449
We'll try not to get caught.

723
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,849
I'll be more careful.

724
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:41,759
I'll make sure no one recognizes me.

725
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,920
Do Ra.

726
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,690
We can't be together.

727
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,759
I can't explain everything to you,

728
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,570
but we can't be together
for many reasons.

729
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,639
So please.

730
00:40:56,739 --> 00:40:57,840
Don't stir up...

731
00:40:58,809 --> 00:40:59,869
my feelings for you.

732
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,860
We...

733
00:41:18,529 --> 00:41:19,829
have different paths to take.

734
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,099
Find someone
who is a better fit for you.

735
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:26,400
I'll do the same.

736
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:29,239
Why must we break up
when we're in love?

737
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:34,840
I will love you
even if you don't love me back.

738
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:40,050
I'll head straight for you.

739
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:50,130
Cut. That's no good.

740
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:52,829
Ms. Park.

741
00:41:54,699 --> 00:41:55,829
What...

742
00:41:56,529 --> 00:41:58,000
You're not supposed
to cry in this scene.

743
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:01,800
She says she'll be heading
straight for him...

744
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,670
in a cheerful and feisty manner.

745
00:42:07,309 --> 00:42:08,779
Do Ra, come on.

746
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:12,050
Calm your emotions.

747
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:14,719
What is it?

748
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:21,619
She must be projecting
the feelings she has for me.

749
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:24,159
This is how it is with actors.

750
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:26,059
Director Hong,
why don't we take a break?

751
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:27,929
Sure. Let's do that.

752
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:31,099
The devotion the actors have...

753
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:32,630
had them digging deep
into their emotions.

754
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,199
Let's take a short break.

755
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,170
Jae Dong, over here.

756
00:42:37,009 --> 00:42:39,170
There must be something going on
with her and Cha Bong Soo.

757
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,779
Tell me about it.
Something must be going on.

758
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:48,119
A courier dropped off
the information you requested.

759
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:51,449
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

760
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:05,000
This is the punk
she's been casually seeing?

761
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:09,400
Did she reject me
for a punk like this?

762
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,340
Unbelievable.

763
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:23,820
(My very own anti-aging regimen)

764
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,009
(Lightly enjoy!)

765
00:43:45,509 --> 00:43:46,710
Darn it!

766
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,550
Why do I see Do Ra everywhere I go?

767
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:54,579
Park Do Ra.

768
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:56,719
Why are you doing this to me?

769
00:43:57,619 --> 00:43:59,550
Why do you keep showing up?

770
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,989
(Winners of
the KMS Rookie Screenwriting Contest)

771
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:08,099
(We thank everyone
who sent in their work.)

772
00:44:18,139 --> 00:44:22,340
Goodness me.

773
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,179
Myung Dong, hey.

774
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:28,449
Aren't they announcing the winners
of the screenwriting contest today?

775
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,619
Myung Dong, did you...

776
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:34,389
Myung Dong?

777
00:44:35,489 --> 00:44:38,090
Did you not make the cut again?

778
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:47,639
See? What did I tell you?

779
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:50,040
I told you to stop
writing screenplays.

780
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,040
I kept telling you...

781
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,009
to stop wasting your energy
on a pipe dream.

782
00:44:54,009 --> 00:44:57,179
How could you ignore
my advice like this?

783
00:44:57,179 --> 00:45:00,079
Unbelievable.
How could you be this blind?

784
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,480
You even dumped the man
who gave you the diamond ring.

785
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,520
My gosh.

786
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:06,690
You're killing me.

787
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:11,029
As of today,
you'll quit writing screenplays.

788
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:14,929
Throw this out immediately.

789
00:45:15,029 --> 00:45:17,300
Why are you on my case as well?

790
00:45:17,469 --> 00:45:19,730
I'm disappointed as is.

791
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:21,369
This is killing me inside!

792
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,969
Exactly.

793
00:45:25,009 --> 00:45:28,710
Stop wasting time
on what won't work out.

794
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:34,750
You should go out and meet men.

795
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:39,550
Come on. You can't leech off
your in-laws forever.

796
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:41,489
It's embarrassing.

797
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,259
I'm too embarrassed to think...

798
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:47,199
what Hyun Chul
and Sun Young think of you.

799
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:50,529
Fine. I'll move out.

800
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:51,829
I'll leave.

801
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:54,440
Why you...

802
00:45:57,739 --> 00:45:58,840
My goodness.

803
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,690
Why is it?

804
00:46:19,059 --> 00:46:21,500
Why won't they pick me?

805
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,099
Why am I not good enough?

806
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:28,800
Why isn't my work good enough?

807
00:46:31,009 --> 00:46:33,139
Everyone who read it liked it.

808
00:46:35,009 --> 00:46:38,079
I thought it was great too.

809
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:42,219
Why won't they pick my work?

810
00:46:51,889 --> 00:46:53,130
Not again.

811
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,369
Why is she crying?
I feel bad for her.

812
00:47:03,369 --> 00:47:05,639
Why should I feel bad for her?

813
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:11,750
You lot.

814
00:47:12,779 --> 00:47:15,579
I'll make you regret dropping me.

815
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:18,820
I'll make this very clear.

816
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,389
You'll regret it!

817
00:47:32,969 --> 00:47:34,340
I lost my mind.

818
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:36,300
Why am I back here?

819
00:47:41,409 --> 00:47:42,579
Oh, good.

820
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,579
Thank you.

821
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:50,179
What happened?

822
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:55,119
Did I come here
voluntarily on my own?

823
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:58,889
Gosh. I don't remember a thing.

824
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,630
What happened?

825
00:48:13,369 --> 00:48:15,110
It's me, Wednesday.

826
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,980
I don't know what it was about,

827
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:20,380
but don't drink outside on your own.

828
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:23,349
You'll end up
with another guy like me.

829
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:39,099
- Hey.
- Are you okay?

830
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,540
Hey.

831
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,540
You dirtbag.

832
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,480
You piece of trash!

833
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,420
Did he...

834
00:48:55,279 --> 00:48:57,650
bring me here again?

835
00:49:01,759 --> 00:49:03,759
That's insane.

836
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,259
What's wrong with you, Myung Dong?

837
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,369
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

838
00:49:13,699 --> 00:49:15,369
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

839
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,400
Sure.

840
00:49:23,409 --> 00:49:24,550
Have one.

841
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:26,579
It's a handmade burger.

842
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,590
I'm not giving one to just you.

843
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:33,449
I treated the whole crew.

844
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:37,360
Director Hong had one
and so did Bong Soo.

845
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:42,000
No one will gossip
because you eat this.

846
00:49:42,929 --> 00:49:45,300
So you can eat it
without worrying, okay?

847
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,869
Thanks, Ms. Park. I'll enjoy it.

848
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:54,809
Pil Seung.

849
00:49:56,239 --> 00:49:58,679
Don't be so cold and scary.

850
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:01,050
It's our last shoot.

851
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:04,020
We'll rarely get to meet after this.

852
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:09,820
Pil Seung. Will you look at me?

853
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:14,329
Ms. Park. I'm a bit busy.

854
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:16,360
Okay, then. I'll be quick.

855
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,829
Pil Seung.

856
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,000
I thought only of myself
and not of your situation.

857
00:50:22,369 --> 00:50:24,840
From now on, I won't just...

858
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:27,840
beg and whine...

859
00:50:28,179 --> 00:50:30,040
and ask you to date me.

860
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,579
Can't we just be close
and comfortable friends?

861
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,550
Can't we...

862
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:38,790
just do that?

863
00:50:40,989 --> 00:50:43,020
Sorry. I have something urgent
to take care of.

864
00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:46,829
What was that?

865
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:50,770
He doesn't even want to be friends?

866
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,849
Cut, okay! That was great!

867
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:07,579
- Good job.
- Well done.

868
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:10,719
- Good job.
- Good job.

869
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,949
- Well done.
- Good work.

870
00:51:12,949 --> 00:51:14,159
- Good for you.
- Well done.

871
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:15,719
You've been through so much.

872
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:16,989
Well done.

873
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:19,529
- Thank you.
- Good job.

874
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:25,000
Oh, gosh. Thanks.

875
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,270
Thank you.

876
00:51:26,529 --> 00:51:28,000
- Well done!
- Everyone.

877
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:32,040
We had a lot of trials
and tribulations.

878
00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:35,880
Despite all that,
I had you, a great team,

879
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,349
that did your best
until the very end.

880
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:41,820
I thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

881
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:45,050
"Straightforward Romance"
premieres tomorrow!

882
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,190
I'm confident it will be a huge hit!

883
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:55,800
Ms. Park and Mr. Cha.

884
00:51:56,829 --> 00:51:59,369
Despite the dreadful circumstances,

885
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:02,300
you two gave it your all
and I'm grateful for it.

886
00:52:02,469 --> 00:52:04,809
You did a great job.

887
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,540
Thanks, Director Hong.

888
00:52:07,009 --> 00:52:08,909
Assistant Director Ko, you too.

889
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,650
I thank the rest of the crew
for their hard work as well.

890
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:14,079
While filming this,

891
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,779
I fell in love with Do Ra.

892
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,949
Ms. Park. You did an awesome job.

893
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,489
I love you!

894
00:52:26,889 --> 00:52:27,960
Well,

895
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:32,099
I think "Straightforward Romance"
will be...

896
00:52:33,329 --> 00:52:35,570
the first project
to remain with me...

897
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:38,009
for personal reasons.

898
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:44,509
I met people I loved
as if it were fate.

899
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:49,050
The times we spent were magical.

900
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:52,690
I don't think...

901
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:55,460
I'll forget it for a long time.

902
00:52:57,259 --> 00:52:59,429
I don't want to part with you.

903
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:02,699
Goodness.

904
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:07,540
- Don't cry.
- Don't cry.

905
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:09,300
- That's an actress for you.
- Let's all show...

906
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,369
- Do Ra some support!
- It's okay.

907
00:53:29,759 --> 00:53:30,829
Pil Seung.

908
00:53:31,429 --> 00:53:33,690
Will we really
never meet again after today?

909
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:36,029
I can't believe it.

910
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,199
I don't think it's right
to end it like this.

911
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:43,340
Let's have a cup of tea.

912
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,480
Ms. Park.

913
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,590
It was good to see you again
on this project.

914
00:54:00,219 --> 00:54:01,960
I'm busy with other stuff,

915
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,730
so I won't have time to meet you.
This will have to do.

916
00:54:06,259 --> 00:54:07,730
I hope you become a great actor.

917
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:09,860
I'll root for you always.

918
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,329
Why is he acting like a stranger?

919
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,469
He really won't see me again?

920
00:54:20,469 --> 00:54:22,739
Then come see me when you're done.

921
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:25,349
I'll wait at the cafe
until you show up.

922
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,429
Miss.

923
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,869
I'm sorry. We have to close.

924
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:52,809
Okay. Sorry.

925
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,179
Sure.

926
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:27,070
I'm sure you know her.
It's actress Park Do Ra.

927
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:30,809
Hello.

928
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:33,650
Park Do Ra! Cha Bong Soo!

929
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:35,619
- It hurts.
- Move out of the way!

930
00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:36,949
- Bi Bi.
- Bi Bi, let go of it first.

931
00:55:36,949 --> 00:55:38,489
Pil Seung.

932
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:40,090
Do Ra.

933
00:55:41,659 --> 00:55:43,619
I'm feeling great now.

934
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,590
This reminds me of the old days.

935
00:55:48,099 --> 00:55:49,829
I'm so happy.

936
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:52,500
Do you really not know...

937
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,599
- why I did this?
- I don't know.

938
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,340
So you are a complete moron.

939
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:00,239
I like you.

940
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:03,279
I did it because I liked you.

941
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:08,719
- I'm Park Do Ra!
- Hey!

942
00:56:18,829 --> 00:56:21,960
I met people I loved
as if it were fate.

943
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:26,469
The times we spent were magical.

944
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:30,070
I don't think...

945
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:32,869
I'll forget it for a long time.

946
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:04,340
Right.

947
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:08,210
It's a good thing.

948
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:12,449
This is better, anyway.

949
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:24,290
Pil Seung, where are you?

950
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:34,969
(I'm at the broadcasting station.)

951
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:38,409
Why are you lying until the end?

952
00:57:46,579 --> 00:57:47,920
You came here to see me.

953
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,279
So, why are you saying
you're at the broadcasting station?

954
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,790
Why are you hiding your feelings
until the end?

955
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,520
Do Ra.

956
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,829
Do you think it's easy for me
to like you?

957
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:01,800
It's hard for me too.
It's not easy for me either.

958
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:05,429
But because I like you,
I'm mustering up my courage.

959
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,369
But how could you be like this?

960
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:13,040
You came here
because you wanted to see me too.

961
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:15,110
You're only lying until the end.

962
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:21,219
I didn't realize
you were such a coward.

963
00:58:26,449 --> 00:58:27,489
Fine.

964
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:33,059
Let's never see each other again.

965
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,159
We're done working together anyway,

966
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:38,570
and there's no reason for us
to see each other again.

967
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,900
I won't see you again.

968
00:58:43,469 --> 00:58:44,710
I'll never see you again.

969
00:58:46,409 --> 00:58:48,079
Never again will I...

970
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:52,610
like you.

971
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:03,320
You're right, Do Ra.

972
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,860
I came here
because I wanted to see you.

973
00:59:08,529 --> 00:59:10,329
I came here because I didn't want to
say bye to you.

974
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,630
But I kept lying to you
until the end.

975
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:17,270
I'm sorry.

976
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:19,869
I was wrong.

977
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:22,739
I'll never do that again.

978
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:31,449
Pil Seung.

979
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:34,349
Yes, Do Ra.

980
00:59:36,219 --> 00:59:37,290
Let's try dating.

981
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:41,199
Sure, it's no big deal.

982
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,130
Let's just like each other.

983
00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:54,779
Are you sure?

984
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:57,409
Is this for real?

985
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:01,119
You can't go back on your word
later on.

986
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:17,300
("Park Do Ra, Cha Bong Soo's
'Straightforward Romance' is a hit!")

987
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,000
("Smooth sailing for Park Do Ra,
Cha Bong Soo 'Straightforward Romance'")

988
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:21,570
Gosh, but Park Do Ra is so pretty.

989
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:22,840
She's so pretty.

990
01:00:25,009 --> 01:00:26,409
Did you watch
"Straightforward Romance" last night?

991
01:00:26,409 --> 01:00:28,179
Yes, I did. It was so much fun.

992
01:00:28,179 --> 01:00:30,980
Park Do Ra's acting was amazing.
It was incredible.

993
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,579
Her chemistry with Cha Bong Soo...

994
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:34,179
- was amazing too!
- I know!

995
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,449
Mom! Do Ra! Do Jun!

996
01:00:38,449 --> 01:00:39,949
Get out here, quickly!

997
01:00:39,949 --> 01:00:41,219
Why? What is it?

998
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:42,559
Why, Do Sik? What is it?

999
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:44,960
All right.

1000
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,489
"Straightforward Romance"
is a total hit.

1001
01:00:47,489 --> 01:00:50,559
So many people are asking
Do Ra to be in their commercials.

1002
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,599
We're being flooded with calls,
texts, emails, and even DMs!

1003
01:00:54,429 --> 01:00:56,540
Mom. I mean, Ms. Baek.

1004
01:00:56,969 --> 01:00:59,309
What shall we do about this?

1005
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:03,540
What do you mean?
We should accept them!

1006
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:05,750
- Do Ra!
- Yes?

1007
01:01:05,909 --> 01:01:08,119
- Actress Do Ra?
- What?

1008
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:11,119
My beautiful daughter.
Oh, my goodness.

1009
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:15,860
- Seriously.
- Hang on.

1010
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:19,029
- What is it?
- What?

1011
01:01:19,159 --> 01:01:22,059
Yes? Oh, right. Hello.

1012
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:25,730
Well, Do Ra's schedule is
pretty full at the moment.

1013
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:30,469
Yes, all right. We'll check on it
and get back to you. Bye.

1014
01:01:34,509 --> 01:01:35,940
Indeed, Director Hong.

1015
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,679
I knew you would become
a success for sure.

1016
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:41,650
Good job.
I'm proud of you, Hong Jin Gu!

1017
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:45,219
- It's all thanks to you, sir.
- No.

1018
01:01:45,219 --> 01:01:47,820
Thanks to your trust and support,

1019
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,159
I was able to make this happen.

1020
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:53,860
Victory, Ko Pil Seung.

1021
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,230
Why, you little punk.

1022
01:01:55,329 --> 01:01:56,960
You were practically living
at the broadcasting station.

1023
01:01:57,259 --> 01:01:59,869
You totally hit a huge home run.

your directorial debut!

Thank you! Victory!

1026

1027
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:09,679
You two have saved me
and our broadcasting station.

1028
01:02:10,139 --> 01:02:12,250
For the wrap party for
"Straightforward Romance" today,

1029
01:02:12,849 --> 01:02:14,619
it's on me!

1030
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:17,219
- Thank you, sir!
- Thank you, sir!

1031
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,949
Great work.

1032
01:02:21,219 --> 01:02:22,690
Pil Seung, where are you?

1033
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,259
I'll be going first. Victory!

1034
01:02:26,259 --> 01:02:27,590

Hey, what...

1036
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:45,880
Did you sleep well?

1037
01:02:46,909 --> 01:02:48,079
I didn't sleep well.

1038
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:49,949
Why not?

1039
01:02:51,389 --> 01:02:52,690
Because I missed you.

1040
01:02:56,719 --> 01:02:59,090
- I'll be going now.
- Yes, great work, Sun Young.

1041
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:01,090
- I'll see you again next week.
- Okay.

1042
01:03:01,699 --> 01:03:03,230
- Thank you.
- Bye.

- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

1051
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:29,989
My dear Do Ra should take
these tonics, recharge herself,

1052
01:03:29,989 --> 01:03:31,389
and shoot a bunch of commercials.

1053
01:03:31,389 --> 01:03:32,889
That way, I can pay off my debt.

1054
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,199
Gosh, they say
there's always a silver lining.

1055
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:37,130

is my saving grace.

Seeing how you were about to hide,

1059
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,219
I guess you do know
that you did something wrong.

I shouldn't even bother with you.

What? Who are you to say that to me?

You sent your mother-in-law
to threaten me...

1067

01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:30,380
and ripped off the principal
and interest.

1072
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:31,690
It was 50,000 dollars in total.

1073
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:33,320
I even received a memorandum for it.

1074
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:35,520
How dare you act like
you don't know anything about it?

1075
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:37,159
Did you say 50,000 dollars?

1076
01:04:37,989 --> 01:04:39,489
My mother-in-law?

1077
01:04:41,159 --> 01:04:43,929
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1078
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:18,429
I've lost
all of my affection for you.

1079
01:05:18,429 --> 01:05:20,029
I don't even want to
live with you anymore.

1080
01:05:20,029 --> 01:05:23,199
What if she goes to see a lawyer
to discuss a divorce?

1081
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:26,540
I couldn't
be more thrilled right now.

1082
01:05:26,739 --> 01:05:28,980
You're by my side,

1083
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:30,309
so what else could I want?

1084
01:05:30,309 --> 01:05:31,509
What did I just see?

1085
01:05:31,509 --> 01:05:32,949
Why did she get into...

1086
01:05:32,949 --> 01:05:34,380
the curly-haired
assistant director's clunker?

1087
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:35,849
Should I tell Ms. Baek about this?

1088
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,880
You have one month
to change Do Ra's mind...

1089
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,349
and have her come to me.

1090
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:41,190
If you don't,

1091
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:44,790
I'll make sure your daughter
is done for good as a celebrity.

1092
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:47,989
Pil Seung, I'm sorry.
I hate seeing you stressed out.

1093
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,329
It's all right.

1094
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,059
It's fine.

1095
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:54,329
