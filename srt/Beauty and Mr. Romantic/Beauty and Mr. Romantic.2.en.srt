2
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:12,106
Mom, please let go of me.

3
00:00:12,106 --> 00:00:13,506
Let go of me and then talk.

4
00:00:13,506 --> 00:00:15,875
Mom, you're ripping my ear off.

5
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:16,876
Quiet!

6
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:19,485
Maybe your ear coming off
will teach you a lesson.

7
00:00:20,946 --> 00:00:22,685
You, Park Do Ra.

8
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:25,686
It was you, wasn't it?
You ratted me out to my mom.

9
00:00:26,186 --> 00:00:27,925
How could you do this to me...

10
00:00:27,925 --> 00:00:29,695
when I even treated you to tteokbokki?

11
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:31,395
You didn't keep your word.

12
00:00:31,395 --> 00:00:34,296
- Park Do Ra!
- You have some nerve yelling at her.

13
00:00:34,296 --> 00:00:36,066
Get in here this instant.

14
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:37,695
Mom, please.

15
00:00:37,695 --> 00:00:39,866
- I can't believe you.
- Mom.

16
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:43,005
- But it hurts. Let go of me.
- My gosh.

17
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:45,206
- What on earth did I do that was wrong?
- That brat.

18
00:00:45,206 --> 00:00:47,706
What? You did nothing wrong?

19
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,175
You lied to me, haven't been studying,

20
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,346
and have been fooling around...

21
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:55,615
with that older girl from the salon.
Yet, you think you did nothing wrong?

22
00:00:55,615 --> 00:00:57,316
You're the one who's in the wrong.

23
00:00:57,316 --> 00:01:00,185
You pulled Jung Mi's hair
and bashed the salon down.

24
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:01,925
When did you become a thug?

25
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:04,026
How could you do something that menacing?

26
00:01:04,425 --> 00:01:07,126
Being in love isn't a crime. It isn't!

27
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:09,365
Did you just say "love?"

28
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:13,335
Are you preaching about love?

29
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,206
You brat.

30
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:17,535
You have another thing
coming today, darn it.

31
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,945
- Why you...
- What's going on?

32
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,706
- What's happening?
- What's the matter with you?

33
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,316
- What's going on?
- Dad, please.

34
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:23,645
- Get over here.
- Protect me, Dad.

35
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:25,445
Tell me what's going on.

36
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:27,716
Use your words, will you?

37
00:01:27,716 --> 00:01:28,915
Sun Young, wait.

38
00:01:28,915 --> 00:01:31,555
Are you telling me that Dae Chung...

39
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:34,225
has been riding a motorcycle...

40
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:36,255
with Jung Mi from Sol Hair Salon
seated behind him?

41
00:01:36,255 --> 00:01:38,566
Is it true he's been dating her?

42
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:39,865
My gosh.

43
00:01:39,865 --> 00:01:42,736
Ko Dae Chung, you.

44
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,966
Have you been sitting in a tree...

45
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:46,966
with that girl named Jung Mi?

46
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:49,376
Mom, what does she mean
by sitting in a tree?

47
00:01:50,206 --> 00:01:53,346
Mom, what's this about a motorcycle
and the girl from the salon?

48
00:01:54,645 --> 00:01:55,746
Dae Chung, you.

49
00:01:55,746 --> 00:01:57,016
Honey, please.

50
00:01:57,376 --> 00:01:59,385
That's not it.

51
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:02,016
It's just that the witch
from that salon...

52
00:02:02,016 --> 00:02:05,055
seduced our innocent Dae Chung.

53
00:02:05,956 --> 00:02:08,225
Anyway, that minx has been playing...

54
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:09,996
our innocent Dae Chung.

55
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,356
Mom, that's not it.

56
00:02:11,356 --> 00:02:14,365
Mom, Jung Mi didn't flirt with me.

57
00:02:14,365 --> 00:02:16,596
I flirted with her first.

58
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:18,066
- What?
- She didn't want to date me...

59
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:19,535
since I was younger than her,

60
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:21,165
but I begged her...

61
00:02:21,165 --> 00:02:23,306
to give me a chance.

62
00:02:23,505 --> 00:02:25,846
So please don't speak ill of her.

63
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:28,205
My Jung Mi isn't a minx!

64
00:02:28,205 --> 00:02:29,515
You brat.

65
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:31,646
Ko Dae Chung, you.

66
00:02:31,646 --> 00:02:33,316
Jung Mi's 26.

67
00:02:33,316 --> 00:02:34,785
She's eight years your senior,

68
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:36,485
but you're telling me
you flirted with her first?

69
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:38,586
You're still in high school.
Have you lost your mind?

70
00:02:38,586 --> 00:02:40,455
Age doesn't matter in the game of love.

71
00:02:40,455 --> 00:02:43,695
Who says a high school student
can't love someone older than him?

72
00:02:44,056 --> 00:02:46,725
It's not against the law, so who cares...

73
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:49,366
if she's 10, 20, or 100 years older?

74
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:51,096
You've completely lost it.

75
00:02:51,096 --> 00:02:53,066
- Hey!
- He's completely lost it.

76
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:54,665
- You brat.
- Get in here, you brat.

77
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:56,605
- You imbecile.
- Let go of me.

78
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,376
I need to go to Jung Mi.

79
00:02:58,376 --> 00:03:00,776
She must be in shock because of Mom.

80
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:03,575
- Stop yapping nonsense and get inside.
- I need to go to Jung Mi!

81
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:04,876
- Come here.
- Honey.

82
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:06,316
- Let go of me!
- What are you up to?

83
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:07,746
- Come inside.
- Yes.

84
00:03:07,746 --> 00:03:09,056
- Walk.
- You're insane.

85
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,616
Who do you take after?

86
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:12,225
You can try to shackle me,

87
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,825
but you can't get in-between
Jung Mi and I and our love!

88
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,295
- My gosh. Dae Chung.
- Shut your mouth!

89
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,466
- He's helpless.
- Come inside.

90
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:23,135
He's totally...

91
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:26,436
He's such a lowlife.

92
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:29,635
I didn't think Dae Chung was like that.

93
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:33,075
Is that the person I liked?

94
00:03:35,176 --> 00:03:36,545
Open this door!

95
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:38,146
Let me out!

96
00:03:38,646 --> 00:03:40,216
What's wrong with everyone?

97
00:03:40,885 --> 00:03:42,855
Mom! Dad!

98
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:43,885
Be quiet!

99
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:45,855
A teenager should study,

100
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:48,156
but you went around dating an older woman.

101
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:50,526
How dare you cause a scene on top of that?

102
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:51,926
My head hurts.

103
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:55,665
Sun Young, drink some ice-cold water.

104
00:03:55,896 --> 00:03:58,966
Yes. Have some water and calm down.

105
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:05,605
My heart's still racing.

106
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,746
That brazen girl...

107
00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:11,246
was doing this,
trying to kiss my Dae Chung.

108
00:04:11,515 --> 00:04:13,785
Just thinking of it makes my blood boil.

109
00:04:14,586 --> 00:04:17,885
Really? Jung Mi must be out of her mind.

110
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:18,985
She is.

111
00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:21,026
How dare she seduce a schoolboy?

112
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:23,496
That's what you call a crazy witch.

113
00:04:23,926 --> 00:04:26,095
Don't say such things about Jung Mi!

114
00:04:26,595 --> 00:04:29,095
My Jung Mi isn't a crazy witch!

115
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:32,566
How could he get that out of control?

116
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:35,376
He's still young
and he's crazy about a woman.

117
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:39,046
My gosh. I'm too embarrassed
to go out in public.

118
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,316
Where did he get the motorcycle?
Did he borrow someone else's?

119
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:44,176
No, well...

120
00:04:44,345 --> 00:04:47,385
He'd been asking for money
for workbooks and extra classes.

121
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:48,816
He saved that up...

122
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:51,316
- and bought a used motorcycle.
- What?

123
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:53,825
He'd been riding
something that dangerous...

124
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:55,755
and we had no idea.

125
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,895
What if he'd been in an accident?

126
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,366
- My heart's racing again.
- My goodness.

127
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:05,335
Sun Young. I told you it looked like
Dae Chung was pocketing the money.

128
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:07,036
My goodness.

129
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:09,106
"My dear son. My Dae Chung."

130
00:05:09,106 --> 00:05:10,905
You coddled him to no end.

131
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:13,945
And he just stabbed you in the back.

132
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:17,445
When I needed money for a tooth implant,

133
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:19,786
you acted like you hadn't heard a thing.

134
00:05:20,345 --> 00:05:22,215
Come on, Mom.

135
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,986
Will you open the door?

136
00:05:26,155 --> 00:05:28,286
I need to pee.

137
00:05:29,226 --> 00:05:32,265
You can pee
in the plastic bottle for all I care.

138
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,025
You don't deserve to pee!
Do you know that?

139
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:38,566
Goodness.

140
00:05:46,705 --> 00:05:48,645
(Pretty Girl)

141
00:05:52,046 --> 00:05:54,015
The person you have reached...

142
00:05:55,316 --> 00:05:57,585
Why won't she pick up?

143
00:06:01,255 --> 00:06:04,525
I think something bad happened to Jung Mi.

144
00:06:05,595 --> 00:06:06,626
Darn it.

145
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:18,176
Mom.

146
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,106
Dad.

147
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,916
If you open this door,

148
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,816
I promise I'll study really hard.

149
00:06:28,486 --> 00:06:30,885
I'll study hard, go to a good college,

150
00:06:31,585 --> 00:06:33,126
and I'll be good to you.

151
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:36,296
So Mom and Dad, please.

152
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:39,996
Will you please unlock the door?

153
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,695
What? You'll be good to them?

154
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,765
As if that will do any good.

155
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:48,436
You lied about needing money
and spent it on something else.

156
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,036
As if you'd be a good son.

157
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:55,775
Open the door!

158
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:57,715
Shoot.

159
00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:05,556
(New message. Will you read it? Yes)

160
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:07,655
Dae Chung.

161
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:10,895
Thanks for everything.

162
00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:13,595
You made me happy.

163
00:07:14,996 --> 00:07:16,265
I won't forget it.

164
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:19,265
Goodbye.

165
00:07:22,036 --> 00:07:23,036
"Goodbye?"

166
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:26,606
What does that mean?

167
00:07:31,715 --> 00:07:33,116
The phone is turned off.

168
00:07:33,116 --> 00:07:35,455
Please leave a message after the tone.

169
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:38,655
Why won't you pick up?

170
00:07:38,986 --> 00:07:40,955
Why can't I reach you?

171
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,025
- Jung Mi.
- The phone is turned off.

172
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:46,325
- Pick up!
- Please leave a message...

173
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:48,095
- after the tone.
- Please, Jung Mi!

174
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:55,575
Jung Mi's not taking his calls.

175
00:07:55,835 --> 00:07:58,075
He's losing his mind.

176
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:00,005
The moron.

177
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:02,476
I should've taken his phone.

178
00:08:03,876 --> 00:08:07,145
I guess the girl got my message...

179
00:08:07,145 --> 00:08:08,816
if she's ignoring his calls.

180
00:08:09,585 --> 00:08:13,325
I said I'd do even worse
if she saw Dae Chung again.

181
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:16,626
We can't keep him locked up forever.

182
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:17,955
He has to go to school.

183
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:20,726
School's the least of our problems.

184
00:08:21,595 --> 00:08:23,496
Ms. Park said she'd send Jung Mi...

185
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:25,505
back to her parents in the countryside.

186
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,806
He can't come out until then.

187
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:29,135
I have to see Jung Mi right now!

188
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:32,945
If you don't unlock the door,
I'll break it down!

189
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,816
Go ahead! Smash it if you can!

190
00:08:40,046 --> 00:08:41,186
- Hey.
- My gosh.

191
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:42,756
- Hey.
- Where are you going?

192
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,615
- Dae Chung.
- My gosh. Dae Chung!

193
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:45,955
- Come back here!
- Honey.

194
00:08:49,426 --> 00:08:50,455
Dae Chung.

195
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,495
Dae Chung!

196
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:56,536
Where are you headed?

197
00:08:56,896 --> 00:08:59,436
My goodness. I heard a loud bang.

198
00:08:59,566 --> 00:09:01,166
Is something wrong?

199
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:02,875
I thought a bomb exploded.

200
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:06,345
Dae Chung broke down his door to get out.

201
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,176
Gosh, I'm still trembling.

202
00:09:09,776 --> 00:09:13,316
He smashed his door
so he could see Jung Mi?

203
00:09:13,516 --> 00:09:14,745
Yes.

204
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:18,516
Old or young, men lose control
when they fall in love.

205
00:09:18,656 --> 00:09:21,056
How could he break his door?

206
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:23,156
He's a born troublemaker.

207
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,835
Did something happen while I was out?

208
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,266
What's up with Sun Young and Hyun Chul?

209
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,406
Is Dae Chung in trouble?

210
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:37,975
You see, Mr. Kim... My goodness.

211
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:39,906
That fool Dae Chung...

212
00:09:39,906 --> 00:09:42,445
Dae Chung and the hair salon girl...

213
00:09:42,475 --> 00:09:44,075
have been sitting in a tree.

214
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:51,556
Please tell me where Jung Mi went.

215
00:09:52,256 --> 00:09:53,985
She's your niece. You must know.

216
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:57,426
If I tell you where Jung Mi is,

217
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,566
you know what your mom will do.

218
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,225
You have eyes, don't you?

219
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:03,666
Use them to look around.

220
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:04,965
Look at this mess.

221
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,676
Your mom did all this.

222
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:12,845
Ladies from all over flocked to watch.

223
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:16,046
They pointed at me and Jung Mi
and cursed us out.

224
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:17,546
Darn it.

225
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:22,886
I might have to close the salon
because of you, Dae Chung.

226
00:10:23,016 --> 00:10:24,286
I might lose everything.

227
00:10:24,816 --> 00:10:27,585
So don't look for Jung Mi again,

228
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,955
and stay away.

229
00:10:29,256 --> 00:10:30,325
My head hurts.

230
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:34,195
Get out of here. Go away.

231
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,666
Get lost!

232
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,646
The hair salon girl.
Are you sure she left?

233
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,575
Yes. Ms. Park called.

234
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:53,945
She took her to the bus terminal...

235
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,056
and saw the bus leave with her inside.

236
00:10:57,316 --> 00:11:00,056
She even left her phone behind saying...

237
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:01,585
she'll never contact Dae Chung.

238
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,256
It's over, then.

239
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,195
Isn't it over
if they stop calling or meeting up?

240
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:09,766
Then...

241
00:11:09,796 --> 00:11:12,835
when Dae Chung comes home,
talk to him instead of berating him.

242
00:11:13,835 --> 00:11:15,365
Pretend nothing happened.

243
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:17,776
Okay, Dad.

244
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:23,075
Here he is.

245
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:27,316
Stand up, Mom. You're coming with me.

246
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:28,955
What are you doing?

247
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:32,256
Come with me. Apologize to Ms. Park,

248
00:11:32,386 --> 00:11:34,786
and tell her to bring Jung Mi back.
Come on!

249
00:11:34,786 --> 00:11:35,926
Ko Dae Chung.

250
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:39,026
How dare you act like this
in front of your grandparents?

251
00:11:39,896 --> 00:11:42,166
Jung Mi left because of Mom.

252
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:44,636
Because Mom turned the salon upside-down.

253
00:11:45,465 --> 00:11:47,406
Apologize for making a mess...

254
00:11:47,536 --> 00:11:49,406
and tell her to bring Jung Mi back.

255
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:52,845
I can't live without her.

256
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,375
I really, seriously love her.

257
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,146
Mom, who are you
to keep us away from one another?

258
00:11:58,146 --> 00:11:59,245
Why?

259
00:11:59,646 --> 00:12:02,256
Okay, fine. I get it.

260
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:05,115
Get back with her after you go to college.

261
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:07,426
Who cares about a high school diploma?

262
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:08,896
Is it more important than love?

263
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,756
Apologize to Ms. Park at the salon.

264
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:13,325
If Jung Mi doesn't come back,

265
00:12:13,426 --> 00:12:14,995
I'll stop going to school
and waste my life.

266
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:16,166
I'll get messed up!

267
00:12:16,995 --> 00:12:19,636
Yes, go ahead. Waste your life away.

268
00:12:19,835 --> 00:12:21,306
Do whatever you want.

269
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:23,936
What? You'll get messed up?

270
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:27,975
What's the matter with you?
Why are you so twisted?

271
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:30,975
You're merely a foundling.
How dare you forget their grace...

272
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:33,245
for raising you and cause a scene?

273
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:34,416
- Mother.
- Mom.

274
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,416
Ms. So.

275
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:37,455
- Mom.
- I'm a foundling?

276
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,756
Is that what you called me?

277
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:44,195
Am I a foundling?

278
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:46,666
No. No way.

279
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,825
What are you talking about?

280
00:12:49,796 --> 00:12:51,396
Am I not your son?

281
00:12:51,835 --> 00:12:53,865
Did you find me on the street?

282
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:57,075
No. We didn't.

283
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,306
Your grandma's tongue slipped.

284
00:12:59,306 --> 00:13:02,475
Grandma. You just called me a foundling.

285
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,345
Right. That's true.

286
00:13:06,546 --> 00:13:08,115
You should tell him the truth now.

287
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:10,016
So he will get his act together.

288
00:13:10,215 --> 00:13:12,585
Mother, why are you being like this?

289
00:13:15,256 --> 00:13:16,296
So...

290
00:13:17,595 --> 00:13:19,225
I'm not your son.

291
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:26,105
I thought it was strange
that I had curly hair.

292
00:13:28,436 --> 00:13:29,506
Right.

293
00:13:29,735 --> 00:13:30,806
Dae Chung.

294
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,605
That's not true. I gave birth to you.

295
00:13:33,776 --> 00:13:36,546
You are my son. I'm telling you.

296
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:40,186
Darn it!

297
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:41,386
- Dae Chung.
- Dae Chung.

298
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:42,955
- Dae Chung!
- Honey, what do we do?

299
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,585
- Dae Chung.
- Dae Chung.

300
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:45,756
- Dae Chung.
- Dae Chung.

301
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:48,056
- Dae Chung.
- My gosh. Dae Chung.

302
00:13:54,995 --> 00:13:56,095
- Dae Chung.
- Dae Chung.

303
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:57,796
Dae Chung.

304
00:13:58,495 --> 00:13:59,666
- Dae Chung.
- Gosh.

305
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:01,766
Dae Chung.

306
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:03,806
Dae Chung.

307
00:14:05,306 --> 00:14:06,776
Hey, Do Ra. Where are you going?

308
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:10,546
(Young Mi Snacks)

309
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:20,125
Dae Chung must be really upset.

310
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:23,595
What if something happens to him?

311
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:27,066
This is all my fault.

312
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,796
I shouldn't have told on him.

313
00:14:29,896 --> 00:14:31,365
Then none of this would've happened.

314
00:14:32,835 --> 00:14:34,136
Where did he go?

315
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,646
Ms. Yeoju, come on over and sit.

316
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:44,646
Why?

317
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:47,146
Listen, Ms. Yeoju.

318
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:49,816
You're supposed to do as I say
without asking a question.

319
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,115
Don't talk back to me.

320
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:55,026
And don't forget to call me Ms. Hong.

321
00:14:58,396 --> 00:14:59,965
I'm not used to it yet.

322
00:15:02,225 --> 00:15:04,936
What is it you want to tell me, Ms. Hong?

323
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,006
This is a seafood shop
that an acquaintance of mine is running.

324
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:11,276
I want you to buy seafood here
from now on.

325
00:15:12,575 --> 00:15:14,945
But there's a store that's been
doing business with us for years.

326
00:15:15,406 --> 00:15:17,146
Just do as I say.

327
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:19,286
I'm the lady of the house now.

328
00:15:21,316 --> 00:15:24,355
And when you plan a week's worth of meals,

329
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:25,855
make sure to report it to me first.

330
00:15:27,256 --> 00:15:28,656
Why aren't you answering me?

331
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:30,526
Yes, I will.

332
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:32,296
Ms. Yeoju, I'm going out to exercise.

333
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:33,666
Wait, Ms. Jang.

334
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,465
Why? Do you have anything to say?

335
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:41,906
I was told to buy seafood...

336
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,036
from this store from now on.

337
00:15:44,036 --> 00:15:45,636
I think you should know.

338
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:51,776
Okay. I understand.

339
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:53,215
Go and get some rest.

340
00:15:53,215 --> 00:15:54,286
Yes, ma'am.

341
00:15:57,715 --> 00:15:59,016
What is this?

342
00:15:59,485 --> 00:16:00,585
Soo Yeon.

343
00:16:01,355 --> 00:16:03,796
You must've been through a lot
taking care of the house.

344
00:16:04,325 --> 00:16:07,266
So my mom and I will take charge
from now on.

345
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,526
You can rest easy now...

346
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:10,095
and just focus on Ma Ri's education.

347
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:11,636
Oh, right.

348
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,865
And give me your bankbook...

349
00:16:14,865 --> 00:16:16,136
so I can manage the living expenses.

350
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:20,345
Thanks for your kind gesture,

351
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:21,646
but that's not necessary.

352
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:23,546
I just want you to keep things quiet...

353
00:16:23,546 --> 00:16:25,945
without worrying about stuff like this.

354
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,416
What do you think you're doing?

355
00:16:29,316 --> 00:16:31,816
How could you throw away the card
I just gave you?

356
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:35,056
Are you trying to ignore me?
I'm your mother-in-law.

357
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:37,825
You may want to deny it,
but I'm still your mother-in-law.

358
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:41,095
And what? You want me
to keep things quiet?

359
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:42,595
What's that supposed to mean?

360
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:44,296
Are you saying...

361
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:46,306
I should lay low and keep my head down?

362
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,575
Why would you say such harsh things?

363
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:53,845
I never told you to lay low
and keep your head down.

364
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:55,475
What's the difference?

365
00:16:56,245 --> 00:16:59,386
You're acting
so haughty and condescending.

366
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,945
But I gave birth to a son,
which you failed to do.

367
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:04,786
I got this family a son
that will carry on the family name.

368
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:10,426
What are you talking about?
We have our Ma Ri.

369
00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:12,196
What age are you living in?

370
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:14,395
What makes you think that
only sons will carry on the family name?

371
00:17:14,996 --> 00:17:17,435
You can't say things like that
in this world and age.

372
00:17:19,135 --> 00:17:21,935
I don't want to have
this conversation with you.

373
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:23,375
- I'm going out.
- Hey!

374
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,175
How dare you talk down to me?

375
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:26,946
I'm your mother-in-law!

376
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:29,915
Of course.

377
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,016
I was talking to you as a friend.

378
00:17:33,016 --> 00:17:35,585
You're my mother-in-law,
but you're also my friend.

379
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:40,125
Mother. I'm going out to exercise.

380
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:46,865
She's so annoying.

381
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,766
That darn brat.

382
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:56,706
Jin Taek.

383
00:17:56,706 --> 00:17:59,476
I mean, Chairman Gong. We need to talk.

384
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,575
Well...

385
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:04,446
What's the use
of moving into the main house...

386
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:06,946
when no one wants to respect me?

387
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:11,486
I did tell you and Soo Yeon
to call me Mother,

388
00:18:11,486 --> 00:18:13,685
but it's not like I wanted to hear that.

389
00:18:14,256 --> 00:18:16,395
I just wanted you
to show me some courtesy.

390
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:20,125
But Soo Yeon, that brat,
still treats me like dirt.

391
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,595
I can't live like this.

392
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:26,635
So, Jin Taek, just let me
take the angel investment company.

393
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:29,236
Once I get it,
I'll move out of this house right away.

394
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:32,976
What?

395
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:35,675
My Jin Dan will eventually
inherit the company.

396
00:18:35,675 --> 00:18:37,575
That's what Chairman Gong said.

397
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:39,615
I'll run the company...

398
00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:41,746
until Jin Dan takes it over.

399
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,956
So please transfer the company name
to me and Jin Dan.

400
00:18:46,486 --> 00:18:47,825
That's ridiculous.

401
00:18:48,355 --> 00:18:49,825
Now isn't the time. Get out.

402
00:18:49,825 --> 00:18:51,556
Why not?

403
00:18:51,556 --> 00:18:53,526
Do you think I'll ruin the company?

404
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,776
That company belongs to my Jin Dan.

405
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:05,276
Is he planning to steal it from us?

406
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,206
I can't let it happen.

407
00:19:18,556 --> 00:19:20,655
Sun Young, it's me. What are you doing?

408
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,226
I'm out for a stroll.
Do you want to join me?

409
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:25,655
Let's take a walk around the Han River.

410
00:19:26,996 --> 00:19:27,996
Sun Young?

411
00:19:28,526 --> 00:19:30,036
What's wrong?

412
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:31,865
Are you crying?

413
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:33,635
Soo Yeon.

414
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,335
Dae Chung is missing.

415
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,375
He found out the whole thing.

416
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:41,446
What?

417
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:44,246
Dae Chung found out the whole thing?

418
00:19:49,585 --> 00:19:51,115
Yes. I'm coming.

419
00:20:01,595 --> 00:20:02,665
Sun Young.

420
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:04,566
Soo Yeon.

421
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:17,046
Dae Chung.

422
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,286
Dae Chung.

423
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,796
Dae Chung.

424
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:45,506
Dae Chung, what are you doing up there?

425
00:20:45,905 --> 00:20:47,105
It's dangerous.

426
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:54,546
Dae Chung, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

427
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:56,915
So please don't kill yourself.

428
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:00,256
Where are you going?

429
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,526
Your mom is worried about you
and looking for you.

430
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:06,625
You can't be doing this to your mom.

431
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:09,325
Dae Chung.

432
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:11,796
Dae Chung.

433
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:13,736
Dae Chung.

434
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:15,536
Dae Chung!

435
00:21:15,905 --> 00:21:17,605
- Dae Chung.
- He went that way.

436
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:18,635
- Okay.
- Over there.

437
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:19,776
Dae Chung.

438
00:21:24,946 --> 00:21:27,085
Dae Chung! Ko Dae Chung!

439
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,456
My goodness. Dae Chung!

440
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:31,016
My son. Oh, no.

441
00:21:31,016 --> 00:21:32,986
Dae Chung, are you all right?

442
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,530
Gosh, you're bleeding.

443
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,729
You're bleeding. What do I do?

444
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,070
Let me take you to a doctor.

445
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:44,914
Mom.

446
00:21:46,543 --> 00:21:47,543
Yes.

447
00:21:48,743 --> 00:21:50,184
Yes, my son.

448
00:21:51,783 --> 00:21:52,914
My son.

449
00:21:52,914 --> 00:21:53,983
Mom.

450
00:21:55,384 --> 00:21:56,953
Whose son am I...

451
00:21:58,453 --> 00:21:59,654
if I'm not yours?

452
00:22:01,063 --> 00:22:02,394
Who gave birth to me?

453
00:22:03,624 --> 00:22:04,763
Dae Chung.

454
00:22:05,793 --> 00:22:07,434
You're being ridiculous.

455
00:22:08,803 --> 00:22:10,463
You're my son.

456
00:22:11,174 --> 00:22:12,604
You're your father's son.

457
00:22:14,904 --> 00:22:17,773
I gave birth to you from here.

458
00:22:18,813 --> 00:22:20,074
Right here.

459
00:22:21,783 --> 00:22:22,944
Mom...

460
00:22:28,124 --> 00:22:29,684
I can't live without you.

461
00:22:31,094 --> 00:22:32,624
I'll die without you in my life.

462
00:22:34,364 --> 00:22:36,063
Could you possibly survive without me?

463
00:22:38,963 --> 00:22:41,604
I can't live without you either.

464
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:45,674
- Mom...
- Dae Chung.

465
00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:52,114
Dae Chung.

466
00:22:52,674 --> 00:22:55,084
Mom...

467
00:23:01,184 --> 00:23:03,584
I can't live without you.

468
00:23:08,463 --> 00:23:10,023
Dae Chung.

469
00:23:18,174 --> 00:23:20,404
Dae Chung had to break up
with Jung Mi because of me...

470
00:23:21,243 --> 00:23:23,944
and that led to him finding out
that he isn't their biological son.

471
00:23:25,114 --> 00:23:26,243
It's all because of me.

472
00:23:28,144 --> 00:23:29,313
My gosh.

473
00:23:30,644 --> 00:23:32,013
Was Dae Chung a foundling?

474
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:35,483
No wonder he was the only one
with curly hair.

475
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:39,394
Still, I'm impressed
with the landlord and his wife.

476
00:23:39,723 --> 00:23:42,694
I had no idea Dae Chung
wasn't their biological son.

477
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:45,334
How can they raise a foundling
as if he were their own?

478
00:23:45,563 --> 00:23:49,703
If you think about it,
the entire family seems nice.

479
00:23:52,074 --> 00:23:55,003
Mom, tell me.
I'm your biological son, right?

480
00:23:56,003 --> 00:23:58,273
Did you think I gave birth to you?

481
00:23:59,414 --> 00:24:01,384
- What?
- What about me?

482
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:05,354
My Do Jun is definitely mine!

483
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,184
Are you kidding me?

484
00:24:07,483 --> 00:24:08,523
Sorry about that.

485
00:24:08,523 --> 00:24:11,523
- Seriously.
- Study hard and be good boys, okay?

486
00:24:11,523 --> 00:24:14,124
My sweet boys.

487
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:26,374
Soo Yeon.

488
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,174
Why are you still here?

489
00:24:30,104 --> 00:24:32,013
I was worried,
so I wanted to see you before I left.

490
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:37,043
Is Dae Chung doing better?

491
00:24:38,884 --> 00:24:41,884
Yes, he just fell asleep.

492
00:24:45,854 --> 00:24:48,124
What did Dae Chung say?

493
00:24:49,763 --> 00:24:51,334
I bet the news shocked him.

494
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:54,803
He just keeps on...

495
00:24:55,934 --> 00:24:57,164
crying.

496
00:24:58,574 --> 00:25:00,973
He doesn't want to,
but he can't help the tears from falling.

497
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:07,614
This hurts me too much.

498
00:25:18,953 --> 00:25:20,493
The thing is,

499
00:25:22,094 --> 00:25:23,624
eighteen years ago,

500
00:25:25,594 --> 00:25:27,963
Dae Chung was found in a blanket
on this step.

501
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:35,003
I was drawn outside
by the sound of a baby crying.

502
00:25:36,644 --> 00:25:39,043
He stopped the second I picked him up.

503
00:25:42,713 --> 00:25:44,983
You have no idea how sweet he was.

504
00:25:46,584 --> 00:25:49,253
It was as if I was given
a gift from the skies.

505
00:25:53,854 --> 00:25:55,694
Ever since then,

506
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,993
I didn't think he wasn't my son,
not even for a second.

507
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:05,533
I raised him thinking I gave birth to him.

508
00:26:10,574 --> 00:26:12,043
Even if...

509
00:26:13,644 --> 00:26:15,684
the whole world found out about it,

510
00:26:16,644 --> 00:26:19,354
I hoped that I could keep Dae Chung
in the dark.

511
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:28,164
So what now?

512
00:26:30,194 --> 00:26:32,394
Will he be all right?

513
00:26:33,594 --> 00:26:34,664
Of course.

514
00:26:38,803 --> 00:26:40,134
He'll be fine.

515
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:46,973
He'll be fine.

516
00:26:51,614 --> 00:26:52,654
He'll be all right.

517
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:36,394
What?

518
00:27:37,963 --> 00:27:39,194
Dae Chung?

519
00:27:39,664 --> 00:27:41,334
- Hey.
- Why aren't you asleep?

520
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:51,513
Mom,

521
00:27:52,444 --> 00:27:53,444
Dad.

522
00:27:54,743 --> 00:27:55,783
Right.

523
00:27:56,684 --> 00:27:57,783
Go ahead.

524
00:28:03,283 --> 00:28:06,424
Who are my biological parents?

525
00:28:08,223 --> 00:28:11,834
I at least want to know who I really am.

526
00:28:13,094 --> 00:28:14,194
Dae Chung,

527
00:28:15,134 --> 00:28:17,104
how many times must I tell you this?

528
00:28:18,074 --> 00:28:20,003
You're our son.

529
00:28:21,303 --> 00:28:22,674
Your parents are right here,

530
00:28:22,674 --> 00:28:25,344
so why are you asking
that ridiculous question?

531
00:28:26,344 --> 00:28:28,813
Honey, hold on.

532
00:28:30,944 --> 00:28:31,983
Right.

533
00:28:33,884 --> 00:28:35,553
It's natural for you to want to know.

534
00:28:36,523 --> 00:28:37,684
Of course you're curious.

535
00:28:41,723 --> 00:28:42,723
Dae Chung.

536
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:49,533
If we're being honest,

537
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:52,574
we know nothing...

538
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:54,944
about your biological parents.

539
00:28:59,874 --> 00:29:01,983
One night 18 years ago,

540
00:29:03,013 --> 00:29:04,614
we heard a baby crying.

541
00:29:06,084 --> 00:29:07,684
Your mom went outside...

542
00:29:10,084 --> 00:29:13,023
to find you in a basket.

543
00:29:15,624 --> 00:29:17,424
There was only a note
with your birthday on it.

544
00:29:21,463 --> 00:29:24,104
Was that all?

545
00:29:26,203 --> 00:29:28,973
Yes, that was all.

546
00:29:31,713 --> 00:29:32,973
But Dae Chung,

547
00:29:35,213 --> 00:29:37,584
from the second we laid eyes on you,

548
00:29:38,483 --> 00:29:40,783
we raised you thinking that you were...

549
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,354
our very own.

550
00:29:42,753 --> 00:29:44,854
Never for a second
did we think of you as a foundling...

551
00:29:45,594 --> 00:29:48,094
or someone else's son.

552
00:29:52,263 --> 00:29:54,533
We gave birth to you that day.

553
00:29:55,434 --> 00:29:57,563
No matter what people say, you're our son.

554
00:29:58,773 --> 00:30:00,174
You're my son...

555
00:30:00,803 --> 00:30:02,344
and your mother's boy.

556
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,444
That will never change.

557
00:30:22,523 --> 00:30:23,694
Mom, Dad.

558
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:28,563
Thank you for raising me...

559
00:30:29,664 --> 00:30:30,803
for all these years.

560
00:30:44,783 --> 00:30:45,914
Dae Chung.

561
00:30:55,463 --> 00:30:57,624
- Dae Chung.
- Dae Chung...

562
00:31:02,063 --> 00:31:03,104
Dae Chung.

563
00:31:27,354 --> 00:31:28,364
Sun Young.

564
00:31:31,293 --> 00:31:32,463
I'm sorry.

565
00:31:33,463 --> 00:31:37,303
I should've watched my words.

566
00:31:39,334 --> 00:31:40,503
But Sun Young,

567
00:31:41,543 --> 00:31:44,543
wasn't it something
that he had to deal with someday?

568
00:31:45,374 --> 00:31:46,944
Nothing stays a secret forever.

569
00:31:55,824 --> 00:31:58,694
Mom, are you insane? Come on.

570
00:32:01,624 --> 00:32:03,864
Honey, it's bad.
I don't see Dae Chung anywhere.

571
00:32:03,864 --> 00:32:06,334
What? What did you just say?

572
00:32:09,503 --> 00:32:10,563
Honey!

573
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:14,233
- Where on earth did Dae Chung go?
- I don't know.

574
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:15,874
He was asleep a minute ago,

575
00:32:15,874 --> 00:32:17,404
so what's going on?

576
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:20,243
Sun Young, try calling him.

577
00:32:20,243 --> 00:32:21,983
- Give him a call.
- Right.

578
00:32:29,854 --> 00:32:30,924
Hey, Mom.

579
00:32:31,184 --> 00:32:32,293
Dae Chung.

580
00:32:32,793 --> 00:32:35,463
Where on earth did you go?

581
00:32:35,463 --> 00:32:37,124
Where are you?

582
00:32:37,993 --> 00:32:41,293
Mom, I went out to get some fresh air.

583
00:32:41,763 --> 00:32:44,303
Don't worry about me. I'll be right home.

584
00:32:45,604 --> 00:32:47,874
All right.

585
00:32:47,874 --> 00:32:50,303
I won't worry, okay?

586
00:32:50,303 --> 00:32:52,574
Enjoy your fresh air and come home.

587
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,953
- Gosh.
- That shed years off my lifespan.

588
00:33:00,114 --> 00:33:03,553
For a second, I thought
that he had run away from home.

589
00:33:04,354 --> 00:33:05,924
Stop it.

590
00:33:09,624 --> 00:33:11,733
You said you had something to ask me.

591
00:33:13,864 --> 00:33:14,864
Yes.

592
00:33:17,033 --> 00:33:18,033
Sure.

593
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:20,273
Go ahead.

594
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:22,904
Ms. Jang.

595
00:33:24,273 --> 00:33:27,473
You're my mom's best friend.

596
00:33:28,114 --> 00:33:30,384
You two are best friends
who don't have any secrets.

597
00:33:31,953 --> 00:33:33,084
That's right.

598
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:36,223
Then,

599
00:33:36,854 --> 00:33:38,993
you must know that I'm a foundling.

600
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:41,664
I'm not my mom's biological son.

601
00:33:42,963 --> 00:33:43,963
What?

602
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:47,533
Oh, right.

603
00:33:53,203 --> 00:33:54,733
I only found out yesterday.

604
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:57,904
I see.

605
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:01,344
The news must've been startling.

606
00:34:03,684 --> 00:34:07,354
That's why...
I don't mean anything by this,

607
00:34:08,553 --> 00:34:10,424
but I at least want to know...

608
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,293
who I am and where I came from.

609
00:34:13,253 --> 00:34:16,824
My parents claim they only know
of the date I was born.

610
00:34:18,194 --> 00:34:21,364
I was wondering
if my mom told you anything...

611
00:34:21,364 --> 00:34:23,264
she couldn't possibly tell me.

612
00:34:24,904 --> 00:34:28,244
If you know anything,
please tell me whatever that is.

613
00:34:29,244 --> 00:34:31,103
I won't tell my mom.

614
00:34:40,654 --> 00:34:42,123
Dae Chung, my gosh.

615
00:34:43,753 --> 00:34:44,954
I'm sorry.

616
00:34:46,194 --> 00:34:47,793
I don't know anything about it either.

617
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:53,063
She never told me anything.

618
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:55,103
Is that true?

619
00:34:56,233 --> 00:34:57,833
Do you really not know anything?

620
00:34:58,433 --> 00:35:01,003
She said there was a note
with your birthday on it...

621
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:04,174
and nothing else.

622
00:35:04,744 --> 00:35:06,244
That's what she told me.

623
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:11,853
I see.

624
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:19,054
The one who gave birth to me...

625
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:22,194
must be a bad person.

626
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:26,233
She didn't leave
any kind of information...

627
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,663
worried I might seek her out one day.

628
00:35:29,704 --> 00:35:32,704
She didn't ever want to see me again.

629
00:35:34,003 --> 00:35:37,143
It's why she abandoned me
without leaving a trace behind.

630
00:35:44,244 --> 00:35:47,554
I won't look
for my biological parents anymore.

631
00:35:48,554 --> 00:35:51,123
Ms. Jang, I'm sorry about this.

632
00:35:51,893 --> 00:35:53,954
I came to see you out of the blue
to ask such questions.

633
00:35:55,023 --> 00:35:56,594
I apologize for that.

634
00:35:57,594 --> 00:35:59,034
I'll get going, then.

635
00:36:30,094 --> 00:36:31,094
My gosh.

636
00:36:32,663 --> 00:36:33,864
Oh, my.

637
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,204
My goodness.

638
00:36:37,603 --> 00:36:39,003
There, there.

639
00:36:40,134 --> 00:36:41,304
My gosh.

640
00:36:43,944 --> 00:36:46,014
I'm sorry.

641
00:36:46,744 --> 00:36:48,614
Your mom's sorry.

642
00:37:01,154 --> 00:37:02,224
What the...

643
00:37:03,663 --> 00:37:04,764
There.

644
00:37:05,634 --> 00:37:07,893
What on earth?

645
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:26,983
Dae Chung.

646
00:37:29,924 --> 00:37:32,654
Why are you standing out here in the cold?

647
00:37:36,793 --> 00:37:38,224
Grandpa.

648
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:42,764
It's all right.

649
00:37:43,404 --> 00:37:45,904
Come on. Let's head inside.

650
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:51,603
I think your mom
was making bulgogi, your favorite.

651
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,674
Let's hurry on inside.

652
00:37:54,614 --> 00:38:00,454
(Joongnae-gil)

653
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:21,738
I almost ran into him.

654
00:38:30,378 --> 00:38:31,617
Is he gone?

655
00:38:43,957 --> 00:38:45,198
Hey, Park Do Ra.

656
00:38:50,298 --> 00:38:52,037
You were looking for me, weren't you?

657
00:38:52,437 --> 00:38:53,537
What...

658
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,138
- No, it's...
- Until when are you going to avoid me?

659
00:38:57,707 --> 00:38:59,508
You run off
when you see me in the morning...

660
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:04,347
and stay inside
if you see me outside in the yard.

661
00:39:04,747 --> 00:39:06,178
What's up with that?

662
00:39:06,818 --> 00:39:07,917
Why are you avoiding me?

663
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,488
I wronged you in a number of ways.

664
00:39:15,988 --> 00:39:18,457
I'm too ashamed to face you right now.

665
00:39:19,928 --> 00:39:20,968
Park Do Ra.

666
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:23,937
Follow me.

667
00:39:30,307 --> 00:39:31,838
Where is he taking me?

668
00:39:34,448 --> 00:39:35,448
Is he...

669
00:39:37,077 --> 00:39:39,917
Is he going to have me
dangling from a tree from my ankles...

670
00:39:39,948 --> 00:39:41,388
and beat me silly?

671
00:39:44,957 --> 00:39:47,227
Enjoy and have your fill.

672
00:39:47,227 --> 00:39:48,457
Thank you.

673
00:39:58,338 --> 00:40:00,338
Dig in already.

674
00:40:04,908 --> 00:40:06,138
Dae Chung, I'm sorry.

675
00:40:07,247 --> 00:40:09,178
I'm sorry I caused a mess of things.

676
00:40:10,517 --> 00:40:12,917
You had to break up with Jung Mi
because of me,

677
00:40:13,687 --> 00:40:15,218
and I'm the reason you found out...

678
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:20,028
about something you didn't need to.

679
00:40:21,057 --> 00:40:23,557
I'm to blame for you being hurt.

680
00:40:24,227 --> 00:40:27,367
You've been crying,
so I'm sorry for inflicting such pain.

681
00:40:28,227 --> 00:40:29,928
Is that why you're not
having the tteokbokki?

682
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:35,167
I'm fine, so dig in.

683
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:38,138
I'm actually grateful for what you did.

684
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:40,147
Treating you to this is me saying thanks.

685
00:40:41,178 --> 00:40:42,977
You're grateful...

686
00:40:43,847 --> 00:40:44,917
for what I did?

687
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:49,588
We both know I haven't been
a good son lately.

688
00:40:50,858 --> 00:40:52,158
If it weren't for you,

689
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,327
I would've stayed that way
without having sense knocked into me.

690
00:40:55,457 --> 00:40:57,528
Thanks to you,
I found out who I really am.

691
00:40:58,158 --> 00:41:01,528
And I've been reflecting
on the choices I've made in life.

692
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:03,638
So I would be grateful.

693
00:41:04,738 --> 00:41:06,537
What's all this about?

694
00:41:06,937 --> 00:41:08,608
Was he struck by lightning?

695
00:41:09,238 --> 00:41:10,338
But,

696
00:41:11,508 --> 00:41:13,448
and I thought about it for days,

697
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:15,948
I'm my mom and dad's son.

698
00:41:16,948 --> 00:41:20,417
To be honest,
if they didn't consider me their own,

699
00:41:20,517 --> 00:41:22,488
could they have raised me with love?

700
00:41:24,617 --> 00:41:27,957
I never did as they said
and got into endless trouble,

701
00:41:28,827 --> 00:41:31,028
and broke their hearts so many times.

702
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,928
You know,

703
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:37,138
I never once thought my parents...

704
00:41:37,597 --> 00:41:39,198
weren't my real parents.

705
00:41:40,508 --> 00:41:42,537
Aren't they amazing?

706
00:41:45,278 --> 00:41:46,678
So I made up my mind.

707
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:49,807
I'll study hard and be a good son.

708
00:41:50,077 --> 00:41:51,117
Gosh.

709
00:41:52,147 --> 00:41:54,088
- Is that true?
- Yes.

710
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,388
As an actress, you can be a good daughter.

711
00:41:56,858 --> 00:41:58,858
I'll study hard and become a great person.

712
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:00,727
Let's both be filial children.

713
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:04,158
Okay. I'll do that.

714
00:42:04,327 --> 00:42:05,897
Will you eat the tteokbokki now?

715
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:07,367
Yes.

716
00:42:08,267 --> 00:42:09,597
Eat all you want.

717
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:15,838
It's really tasty.

718
00:42:16,437 --> 00:42:17,477
Eat up.

719
00:42:32,488 --> 00:42:34,928
Right. I'm not dreaming.

720
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:38,597
At last, Dae Chung is mine.

721
00:42:39,698 --> 00:42:42,298
The wall that was between us has gone.

722
00:42:43,767 --> 00:42:46,167
Even the sky is blessing us.

723
00:42:46,537 --> 00:42:49,267
It's a clear blue, the clouds are puffy,

724
00:42:49,508 --> 00:42:51,077
and there's a slight breeze.

725
00:42:52,477 --> 00:42:54,548
Our love is blooming.

726
00:43:13,128 --> 00:43:14,798
- I'll take this.
- Okay.

727
00:43:16,497 --> 00:43:17,497
Here.

728
00:43:23,338 --> 00:43:24,977
The card's not working.

729
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,878
That's impossible. Try it again.

730
00:43:34,888 --> 00:43:36,957
It's not working. It was suspended.

731
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:40,928
Why would it be suspended?

732
00:43:41,028 --> 00:43:42,928
There must be a mistake.

733
00:43:48,367 --> 00:43:50,497
I guess she didn't pay her bills.

734
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:52,997
Is anyone home?

735
00:43:54,008 --> 00:43:55,367
Hello?

736
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,778
Is anyone in?

737
00:44:05,448 --> 00:44:06,778
Is everyone out?

738
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:35,948
These people eat better than I thought.

739
00:44:37,117 --> 00:44:38,847
There's meat and croaker.

740
00:44:41,218 --> 00:44:43,858
My kids like croaker.

741
00:44:45,218 --> 00:44:46,218
Oh, well.

742
00:45:39,037 --> 00:45:40,037
Ms. Baek.

743
00:45:42,008 --> 00:45:44,147
What are you doing in here?

744
00:45:44,378 --> 00:45:45,378
What?

745
00:45:47,347 --> 00:45:49,588
What's all this in here?

746
00:45:49,588 --> 00:45:52,258
Let's see. There's fruit and...

747
00:45:52,818 --> 00:45:54,928
Croaker, meat, and rice.

748
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,758
Ms. Baek. Were you stealing from us?

749
00:45:58,997 --> 00:46:01,497
No way. It's not like that.

750
00:46:01,497 --> 00:46:04,068
I was out of rice
and I came to borrow some,

751
00:46:04,068 --> 00:46:05,367
- and no one...
- Rice?

752
00:46:05,367 --> 00:46:07,338
You don't just have rice here.

753
00:46:07,338 --> 00:46:08,937
There's meat, fruit, and fish too.

754
00:46:09,207 --> 00:46:12,908
Ms. Baek. You're a thief.

755
00:46:12,908 --> 00:46:14,378
What's wrong, Mother?

756
00:46:14,378 --> 00:46:15,508
I'm so sorry.

757
00:46:15,508 --> 00:46:18,948
I was out of rice, you see.

758
00:46:18,948 --> 00:46:20,847
- So I...
- Look, Sun Young.

759
00:46:20,948 --> 00:46:23,957
That woman... Look at this.

760
00:46:23,957 --> 00:46:26,687
Fruit, fish, meat, and rice.

761
00:46:26,687 --> 00:46:29,888
She was about to take all this
when I walked in on her.

762
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:33,897
Sun Young. We let a thief into the house.

763
00:46:34,068 --> 00:46:36,698
Hang on. Since you moved in with us,

764
00:46:36,698 --> 00:46:39,138
how much did you take from our fridge?

765
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,367
No, I...

766
00:46:40,738 --> 00:46:43,508
- Say something.
- Ms. So. It's not like that.

767
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:49,247
Ms. Baek asked me for some rice,

768
00:46:49,247 --> 00:46:51,747
so I told her
to take some rice and meat too.

769
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:55,818
Dad. Is that true?

770
00:46:55,948 --> 00:46:57,687
Did you really say that?

771
00:46:57,917 --> 00:47:00,088
This isn't worth much.

772
00:47:00,088 --> 00:47:02,528
It's just food, isn't it?

773
00:47:03,997 --> 00:47:06,528
Take it and go, Ms. Baek.
The kids must be hungry.

774
00:47:09,597 --> 00:47:11,838
No. It's fine.

775
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:13,638
I'm sorry. Bye.

776
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:42,628
My goodness.

777
00:47:42,928 --> 00:47:45,838
Why is your father like that?

778
00:47:46,097 --> 00:47:47,838
She was stealing.

779
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:50,577
How could he defend her
and make me look bad?

780
00:47:50,908 --> 00:47:53,508
He turned me into a mean, cruel woman.

781
00:47:54,077 --> 00:47:57,347
- Goodness.
- Ms. Baek denied it.

782
00:47:58,017 --> 00:47:59,577
As if she wasn't stealing!

783
00:47:59,778 --> 00:48:02,548
I can't stand this at all.

784
00:48:02,718 --> 00:48:05,517
It's darn upsetting.
I should leave or something.

785
00:48:06,858 --> 00:48:09,327
My gosh. It'll be the death of me.

786
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:12,198
What is happening?

787
00:48:18,468 --> 00:48:20,367
How could you, Mom?

788
00:48:20,937 --> 00:48:23,167
How could you do that
in someone else's home?

789
00:48:23,408 --> 00:48:25,077
That's stealing.

790
00:48:25,537 --> 00:48:28,008
I just went there to borrow some rice.

791
00:48:28,008 --> 00:48:29,678
Didn't you hear what Mr. Kim said?

792
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,517
He told me to take it.

793
00:48:32,778 --> 00:48:35,617
He stood up for you out of pity.

794
00:48:36,147 --> 00:48:37,818
Do you think I couldn't tell?

795
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:41,528
Did I say I wanted meat?

796
00:48:41,888 --> 00:48:43,528
Did I say I wanted fish?

797
00:48:44,128 --> 00:48:46,028
I'd rather starve to death!

798
00:48:46,128 --> 00:48:48,528
You're so embarrassing! I can't take it!

799
00:48:48,528 --> 00:48:50,568
I said I didn't steal!

800
00:48:51,298 --> 00:48:52,867
Why don't you believe me?

801
00:48:54,408 --> 00:48:56,638
I don't live like this because I want to!

802
00:48:59,378 --> 00:49:03,878
Do you think I live this way
because I want to?

803
00:49:13,457 --> 00:49:14,928
Why are you following me?

804
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:17,858
I'm not following you.

805
00:49:18,597 --> 00:49:20,028
I'm headed in the same direction.

806
00:49:26,867 --> 00:49:28,738
You are coming after me.

807
00:49:29,437 --> 00:49:30,577
I'm not.

808
00:49:32,238 --> 00:49:33,338
Do Ra.

809
00:49:34,147 --> 00:49:36,477
Let's race to that tree. If you win,

810
00:49:37,247 --> 00:49:39,747
I'll get you a teddy bear
from the claw machine.

811
00:49:44,718 --> 00:49:45,718
Will you really?

812
00:49:46,388 --> 00:49:47,888
Don't lie this time.

813
00:49:47,888 --> 00:49:49,088
What lie?

814
00:49:49,457 --> 00:49:50,997
I don't know what that is.

815
00:49:54,097 --> 00:49:56,327
Okay, then. Ready, go.

816
00:51:07,267 --> 00:51:09,937
Do Ra, Do Sik, and Do Jun.

817
00:51:10,678 --> 00:51:13,037
I'll make a lot of money...

818
00:51:13,608 --> 00:51:16,108
and come back to pick you guys up.

819
00:51:16,847 --> 00:51:19,847
So study hard until then.

820
00:51:19,847 --> 00:51:21,687
Take care.

821
00:51:22,548 --> 00:51:25,117
Do Sik, take good care of Do Jun.

822
00:51:25,517 --> 00:51:26,658
Do Ra,

823
00:51:27,287 --> 00:51:29,888
take good care of Do Sik and Do Jun.

824
00:51:54,218 --> 00:51:55,647
Ms. Baek.

825
00:51:57,318 --> 00:51:59,758
What are you doing here?

826
00:52:09,428 --> 00:52:10,897
Please go ahead and eat.

827
00:52:11,198 --> 00:52:13,097
You were freezing outside.

828
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:14,667
This will keep you warm.

829
00:52:21,747 --> 00:52:25,378
When my daughter, Sun Young was ten,

830
00:52:25,378 --> 00:52:27,448
her mom passed away.

831
00:52:27,448 --> 00:52:29,617
So I had to raise her by myself.

832
00:52:31,187 --> 00:52:32,787
I may not know the whole story,

833
00:52:33,488 --> 00:52:35,928
but I do understand how you're feeling.

834
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:39,298
You hold out, and you keep on living.

835
00:52:39,528 --> 00:52:41,327
Your children will grow up fast.

836
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:44,537
So... Oh, dear.

837
00:52:46,338 --> 00:52:49,508
Well... Here. Take this.

838
00:53:37,517 --> 00:53:39,117
Hello.

839
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:46,198
I wish I had a father like him.

840
00:53:46,997 --> 00:53:47,997
What?

841
00:53:48,068 --> 00:53:50,428
I'm talking
about Dae Chung's grandfather over there.

842
00:53:51,367 --> 00:53:53,537
I see. Mr. Kim is a nice person.

843
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,408
He's not just good-natured.

844
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:58,307
His daughter is married,
but he still cherishes her a lot.

845
00:53:58,307 --> 00:54:00,577
He even bought her the house.

846
00:54:01,548 --> 00:54:03,477
- He bought her a house?
- Yes.

847
00:54:03,477 --> 00:54:06,247
I see Mr. Kim is highly accomplished.

848
00:54:06,247 --> 00:54:07,448
He is.

849
00:54:07,448 --> 00:54:09,187
He retired as a school principal...

850
00:54:09,187 --> 00:54:10,747
which means he has money saved up.

851
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,718
And don't get me started on his pension.

852
00:54:13,057 --> 00:54:14,528
Who do you think benefits from all that?

853
00:54:16,428 --> 00:54:18,698
I'm so jealous of Dae Chung's mom.

854
00:54:44,258 --> 00:54:46,017
Mr. Kim, over here.

855
00:54:49,888 --> 00:54:52,528
Ms. Baek. Is something wrong?

856
00:54:52,658 --> 00:54:54,397
What brings you here?

857
00:54:56,397 --> 00:54:58,198
This is for you.

858
00:54:58,198 --> 00:54:59,798
I couldn't give you this at home.

859
00:55:00,138 --> 00:55:01,238
What's this?

860
00:55:02,608 --> 00:55:04,838
It's nothing. Please open it.

861
00:55:08,508 --> 00:55:10,917
What? It's a scarf.

862
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:14,448
You helped me a lot,

863
00:55:14,448 --> 00:55:16,388
and I owe you a big favor.

864
00:55:16,787 --> 00:55:18,917
So I'm grateful and sorry about that.

865
00:55:19,318 --> 00:55:21,588
It's no big deal.

866
00:55:21,588 --> 00:55:24,397
Ms. Baek, you don't have to do this.

867
00:55:24,497 --> 00:55:25,698
No, Mr. Kim.

868
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:28,568
I wish I could give you something nicer,

869
00:55:28,568 --> 00:55:30,267
but this is all I can afford.

870
00:55:30,267 --> 00:55:33,198
I made this scarf myself.

871
00:55:33,198 --> 00:55:34,807
This isn't anything big.

872
00:55:34,807 --> 00:55:37,367
Did you knit this yourself?

873
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:38,378
Yes.

874
00:55:39,077 --> 00:55:40,537
Please try it on, Mr. Kim.

875
00:55:40,878 --> 00:55:42,147
Let me put it on you.

876
00:55:44,048 --> 00:55:47,178
Here. Lower your head a bit.

877
00:55:58,758 --> 00:56:02,167
My gosh. It looks great on you!

878
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:05,138
When you go out and exercise,

879
00:56:05,138 --> 00:56:06,838
make sure to wear it.

880
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:10,238
If your neck gets cold,
you can catch a cold.

881
00:56:10,238 --> 00:56:13,477
You knitted it yourself.
This is such a precious gift.

882
00:56:13,477 --> 00:56:15,847
I can't take this.

883
00:56:15,847 --> 00:56:17,577
I feel really bad.

884
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,617
Then, Mr. Kim,

885
00:56:21,517 --> 00:56:23,147
would you buy me a drink?

886
00:56:23,988 --> 00:56:25,057
A drink?

887
00:56:25,718 --> 00:56:26,917
(Clear Soju)

888
00:56:33,397 --> 00:56:35,327
Wait, Ms. Baek.

889
00:56:36,068 --> 00:56:37,528
You've had enough.

890
00:56:37,528 --> 00:56:39,367
You should stop drinking now.

891
00:56:39,367 --> 00:56:41,838
No, Mr. Kim. I'm not drunk at all.

892
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:44,138
I'm fine.

893
00:56:44,408 --> 00:56:46,138
Mr. Kim, just one more drink.

894
00:56:46,408 --> 00:56:48,807
It should be just one more then.

895
00:56:48,807 --> 00:56:49,977
Okay.

896
00:56:57,858 --> 00:57:01,428
Even a beast knows
how to care for its young ones.

897
00:57:03,428 --> 00:57:06,658
So when you saw me
abandon my own children,

898
00:57:07,698 --> 00:57:11,198
you must've thought
I was worse than a brute.

899
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:13,537
Am I right, Mr. Kim?

900
00:57:13,537 --> 00:57:15,537
Please, Ms. Baek.

901
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,977
But, Mr. Kim,

902
00:57:20,338 --> 00:57:23,108
I had no other choice, you know.

903
00:57:23,247 --> 00:57:25,747
You didn't take the bus.

904
00:57:26,247 --> 00:57:28,488
You didn't leave your children behind.

905
00:57:29,048 --> 00:57:30,048
Mr. Kim.

906
00:57:31,218 --> 00:57:34,488
Are you sure I'll keep on living
if I hold out?

907
00:57:36,057 --> 00:57:38,227
I feel hopeless every day.

908
00:57:38,658 --> 00:57:40,957
I just don't want to open my eyes
in the morning...

909
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,468
- My gosh. Ms. Baek.
- Gosh.

910
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:45,298
Oh, dear.

911
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:49,937
How am I supposed to live now?

912
00:57:49,937 --> 00:57:52,238
With my young children,

913
00:57:53,138 --> 00:57:55,278
I just don't know how I should survive...

914
00:57:55,278 --> 00:57:57,917
in this harsh world, Mr. Kim.

915
00:57:57,917 --> 00:57:59,878
- I really don't know.
- Gosh.

916
00:57:59,878 --> 00:58:02,218
I don't know what to do.

917
00:58:02,218 --> 00:58:04,048
Gosh, Ms. Baek.

918
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:06,457
Mr. Kim!

919
00:58:06,457 --> 00:58:10,088
How am I supposed to live?

920
00:58:10,088 --> 00:58:11,358
Ms. Baek.

921
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:13,727
Mr. Kim.

922
00:58:18,198 --> 00:58:20,568
He should be calling me by now.

923
00:58:20,568 --> 00:58:22,267
Why isn't he calling?

924
00:58:22,937 --> 00:58:26,408
Am I wrong? Was I mistaken?

925
00:58:29,008 --> 00:58:30,378
Gosh.

926
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:39,117
Ms. Baek, let's talk for a moment.

927
00:58:39,758 --> 00:58:42,758
That's right. I knew it.

928
00:58:43,028 --> 00:58:44,358
I knew this would happen.

929
00:58:47,658 --> 00:58:48,827
Here.

930
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,798
What is this, Mr. Kim?

931
00:58:51,798 --> 00:58:53,037
Buy some food for your kids.

932
00:58:53,037 --> 00:58:54,298
They're growing children.

933
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:55,307
This isn't much.

934
00:58:55,307 --> 00:58:57,437
Wait, Mr. Kim.

935
00:58:57,437 --> 00:58:59,037
No, please don't do this.

936
00:58:59,037 --> 00:59:00,638
I can't accept this.

937
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:03,747
I'm giving this to your children.

938
00:59:03,747 --> 00:59:06,048
I have no other intentions.
Don't feel pressured.

939
00:59:06,048 --> 00:59:07,218
Buy some meat for them.

940
00:59:07,617 --> 00:59:10,117
Gosh, no. Please don't be like this.

941
00:59:11,517 --> 00:59:13,588
You can pay me back
when things get better.

942
00:59:13,588 --> 00:59:14,957
You can do that.

943
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:17,358
Here.

944
00:59:18,158 --> 00:59:19,897
Thank you, Mr. Kim.

945
00:59:19,997 --> 00:59:22,698
Mr. Kim, please let me
treat you to a meal instead.

946
00:59:22,698 --> 00:59:24,068
Please don't say no.

947
00:59:24,068 --> 00:59:25,738
If you do, I won't accept this.

948
00:59:25,738 --> 00:59:28,508
Okay. Fine. Let's do that.

949
00:59:37,347 --> 00:59:40,048
Hey. So you're a child actress.

950
00:59:41,687 --> 00:59:44,247
I'm not there yet.

951
00:59:44,917 --> 00:59:48,158
I just did a few scenes as an extra.

952
00:59:48,158 --> 00:59:50,057
Look at you.

953
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:53,158
So you were on TV a few times.

954
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,528
That makes you an actress.

955
00:59:55,698 --> 00:59:57,298
Then you must've made some money.

956
00:59:57,667 --> 01:00:01,508
I don't know anything about my pay.

957
01:00:01,508 --> 01:00:02,937
My mom takes care of it.

958
01:00:02,937 --> 01:00:04,778
What do you mean you don't know?

959
01:00:05,307 --> 01:00:06,537
So you got some money.

960
01:00:11,048 --> 01:00:14,278
so we'd like to go to karaoke
and shout out a little.

961
01:00:16,287 --> 01:00:17,687
Why don't you give us some money?

962
01:00:19,057 --> 01:00:21,117
I don't have any money.

963
01:00:22,088 --> 01:00:23,258
Look at you.

964
01:00:23,258 --> 01:00:26,028
Why do you not have money
when you make money?

965
01:00:26,727 --> 01:00:27,997
That doesn't make sense.

966
01:00:28,528 --> 01:00:30,528
You're a so-called actress.

967
01:00:31,367 --> 01:00:32,798
It's impossible that you have no money.

968
01:00:32,937 --> 01:00:35,537
I'm serious. I really don't.

969
01:00:35,537 --> 01:00:37,037
Darn it.

970
01:00:37,437 --> 01:00:40,238
I don't think you understand
what's going on because we're being nice.

971
01:00:40,238 --> 01:00:41,347
Hey!

972
01:00:42,378 --> 01:00:44,178
If I find any money with you,

973
01:00:44,178 --> 01:00:46,818
I'll punch you
10 times per 10 cents. Okay?

974
01:00:46,878 --> 01:00:47,917
Get up.

975
01:00:48,617 --> 01:00:50,088
Please stop it.

976
01:00:50,088 --> 01:00:51,787
- I really don't have any money.
- Give me.

977
01:00:51,787 --> 01:00:53,488
- Stop it, please.
- Hey!

978
01:00:59,557 --> 01:01:00,798
- What are you doing?
- Darn it.

979
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:02,298
Seriously.

980
01:01:02,497 --> 01:01:03,827
This doesn't concern a high schooler.

981
01:01:04,937 --> 01:01:07,298
Just keep walking, will you?

982
01:01:08,367 --> 01:01:10,608
Do Ra, get over here.

983
01:01:11,638 --> 01:01:12,638
Dae Chung.

984
01:01:17,477 --> 01:01:21,488
Bully her again,
and you'll have to pay for it.

985
01:01:22,948 --> 01:01:24,787
I'll let you off the hook today,

986
01:01:25,517 --> 01:01:28,057
but I won't be so nice next time.

987
01:01:31,397 --> 01:01:33,128
Are you her manager or what?

988
01:01:33,227 --> 01:01:35,097
What a bunch of losers.

989
01:01:35,198 --> 01:01:38,568
If you don't want this actress
to get beaten up,

990
01:01:39,068 --> 01:01:40,667
you pay up instead.

991
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:42,307
Do Ra, let's go.

992
01:01:42,468 --> 01:01:44,138
Why you...

993
01:01:44,138 --> 01:01:46,908
Hey! You can't just leave.

994
01:01:46,908 --> 01:01:48,678
- Pay up first.
- Don't do this.

995
01:01:48,678 --> 01:01:50,307
Hey, stop that.

996
01:01:50,878 --> 01:01:52,448
- Hey.
- Hold on.

997
01:01:52,448 --> 01:01:53,577
You brats.

998
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:55,647
Take that.

999
01:01:55,647 --> 01:01:57,218
Stop this while I ask nicely.

1000
01:01:57,218 --> 01:01:59,057
Hey, you three.

1001
01:01:59,057 --> 01:02:00,617
Get back here.

1002
01:02:02,128 --> 01:02:03,827
You'll pay for this.

1003
01:02:04,528 --> 01:02:05,557
Hey.

1004
01:02:13,497 --> 01:02:14,667
Do Ra.

1005
01:02:15,537 --> 01:02:17,767
Did they hurt you anywhere else?

1006
01:02:19,838 --> 01:02:21,207
Dae Chung, I'm fine.

1007
01:02:22,977 --> 01:02:24,448
Dae Chung, oh no.

1008
01:02:25,077 --> 01:02:26,678
They pulled out your hair...

1009
01:02:27,417 --> 01:02:28,948
and you lost a button on your shirt.

1010
01:02:29,347 --> 01:02:32,358
It's fine.
I have more than enough hair to spare.

1011
01:02:33,318 --> 01:02:36,457
Besides, I'm not one to be smacked around,

1012
01:02:37,997 --> 01:02:40,128
but a guy can't possibly hit girls.

1013
01:02:40,227 --> 01:02:41,468
I went easy on them.

1014
01:02:42,997 --> 01:02:46,638
Dae Chung, you're the coolest.

1015
01:02:47,568 --> 01:02:49,338
Gosh, that's...

1016
01:02:50,537 --> 01:02:53,508
Do Ra, if anyone bothers you like that,

1017
01:02:53,707 --> 01:02:55,847
come to me for help. Got it?

1018
01:03:02,088 --> 01:03:04,187
What? Why? What is it?

1019
01:03:04,787 --> 01:03:05,917
Why are you looking at me like that?

1020
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:12,327
- Well...
- It hurts.

1021
01:03:14,867 --> 01:03:16,097
You see...

1022
01:03:18,468 --> 01:03:19,997
I like you, Dae Chung.

1023
01:03:21,167 --> 01:03:22,167
What?

1024
01:03:23,108 --> 01:03:25,908
What did you say? I didn't catch that.

1025
01:03:26,378 --> 01:03:27,937
I like you, Dae Chung.

1026
01:03:29,247 --> 01:03:30,247
What?

1027
01:03:30,878 --> 01:03:32,247
You like me too, don't you?

1028
01:03:32,747 --> 01:03:34,417
It's why you gave my bike rides...

1029
01:03:34,517 --> 01:03:37,588
and protected me from those girls
while letting them pull your hair out.

1030
01:03:37,888 --> 01:03:38,888
Right?

1031
01:03:41,827 --> 01:03:43,057
Of course I like you.

1032
01:03:43,888 --> 01:03:45,528
You're like my baby sister.

1033
01:03:45,957 --> 01:03:47,628
No, not as your sister.

1034
01:03:48,097 --> 01:03:50,198
I like you like a girl would like a boy.

1035
01:03:50,997 --> 01:03:52,037
What?

1036
01:03:52,738 --> 01:03:54,767
Did them knocking you around...

1037
01:03:54,937 --> 01:03:56,437
do a number on your brain?

1038
01:03:57,207 --> 01:04:00,338
How dare you say you like me like that?

1039
01:04:00,738 --> 01:04:02,847
Don't get cheeky with me
when you're still just a kid.

1040
01:04:03,207 --> 01:04:04,207
Let's go.

1041
01:04:10,517 --> 01:04:11,557
What the...

1042
01:04:13,117 --> 01:04:15,888
Dae Chung, did you reject me?

1043
01:04:18,028 --> 01:04:20,128
Is he still hung up on Jung Mi?

1044
01:04:22,128 --> 01:04:25,597
That's right.
They say little strokes fell great oaks.

1045
01:04:25,867 --> 01:04:27,468
I only struck once.

1046
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:30,968
Just you wait.
I'll have you fall for me too.

1047
01:05:03,968 --> 01:05:06,077
Say goodbye to your cell phones
for the time being.

1048
01:05:07,807 --> 01:05:09,878
It is illegal to film the movie
you're watching.

1049
01:05:11,247 --> 01:05:13,477
Always be careful on the stairs.

1050
01:05:14,617 --> 01:05:16,687
For your safety...

1051
01:05:16,687 --> 01:05:18,617
Gosh, I'm sorry about that.

1052
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,117
Don't be sorry, sir.

1053
01:05:21,388 --> 01:05:24,258
I see you have warm hands.

1054
01:05:24,457 --> 01:05:26,258
Yes, mine tend to be warm.

1055
01:05:27,827 --> 01:05:28,867
Sir,

1056
01:05:29,767 --> 01:05:31,997
I only ask because you have warm hands.

1057
01:05:31,997 --> 01:05:33,738
May I hold it?

1058
01:05:34,638 --> 01:05:36,307
Yes, of course.

1059
01:05:40,408 --> 01:05:42,548
- The movie's about to start.
- Right.

1060
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,298
Sir, how was the movie?

1061
01:06:01,298 --> 01:06:03,128
- It was fun.
- Really?

1062
01:06:03,568 --> 01:06:07,068
I don't remember when I last
watched a movie at a theater.

1063
01:06:07,397 --> 01:06:09,338
I owe it all to you today.

1064
01:06:09,568 --> 01:06:10,807
Gosh, don't say that.

1065
01:06:11,037 --> 01:06:13,238
I wanted to express my gratitude,

1066
01:06:13,238 --> 01:06:14,778
but a meal didn't seem good enough.

1067
01:06:15,077 --> 01:06:18,048
I should be the one to thank you
for this entertaining evening.

1068
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:20,117
I haven't been to a movie theater...

1069
01:06:20,517 --> 01:06:22,548
ever since my husband passed away.

1070
01:06:23,988 --> 01:06:25,187
You too?

1071
01:06:25,787 --> 01:06:26,787
That's right.

1072
01:06:26,988 --> 01:06:29,158
My children needed constant caring,

1073
01:06:29,158 --> 01:06:31,287
and I was making do one day at a time.

1074
01:06:31,388 --> 01:06:35,128
So of course, I didn't have the luxury
to come see a movie.

1075
01:06:35,227 --> 01:06:36,568
I see.

1076
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:37,698
Sir,

1077
01:06:37,698 --> 01:06:40,367
we should catch a movie like this
some other time.

1078
01:06:40,437 --> 01:06:43,108
I don't know about anything else,
but the tickets will be on me.

1079
01:06:43,108 --> 01:06:46,207
Gosh, no.
Since you bought the tickets today,

1080
01:06:46,338 --> 01:06:48,908
I'll take you out next time.

1081
01:06:50,108 --> 01:06:51,878
- Goodness.
- What's wrong?

1082
01:06:53,147 --> 01:06:55,647
I wore heels which I rarely do
since we were going to the movies.

1083
01:06:55,647 --> 01:06:56,687
Are you all right?

1084
01:06:57,687 --> 01:06:58,917
I don't think I sprained it.

1085
01:06:59,388 --> 01:07:01,318
I'm sorry to ask,
but can you help me walk over there?

1086
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,088
Yes, of course.

1087
01:07:28,247 --> 01:07:29,417
Hey, Baek Mi Ja.

1088
01:07:32,988 --> 01:07:34,457
Seriously.

1089
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:36,327
How dare you run off with our money?

1090
01:07:36,557 --> 01:07:38,457
Did you really think we wouldn't find you?

1091
01:07:38,457 --> 01:07:41,557
- Well, that's...
- You thief and fraud.

1092
01:07:42,128 --> 01:07:44,798
How can you take off with my money...

1093
01:07:45,638 --> 01:07:47,097
and still be living in good shape?

1094
01:07:48,138 --> 01:07:49,138
Let's go.

1095
01:07:49,367 --> 01:07:50,638
Come on already.

1096
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:53,077
You should either pay it back...

1097
01:07:53,077 --> 01:07:55,347
with physical labor
or by spending time in prison.

1098
01:07:55,347 --> 01:07:57,948
No, I said I'd pay you back.

1099
01:07:58,247 --> 01:07:59,278
Look here.

1100
01:07:59,948 --> 01:08:01,318
How much does she owe you?

1101
01:08:01,747 --> 01:08:03,187
Why do you want to know?

1102
01:08:04,218 --> 01:08:05,488
It's 30,000 dollars.

1103
01:08:06,088 --> 01:08:07,617
Are you going to pay it back for her?

1104
01:08:13,858 --> 01:08:16,528

1106
01:08:48,968 --> 01:08:50,398
It's like I said.

1107
01:08:50,497 --> 01:08:51,898
I have feelings for you.

1108
01:08:51,938 --> 01:08:54,737
I like you so much
that I wanted to look older.

1109
01:08:54,838 --> 01:08:57,508
You only see me
as the little girl who lives next door.

1110
01:08:57,508 --> 01:08:59,707
Park Do Ra,
don't acknowledge me ever again.

1111
01:08:59,707 --> 01:09:02,107
I'll go back to being strangers too.

1112
01:09:03,678 --> 01:09:04,777
Do you like it?

1113
01:09:04,777 --> 01:09:06,277
Yes, I love it.

1114
01:09:06,277 --> 01:09:08,848
I thought you should know.

1115
01:09:08,848 --> 01:09:11,388
Dae Chung's grandpa,
the former school principal...

1116
01:09:11,388 --> 01:09:15,088
Are you saying I've been seducing
your father because of his money?

1117
01:09:15,088 --> 01:09:19,357
If it were you, would you like
to fool around with a grandpa?

1118
01:09:19,497 --> 01:09:20,527
Dad.
